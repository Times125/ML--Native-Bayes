The cyber attack launched on June 27 failed to inflict significant damage on government agencies, banks and critical infrastructure assets, private companies have been hit harder, according to Valentyn Petrov, head of the information security service at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council (NSDC). The virus attack did cause some damage to government agencies, banking institutions, industrial facilities, including critical assets, but "despite the panic mood, the miscreants failed to cause significant harm," Petrov said. The government agencies were affected less than private companies, he said. The NSDC has ruled out that the cyber attack was carried out with a view to gaining profit. "For the decoding of computers encrypted as the result of the virus, one would have to pay around $300, but according to the National Police only 28 people did. In other words, the miscreants' profit amounted to around $9,000, it is incomparable with their costs," Petrov said. The political subtext of the attack is also evidenced by the very name of the virus (Petya), as well as the fact that it was carried out on the eve of Ukraine's Constitution Day, Petrov said. Ukraine is implementing a cyber security project in partnership with NATO, he said. "Special equipment has been purchased and passed to law enforcement bodies, an appropriate cyber security sensor has been installed. Ukraine is actively working with NATO, the U.S., UK. We are being helped and our experience studied, because we are an interesting testing ground on which Russia is using modern cyber weapon, and all are interested to see how it is working, how threats can be countered," Petrov said.
