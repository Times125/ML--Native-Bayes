Three of the UK s most important galleries have announced an unprecedented collaboration in which they will stage exhibitions devoted to different aspects of work by one living artist: .In 2018, the  will show the portrait work of Dean, while the National Gallery will show still life and the Royal Academy of Arts will show landscape.Dean, a British artist who is based in Berlin and Los Angeles, is primarily known for her film work such as her commission for , which was a loving homage to the dying medium of celluloid.The three-gallery project came about organically after the NPG began discussions with Dean for what will be its first-ever exhibition devoted to the medium of film.Its director, Nicholas Cullinan, said he became aware that the RA had also approached Dean about a show for its 250th year:  We thought a more interesting model, rather than try to compete and say  you ve got to choose one , was to collaborate. After more discussions it became clear there was a side to Dean s work that was missing, which is why the  came on board.  We now have this wonderful idea of one artist, three venues, three genres,  Cullinan said. It has been very organic and such a great collaboration and I think more galleries in  and beyond should do this; you don t have to compete. Tim Marlow, the RA s director of exhibitions, agreed calling it a landmark collaboration.  Sometimes institutions are seen as being very competitive and parts of some institutions are very competitive but if, creatively, culturally and curatorially we can t get it together then there s a big problem and we should be doing more of this. Marlow said Dean was  one of the most important artists of her generation anywhere in the world  and one who deserved to be even better recognised than she is.The NPG show will will include the first UK display of  of the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham, as well as films relating to the artists Claes Oldenburg, David Hockney and Julie Mehretu.At the National Gallery Dean will present historical paintings, such as  alongside still life works either by Dean or her contemporaries including Roni Horn, Wolfgang Tillmans and Thomas Demand.Both shows will run simultaneously and while dates have yet to be announced for the RA it will overlap with the other two.The reason for the date announcement delay is that Dean will be staging her show in new gallery space at the RA being created as part of its, one on Piccadilly, the other on Burlington Gardens.Dean s landscape show will explore the subject in its broadest sense, taking in botany, cosmography, travel and weather and culminating in a new 35mm Cinemascope film called Antigone featuring the poet Anne Carson and the actor Stephen Dillane.Dean said it was a great honour to make the exhibitions for the three galleries:  It has been a huge pleasure developing the structure of these exhibitions with everyone involved and daring to gently nudge pre-existing orthodoxies about what constitutes a landscape, portrait and still life.
