PRAGUE, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic signed a memorandum of understanding with NATO on cyber security on Wednesday, said Czech National Security Office (NBU) spokesman Radek Holy. The document were signed by Czech NBU director Dusan Navratil and NATO Assistant Secretary General Sorin Ducaru. The Czech Republic is the first NATO member to have singed the memorandum. After signing the pact, Ducaru said that the memorandum is a major tool for NATO and its allies to upgrade the protection of their networks. He said that the mutual support of the Czech Republic and NATO should not be limited to the exchange of information, but also cover the schooling and training of experts in the sphere of cyber protection. Holy said that the memorandum aims to improve and enhance cooperation between the Czech Republic and NATO in fighting against cyber threats and attacks that are increasingly common, sophisticated and harmful. As computer attacks become a global problem, NATO has reacted at its 2014 summit in Wales with approving an action plan.
