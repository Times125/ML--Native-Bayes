his release may give  s ever-increasing band of admirers a sense of deja vu. It s only six years since the Austrian baritone  very successfully with the pianist Malcolm Martineau. Returning to the cycle so soon, this time for Hyperion, a label not short on , is hard to explain, especially when there are so many areas of his Lieder repertoire that Boesch has yet to record.As an outstandingly perceptive and musical artist, Boesch will be constantly refining his interpretation of a work that s a cornerstone of his repertory, but there s no sense that his new reading, with the pianist Roger Vignoles, is radically different from its predecessor.

Both versions are utterly convincing.
