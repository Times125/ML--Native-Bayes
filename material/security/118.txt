(Xinhua/Li Tao) WUZHEN, Zhejiang, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- President Xi Jinping on Wednesday called on the international community to cooperate to combat cybercrimes and Internet terrorism, adding that there should no double standards in the safeguarding of cyber security. "We cannot just have security for one or some countries, leaving the rest insecure. [No one country should] seek so-called 'absolute security' for itself at the expense of the security of others," Xi said in a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the Second World Internet Conference in the river town of Wuzhen, east China's Zhejiang. Xi said that a secure, stable and prosperous cyberspace was crucial for all countries, especially with the threats of wars, terrorism and other crimes. Cyberspace, he said, should not be turned into a battleground for nations to wrestle one another, and still less a hotbed for crimes. He said nations should cooperate to prevent and oppose the misuse of cyberspace for crimes such as terrorism, obscenity, drug trafficking, money laundering and gambling. All cybercrimes, be they commercial theft or hacker attacks, must all be handled in accordance with laws and international conventions, he said.
