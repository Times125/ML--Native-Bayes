SEOUL, March 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's spy agency will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday to go over the preparations of government agencies against potential cyber terror threats from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Yonhap news agency reported Monday. The meeting will be convened by Choi Jong-il, the National Intelligence Service (NIS)'s third deputy chief in charge of industrial intelligence and cyber security affairs. Attending the gathering will be director-general-level officials from 14 ministries, including the office for government policy coordination, the financial regulator and defense and science ministries. The meeting would be held as possibility became higher than ever for the DPRK to commit terrorist attacks in cyberspace against South Korea in protest against the international community's fresh sanctions on Pyongyang, the NIS was quoted as saying. Hours after the UN Security Council's adoption of new sanctions resolution on the DPRK's latest nuclear test and rocket launch, Pyongyang fired six short-range projectiles into eastern waters last week in a show of anger at the fresh UN resolution. Adding to Pyongyang's anger, South Korea and the United States kicked off their largest-ever joint annual war games on Monday, which the DPRK called "undisguised nuclear war drills." The DPRK threatened "pre-emptive and aggressive nuclear strikes" against South Korea and the U.S. mainland in protest against the spring drills.
