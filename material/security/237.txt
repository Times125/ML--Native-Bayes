SINGAPORE, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) -- Six new joint research projects will enhance cyber security research collaboration between the United Kingdom and Singapore, said Singapore's National Research Foundation (NRF) on Wednesday. UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and NRF announced a joint research call of 5.1 million Singapore dollars (3.6 million U.S. dollars) to fund the projects over the next three years, said NRF in the news release. The six selected projects involve universities from both countries working on research in areas including intrusions, data analytics, human factors as well as sector and applications. This joint research program implements the research and development collaboration element of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on cyber security, which was signed by the UK's Cabinet Office and Cyber Security Agency of Singapore during British Prime Minster David Cameron's visit to Singapore in July 2015. Launched in May this year, the Singapore-UK joint grant call seeks to strengthen knowledge and capabilities in cyber security and foster closer collaboration on cyber security research between the two countries. The grant call closed in July 2015 with a total of 22 proposals received. All submitted proposals were evaluated jointly by cyber security experts of both countries.
