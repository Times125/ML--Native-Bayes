A mine expansion proposal by Glencore appears to include handing responsibility for the McArthur River Mine site to the  government just 50-100 years into an expected 1,000-year rehabilitation and monitoring process. is proposing to expand its operations in Borroloola for another 20 years from 2018 and, according to its draft environmental impact statement, that expansion would require up to 300 years of rehabilitation and management, and about 900 years of monitoring.But a risk assessment table deep within the document indicates Glencore intends to have little or no involvement after the mine s life ends and the  adaptive and reactive management phases  begin in 2048.According to the table, Glencore s new plan reduced the risk that  long-term closure monitoring cannot be achieved . However, its confidence that the risk would be reduced was  outside McArthur River Mining s control , suggesting another entity   likely the NT government   may have to take over the responsibility.Glencore s current proposal for expansion would have the mine continue operating until 2037, with reprocessing bringing an end to the life of the mine by 2048.It would then enter the closure phase, including  adaptive management  until 2100 to rehabilitate the site to a permanent, self-sustaining state with no need for active management.From 2101 until 3017 the  proactive monitoring and reactive monitoring  phases would see scheduled routine monitoring and maintenance transition to a system of responding only to particular events.The EIS defines  long-term  to be 100-1000 years after closure, including the proactive and reactive monitoring phases, but the document item about the company s control also references a funding agreement with regulators for the  adaptive  phase. This phase begins much earlier, in 2048, and includes the controversial rediversion of the McArthur river to flow through a refilled pit lake.The Environmental Defenders Office NT said its experts had raised major queries about the  sense and safety  of the flow through option over backfilling the pit.The risk assessment said there was funding for only 25 years of monitoring but early monitoring and feedback would  continually update closure costs and reduce the risk of unforeseen major costs .The McArthur River Mine has seen a number of environmental incidents including the combustion and year-long smouldering of its waste rock pile   which it is also seeking to expand. Locals have also repeatedly raised concerns over contamination findings in the river and fish stock.Guardian Australia asked Glencore whether it intended to relinquish all responsibility in 2048, what the cited  funding mechanisms  were, what level of involvement the company would have in any future incident responses and if it was proposing to receive its   as yet undisclosed   rehabilitation bond back from the government.The company did not answer specific questions but a spokeswoman said it was continuing to engage with stakeholders including the NT government and the EPA on the content of the draft EIS, as it developed its supplementary report.A public comment period on the draft EIS closed in May and Glencore are now in the process of drafting a responsive supplementary EIS.A spokeswoman for the NT Department of Primary Industry and Resources declined to comment on specific elements while the process was ongoing. The NT environmental protection agency similarly declined to comment on Glencore s EIS before the draft supplement was completed.However, its chairman, Paul Vogel, said it wasn t unusual for a mining company to hand over control and responsibility for a mine site to a government once the ore body ran out or ceased to be economically viable. What needs to be agreed with government and other stakeholders, should their proposal be approved, is under what conditions or relinquishment criteria would that hand back occur and what is the process for that to happen over the ensuing years,  he said.Dr Gavin Mudd, associate professor at RMIT and chairman of the Mineral Policies Institute, suggested it was difficult to predict how Glencore s rehabilitation plans would play out, partly because they had taken a unprecedented and welcome step of modelling for 1,000 years but also because very few mines in the NT had ever properly been closed. Often what does happen in the industry   if you re looking at gold or coal in particular, the lease is just held on to and switched from  operation  to  care and maintenance  and a new operator will come along and reopen it all,  he said.Regardless, relinquishing responsibility in 2048 was  absolutely  too soon, Mudd said, although the mining industry would likely consider it reasonable.There were serious questions around what happens should there be an incident in the future and how it would be funded. The waste rock dump is up to 300 degrees celsius,  he said.  It s absolutely incredible   Anyone with a brain would realise that means huge, long-term environmental risk, and financial risk. We know the very nature of these types of problems. They can last for 1000 years. The Garawa elder Jack Green recently  but Glencore are appealing the ruling.In 2015 Glencore agreed to increase its bond   then known to be $111m   after the then Country Liberal party government .The new amount was not published but  to properly clean up the site after Glencore left. The Northern Territory government holds $1.3bn in total rehabilitation bonds for all NT mine sites, according to the Australia Institute.
