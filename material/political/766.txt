President Trump raised $13.3 million through three fundraising committees in the second quarter of 2017, according to Federal Election Commission records released over the weekend and reported by Bloomberg News. Mr. Trump had raised $12.6 million in the first quarter of the year, according to the report. The records show that the committees wound up with $22.6 million cash on hand in the second quarter, which includes $11.9 million from his official campaign account. The president spent hundreds of thousands on legal services in the second quarter -- $50,000 in late June went to the Law Offices of Alan Futerfas. Futerfas is now representing Donald Trump Jr. as he comes under scrutiny for his June 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer who offered compromising information on Hillary Clinton. That payment, the report said, came a few weeks before details of the meeting surfaced in news reports. It became clear that he hired Futerfas only last week. Overall, Mr. Trump's campaign paid $678,000 for legal services, Bloomberg reported, with Jones Day picking up the largest share of the payments. According to the report, the president raised $5 million from people who contributed $200 or less in the second quarter.
