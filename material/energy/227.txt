The federal resources minister, , has attracted a slew of criticism after attacking the Queensland government for trying to  save the planet in 2050 .On Tuesday,  announced it would aim to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. The announcement was far from radical, with identical pledges already made by the Coalition-led New South Wales government, as well as Labor-led Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.But the move attracted the ire of Queensland-based Canavan, who tweeted:  Instead of trying to save the planet in 2050 the QLD labor should just concentrate on saving jobs today! People on Twitter had a field day.Many attacked the short-sightedness of Canavan s suggestion.Some pointed out the seemingly selective focus of the government s concern for  intergenerational theft , which it spoke a lot about when attacking the budget deficit under Labor.Meanwhile, it was unclear to many on Twitter why taking action on climate change and growing employment today would be seen as mutually exclusive aims.Although Queensland s announcement was unlikely to have much impact on Adani s plans to build Australia s biggest coalmine in the state, many people pointed out that coalmining produced relatively few jobs compared with those threatened by climate change.Craig Kelly, the Liberal MP who chairs the Coalition s backbench energy committee, was also criticised  because it was pushing up energy prices.
