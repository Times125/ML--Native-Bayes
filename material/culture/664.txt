ot a patch on the , this relentlessly chirpy kids  animation is set in a colourful jungle menaced by a pyromaniacal koala bear called Igor (overlooking even the basics of natural history, since it s a fact widely known that koalas sleep for up to 22 hours a day, the lazy blighters). The only thing standing between Igor and jungle annihilation is a plucky orphaned penguin and his gang of underdogs.Loud and zappy, The Jungle Bunch trots out predictable be-kind-be-brave platitudes, but lacks anything distinctive of its own. And at the risk of sounding like a nannyish custodian of young minds, it s pretty aggressive in places   one of the good guys is a dimwitted gorilla with an almighty thump.
