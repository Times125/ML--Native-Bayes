ecord low wages growth has led the ALP and unions to believe that voters are willing for governments to take a more hands-on approach than has been the case since the Keating government introduced enterprise bargaining in the early 1990s. And, somewhat ironically, the very system of enterprise bargaining looks set to become a major political battleground.Last week, as the latest release of the  showed another record low in wages growth, the Department of Employment figures  showed much the same.In the March quarter, the average annual wage increase within the 761 agreements signed was just 2.7% – the lowest growth recorded since December 1991.The wage growth in EBAs is not directly comparable with the wage price index because the index looks back over the past year, whereas the annual growth in the EBA is an average over the length of the EBA (usually about three years) – so it is more of a forward-looking measure.EBAs are also much more likely to be negotiated by unions than are most workers’ wages. , only about 15% of all workers are members of a trade union, but about 88% of the nearly two million workers operating under an EBA are under one negotiated by a union.Those covered by union-negotiated EBAs also generally have higher wage increases than the non-union ones:So it is not surprising that EBAs have had higher annual wage growth than the overall wage price index. But it is noticeable that the gap between the two measures has recently increased.And the news looking ahead is not good either. Since September 2012, the average wage growth of EBAs agreed each quarter has been below the average for all current EBAs except for one quarter – suggesting the overall average will continue to fall, and there is little sign of improvement:But what is more striking about the latest figures is not the low wage growth (hardly unexpected) but the decline in the number of people covered by EBAs.In the past four years the number of private sector workers covered by EBAs has dropped by 25%. In December 2013 there were 1.954m private sector workers operating under EBAs – in March this year it was 1.475m:The biggest drop has occurred in the retail trade sector, but it has occurred generally across all industries. There are 36% fewer EBAs in operation now than there were four years ago – and while there has been some drop in the public sector, overwhelmingly the decline has come from the private sector:It has led to a situation where there has been a sharp increase in the number of workers operating under an award – up from 10% in 2010 to now 24%:This area will be the main industrial relations battlefield at the next election, and one of the major issues is the increase in EBA terminations during the bargaining of a new agreement.This issue has arisen since the Fair Work Commission’s decision to terminate the Aurizon EBA in April 2015. That decision drastically changed the nature of the EBA – from being based on the assumption it would be ongoing until renegotiated; to being able to be terminated during the bargaining process and threatening to put workers back on award rate conditions.The ALP’s employment spokesperson, Brenan O’Connor,  to the Sydney Institute  in which he pledged to end the ability of employers to follow this “nuclear option”.It is a stance echoed by the president of the ACTU, Ged Kearney, who argues that “cancelling agreements is a new form of industrial blackmail” and that “the precedent set by the Fair Work Commission’s ruling on Aurizon is being exploited by companies which now use termination of agreements as a bargaining tool”.There certainly has been an increase in the number of EBAs terminated. The Department of Employment, in its submission to the Senate inquiry into “Incidence of, and trends in, corporate avoidance of the Fair Work Act 2009” found that there had been an increase in terminations, but that up until that time (mid-2016) most had involved a small numbers of workers:However, the issue is a live one – in the past week, Unilever have sought to terminate the EBA for its Street Ice Cream factory workers in western Sydney.On the employers’ side,  has argued that the increase in terminations is not evidence that the enterprise bargaining system is broken. It argues that, despite the high-profile terminations “each year, on average, 17,000 enterprise agreements are approved by the commission”.But the data released last week show that there has been a sharp drop in the approvals of new EBAs since 2012:The ACTU also notes that since 2014 only 8.5% of the agreements terminated were made during the WorkChoices era, “whereas the remainder were those underwritten by a requirement to not disadvantage employees compared to the award (26.3%) or ensure employees were better off overall compared to the award (65.2%)”. Ged Kearney argues that “employers should not be able to hold the threat of termination of agreements over workers’ heads. It’s converting the bargaining system into a tool to cut pay and living standards when it was supposed to be about improving people’s lives”Pointedly, she says of this practice, “it must end”.That employer groups seem more happy with the current enterprise bargaining system than unions probably gives a good indicator of how it is being used. And after a quarter of a century during which the ALP, for the most part, has been wary of taking an overly interventionist approach to IR, it appears that (as with their thinking on negative gearing) they believe the time is ripe for a shift in policy.With workers now almost resigned to low wage growth, the belief that a hands-off approach to IR is the best for the economy – and workers – might be ready to be challenged.
