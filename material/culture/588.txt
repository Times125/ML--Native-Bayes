n recent years, London duo  have shrugged off their post-dubstep past and started to create songs that shepherd synth-heavy post-punk into the present day. On their third album, the band s instrumentals radiate wit and warmth, like mid-80s New Order sloshing around in a sun-kissed sea   but it s as a foil to some of Britain s most idiosyncratic artists that Mount Kimbie really prove their mettle. Marilyn, their collaboration with Micachu, produces a masterly melange of outside-the-box melodies,  s hyper-emotional pipes meet creepily corrupted gospel on We Go Home Together, while the brilliant You Look Certain (I m Not So Sure) s chit-chatty vocals (courtesy of Andrea Balency, the band s touring singer) recall post-punkers such as  and the Raincoats. The record s other highlight, Blue Train Lines, sees the duo reprise their hugely fruitful alliance with , artfully tempering the latter s cracked howl with neat motorik drums and restrained synths that hover politely on the fringes of white noise.
