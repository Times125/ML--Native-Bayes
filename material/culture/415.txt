his empathic documentary follows an experimental programme that helps convicts at Folsom state prison in California and volunteer citizens confront their darkest feelings through group therapy. Shaped by recent therapeutic approaches aimed at men with issues involving violence, substance abuse and childhood trauma, the programme gets the guys all chanting, crying, screaming, raging and, above all, talking about what happened to get them where they are now.In the case of the prisoners, that s often a lot of bad luck and poor decision-making. But what is really fascinating is watching how the ordinary joes   aware of being there but for the grace of God   learn from the inmates, inspired by their courage to  jump in the fire  and expose their deepest fears and anxieties. The constant therapy-speak may be squirm-inducing for more uptight British viewers, and risks confirming suspicions about the huggy-feely nature of Californians of all classes, but for the open-minded this is moving, even wrenching viewing that might inspire similar approaches in British institutions. The dry, strictly observational shooting style means the doc stays in the moment and rarely ventures out of the room where the programme unfolds, adding immediacy. It s also essential viewing for aficionados of intricate tattoo art.
