WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY        THE TAKE with ABC News' MaryAlice Parks The president's wife, daughter and own vice president saw pictures of white nationalists' carrying torches in a Southern street -- chanting slogans like "Jews will not replace us" -- and felt compelled to speak out. President Trump, by his own admission, was not convinced by what he saw. For the president there could have been "fine people" in the crowd, though they would have been walking alongside symbols of racist violence, mass murder and oppression. Politicians tend to speak either because they think it is right or because it is in their own self-interest. While the president condemned neo-Nazis and the KKK, he stopped short of telling them he did not want their support. The white nationalists continue to be very specific about backing this president. We have seen from his past behavior that President Trump can prioritize loyalty above almost anything else, and perhaps that is driving some of his decision-making here. Either he wants and enjoys the support of white nationalist groups or he does not. Or he thinks he needs their support to win. Republicans on the whole will continue to face questions about those possibilities, whether they rode the coattails of his implicit acceptance or encouragement of these groups, and whether any of that is excusable.
