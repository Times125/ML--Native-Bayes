ecently, British director Ben Rivers made a deeply strange Morocco-set movie, inspired by a Paul Bowles story, entitled . It featured a director making a film with non-professionals on location   and for these shots Rivers used a real director and (as it were) real non-professionals making a real film: this film, in fact, from 35-year-old French-born director Oliver Laxe.Mimosas is a challengingly static, dreamily mysterious and beautifully shot film about two disreputable Moroccan men who, as part of a caravan of travellers, accept the task of carrying the dead body of a holy man, the  Sheikh , across the Atlas mountains to be buried in his home village. They receive help from a stranger who is as enigmatic as everything and everyone else in the film. It has been compared to Werner Herzog s , but where that has a very real sense of hubris and fear, this is too opaque and unreal to have quite that effect. It is more like a parable. Certain scenes look as if they have been improvised on location and there is something exasperatingly non-committal and provisional about it. But it certainly looks wonderful.
