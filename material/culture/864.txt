There is a bitter irony, during this BBC Proms season, in the announcement by the National Musicians  Church, St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, that amateur and professional musicians will no longer be permitted to hire the church for rehearsals and concerts. The ashes of Sir Henry Wood, founder of the Proms, lie in its north chapel, which is dedicated to the commemoration of significant British musicians.This move was made without consultation and contradicts assurances given when the church was taken over in 2013 by Holy Trinity Brompton. At present, the historic building rings with rehearsals and concerts by the country s finest ensembles, including the Sixteen. It is deeply regrettable that the current incumbent, the Rev David Ingall, wishes to exclude superb music, even as   our ministry as the National Musicians  Church continues to be a core part of our church s identity and vision . We don t understand how excluding musicians and listeners who regularly visit the church during rehearsals and concerts would further this goal.We understand that churches are principally places of worship and sympathise with the challenges faced in achieving a sustainable balance of activity. However, the unique  mission  for St Sepulchre s has been to musicians, providing a welcoming space and encouraging them to be involved in running the parish. That its custodians are now willing to abandon this unique national cultural remit is difficult to understand and harder to accept.We urge a reversal of this ban on external hirers, followed by open consultation with a range of music stakeholders on a way forward to ensure that the mission of the National Musicians  Church is assured.
