Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine), on Thursday joined other Republicans seeking to oust Democratic Rep. Scott Peters from his 52nd Congressional District seat. "Washington needs more patriots and less politicians," Casara said in a statement. "Voters demand a representative who understand the needs of a strong national defense and will support the men and women who provide it."
