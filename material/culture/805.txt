The hit TV comedy Fleabag is to return after its creator, , dreamed up a new idea on a bus.But the second series of the Bafta-winning show will not air until 2019.Waller-Bridge, who was  before , said it had taken a while to work out how to bring the show back. I really struggled thinking about how to come back, because I didn t want to stretch the story even further than I already stretched it, and I felt like the relationship with the audience had evolved by the end,  the 32-year-old told the Edinburgh international television festival. So that s what has been taking us so long, and me so long, to decide whether or not we re going to do it again. And then I was on a bus and had an idea! So we re really, really excited. Waller-Bridge added in a statement:  I asked myself if Fleabag has more to say and, frankly, she hasn t shut up since   Series two will be a whole new adventure and I m beyond thrilled to be coming back. Shane Allen, the BBC s controller of comedy, said:  Fleabag signalled the arrival of a hugely distinctive writer with the mesmerising performing talent to match. Phoebe s career has shot up like a firework display in the last year and the show has been rightly hailed as a modern classic. It ll be thrilling to see where she takes the character in the next series. The producer of the programme, Lydia Hampson, said:  It s quite a long wait, but it s happening. Waller-Bridge wrote and starred in the comedy about a cash-strapped young woman trying to come to terms with a recent tragedy.Producers said the new BBC3 series would  follow Fleabag through many more outrageous exploits .
