Another crop of hopefuls descend on John and GreggïŒs kitchen for the next round. With Vic Reeves now out of the running, itïŒs down to Ulrika-ka-ka Jonsson to represent Team Shooting Stars.

If youïŒre one of those people who doesnïŒt end up bawling their eyes out by the end of a fresh episode of Long Lost Family, well, you probably donïŒt exist.

TonightïŒs canvas is Rebecca, a gran whose commitment to black extended to her wedding dress.
