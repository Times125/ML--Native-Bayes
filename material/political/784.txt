President Trump went to the Pentagon Thursday to be briefed by Defense Department officials on U.S. military deployments, including discussions about troop levels in Afghanistan. As he and the vice president arrived at the Pentagon, Mr. Trump was asked whether he intended to send more troops to Afghanistan.   "We'll see," he told the pool reporter, adding, "And we're doing very well against ISIS. ISIS is falling fast. Very fast."   In June, the president gave Defense Secretary James Mattis the authority to set troop levels in Afghanistan. Mattis is expected to approve the deployment of at least 3,000 additional trainers and advisers, and special operations forces.  Currently, there are about 8,400 U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan.
