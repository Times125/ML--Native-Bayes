SINGAPORE, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore releases key findings from first cyber security public awareness survey conducted by the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) on Wednesday. The survey result revealed that majority of Singaporean recognize that every individual has a role to play in cyber security, said CSA. Close to three in five respondents were extremely concerned about the security of their financial and personal information. However, the findings revealed that there is room for improvement when it comes to cyber hygiene awareness and practices. According to the survey, 86 percent said they used a combination of letters, numbers and symbols in their passwords. However, 41 percent admitted to not conducting virus scans on their devices and files before opening them, as they found it either too time-consuming or deemed it as unnecessary. Also, the survey suggested that more than six in 10 respondents connected to open, non-password protected Wi-Fi networks in public places. "Many may not realize that these practices may pose substantial risks to the security of their personal information," said the agency in its statement. A total of 2,000 respondents aged 15 and above were surveyed between July and August last year.
