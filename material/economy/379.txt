his piece is about one of the biggest taboos of our times. About a truth that is seldom acknowledged, and yet   on reflection   cannot be denied. The truth that we are living in an inverse welfare state.These days, politicians from the left to the right assume that most wealth is created at the top. By the visionaries, by the job creators, and by the people who have  made it . By the go-getters oozing talent and entrepreneurialism that are helping to advance the whole world.Now, we may disagree about the extent to which success deserves to be rewarded   the philosophy of the left is that the strongest shoulders should bear the heaviest burden, while the right fears high taxes will blunt enterprise   but across the spectrum virtually all agree that wealth is created primarily at the top.So entrenched is this assumption that it s even embedded in our language. When economists talk about  productivity , what they really mean is the size of your paycheck. And when we use terms like  ,  redistribution  and  solidarity , we re implicitly subscribing to the view that there are two strata: the makers and the takers, the producers and the couch potatoes, the hardworking citizens   and everybody else.In reality, it is precisely the other way around. In reality, it is the waste collectors, the nurses, and the cleaners whose shoulders are supporting the apex of the pyramid. They are the true mechanism of social solidarity. Meanwhile, a growing share of those we hail as  successful  and  innovative  are earning their wealth at the expense of others. The people getting the biggest handouts are not down around the bottom, but at the very top. Yet their perilous dependence on others goes unseen. Almost no one talks about it. Even for politicians on the left, it s a non-issue.To understand why, we need to recognise that there are two ways of making money. The first is what most of us do: work. That means tapping into our knowledge and know-how (our  human capital  in economic terms) to create something new, whether that s a takeout app, a wedding cake, a stylish updo, or a perfectly poured pint. To work is to create. Ergo, to work is to create new wealth.But there is also a second way to make money. : by leveraging control over something that already exists, such as land, knowledge, or money, to increase your wealth. You produce nothing, yet profit nonetheless. By definition, the rentier makes his living at others  expense, using his power to claim economic benefit.For those who know their history, the term  rentier  conjures associations with heirs to estates, such as the 19th century s large class of useless rentiers, well-described by the . These days, that class is making a comeback. (Ironically, however, conservative politicians adamantly defend the rentier s right to lounge around, deeming inheritance tax to be the height of unfairness.) But there are also other ways of rent-seeking. From Wall Street to , from big pharma to the lobby machines in Washington and Westminster, zoom in and you ll see rentiers everywhere.There is no longer a sharp dividing line between working and rentiering. In fact, the modern-day rentier often works damn hard. Countless people in the financial sector, for example, apply great ingenuity and effort to amass  rent  on their wealth. Even the big innovations of our age   businesses like  and Uber   are interested mainly in expanding the rentier economy. The problem with most rich people therefore is not that they are coach potatoes. Many a CEO toils 80 hours a week to multiply his allowance. It s hardly surprising, then, that they feel wholly entitled to their wealth.It may take quite a mental leap to see our economy as a system that shows solidarity with the rich rather than the poor. So I ll start with the clearest illustration of modern freeloaders at the top: bankers. Studies conducted by the  and the    not exactly leftist thinktanks   have revealed that much of the financial sector has become downright parasitic. How instead of creating wealth, they gobble it up whole.Don t get me wrong. Banks can help to gauge risks and get money where it is needed, both of which are vital to a well-functioning economy. But consider this:  of GDP. Based on this equation, if the financial sector only grows, it won t equal more wealth, but less. So here s the bad news. In the United Kingdom, . In the .In other words, a big part of the modern banking sector is essentially a giant tapeworm gorging on a sick body. It s not creating anything new, merely sucking others dry. Bankers have found a hundred and one ways to accomplish this. The basic mechanism, however, is always the same: offer loans like it s going out of style, which in turn inflates the price of things like houses and shares, then earn a tidy percentage off those overblown prices (in the form of interest, commissions, brokerage fees, or what have you), and if the shit hits the fan, let Uncle Sam mop it up.The financial innovation concocted by all the math whizzes working in modern banking (instead of at universities or companies that contribute to real prosperity) basically boils down to maximising the total amount of debt. And debt, of course, is a means of earning rent. So for those who believe that pay ought to be proportionate to the value of work, the conclusion we have to draw is that many bankers should be earning a negative salary; a fine, if you will, for destroying more wealth than they create.Bankers are the most obvious class of closet freeloaders, but they are certainly not alone. Many a lawyer and an accountant wields a similar revenue model. . Untold hardworking, academically degreed professionals make a good living at the expense of the populations of other countries. Or take the tide of privatisations over the past three decades, which have been all but a carte blanche for rentiers. One of the richest people in the world, , earned his millions by obtaining a monopoly of the Mexican telecom market and then hiking prices sky high. The same goes for the Russian oligarchs who rose after the , who bought up valuable state-owned assets for song to live off the rent.But here comes the rub. Most rentiers are not as easily identified as the greedy banker or manager. Many are disguised. On the face of it, they look like industrious folks, because for part of the time they really are doing something worthwhile. Precisely that makes us overlook their massive rent-seeking.Take the pharmaceutical industry. Companies like  and  regularly unveil new drugs, yet most real medical breakthroughs are made quietly at government-subsidised labs. Private companies mostly manufacture medications that resemble what we ve already got. They get it patented and, with a hefty dose of marketing, a legion of lawyers, and a strong lobby, can live off the profits for years. In other words, the vast revenues of the pharmaceutical industry are the result of a tiny pinch of innovation and fistfuls of rent.Even paragons of modern progress like Apple, Amazon, , Facebook, Uber and Airbnb are woven from the fabric of rentierism. Firstly, because they owe their existence to government discoveries and inventions (every sliver of fundamental technology in the iPhone, from the internet to batteries and from touchscreens to voice recognition, was invented by researchers on the government payroll). And second, because they tie themselves into knots to avoid paying taxes, retaining countless bankers, lawyers, and lobbyists for this very purpose.Even more important, many of these companies function as  natural monopolies , operating in a positive feedback loop of increasing growth and value as more and more people contribute free content to their platforms. Companies like this are incredibly difficult to compete with, because as they grow bigger, they only get stronger.Aptly characterising this  platform capitalism  in an article, :  Uber, the world s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world s most popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate. So what do these companies own? A platform. A platform that lots and lots of people want to use. Why? First and foremost, because they re cool and they re fun   and in that respect, they do offer something of value. However, the main reason why we re all happy to hand over free content to Facebook is because all of our friends are on Facebook too, because their friends are on Facebook   because their friends are on Facebook.Most of Mark Zuckerberg s income is just rent collected off the millions of picture and video posts that we give away daily for free. And sure, we have fun doing it. But we also have no alternative   after all, everybody is on Facebook these days. Zuckerberg has a website that advertisers are clamouring to get onto, and that doesn t come cheap. Don t be fooled by endearing pilots with free internet in Zambia. Stripped down to essentials, it s an ordinary ad agency. In fact, in 2015 Google and Facebook pocketed an astounding  in the US.But don t Google and Facebook make anything useful at all? Sure they do. The irony, however, is that their best innovations only make the rentier economy even bigger. They employ scores of programmers to create new algorithms so that we ll all click on more and more ads.  just as  and Amazon has overrun the book trade. The bigger such platforms grow the more powerful they become, enabling the lords of these digital feudalities to demand more and more rent.Think back a minute to the definition of a rentier: someone who uses their control over something that already exists in order to increase their own wealth. The feudal lord of medieval times did that by building a tollgate along a road and making everybody who passed by pay. Today s tech giants are doing basically the same thing, but transposed to the digital highway. Using technology funded by taxpayers, they build tollgates between you and other people s free content and all the while pay almost no tax on their earnings.This is the so-called innovation that has Silicon Valley gurus in raptures: ever bigger platforms that claim ever bigger handouts. So why do we accept this? Why does most of the population work itself to the bone to support these rentiers?I think there are two answers. Firstly, the modern rentier knows to keep a low profile. There was a time when everybody knew who was freeloading. The king, the church, and the aristocrats controlled almost all the land and made peasants pay dearly to farm it. But in the modern economy, making rentierism work is a great deal more complicated. How many people can explain a , or a ? Or the revenue model behind those cute Google Doodles? And don t the folks on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley work themselves to the bone, too? Well then, they must be doing something useful, right?Maybe not. The typical workday of Goldman Sachs  CEO may be worlds away from that of King Louis XIV, but their revenue models both essentially revolve around obtaining the biggest possible handouts.  The world s most powerful investment bank,  wrote the journalist ,  is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. But far from squids and vampires, the average rich freeloader manages to masquerade quite successfully as a decent hard worker. He goes to great lengths to present himself as a  job creator  and an  investor  who  earns  his income by virtue of his high  productivity . Most economists, journalists, and politicians from left to right are quite happy to swallow this story. Time and again language is twisted around to cloak funneling and exploitation as creation and generation.However, it would be wrong to think that all this is part of some ingenious conspiracy. Many modern rentiers have convinced even themselves that they are bona fide value creators. When current Goldman Sachs CEO  was asked about the purpose of his job, his straight-faced answer was that he is  . The Sun King would have approved.The second thing that keeps rentiers safe is even more insidious. We re all wannabe rentiers. They have made millions of people complicit in their revenue model. Consider this: What are our financial sector s two biggest cash cows? Answer: the housing market and pensions. Both are markets in which many of us are deeply invested.Recent decades have seen more and more people contract debts to buy a home, and naturally it s in their interest if  (read: burst bubble upon bubble). The same goes for pensions. Over the past few decades we ve all scrimped and saved up a mountainous pension piggy bank. Now pension funds are under immense pressure to ally with the biggest exploiters in order to ensure they pay out enough to please their investors.The fact of the matter is that feudalism has been democratised. To a lesser or greater extent, we are all depending on handouts. En masse, we have been made complicit in this exploitation by the rentier elite, resulting in a political covenant between the rich rent-seekers and the homeowners and retirees.Don t get me wrong, most homeowners and retirees are not benefiting from this situation. On the contrary, the banks are bleeding them far beyond the extent to which they themselves profit from their houses and pensions. Still, it s hard to point fingers at a kleptomaniac when you have sticky fingers too.So why is this happening? The answer can be summed up in three little words: Because it can.Rentierism is, in essence, a question of power. That the Sun King Louis XIV was able to exploit millions was purely because he had the biggest army in Europe. It s no different for the modern rentier. He s got the law, politicians and journalists squarely in his court. That s why bankers get fined peanuts for preposterous fraud, while a mother on government assistance gets penalised within an inch of her life if she checks the wrong box.The biggest tragedy of all, however, is that the rentier economy is gobbling up society s best and brightest. Where once upon a time Ivy League graduates chose careers in science, public service or education, these days they are more likely to opt for banks, law firms, or trumped up ad agencies like Google and Facebook. When you think about it, it s insane. We are forking over billions in taxes to help our brightest minds on and up the corporate ladder so they can learn how to score ever more outrageous handouts.One thing is certain: countries where rentiers gain the upper hand gradually fall into decline. Just look at the Roman Empire. Or Venice in the 15th century. Look at the Dutch Republic in the 18th century. Like a parasite stunts a child s growth, so the rentier drains a country of its vitality.What innovation remains in a rentier economy is mostly just concerned with further bolstering that very same economy. This may explain why the big dreams of the 1970s, like flying cars, curing cancer, and colonising Mars, have yet to be realised, while bankers and ad-makers have at their fingertips technologies a thousand times more powerful.Yet it doesn t have to be this way. Tollgates can be torn down, financial products can be banned, tax havens dismantled, lobbies tamed, and patents rejected. Higher taxes on the ultra-rich can make rentierism less attractive, precisely because society s biggest freeloaders are at the very top of the pyramid. And we can more fairly distribute our earnings on land, oil, and innovation through a system of, say, employee shares, or a .But such a revolution will require a wholly different narrative about the origins of our wealth. It will require ditching the old-fashioned faith in  solidarity  with a miserable underclass that deserves to be borne aloft on the market-level salaried shoulders of society s strongest. All we need to do is to give real hard-working people what they deserve.And, yes, by that I mean the waste collectors, the nurses, the cleaners   theirs are the shoulders that carry us all.
