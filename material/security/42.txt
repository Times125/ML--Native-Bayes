BEIJING, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Thursday reiterated China's firm opposition to cyber attacks and its commitment to fighting them in any form. Spokesperson Hua Chunying made the remarks while responding to a question on how China and the United States should deal with cyber security issues. "Cyber attacks tend to be transnational and anonymous," Hua said, adding that the issue was a complicated, global problem. Hua said China had been the target of overseas cyber attacks, which had severely threatened national security and interests. China called for strengthened dialogue and cooperation, she said, adding that "wild guesses and malicious slurs" will not help the issue. China and the United States had common interests, Hua said, noting that cyber security should become an area of cooperation instead of a source of friction. Hua said China hoped the United States could maintain a constructive attitude, creating the necessary conditions for further cooperation based on mutual respect and trust. China hopes the United States will work with the international community to build a peaceful, safe, open and cooperative cyber space, she said.
