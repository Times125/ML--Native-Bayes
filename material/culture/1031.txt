n a week where up increasingly seems like down and purple is apparently orange (with PrinceïŒs sister having made an incendiary claim ), there is something reassuring about the sight of a crushed hard drive. To be more specific, the sight of a hard drive once housed in Terry PratchettïŒs computer, and thought to contain up to 10 unfinished novels, being, in accordance with the late authorïŒs wishes. We were left with the authorïŒs final, perhaps greatest, creative statement: that there should be no room in this world for substandard art.With news of ITVïŒs autumn schedule dropping on the same day, it feels like a waste of a good six-and-a-half tonne steamroller for such destruction to be restricted to the creative works of the deceased. Efforts may be wasted on attempts to eradicate season 76 of The X Factor: it feels as if this curiously resilient singing contest will outlast us all, the only hint of human life 1,000 years from now consisting of a defibrillated painter-decorator singing Maroon 5 in a bombed-out conference room for the benefit of an animatronic approximation of Nicole Scherzinger. But could  æ¯ â»Eight 21st-century lads are to be transported back to the Roman empire to see if they can cut it as gladiatorsÂ§ æ¯ provide a good test subject?In the name of managed expectations, please understand that  has not spent its Love Island ad revenue perfecting the art of time travel. This show is pretend. ItïŒs also, necessarily, presented with tongue in cheek. This primetime â»modern geezers in the time of CaesarÂ§ romp was described by executive producer Ben Kelly using the following words: â»The Romans gave us roads, viaducts and basic sanitation but Bromans may prove to be their greatest legacy.Â§Fair enough, but let us turn this on its head: letïŒs mix it with PratchettïŒs own greatest legacy, and tune in on launch night to watch TV executives competing to prevent the destruction of tapes containing BromansïŒ first series. Then we will see how much they really believe in what theyïŒre selling.
