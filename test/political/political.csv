"President Trump's embattled chief strategist Steve Bannon lashed out at his rivals in the administration in a rare interview with the American Prospect, which was published Wednesday.? Bannon told progressive American Prospect writer Robert Kuttner about his plan to neutralize his opponents, which include top officials and advisers to President Trump. ""They're wetting themselves,"" he said of his adversaries in the administration who disagree with him on trade and economic policies. Bannon proceeded to relay how he wants to create an outside group of trade hawks with factions from both the left and the right wings of the political spectrum. Bannon told Kuttner he's ""changing out people at East Asian Defense,"" and getting Susan Thornton, the acting head of East Asian and Pacific Affairs for the State Department, ""out at State."" ""That's a fight I fight every day here,"" he said. ""We're still fighting. There's Treasury and [National Economic Council chair] Gary Cohn and Goldman Sachs lobbying."" ""We gotta do this,"" Bannon continued about taking an aggressive stance against China on trade issues. ""The president's default position is to do it, but the apparatus is going crazy. Don't get me wrong. It's like, every day."" ""To me, the economic war with China is everything,"" Bannon told Kuttner. ""And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, ten years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover."" Bannon's call to Kuttner, who says he'd never spoken to the former Breitbart publisher before, came as Bannon's future in the White House is uncertain. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said ""we'll see"" what happens with Bannon, in the middle of a chaotic press that blamed ""both sides"" for violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. ""Well we'll see -- look, like, I like Mr. Bannon, he's a friend of mine, but Mr. Bannon came on very late, you know that,""?Mr. Trump said. ""I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that, and I like him, he is a good man, he is not a racist, I can tell you that. He's a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard, but we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon, but he's a good person, and I think the press treats him frankly very unfairly."" Sources claim that Steve Bannon's White House job is in jeopardy. Josh Gerstein, senior White House reporter for Politico, joins CBSN to discuss ... Bannon, who in the past has bragged about his connections to?the ""alt-right,"" dismissed the far-right protesters as an irrelevant ""fringe element."" ""Ethno-nationalism〞it's losers,"" Bannon said. ""It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more."" ""These guys are a collection of clowns,"" the president's chief strategist added.? Bannon also said pursuing a military option with North Korea in the face of its nuclear threats is useless.? ""There's no military solution, forget it,"" Bannon said. ""Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul [South Korea] don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about, there's no military solution here, they got us.""?

"ATLANTA -- With the president under fire for remarks about Charlottesville, CBS News checked in with some Republicans who voted for him. Janelle Jones, Ellen Diehl and Lucretia Hughes say their support for President Trump has not lessened. ""I don't look at him as my pastor or my moral leader,"" said Jones. ""I look at him as the leader as it relates to governmental issues."" ""We are not looking for somebody charming,"" Diehl said. ""We are looking for a man who knows how to turn things around and he's got a track record of turning things around."" Janelle Jones, Ellen Diehl and Lucretia Hughes all voted for President Trump. When she saw the violence in Charlottesville, Diehl said, for her, ""it wasn't necessarily a complete black-white issue. But I think the media is turning it into a black-white issue. It's definitely a left-right issue. But its left fringe and right fringe."" As for the Confederate monuments, Hughes said they are ""history."" ""I wasn't born back then you wasn't either,"" Hughes said. ""So why is that affecting us? If anything we should grow and learn from it.? Just like Martin Luther King said, you don't judge people by the color of their skin. You base that on their character."" CBS News chief Washington correspondent and ""Face the Nation"" moderator John Dickerson joins ""CBS This Morning"" from Washington to discuss Presid... As for the criticisms Mr. Trump has faced about his reaction to racial tension, Hughes and Jones said that does not change their support. ""I think for myself. Period,"" Hughes said. ""Nobody is going to tell me what to think or how to think. I am not gullible and I am not blind. It's my decision if I am going to support someone or not. Not go by what other people has to say and to me what I have seen and what I love, he is not going to lose my support any time soon."" ""I have been a Republican before Donald Trump, I will be a Republican afterwards,"" Jones said. ""I honestly don't think we will see this issue a racial divide addressed until we remove identity politics out of the political process."" These Republican women say if a president deserves blame for making racial tensions worse it's former President Obama, not Mr. Trump, and the identity politics they believe Democrats have practiced for the last eight years.

"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- As night fell in Birmingham Tuesday, city workers raised a blackened plywood wall around the Confederate memorial that has stood there for more than a century. By Wednesday morning, Roy Brook, carrying an American flag, marched alone in protest. ""I just hate seeing history destroyed,"" Brook said. Roy Brook protests the covering of a Confederate monument in Birmingham, Alabama. The violence in Charlottesville, Virginia,?re-ignited the debate, and Birmingham Mayor William Bell says these monuments don't belong in what he calls the cradle of the civil rights movement. Birmingham Mayor William Bell ""I want it gone,"" Bell said. ""Think about what it represents. The Confederacy was an act of sedition. It was an act of treason."" The Southern Poverty Law Center found some 1,500 Confederate memorials across the country, including 718 statues and monuments and 10 U.S. military bases named after Confederate officers. But the list has gotten a little smaller: Baltimore's mayor ordered that city's four Confederate monuments removed. And protesters in Durham, North Carolina, took matters into their own hands -- and feet -- to remove a statue at the county courthouse. A statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in the U.S. Capitol. And even on Capitol Hill -- where ten statues including those of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and Gen. Robert E. Lee stand in Statuary Hall -- critics want them gone, too. ""It sends the message we have not learned from our past. We have not learned that all God's children are created equal,"" Bell said. The Alabama attorney general is suing the city of Birmingham and the mayor, saying the wall obstructs the view to the monument which violates a state law signed this year.

"The Trump administration will make Obamacare payments to insurers for August, a White House spokesman said Wednesday. The president has repeatedly said he might end the payments, known as cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments, which are currently slated to cost the government $7 billion during this fiscal year and $10 billion in 2018. These payments are made to health insurers to help low-income people enrolled under the health care law with out-of-pocket expenses. This comes a day after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that cutting off the payments would result in premiums going up 20 percent next year and the federal deficit growing by $194 billion over a decade. In a statement Wednesday, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, said that the president's decision helps ""18 million Americans who buy health insurance on the individual market."" ""State insurance commissioners have warned that abrupt cancellation of cost-sharing subsidies would cause premiums, copays and deductibles to increase and more insurance companies to leave the markets in 2018,"" said Alexander, who is calling for a more permanent bipartisan solution. ""Congress now should pass balanced, bipartisan, limited legislation in September that will fund cost-sharing payments for 2018 as well as make section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act work better to give states more flexibility in approving insurance policies. ?These two actions will help make insurance policies available at affordable prices,"" he added. His committee is scheduled to hold bipartisan hearings on stabilizing the health insurance market the week of Sept. 4.?

"BATON ROUGE, La. -- A neo-Nazi website's publisher said Wednesday that he has ""effectively been completely banned from the internet"" after mocking the victim of a deadly car attack at a white nationalist rally in Virginia. ""Clearly, the powers that be believe that they have the ability to simply kick me off the internet,"" Andrew Anglin, who has published the site from an undisclosed location, complained to The Associated Press in an e-mail. Access to The Daily Stormer had been sporadic since Monday, when Google canceled its domain name registration, making its IP address nearly impossible for internet users to locate. The site had moved its registration to Google after GoDaddy tweeted late Sunday night that it had given The Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain to another provider. Google then yanked the address as well, citing a violation of its terms of service. We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service. The site briefly reappeared Wednesday with a Russian domain name and registration and a dubious top story, making the unsupported claim that President Donald Trump had called Russian President Vladimir Putin to get the site restored. The story presented no evidence that Mr. Trump or Putin had any involvement in the move and Mr. Trump has no known links to the site. Until mid-day, the site continued to receive performance and security services from San Francisco-based Cloudflare Inc., protecting it from denial of service attacks. Cloudflare said it is cooperating with law enforcement. A company statement called some of the content on Cloudfare's network ""repugnant."" but said withdrawing its services would not remove the website from the internet, just make it slower and more vulnerable to attack. Shortly thereafter, the site that takes its name from Der St邦rmer, a newspaper that published Nazi propaganda, disappeared again. Anglin said he was struggling to find a domain registry service whose terms of service allow for the content he produces. ""I have been kicked off of 4 of them so far, and many of them contain explicit references to ""hate speech"" in their ToS. Others would be incapable of managing the DDoS attacks,"" Anglin wrote, expressing frustration with ICANN, the international nonprofit that authorizes domain-name registrars. ""If they don't have a single registrar willing to host me, then they have effectively banned me from registering a domain."" Anglin had been keeping up his inflammatory statements through the Russian domain, mocking Heather Heyer, the woman who was killed when a man remembered for praising Adolph Hitler rammed his car into a crowd of demonstrators in Charlottesville on Saturday. The original story called her, among many other things, ""the definition of uselessness."" But Anglin had other fresh trouble as well: A Muslim-American radio host filed a federal lawsuit on Wednesday accusing him of defamation by falsely labeling him the ""mastermind"" of a deadly concert bombing in England. In this June 25, 2015, file photo, Muslim comedian Dean Obeidallah speaks at a news conference in New York. SiriusXM Radio show host Dean Obeidallah said The Daily Stormer embedded fabricated tweets in a June 1 story to make them seem like they had been sent from Obeidallah's Twitter account, tricking readers into believing he took responsibility for the May 22 terrorist attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. The death threats came quickly thereafter. ""It was literally jaw-dropping,"" Obeidallah, a comedian and Daily Beast columnist, told the AP. ""The death threats were something I've never seen before in my life."" The suit claims that the article's defamatory statements were intended to incite violence against Obeidallah, citing other alleged examples of Daily Stormer readers who did just that, including Dylann Roof, who read the site before killing black churchgoers in South Carolina. ""Mr. Obeidallah is an ardent believer in and defender of the First Amendment. He recognizes the importance of freedom of speech and political discourse, regardless of viewpoint. But the First Amendment does not license defamation,"" his suit says. Asked by the AP for comment on the lawsuit, Anglin gave a two-word response: ""Wew lads,"" referring to an internet meme expressing sarcastic fake-surprise and dismissiveness. The Daily Stormer also was sued in April by a Montana woman for orchestrating an anti-Semitic trolling campaign against her family. Tanya Gersh's suit claims anonymous internet trolls bombarded Gersh's family with hateful and threatening messages after Anglin published their personal information in a post accusing her and other Jewish residents of Whitefish, Montana, of engaging in an ""extortion racket"" against the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer. Gersh is represented by attorneys from the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. In July, the law center's lawyers claimed Anglin was ""actively concealing his whereabouts"" and hadn't been served with Gersh's suit. They said they looked for him at four addresses in Franklin County, Ohio, where he apparently has connections. Obeidallah's lawsuit was filed in Columbus, Ohio, since Anglin is an Ohio native who uses a post office box in Worthington, Ohio. A lawyer for Obeidallah said The Daily Stormer hasn't responded to their request to remove the June 1 article about him. Obeidallah is represented by Muslim Advocates, a national legal and educational organization based in Oakland, California.

"President Trump's reaction to the deadly violence at a white nationalist rally in Virginia last weekend drew considerably more disapproval than approval, according to a poll released Wednesday by the Economist and YouGov. Forty-two percent of respondents said they disapprove of the president's response, while only 27 percent said they approve. Thirty-one percent had no opinion. In his first remarks on the violence, the president on Saturday condemned the violence and bigotry ""on many sides"" 每 a remark widely interpreted as a suggestion of moral equivalency between the white nationalists and the counter-demonstrators. On Monday, the president struck a more unequivocal tone, describing white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, and other hate groups as ""repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans."" But by Tuesday, the president seemed to revert to his initial message, declaring in a combative press conference, ""I think there is blame on both sides."" The violence in Charlottesville claimed three lives over the weekend. A young woman was killed on Saturday when a car driven by a white nationalist plowed through a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators. And a police helicopter that was deployed in response to the ongoing situation crashed later that afternoon, killing two law enforcement officers on board. President Trump defended his response to deadly protests in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend, but ""it is hard to get on other side of n... Respondents in the Economist survey were asked which group is more likely to use violence 每 white nationalists or the anti-racist demonstrators. Thirty-one percent picked the white nationalists, ten percent picked the counter-protesters, and 45 percent said both groups were equally likely to turn violent. The poll also reflected the dim view most Americans hold of groups under the white nationalist umbrella, including the KKK and neo-Nazis. Only seven percent of respondents said they have a favorable opinion about white nationalists. Six percent said they view the KKK favorably. And only five percent said the same of neo-Nazis. Results were decidedly mixed, however, on questions involving symbols of the Confederacy like the Confederate flag and statues of Confederate leaders. (The situation in Charlottesville was sparked, in part, by the city's plan to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee from a public park.) Forty-three percent of respondents said they see the confederate flag mostly as a symbol of Southern pride, while 38 percent said they see the flag as a symbol of racism. Fifty-four percent said they see the statues of Confederate leaders as symbols of southern pride, and 26 percent said they see those statues as symbols of racism. Only 30 percent of respondents said they approve of Charlottesville's decision to remove the statue of Lee, while 48 percent said they disapprove. According to the survey, the president's approval rating among Americans nationwide stands at 39 percent, and his disapproval rating stands at 51 percent. The Economist poll surveyed 1,500 Americans between August 13 and 15, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.?

"Last Updated Aug 16, 2017 3:38 PM EDT Attorney General Jeff Sessions singled out Chicago and other so-called sanctuary cities in a speech in Miami on Wednesday, after Chicago announced it will sue the Department of Justice for planning to cut off key law enforcement grants to localities refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. Sessions said it is ""not moral or legal"" for local officials to refrain from reporting criminal aliens to federal authorities and to allow such offenders back on the streets. The attorney general said hundreds of thousands of Americans are affected every year by crimes committed by criminals who are in the country illegally, describing several cases in which criminal aliens were accused or convicted of perpetrating violent crimes against U.S. citizens in sanctuary cities. ""The Department of Justice will not concede a single block or street corner in the United States to lawlessness or crime,"" Sessions said. ""Nor will we tolerate the loss of innocent life because a handful of jurisdictions believe that they are above the law."" Sessions urged Chicago and other sanctuary cities to follow the example of Miami-Dade, where he said local officials are in full compliance with requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officials to report and hand over people who are in the country illegally. Sessions linked Chicago's notoriously high violent crimes rates to its sanctuary city policies. ""In Chicago 每 a city with almost exactly the same 2.7 million person population as Miami-Dade 每 more than 433 people have been murdered since the beginning of the year,"" the attorney general said in his prepared remarks. ""More than three times as many as Miami-Dade."" But CBS News' Paula Reid reports DOJ has been unable to provide any data supporting the connection between higher crime rates in Chicago and its immigration-related policies.? A memorial was held in honor of Heather Heyer, who died after a car plowed into a protesting crowd in Charlottesville, Virginia. Fran Townsend, C... The attorney general went also off script from his prepared remarks to address the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia -- calling the city ""Charlotte"" by mistake -- to denounce bigotry and praise the local law enforcement response there. Sessions, Reid reports, was one of the most vocal officials in the Trump administration to speak out first against Saturday's violent turn of events.? ""We've had a tough weekend in Charlotte, and um, I know you've all been following that. I want to thank state and local people and federal people that worked so hard since those tragic events there,"" Sessions said.? ""We cannot, and in no way can we accept or apologize for, racism, bigotry, hatred, violence, and those kind of things that too often arise in our country. I would say that the state people were engaged aggressively. Saturday night FBI was interviewing people in Ohio, they're moving aggressively in a collaborative way using the interstate capabilities that the federal agents have as well as on the ground capabilities of our state and local law officers."" The Justice Department is opening a civil rights investigation into the events surrounding Saturday's violence that left one woman, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, dead after a suspected attacker rammed his car into a sea of counter-protesters.? Sessions has been at the forefront of the president's agenda to crack down on crime and illegal immigration. But Mr. Trump has attacked his attorney general on Twitter for supposedly being too soft on leakers in federal agencies, or on former secretary of state Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server at the State Department.? Mr. Trump, asked about his relationship with Sessions last week, said, ""it's fine."" The Attorney General faulted politicians in Chicago, saying they're prioritizing and protecting criminal aliens over law-abiding U.S. citizens. Sessions contrasted Chicago with Miami-Dade and a handful of other localities that are ""choosing the rule of law."" ""So to all 'sanctuary' jurisdictions across the country, I say this: Miami-Dade is doing it, and so can you,"" Sessions said in his prepared remarks.? Sessions said sanctuary cities make themselves the best friends of drug smugglers and violent criminals, saying it is ""not moral or legal"" to refuse to work with federal immigration officials to deport criminal aliens. Local police, he said, are not to blame, rather, local politicians are. Sessions criticized Chicago and its murder rate, mentioning that Chicago just sued the U.S. over the DOJ's decision to pull grant funding for sanctuary cities. The attorney general said millions of Americans are affected every year by crimes committed by illegal aliens, describing several cases in which criminal aliens were accused or convicted of committing violent crimes against U.S. citizens. ""How can these politicians hear this story and do nothing?"" Sessions said.? Sessions took a moment to condemn the bigotry in ""Charlotte,"" instead of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.? Sessions' prepared remarks urge sanctuary cities to comply with federal immigration authorities, and focus on crime in cities like Chicago. Here is an excerpt from his prepared remarks:? ""During the last administration, the Inspector General sent 10 letters to jurisdictions that they had reason to believe were not complying with federal immigration law. Last week, we sent a letter to your mayor and today I'm here to announce that Miami-Dade is now in full compliance and eligible for federal law enforcement grant dollars. This is wonderful news for law enforcement and the citizens of Miami-Dade. ?It means more money for crime fighting. And it means we are partners in keeping everyone here safe. Unfortunately, some cities 每 like Chicago 每 refuse to follow your example. In Chicago 每 a city with almost exactly the same 2.7 million person population as Miami-Dade 每 more than 433 people have been murdered since the beginning of the year. More than three times as many as Miami-Dade."" Thomas Homan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said there's no reason to keep criminal aliens on the streets. As of July 31, nearly 10,000 criminal aliens released to the streets have committed another crime, he said.? ""Let me be clear. Entering this country illegally is a crime,"" Homan said.? Homan said state and local politicians can't be in the business of ""shielding"" people from the law.?

Both demonstrations are set to take place on September 16th and both eye the National Mall as the backdrop for their protests.? Organizers of the MOAR event say their demonstration, which is being promoted as the ""Woodstock of American Rallies,"" is set to ""send a message to Congress, the media and the world we stand united to defend American culture and values."" MOAR's head organizer Tommy Gunn, known as the ""P***** Off American"" on social media, says he wanted to create a ""huge"" event for supporters of President Trump.? ""Due to increasing political and social unrest, many believe that core American values, customs and traditions are being sacrificed. Rally participants will demand protection for traditional American culture while they express their love for the United States and the America First agenda,"" a statement on the rally's website reads. The event will feature speeches from vocal Trump supporters like Marco Gutierrez, founder of Latinos for Trump, and Omar Navarro, the Republican challenger to California Rep. Maxine Waters.? According to the Juggalos, September 16th will also be a day they ""rise up and unite to clear our name."" The FBI and Department of Justice originally listed the group as a gang in their 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment report, a move the Juggalos claim resulted in ""hundreds if not thousands of people subjected to various forms of discrimination, harassment and profiling."" The march's website says the ""Juggalo Family must truly shine and show America and the world that we are not a gang, public menace, cult, or any of the other untrue labels they have attempted to slap on us throughout the years."" According to the FBI, fans of the Insane Clown Posse, or ICP, are recognized as a gang in only four states. However, the FBI says many Juggalo subsets exhibit ""gang-like behavior"" and engage in criminal activity and violence like felony assaults, thefts, robberies and drug dealing.? While both events have explicitly said in their codes of conduct that they will not be using violence during their respective rallies, the fear of potential clashes has grown in the wake of the violent Charlottesville, Virginia demonstrations and car attack.?

"Last Updated Aug 16, 2017 7:01 PM EDT President Trump said Wednesday afternoon that he was disbanding his manufacturing council after a number of its members resigned in the wake of the president's handling of the terror attack and violence in Charlottesville last weekend. Mr. Trump made the announcement on Twitter and said that he was also disbanding the Strategy and Policy Forum, another business advisory group. A statement from the Forum said that decision to disband it was made jointly by the group and the president. Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!

Moments after the president's announcement, United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes resigned. Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, was also among those who stepped down. Many of them suggested in statements that the president didn't properly respond to the rally by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend.

Later in the day, Mr. Trump held a press conference at Trump Tower in which he blamed both sides -- the white supremacists and the people protesting them -- for the violence in Charlottesville.																																																																																																																					"
"In a press conference Tuesday, President Trump blamed Saturday's violent disruptions in Charlottesville, Virginia ""on both sides""-- both the neo-Nazis, white supremacists and hate groups present at the ""Unite the Right"" rally, as well as their counter-protesters.? CBS News' White House and senior foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan was there.? ""I was just trying to ask the president about what Senator McCain had said,"" Brennan told CBSN. What was supposed to be a scripted message from the Trump administration on infrastructure development, a key promise from Mr. Trump's campaign for the presidency, quickly changed in tenor with the president?launching attacks on what he labeled ""alt-left"" groups in Charlottesville who ""came charging, clubs in hand, swinging clubs."" ""The president, as you saw, was obviously deeply frustrated and really wanted to unload,"" Brennan said. ""And it was an incredible moment and it was shocking because it got so off the rails."" The events in Charlottesville lead to the death of one 32-year-old woman, who died after an attacker behind the wheel of a car rammed into a crowd of people at the rally, injuring 19 other individuals. Although Mr. Trump labeled the driver ""a murderer,"" he came to the defense of the right-wing activists at the rally. ""Those people, all of those people, excuse me, I've condemned neo-Nazis, I've condemned many different groups,"" Mr. Trump said at the conference. ""But not all those people were Neo-nazis, believe me. Not all those people were white supremacists. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue Robert E. Lee."" Mr. Trump's words sent a shockwave through Congress and surprised even his close allies.? ""White House aides were not prepared for this moment,"" Brennan explained. Mr. Trump also specifically called out Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, by name. ""Senator McCain? You mean the one that voted against Obamacare? You mean Senator McCain who voted against us getting good health care?"" he queried. McCain condemned ""the so-called 'alt-right'"" movement, calling their attacks on President Trump's national security adviser H.R. McMaster ""disgraceful"" in a statement released Monday. ""The mere mention of John McCain's name, he started cutting me off and challenging, and I was just trying to ask a question-- not challenge the president,"" Brennan said. ""That's not our role, to debate him."" ""This is a dangerous topic to go off script with because it can get so heated,"" Brennan said. ""This isn't something you riff on, there's a reason why you need to be very careful with your words on this topic in particular.""?

"Protests at Google offices across the country have been postponed due to what organizers claim are threats posed by unspecified ""left-wing terrorists."" The rallies were announced by a conspiracy-theory promoter after a?Google employee was fired?for penning a highly controversial internal memo about gender differences, sparking uproar in the tech industry. James Damore's memo, which claims biological factors contribute to gender inequality in the tech sector, sparked a quick reaction from Google after it circulated widely online. The ""Peaceful March on Google"" was billed as an ""event for First Amendment supporters from across the country, from all backgrounds, ethnicity and walks of life,"" according to a code of conduct listed on the march's blog. Marches were planned in several cities, including Washington, D.C.; Austin, Texas; New York City; Boston and Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. Organizers placed blame on the news media for causing backlash to the planned marches.? ""Despite our clear and straightforward statements denouncing bigotry and hatred, CNN and other mainstream media made malicious and false statements that our peaceful march was being organized by Nazi sympathizers,"" read a statement on the blog. Organizers claim that they had received a rash of credible threats from ""known Alt-Left terrorist groups,""?including one alleged threat to use a vehicle to drive into marchers like the deadly attack on counter-protesters after Saturday's Charlottesville, Virginia, rally. The rally organizer, Jack Posobiec, has created an active right-wing social media presence and is known for promoting conspiracy theories involving Democrats, including the Pizzagate rumor that a Washington, D.C., pizza shop was a cover for child trafficking. Posobiec had recently regained attention after being retweeted by President Trump for calling into question the ""national media outrage"" over the Charlottesville clashes.? Meanwhile: 39 shootings in Chicago this weekend, 9 deaths. No national media outrage. Why is that? https://t.co/9Crutnnrp8 The postponement comes just one day after Mr. Trump continued to place blame for the violent clashes in Virginia on ""both sides,""?inciting a slew of reactions from the political world for equating counter-protesters with white supremacists. The group says the threats they've received have been reported to the authorities and hope to hold the march ""in a few weeks' time.""

"Hillary Clinton's pastor, the Rev. Bill Shillady, plagiarized the writings of an Indiana minister in a new book that's scheduled to be released Tuesday, according to reports. The book, ""Strong for a Moment Like This: The Daily Devotions of Hillary Rodham Clinton,"" captures emails that Shillady wrote to the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee during the 2016 campaign and last December, CNN reported. An email Shillady sent to Clinton, however, the morning after the election last November that was titled ""Sunday is Coming"" looked similar to what the Rev. Matt Deuel wrote in a blog post in March 2016. The email published in the book, CNN reports, says, ""For the disciples and Christ's followers in the first century, Good Friday represented the day that everything fell apart. All was lost. The momentum and hope of a man claiming to be the Son of God, the Messiah who was supposed to change everything, had been executed."" In the March 2016 blog post, Deuel wrote, ""For the disciples and Christ followers in the first century, Good Friday represented the day that everything fell apart. All was lost. The momentum and hope of a man, claiming to be the Son of God, the Messiah who was supposed to change everything, had been executed."" Shillady apologized on Monday, according to The Washington Post, and he suggested Deuel accepted his apology. ""I am now stunned to realize the similarity between Matt Deuel's blog sermon and my own,"" he said in a statement. ""Clearly, portions of my devotional that day incorporate his exact words. Matt and I have spoken. He was extremely gracious and understanding. I have assured him he will receive full credit moving forward.""																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 16, 2017 9:27 AM EDT President Obama's tweet quoting former South African President Nelson Mandela following the violent clashes and domestic terror attack after white supremacists descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, has made Twitter history with over 3 million likes, making it the most-liked tweet since the social media site launched, according to new Twitter analytics data? The tweet, at more than 2.6 million likes as of Tuesday, had even surpassed talk show host Ellen DeGeneres' selfie tweet at the Academy Awards in 2014. The tweet quickly surpassed the 3 million mark as of late Tuesday night, following President Trump's press conference in which he equated counter protesters to the white supremacists actions in Virginia.? According to Nick Pacilio of Twitter Communications, Government & News, the message is also considered one of the top five most re-tweeted tweet ever. ? Mr. Obama, who faced a variety of national tragedies during his time in office, took to Twitter on Sunday to share a quote from Mandela along with a photo of children of various ethnicities.

The Twitter page, ""Yes, You're Racist,"" is becoming a new battleground after Saturday's violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The account i... Mr. Obama has largely stayed away from making overtly political statements on his social media page since leaving office, but has continued to weigh in on domestic and international events from the terror attacks in Manchester, England, to well-wishes for Republican Sen. John McCain after he announced that he had brain cancer. While President Trump tweeted his own sentiments following Saturday's attack and violent protests, saying ""we all must be united and condemn all that hate stands for"" and later condemned hate ""on many sides"", many were left wondering when Mr. Trump would come out and explicitly denounce white supremacists and other hate groups that were involved in the violence. Two days after the events, amid growing pressure from the public and political world, Mr. Trump denounced racism as ""evil"" in a televised statement from White House. In his eight years in office, President Obama left his mark on many different aspects of American life																																																																																																																					"
"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday responded to President Trump's suggestion a day earlier that there were ""very fine people, on both sides"" in Charlottesville last weekend. ""There are no good neo-Nazis, and those who espouse their views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms. We all have a responsibility to stand against hate and violence, wherever it raises its evil head,"" the Kentucky Republican said in a statement. McConnell didn't explicitly call out the president in his statement, which also said that white supremacist, neo-Nazi and KKK groups are planning a rally in Lexington, Kentucky. ""Their messages of hate and bigotry are not welcome in Kentucky and should not be welcome anywhere in America,"" he said. In a fiery exchange with reporters on Tuesday, President Trump backed off his Monday statement on the Charlottesville protests where he had denou... Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, tweeted Tuesday, ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity."" A number of GOP lawmakers also tweeted or issued similar statements, with many not addressing Mr. Trump directly. Some more moderate members, on the other hand, did call him out by name. During a press conference at Trump Tower Tuesday that was supposed to be a statement on infrastructure, the president again blamed both sides -- the white supremacists and the people protesting them -- for the Charlottesville violence like he did on Saturday after the terror attack. ""You have some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. You had people in that group 〞 excuse me, excuse me 〞 I saw the same pictures as you did.

Lee to another name,"" Mr. Trump said.?																																																																																																																					"
"Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel went on a rant Tuesday about the president's defense of neo-Nazis and white supremacists and proposed a ""plan"" on his show to ""save"" the nation from President Trump. In his opening monologue ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" Kimmel said that either the president should be impeached or Americans should do what Mr. Trump would do in this situation: ""We negotiate. We make a deal."" ""And I know this is going to sound nuts, but I have an idea. So hear me out on this....instead of president, we make Donald Trump king,"" Kimmel said. ""We make him the first king of America."" ""Think about it: England has a Queen. She lives in a palace. Everyone makes a big deal when she shows up and she has no power at all. In the morning, they put a crown on her head, and she goes back to bed -- that's it,"" he said. ""That's what we need to do with Donald Trump. We need to set him up in a castle -- maybe in Florida -- lead him to the top and then lock the door to that castle...forever."" Kimmel said that Mr. Trump could sit there watching ""Fox and Friends"" and chip ""golf balls out of the window of his tower."" ""There's no way he turns that deal down,"" he said. ""Mike Pence is ready. He's boring. He's relatively sane. He looks like a neighbor you might borrow a lawnmower from."" At the beginning of his monologue, Kimmel told his audience that what was supposed to be a press conference about infrastructure ""ended with our president making an angry and passionate defense of white supremacists."" ""It's like if your book club meeting turned into a cock fight,"" he joked. Kimmel called Mr. Trump ""completely unhinged"" to the point where ""the wheels are off the wagon and hurdling toward the moon right now."" He mocked the president for saying during the press conference that he wanted to wait for the facts on Saturday following the terror attack in Charlottesville. Kimmel noted the times that Mr. Trump linked Sen. Ted Cruz's father to Lee Harvey Oswald, who killed President Kennedy, and claiming that President Obama was born in Kenya. ""He's a stickler for facts,"" joked Kimmel, who then played a few video clips from his press conference including the part when Mr. Trump said the ""alt-left"" has a ""semblance of guilt"" for swinging clubs. ""I think we might need an alt-president right now,"" Kimmel said. He also played the clip of Mr. Trump describing ""very fine people on both sides."" ""If you're with a group of people and they're chanting things like, 'Jews will not replace us,' and you don't immediately leave that group, you are not a very fine person.""?

"Corey Lewandowski, who served as Donald Trump's first campaign manager in the 2016 race, threatened and intimidated his neighbors in Windham, New Hampshire, according to The Daily Beast. Last month, Lewandowski filed a $5 million lawsuit against his neighbors, Glenn and Irene Schwartz, claiming that they blocked access to one of his properties, the report said. The couple then filed a countersuit last week regarding the empty property, a campsite, which Lewandowski bought.? In 2015, the report said that Lewandowski offered his neighbors a ""land swap"" for the property as long as he'd have access to it. The neighbors, however, said that Lewandowski eventually made clear he planned to build a six-car garage on the property, the report says. The neighbors, meanwhile, were building a house and they had electricity lines run over the campsite property for it and the report says Lewandowski parked his pickup truck to block the power line, which cut off electricity to their construction site. ""On more than one occasion Lewandowski came out of his home carrying a baseball bat while Irene Schwartz was on her property seemingly as a threatening and intimidating gesture,"" the countersuit says, according to the report. Lewandowski also threatened to make his neighbors' life a ""nightmare."" ""This is a small town,"" Lewandowski allegedly yelled over the phone, the report said, threatening to ""shut down all building and work and make your life a nightmare with an expensive and extended lawsuit."" Last year, Lewandowski was charged with battery after grabbing the arm earlier in the month of then-Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields at a Trump press conference.

Scaramucci left the role after an explosive phone conversation with a New Yorker reporter in which he disparaged several other White House staffers. The move came at the behest of chief of staff Gen. John Kelly, who asked Mr. Trump to remove Scaramucci from his role, according to a New York Times report. Kelly wanted ""more structure, less Game of Thrones,"" a source close to the White House told CBS News.

"Last Updated Aug 16, 2017 8:51 AM EDT The violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, have prompted many Americans to question how we move forward as a nation. Civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ""Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do that."" Congressman John Lewis is one American who embodies that message of unity. On Tuesday night, Lewis said the violence in Charlottesville troubles him a great deal. He encouraged people to ""speak up, speak out"" and ""participate in the democratic process."" Decades before his service on Capitol Hill, he risked his life fighting for equal rights. Lewis reflects on his journey and his push to bring people together in our ongoing series, Note to Self. This piece originally aired June 29, 2017. Georgia Congressman John Lewis was born and raised on a cotton farm outside Troy, Alabama. He later became one of the most prominent leaders of the civil rights movement and was known as the godfather of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, fighting 15 years for its creation. In our ongoing series, ""Note to Self,"" he tells his younger self 每 ""so full of passion"" 每 about the 45 times he'll be arrested in his ""mission to help redeem the soul of America."" ""In 1956, when you were only 16 years old, you and some of your brothers and sisters and first cousins went down to the public library trying to get library cards, trying to check out some books, and you were told by the librarian that the library is for whites only, and not for coloreds,"" Lewis recalls. ""I say to you now, when you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have a moral obligation to continue to speak up, to speak out,"" he says. ? Lewis was so inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks that he got involved in the civil rights movement. ""Something touched you and suggested that you write a letter to Dr. King. You didn't tell your teachers, you didn't tell your mother and you father,"" Lewis says. King wrote him back and invited Lewis to Montgomery, Alabama. Meanwhile, Lewis was admitted to a school in Nashville, Tennessee, where he would get involved in the sit-ins. ""You'd be sitting there in an orderly, peaceful, non-violent fashion and someone would come up and spit on you, or put a cigarette out in your hair or down your back, pour hot water, hot coffee, hot chocolate on you,"" Lewis says. ""You got arrested the first time, and you felt so free. You felt liberated. You felt like you had crossed over,"" he added. ""The Boy from Troy,"" as King called Lewis, would go on to become the embodiment of non-violence in America. ""Two years after you speak at the March on Washington, you will see the face of death leading the march for voting across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. You were beaten on that bridge. You were left bloody. You thought you were going to die. But you will make it. You will live to see your mother and father cast their first votes,"" Lewis says. From a segregated nation, Lewis would go on to eventually see the country send an African-American president to the White House. ""Guess what, young John? By some divine providence, as if to send a message down through the ages, that man will be nominated on the 45th anniversary of the March on Washington,"" Lewis says. ""And all of those signs that you saw as a little child that said, 'White Men,' 'Colored Men,' 'White Women,' 'Colored Women' 每 those signs are gone. And the only places you will see those signs today would be in a book, in a museum, or a video."" Lewis was sad when he was denied a library card as a teenager, but he would go on to be elected to Congress and write a book called ""Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement."" The same library that rejected him would invite him back for a book signing 每 and present him with a library card. ""I believe as Dr. King and A. Philip Randolph and others taught you, that we're one people and it doesn't matter whether we're black, or white, Latino, Asian-American or Native American. That maybe our foremothers and our forefathers all came here in different ships, but we're all in the same boat now,"" Lewis says. ""John, you understood the words of Dr. King when he said we must learn to live together as brothers and sisters, if not we will perish as fools,"" he says.

"WASHINGTON -- An internet company is fighting what it says is a ""sweeping"" request for information about an anti-Trump website that prosecutors allege was behind destructive Inauguration Day protests here. The company says the government is seeking information about 1.3 million visitors to the site, among other information. Approximately 230 protesters were arrested, most on felony rioting charges, on Inauguration Day after some protesters threw objects at people and businesses, destroying storefronts and damaging vehicles, CBSNews.com partner website CNET.com reports. The arrests took place in a four-block stretch of downtown Washington around the time of Mr. Trump's swearing-in ceremony. Prosecutors say the website disruptj20.org was used in the ""development, planning, advertisement, and organization of a violent riot,"" and they obtained a search warrant in July ordering the company that hosted the website, DreamHost, to turn over information. But California-based DreamHost says the warrant violates the Constitution and a federal privacy law. The company said in a blog post Monday that it's being asked to turn over IP addresses of those who visited the site plus ""contact information, email content and photos of thousands of people."" The company said that ""information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the Constitution's First Amendment."" ""That should be enough to set alarm bells off in anyone's mind,"" the post says. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment beyond what had been filed in court. A court filing by prosecutors says the search warrant was ""properly issued."" A hearing in Superior Court in Washington was scheduled for Friday, but has been postponed. It was revealed in March that prosecutors were?trying to pull data from 100 locked phones seized during arrests made in Washington on Inauguration Day, according to CNET. Officials said they have search warrants to extract data from the phones.? Mark Rumold, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group supporting DreamHost, says such sweeping seizures are usually reserved for investigations of websites devoted to criminal activity like child pornography. ""Here, the concerns are exacerbated because we're dealing with core, protected First Amendment activities,"" he said.

"The statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, was the focus of an emotional debate in the state's Republican primary election weeks before it became a flashpoint in the nation's struggle over race. Corey Stewart, an outsider candidate for governor sometimes compared to President Donald Trump, seized on possible removal of the Confederate general's memorial as an ""attempt to destroy traditional America."" Stewart, who said in an interview Tuesday that such an action ""hits people in the gut,"" found unexpectedly strong support, forced his main opponent to defend the statue and almost won. Now the fight over ""traditional America"" is throwing a spotlight on the Republican Party's struggle with race in the age of Trump. The deadly white supremacist rally against removal of the Lee statue served as a painful example of the uncomfortable alignment between some in the party's base and the far-right fringe. But despite the party's talk of inclusiveness and minority outreach, it's clear white fears continue to resonate with many in the GOP base. Politicians willing to exploit those issues are often rewarded with support. One big beneficiary, critics say, has been the president himself. A crowd of protesters in Charlottesville confronted a man holding a confederate flag on Tuesday at the site of the Robert E. Lee statue where white supremacists rallied last weekend. For those critics, on both the left and right, Mr.?Trump's response to Charlottesville was a glaring example. On Saturday, he denounced hatred and violence on ""many sides,"" seeming to assign blame equally to counter-demonstrators as well as hate groups protesting the proposed removal of the statue. He waited until Monday to specifically name the groups he was condemning -- the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists. On Tuesday, he was back to assigning partial blame to those protesting the white supremacists. ""I think there's blame on both sides,"" Mr. Trump charged in a fiery Trump Tower press conference. He added, ""There are two sides to a story."" ""Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch,"" Mr. Trump continued. ""Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee."" For Republicans who hoped the president might use the moment to send a new message about racism and their party, Mr. Trump failed the test. ""We have reached a defining moment,"" New Hampshire GOP chair Jennifer Horn said. ""We, as Republicans, every single one of us, needs to speak up and make it very clear that this is not our party, these are not our values."" Such moments have the potential to undermine years of attempts to portray the party as more welcoming to minority voters. The Republican National Committee, led by Mr. Trump's former chief of staff Reince Priebus, released an exhaustive report in 2013 noting that the GOP's traditional base of older, white voters was becoming a smaller and smaller portion of the electorate in America. ""If we want ethnic minority voters to support Republicans, we have to engage them and show our sincerity,"" the RNC wrote. Yet Republican officeholders, including the president, have found success by seizing on semi-hidden ""dog whistle"" rhetoric and policies largely designed to appeal to whites. -- Across the Midwest, Mr. Trump and others have appealed to suburban white voters by decrying a rise in urban violence, even as statistics show violent crime is down in many cities. -- With no evidence of widespread voter fraud, Republicans nationwide have promoted voter ID laws that several courts determined discriminate against minority voters. -- Mr. Trump's promise to build a massive wall along the southern border resonates with conservatives across the West and even in overwhelmingly white Northeastern states where Republicans fear the influx of illegal Hispanic immigrants. -- And, particularly in the South, some conservatives continue fight to preserve symbols of a Confederate Army that fought for Southern states' rights to continue slavery. The relics are simultaneously denounced as symbols of oppression by most blacks and celebrated as marks of Southern pride by many whites. This week in Alabama, three Republicans running in Tuesday's special U.S. Senate primary demonstrated the careful tiptoeing politicians do around the subject. Rep. Mo Brooks generally bemoaned ""bigotry."" Former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore rejected ""violence and hatred."" Sen. Luther Strange, appointed to the seat when Mr. Trump tapped Jeff Sessions as attorney general, made no reference to racial motivations at all. Brooks and Strange also expressed support for Mr. Trump's remarks, and Strange seemed to echo the president's assertion that ""many sides"" were at fault, as he encouraged ""Americans to stand together in opposition to those who encourage hate or promote violence."" Mr. Trump recently endorsed Strange. The careful language reflects a political reality in a state where nearly all Republican votes come from white voters, says David Mowery, an Alabama-based political consultant who has worked for Republicans and Democrats. That doesn't mean Republicans actively pursue racist votes, he said, but sometimes it means they take the most cautious path to avoid controversy. ""I don't think here that any Republican benefits by talking about it or is necessarily hurt by not talking about it,"" he said. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, now Mr. Trump's representative to the United Nations, said as recently as 2014 that the Confederate battle flag should fly at the state Capitol. She changed course two summers ago only after a white supremacist who was photographed holding a Confederate flag murdered nine black people inside a South Carolina church. About the same time, then-Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama removed Confederate banners from a Confederate monument outside his office, though the monument remains. In this year's Virginia primary for the Republicans' candidate for governor, outsider Stewart lost to establishment favorite Ed Gillespie, but by less than 2 percentage points. On Sunday, Gillespie attended church in Charlottesville and minced no words in naming names and urging those responsible for the violence to take their ""vile hatred"" out of the state. ""We have stared down racism and Nazism and white supremacy before, and we will stare it down again,"" the Republican candidate for governor told a local TV station. His campaign later added that Gillespie continues to oppose removal of confederate statues, but ""believes it is an issue best resolved at the local level."" Stewart is now running for the Senate in 2018.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 16, 2017 6:58 AM EDT Cities and states accelerated their plans to remove Confederate monuments from public property Tuesday as the violence over a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, moved leaders across the country to plan to wipe away much of the remaining Old South imagery. CBS Baltimote reports city crews began removing Confederate monuments around the city overnight Wednesday. A Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson monument was removed with a crowd watching. A monument to former Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, author of the infamous Dred Scott ruling in 1857 affirming slavery, also came down. And crews removed a monument to Confederate women. The Baltimore City Council passed a resolution Monday calling for the immediate deconstruction of the monuments. In Birmingham, Alabama, workers covered the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors monument late Tuesday night, reports the CBS affiliate there, WIAT-TV. Mayor William Bell ordered the move to give the city time to explore the legality of removing it. Leaders of a New York Episcopal diocese say they'll remove two plaques honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a church property in Brooklyn. Bishop Lawrence Provenzano, leader of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, told Newsday on Tuesday that two plaques marking a maple tree outside St. John's Episcopal Church will be removed Wednesday. The United Daughters of the Confederacy markers commemorate the spot where the Virginia-born Lee is said to have planted a tree while serving in the U.S. Army at Fort Hamilton in the 1840s. Two decades later he became commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. In Gainesville, Florida, on Tuesday, the Daughters of the Confederacy removed a statue of a Confederate soldier known as ""Ole Joe,"" and in Durham, North Carolina, protesters used a rope Monday night to pull down a Confederate monument dedicated in 1924. The anti-Confederate momentum seemed to ensure that other memorials would come down soon. Many other local and state governments announced that they would remove statues and other imagery from public land, or consider doing so, in the aftermath of Saturday's white nationalist rally that killed one person and injured dozens more. The changes were publicized as President Trump defended Confederate statues in wide-ranging remarks. ""This week it's Robert E. Lee. I notice that Stonewall Jackson's coming down,"" Mr. Trump said during a visit to Trump Tower in New York. ""I wonder, is it George Washington next week, and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?"" Asked specifically whether Charlottesville's Lee statue should come down, he said: ""I would say that's up to a local town, community or the federal government, depending on where it is located."" All around the country, Republican and Democratic officials at the state and local levels moved swiftly to begin a process to remove the statues. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he would ask the Legislature to reverse a 2015 law signed by his Republican predecessor, Pat McCrory, that prevents the removal or relocation of monuments, and to defeat a measure giving immunity to motorists who strike protesters. He also planned to ask state officials to determine the cost of moving Confederate statues and to give him options of where they could go. ""Our Civil War history is important, but it belongs in textbooks and museums?- not a place of allegiance on our Capitol grounds,"" Cooper said in a statement. In Maryland, GOP Gov.? Larry Hogan said Tuesday he would push to remove the statue of Taney from state land. ""While we cannot hide from our history, nor should we, the time has come to make clear the difference between properly acknowledging our past and glorifying the darkest chapters of our history,"" said Hogan, who before had resisted calls to move the statue. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings announced plans Tuesday to ask his city council to appoint a task force to study the fate of the city's Confederate statues. Rawlings said he personally finds the monuments to be ""dangerous totems,"" but a task force would ensure a productive conversation. Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, called on state officials Monday to remove a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate cavalry general and an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan, from the Tennessee Capitol. Protesters earlier draped a black jacket over the head of the bust while cheering, ""Tear it down!"" Similar plans were being made in San Antonio, as well as Lexington, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; and elsewhere. In Durham, Sheriff Mike Andrews said protesters who toppled a nearly century-old Confederate statue in front of a North Carolina government building would face felony charges. The Confederate Soldiers Monument, dedicated in 1924, stood in front of an old courthouse that how houses local government offices. The crumpled and dented bronze figure has been taken to a warehouse for storage. Deputies later arrested Takiyah Thompson, who identified herself Tuesday as the woman who tied the rope that was used to tear it down. She said her actions were justified because Confederate statues represent white supremacy. A law professor and director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University in San Antonio called removal a ""slippery slope,"" saying judging historical figures through a modern lens can be difficult. ""A healthy democracy and people within that democracy should be able to say, 'This is our history.' And history is made up of actions of human beings, and human beings aren't perfect,"" said Jeffrey F. Addicott, who stressed he was speaking for himself and not the law school. Statues, he added, can be moved, but he's opposed to them being ""put in a warehouse never to be seen again because then you're kind of erasing or rewriting history."" The Sons of Confederate Veterans condemned attempts to take down Confederate statues around the country. ""These statues were erected over 100 year ago to honor the history of the United States,"" added Thomas V. Strain Jr., the group's commander in chief. ""They're just as important to the entire history of the U.S. as the monuments erected to our forefathers."" Strain, who said his group did not participate in Charlottesville, condemned the Klan, white nationalist groups, neo-Nazis and other extremists. ""It's painful to watch for lack of better words,"" he said. ""It was our family that fought, and it was our families that died, and now we have these knuckleheads hijacking the flag for their own purposes."" But city and state officials said Charlottesville convinced them it's time to move on from having Confederate imagery in prominent public places. In Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray moved up his announcement by a day in reaction to the Charlottesville bloodshed. Memorials to John C. Breckinridge and John Hunt Morgan are perched outside a former courthouse that was the site of slave auctions before the Civil War. ""This is the right time,"" Gray said Monday. ""We accelerated that because of the events in Charlottesville, but I knew that it was the right thing to do.""

"President Trump, days after entering office, signed an executive order to hire 15,000 new border security agents and immigration officers, in step with his campaign platform that was tough on illegal immigration. Now, more than six months into his tenure, that plan to add 5,000 more border patrol agents at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and 10,000 more immigration officers at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) isn't looking so simple.? The Office of Personnel Management has given a two-year window to move forward with the hiring surge, but immigration and border experts -- including the Department of Homeland Security's own watchdog -- note the logistical challenges of hiring that many new employees, and question whether they're necessary in the first place. A late July DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) report was the latest blow to the president's plan. ""Neither CBP nor ICE could provide complete data to support the operational need or deployment strategies for the additional 15,000 additional agents and officers they were directed to hire,"" the report found. Moreover, CBP and ICE don't know how many additional personnel they need, and it will be three or four years before those agencies will complete calculating those figures. Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at the Baker Institute at Rice University, said the number of new hires the Trump administration suggested seems like an ""arbitrary number."" ""So what is the optimum number for the border patrol?"" Payan said. ""We don't really have a baseline right now. I think saying that we need 25 percent more, or we need to double ICE, at this point in time it sounds to me more like ... sort of an arbitrary number."" The administration's intent to hire thousands more border agents and immigration officers faces serious logistical issues as well. To even find 5,000 qualified applicants at CBP, the agency would need an applicant pool of 750,000 people, according to the OIG report. To find 10,000 qualified immigration officers at ICE, the agency would need more than half a million people to apply. Even if that many people applied, which would be about as many applicants as there are residents of Dallas, human resources staffers in those agencies would have a hard time vetting them all. DHS' human resources servicing ratio is the lowest of any large federal agency, the OIG report pointed out, at one HR employee for every 148 employees. The OIG found DHS would need to hire hundreds more human resources staffers.? ""Although DHS has established plans and initiated actions to begin an aggressive hiring surge, in recent years the department and its components have encountered notable difficulties related to long hire times, proper allocation of staff, and the supply of human resources,"" the report said. Donald Trump is refocusing on his campaign promise to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico. CBS News asked U.S. Customs and Border Patrol off... CBP experienced a hiring surge under former President George W. Bush and former President Barack Obama, roughly doubling the size of its workforce from 10,000 to 20,000 in a relatively short period of time. Occasionally, crucial steps in the hiring process -- like complete background checks -- were skipped.? The challenges don't end once those new border agents and immigration officers are hired, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.? ""Hiring another 5,000 agents will put another strain on an agency that's struggled to maintain professionalism and professional standards,"" Wilson said. The pro-immigration American Immigration Council, for instance, released a reporter earlier this month from a request under the Freedom of Information Act showing the CBP took no action against border patrol agents in 96 percent of 2,179 cases of alleged misconduct filed between 2012 and 2015.? If a vast percentage of an agency's workers have no experience handling the difficult and sometimes emotionally charged situations they encounter, that leads to mistakes, Payan said. New officers are ""not well seasoned,"" Payan said. It takes time for immigration officers to respond quickly and swiftly but without overreacting. ""That kind of experience takes a very long time,"" Payan said. ""And when you have a law enforcement agency that doesn't allow for that kind of maturity to take place, you see mistakes."" President Trump is backing a Republican plan to cut legal immigration in half. He faces strong opposition over the most significant change to our... CBP did not respond with a request for comment on the hiring progress made since Mr. Trump took office. ICE did not have figures on its current staffing levels or number of people hired since January readily available, but said it is making progress in the hiring process. ""U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is working on implementing a plan to hire the additional 10,000 employees mandated in the executive order,"" Dani Bennett, an ICE spokesman, told CBS News. ""Those hired pursuant to the president's direction under the executive order will focus on both civil and criminal immigration enforcement, including the smuggling of people and other contraband by transnational criminal organizations. Additional personnel will also be hired to carry out support functions of the executive order."" Bennett added that, ""ICE will not lower its standards to achieving hiring goals,"" and uses a ""competitive"" hiring process to vet applicants.? DHS currently has an acting head, Elaine Duke, since Mr. Trump selected former DHS head John Kelly to be his chief of staff at the White House.? Increasing the number of immigration enforcers leaves other backlogs in the immigration system unaddressed, Wilson and Payan said. In recent years, a growing number of people crossing the border are turning themselves in and requesting asylum, instead of hiding from immigration officials. That requires a different kind of approach to immigration, they said. The Trump administration's strategy of beefing up immigration personnel is also leaving out one major component -- the country's immigration courts, which are experiencing historic backlogs. With the nation's approximately 250 immigration court judges overwhelmed by about 575,000 pending immigration cases, the United States' immigration courts are increasingly backlogged, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. The average case has already been pending for 667 days, or nearly two years. Hiring more ICE officers could simply accelerate the number of pending immigration court cases, with no additional judges to handle them, Wilson and Payan said. ""ICE is actually engaged in a kind of strange case where they're also adding to the load of the immigration courts than the courts can actually process the cases, because they're actually being very effective,"" Payan said.?

"Last Updated Aug 16, 2017 7:42 AM EDT The White House sent a memo of talking points to Republicans on Capitol Hill and other allies telling them to say President Trump was ""entirely correct"" in his controversial assessment of the violence in Charlottesville, CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett reports. CBS News obtained a copy of the memo, which has the subject line ""President's Presser."" ""Despite the criticism, the President reaffirmed some of our most important Founding principles: We are equal in the eyes of our Creator, equal under the law, and equal under our Constitution,"" reads one bullet point.? Although the press conference was scheduled to discuss American infrastructure, the president mainly spoke about the violence in Charlottesville, insisting ""both sides"" were responsible for the violence, and citing the ""alt-left,"" who he said came ""charging with clubs in their hands."" Other bullet points the White House wants discussed:? At least prominent Republican, U.S. Sen. John McCain, didn't repeat the talking points outlined in the memo. McCain tweeted late Tuesday ""there's no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate & bigotry. The President of the United States should say so."" There's no moral equivalency between racists & Americans standing up to defy hate& bigotry. The President of the United States should say so Mr. Trump was asked at his Tuesday news conference about McCain's earlier comments that Mr. Trump should defend his National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster, against attacks by the alt-right. Mr. Trump said ""you mean Sen. McCain who voted against us getting good healthcare?"" The reporter pressed on, saying McCain says the ""alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those who perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville."" After widespread denouncement from both sides of the aisle, President Trump once again equivocated white supremacists and counter-protesters in C... ""Well, I don't know,"" Mr. Trump responded. ""I can't tell you. I'm sure Sen. McCain must know what he's talking about. But when you say the alt-right, define alt-right to me. You define it. Go ahead."" Mr. Trump then spun off, describing the ""alt-left."" Mr. Trump had been criticized Saturday by Democrats and Republicans alike for his response to the violence in Charlottesville, which left one person dead when a white nationalist allegedly rammed his car into a group of counter-protesters. The president said at the time many sides were at fault.?Many prominent Republicans, including Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, had called on Mr. Trump to condemn the rally as domestic terrorism. On Monday, the president ?did specifically decry white supremacists, but then re-lit the firestorm with his Tuesday remarks.

"Last Updated Aug 16, 2017 2:44 AM EDT SALT LAKE CITY -- The mayor of the Mormon stronghold of Provo won a three-way Republican primary Tuesday in the race to replace former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, putting him on track to clinch the congressional seat in the general election in the overwhelming GOP district. John Curtis pulled off the win despite being dogged by attack ads from deep-pocketed outside groups in a race whose three candidates were emblematic of the divisions roiling the GOP under President Trump. Curtis is a former Democrat who was the most moderate of the Republican candidates running in Utah's 3rd Congressional District, which Chaffetz represented until he abruptly resigned in June, citing a desire to spend more time with family. Moderate Utah Republicans including Gov. Gary Herbert backed Curtis, the only one of the three Republican candidates who didn't vote for Trump. As supporters erupted into loud cheers at his Provo election night party, Curtis said in a phone interview with The Associated Press that his victory showed that voters like what he's accomplished as mayor and want to see him do the same in Washington. He said it also proved that his campaign strategy worked. ""It was Utah-based, Utah-principled, Utah-endorsed. That's what they want,"" Curtis said. ""They didn't like the negativity."" Curtis defeated Chris Herrod, a former state lawmaker known for strict immigration positions, and Tanner Ainge, a business consultant, first-time candidate and son of Boston Celtics president Danny Ainge. They split support during the campaign from more conservative Republicans. Curtis had captured about 41 percent of the vote while Herrod and Ainge split the rest, according to unofficial results Tuesday. Ainge conceded but Herrod held out hope based on tens of thousands of ballots not yet counted in the county with the most voters. ""We had very good internal polls and so, we're not quite ready to get there,"" Herrod said. Ainge said Curtis is the type of voice needed in the district. ""I'm glad that we have someone who's been successful in the business world like John, who knows how to balance a budget and understands the entrepreneurial spirit of this district, who will represent us,"" Ainge said. Utah's special election is one of seven this year to fill vacancies in the U.S. House and Senate, five of which opened up when elected officials took posts in Trump's administration. Voters in Alabama were also voting Tuesday in primaries to select party nominees for the U.S. Senate seat that previously belonged to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Chaffetz, a five-term Republican, carved out a reputation for using the House Oversight committee he chaired to run aggressive investigations of Hillary Clinton before the 2016 presidential elections. He's since taken a role as a Fox News commentator and announced he will be one of six visiting fellows at Harvard University this fall. His departure opened up a congressional seat in a district where Republicans outnumber Democrats 5-to-1 in an area that stretches from the Salt Lake City suburbs and several ski towns southeast to Provo and Utah coal country. Out-of-state organizations and political action committees have spent about $900,000 in Utah's race - on top of about $600,000 in campaign contributions collected by the three Republicans running for Utah's 3rd Congressional District. Outside spending of that magnitude is generally only seen in heavily Republican Utah when Democrats and Republicans face off in an occasional close race. Curtis, 57, the target of most of the out-of-state attack ads, faced suspicion and criticism from some Republicans for his 2000 run as a Democrat for the state Legislature and his time leading a county Democratic party. He said he now identifies as a conservative Republican and notes that Ronald Reagan, Trump and Chaffetz were all Democrats at one point. ""I've got a message to those PACs in Washington, D.C. and those special interests: This is my town, this is my district. Go home. You wasted your money,"" Curtis said in a victory speech in Provo. Curtis has served eight years as the mayor of Provo, where he helped negotiate a deal for Google to take over the city's troubled fiber-optic system and instead give the city of about 117,000 people the company's high-speed Google Fiber internet service, including free basic internet for all residents. Ada Wilson, a 59-year-old Republican homemaker from Orem, said Curtis' stint across the aisle was one of the reasons she voted for him.

"Last Updated Aug 16, 2017 6:37 AM EDT The Republican race for Alabama's Senate seat is headed for a runoff as neither former state Supreme Court justice Roy Moore or Sen. Luther Strange managed to get 50 percent of the vote, despite Strange's endorsement from President Trump. The runoff will be held on Sept. 26. Strange was appointed earlier this year to Attorney General Jeff Session's former seat, but his appointment has been clouded in some controversy since Gov. Robert Bentley resigned soon appointing him. At the time, Strange had been the attorney general investigating Bentley relationship with a former aide. Both men deny any wrongdoing. Moore was kicked off the bench last year after being found to have encouraged probate judges to deny marriage licenses. ?A disciplinary court had removed him from the bench in 2003 for refusing to remove a 10 Commandments statue from the state judicial building, although voters re-instated him as chief justice. Strange and Moore faced off against U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, a member of the House Freedom Caucus from northern Alabama. Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney, won the Democratic nomination over Robert Kennedy Jr., a businessman with no relation for famous powerhouse Kennedy family. The top Republican contenders were Strange; Rep. Mo Brooks, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus; and Roy Moore, a strongly religious former justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama. Moore was leading in polls leading up to the special election. The Republican and Democratic victors will face off on in a general election December 12. But most of the focus in the race has been on the Republican candidates. Alabama, a deeply Republican state, hasn't had a Democratic senator since 1996. Mr. Trump took to Twitter leading up to the election to voice his support for Strange, and recorded a robocall for him. Big day in Alabama. Vote for Luther Strange, he will be great! Senator Luther Strange, who is doing a great job for the people of Alabama, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:15. Tough on crime, borders etc. Luther Strange of the Great State of Alabama has my endorsement. He is strong on Border & Wall, the military, tax cuts & law enforcement. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted about Tuesday's results: Congratulation to Roy Moore and Luther Strange for being the final two and heading into a September runoff in Alabama. Exciting race! Mr. Trump is popular in Alabama. According to Gallup, Mr. Trump has averaged a 55 percent approval rating in that state during his first six months in office.

"Dr. Calvin Butts, president of the State University of New York at Old Westbury and pastor of New York's Abyssinian Baptist Church, spoke with CBS News' Anthony Mason about his reaction to President Trump's comments blaming ""both sides"" for weekend violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. ANTHONY MASON: The president said yesterday that racism is evil. Have his remarks today effectively undercut that? DR. CALVIN BUTTS: I think so. Everyone believes that he's trying to avoid identifying the hatred and the level of vitriol in the country today. And his statements today in terms of trying to spread the blame, so to speak, did not really ensure Americans, most of them -- and I would encourage the president to pay attention to the polls -- that we should not be living in fear. Everyone is afraid today. Dr. Calvin Butts MASON: Is it possible to keep the country united with this kind of rhetoric? BUTTS: No, and that's the problem. Coming from the bully pulpit of the White House, you have to speak to the sensibilities of this nation. We're not going to fight the Civil War again, and we're not going to stand for the kind of hatred that we see tearing this country apart. And the president needs to tone it down. He needs to demonstrate that he can lead this nation. It's a difficult job, but we are a good people, and we've come a long way, and we cannot let a man like him take us back. MASON: What is ""a man like him?"" What do you mean? BUTTS: Someone who is a bully. Someone who does not listen to the deep reservoir of intelligence of the men and women of the United States government. MASON: If you could say something directly to the president today, or have him say something, what would that be? BUTTS: It would be that there is domestic terrorism in the United States of America, and the president of the United States does not tolerate it, and say it from his heart. I think he needs to sit back and take a look at, what is America, truly, today? And it is a diverse nation that's, one, E Pluribus Unum. I wonder if he knows what that means. Out of many, one. And he's segregating the population with this rhetoric.																																																																																																																					"
"WASHINGTON -- President Trump blamed ""both sides"" for the weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Tuesday while taking questions from reporters. ""I watched this very closely, much more closely than you people watched it and you have, you had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now. You had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent,"" Mr. Trump said. CBS News reporter Paula Reid was on the ground in Charlottesville during the demonstrations, and told anchor Anthony Mason that she has a different view of what happened. John Dickerson, CBS News chief Washington correspondent and anchor of ""Face the Nation,"" weighs in on President Trump's Tuesday remarks on the we... ""Pretty much every white supremacist demonstrator they saw had some sort of weapon, either a helmet, a shield, a firearm, a baton. As for the counter-protesters, I would say most of them were unarmed. Many of them were members of the clergy or they were students,"" Reid said on the ""CBS Evening News."" ""Now, there were certainly some people who were there as counter-demonstrators who were there to cause trouble, but overwhelmingly, the counter-protesters were unarmed,"" she continued. Reid also noted that the counter-demonstrators were the only ones she saw providing medical aid to people who were hit with chemical agents. According to Reid, it was also clear that most of the objects being thrown into the crowd of counter-demonstrators were coming from the park containing Robert E. Lee's statue, which the white supremacists had been holding throughout the day. Violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""It was clear that for every one counter-demonstrater flag you could see, there were 10 Confederate, or white supremacist flags,"" Reid said. While the protests had been scheduled to start Saturday, they actually began on Friday night, which almost helped to embolden them, Reid said. ""They got to the rally several hours early and were already pretty ramped up,"" Reid said. Also on the ""CBS Evening News,"" John Dickerson, CBS News chief Washington correspondent and ""Face the Nation"" moderator?said he felt that Mr. Trump's comments were more about assigning blame to those on the left than showing a ""moral disgust"" to the neo-Nazi demonstrators. That, Dickerson said, ""repeated and made worse his moral failure from Saturday."" ""Presidents are supposed to rush into these moments and unify Americans,"" Dickerson said. ""But the president, by bringing that statement and continuing to try to defend himself, was continuing an argument and saying both sides were to blame. He wanted to make sure he was right about the details, but then when he characterized the protesters, he totally overlooked the Nazi slogans and flags and salutes."" Moving forward, Dickerson said that Mr. Trump's comments will likely do him political harm. ""The president won office and was heralded by many of his supporters by speaking bluntly, by speak truths, by not bothering with the niceties, so his reluctance to do that here, to speak the essential truth about the neo-Nazi protesters who were chanting those Nazi slogans, that is a failing that he has now repeated twice,"" Dickerson said. Mr. Trump had a moment like this during the primaries that rattled Republican leaders, Dickerson said, and now ""Republican leaders will now have to distance themselves from the president, and the question is how they get back together again.""

"Last Updated Aug 15, 2017 11:07 PM EDT President Trump on Tuesday said ""there is another side"" to the violence in Charlottesville, specifically calling out the ""alt-left."" ""What about the alt-left that came charging at, what you say, the alt-right?"" Mr. Trump asked. ""Do they have any semblence of guilt? What about the fact they charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs, do they have any problem? I think they do."" What is the ""alt-left""? Let's start with the basics.? It's the group Mr. Trump is partly blaming for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend. Except it's not really a group, and more of just an epithet that's gained currency in some conservative and liberal circles to describe leftists, particularly ""Antifa"" groups that sometimes skirmish with right-wing demonstrators. The term ""alt-right"" was coined by the white supremacist Richard Spencer, who used it to describe people like himself. The alt-right is a loosely defined movement that rejects traditional conservatism and typically embraces a white supremacist viewpoint. It is usually used to encompass far-right activists who reject the idea of racial egalitarianism and equality of the sexes. Some alt-right adherents, such as Spencer, also hope for the dissolution of the United States and the creation of an ""ethnostate"" for non-Jewish people of European heritage. Mr. Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon once said that the news website he used to run, Breitbart, was ""the platform for the alt-right."" But that was before internal disagreements within the alt-right created what some adherents call the ""alt-light,"" which is less extreme in its views and tends to distance itself from the outright white supremacy of people like Spencer and David Duke, a former KKK leader. Both Spencer and Duke were present at the Charlottesville protests.? The alt-left, meanwhile, is a purely pejorative description. Few, if any, people on the left claim to be part of anything called the alt-left, as the term was created in an attempt to demean leftists and imply they are morally equivalent to the alt-right. It grew out of the conservative media. In particular, Fox News host Sean Hannity, an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump, frequently references the alt-left on Twitter. Alt left distorts meaning of my tweet in 2013. https://t.co/Cjmcof8xeD The point was clear--he is arrogant, lazy, & his threats meaningless The Alt Left Propaganda media will run with every leak to help distract from Obamas & Co's role in spying on @POTUS @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/fDbnwE3GYQ No anger. MSM alt left media is lazy, biased and overpaid. And they lie. Fact! https://t.co/xFXr7dIMT8 In a November appearance on Hannity's show, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci said the alt-left think Trump voters ""are misogynists and misanthropes and negative people."" After widespread denouncement from both sides of the aisle, President Trump once again equivocated white supremacists and counter-protesters in C... But conservatives aren't the only ones talking about the alt-left. Some liberal commentators have employed the term as well when writing about left-wing activists and politicians. For example, an April article in New York magazine identified Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, French politician Jean-Luc Melenchon,, and British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as ""evidence of an active contemporary 'alt-left.'"" Liberals and conservatives tend to use ""alt-left"" somewhat differently, however. Hannity will often use the term to describe mainstream liberals, while liberals sometimes use it to describe socialists, social democrats, and other far-left groups. The people who arrived to protest white supremacists at the rally were mostly clergy, students, and residents of Charlottesville, according to CBS News' Paula Reid. And the vast majority of them were unarmed, despite Mr. Trump's claims to the contrary. While there were some Antifa protesters with batons, but they were vastly outnumbered by armed white supremacists. The white supremacists committed the worst acts of violence at the rally, including one who appeared to deliberately plow into counter-protesters with a car, killing one woman.?

The #WhiteSupremacy groups will see being assigned only 50% of blame as a win.We can not allow this old evil to be resurrected 6/6 This is simple: we must condemn and marginalize white supremacist groups, not encourage and embolden them. It＊s a sad day in American history when the President of the United States defends white supremacists. Mr. President, for the good of the country, stop defending the actions of white supremacists in #Charlottesville.

Yes, @POTUS, there's 2 sides to Charlottesville. 1 is right & 1 is wrong. 1 is full of hate & 1 stands up to hate. You're on the wrong side.

No one, especially not the leader of the free world, should ever tolerate violent racists. Did you really just compare neo-Nazis & white supremacists to the other side? @realDonaldTrump, there is one evil side here. By saying he is not taking sides, Donald Trump clearly is. When David Duke and white supremacists cheer, you＊re doing it very very wrong. There is only one side. White supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazis, & hate groups have no place in our country. The President needs to say that. Off prompter and in his own words, the president gives comfort to white supremacists and neo-Nazis. Absolutely horrifying. All Americans can & must shape the course of history, consistent with the time-honored values of justice, equality, liberty & tolerance. Donald Trump is not the real America. All Americans should condemn these disgusting, indefensible comments. Let us unite. There aren't ""2 sides"" when it comes to hate. Only right & wrong. It's shameful that @RealDonaldTrump can't find the courage to say it. The violence in Charlottesville was not caused by the ""alt-left,"" (whatever that may be). It was caused by Neo-Nazis and white supremacists. The response to this ideology of hate & bigotry, & the act of domestic terrorism, should be simple & united condemnation without ambiguity.

"Two White House officials, including one former official, say that there is ""great concern"" regarding the level of threats being made against U.S. officials who serve on the Trump Administration's National Security Council, CBS News' Margaret Brennan reports.? A White House official told CBS News that it is ""disheartening"" to see the?uptick in verbal and online attacks on members who come from security-focused backgrounds, not political ones.? The unusual scrutiny has targeted individuals who are serving one to two year terms on loan from the Departments of Justice, Defense, State or other agencies. In past administrations, individuals in these positions often flew under the radar. There has been a noticeable uptick in threats for those who currently report to National Security Adviser General H.R. McMaster. ""McMaster is used to facing real bullets so verbal ones are not going to impact him,"" a White House official said in regard to a sustained online campaign against him. The official noted that a statement of support yesterday for McMaster from Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, was very much appreciated. On Monday, McCain publicly called on President Trump to defend McMaster against similar virulent and personal attacks that originated from what he described as the same alt-right groups who precipitated the Charlottesville attack. A White House official told CBS News that it takes security seriously and said there are measures in place if individuals feel personally threatened.? Sources claim that Steve Bannon's White House job is in jeopardy. Josh Gerstein, senior White House reporter for Politico, joins CBSN to discuss ... The pressure also may come from within the Trump administration. It is no secret that there is tension between McMaster and Mr. Trump's Chief Strategist Steve Bannon as the two often disagree on policy matters. Trump allies outside the administration, including the recently departed communications director Anthony Scaramucci, have made clear that they also suspect Bannon of leaking damaging information to news sites. ?Bannon once described Breitbart, the site he previously ran, as a platform for the ""alt-right"" movement. A third U.S. official told CBS News that the president's own public disparagement of the intelligence community had also made those working for the agencies think twice before being recruited to work directly in the Trump White House. A White House spokesman told CBS News that the NSC continues to attract the best and the brightest career professionals from across U.S. agencies. In July, Foreign Policy reported that online threats of violence and targeted attacks by right-wing blogger Mike Cernovich contributed to a recent departure of an assistant to McMaster.

"If President Trump decides to end an Obamacare insurance subsidy, premiums would go up 20 percent next year and some people would have no insurers in the nongroup market, according to a report published Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office. The nonpartisan budget scorekeeper analyzed the repercussions of what would happen if Mr. Trump decides to cut off cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments. These payments are made to health insurers to help low-income people enrolled under the health care law with out-of-pocket expenses. Under that scenario, the federal deficit would grow by $194 billion over the next decade, the report estimates. It said that total federal subsidies would increase because more people would receive subsidies and the average amount of the subsidy per person would be greater. The CBO estimates that ending payments to insurance companies would swell the deficit by $7 billion this fiscal year, and increase thereafter. While premiums would increase by an average of 20 percent for silver plans next year, they will be 25 percent higher by 2020. The president has repeatedly said he might end the payments, which are currently slated to cost the government $7 billion during this fiscal year and $10 billion in 2018. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters last week that he'd consider a bipartisan effort to continue the payments. He said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, is working on ""some kind of bipartisan approach"" that would involve subsidies for insurance companies. CBS News' Emily Tillett contributed to this report.																																																																																																																					"

""We assess lone actors and small cells within the white supremacist extremist (WSE) movement likely will continue to pose a threat of lethal violence over the next year,"" the report read.? The findings were based on reviews of lethal and potentially lethal incidents of extremist violence from 2000 to 2016. The report's release comes after President Trump came under fire for blaming ""both sides"" for the violence in Charlottesville. On Monday, Mr. Trump?formally denounced hate groups following the clashes.? The perpetrators of violence in 2016, the report found, included members of racist skinhead groups, Klan members and ""individuals who lacked group affiliations."" The report also noted that white supremacists targeted racial or religious minorities including Hispanics, African-Americans, a Chinese student and one person ""perceived to be Jewish"" in 2016.? Victims in white supremacist extremist attacks from 2000-2016 ""Adherents of the WSE movement view these persons as legitimate targets, as they pose a threat to, or reflect poorly on, the white race. Other targets have included persons or facilities associated with government and law enforcement,"" the report added.? The intelligence report found white supremacists were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016, more than any other domestic extremist movement during that time period. It concluded in their overall assessment that ""violence over the next year very likely will derive from the capabilities of lone offenders or small cells, rather the resources of larger groups"" due to the white supremacist movements' lack of clear organization or direction. Similar to the weekend's violent events, which evolved from a white supremacist rally into a car attack against counter-protesters, the report noted that future violence would likely continue to be ""spontaneous and involve targets of opportunity.""

"President Trump deleted two retweets Tuesday morning, including one that showed the logo of CNN being hit by a train, following blowback on social media.

""Nothing can stop the #TrumpTrain!!"" said a message accompanying the image. Nothing can stop the #TrumpTrain pic.twitter.com/3d7am1iUsw The tweet, which came just days after a man drove a car through a group of people protesting a white supremacist rally, quickly raised eyebrows. Mr. Trump was heavily criticized for his response to that attack, which killed one person and left many others wounded. Minutes later, Mr. Trump retweeted a person who said that he was considering a pardon of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio because he is a ""fascist."" He's a fascist, so not unusual. The user, who was intending to mock Arpaio and Mr. Trump, later joked that he was leaving Twitter because he would ""never top this re-tweet."" Mr. Trump then deleted both retweets. A White House official said the CNN tweet had been posted inadvertently, according to The New York Times. Mr. Trump has criticized CNN as ""fake news"" numerous times, including on Monday.?

"Sen. Dean Heller has revealed that he wound up voting for Donald Trump for president last November. ""Yes, I voted for Donald Trump,"" he said in a statement texted to a reporter, according to The Nevada Independent newspaper. The Nevada Republican told reporters in the month before the election that he was 99 percent sure he would oppose Mr. Trump for president, the report notes. Heller, 57, has served in the Senate since 2011 and previously served in the House and as secretary of state of Nevada. He's considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans up for re-election in the 2018 midterm elections. He was highly critical of the Senate Republican leadership's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in June, arguing that it would have taken health care coverage away from millions of Americans and tens of thousands of his constituents. Last week, Danny Tarkanian, the son of former University of Nevada, Las Vegas, basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, announced that he's launching a campaign to challenge Heller in the party's primary next year. Tarkanian, 55, said that he supported Mr. Trump through the end of the 2016 campaign. He has run unsuccessfully for Congress several times -- for House seats and, in 2010, he tried to unseat Democratic leader Sen. Harry Reid.																																																																																																																					"

"Last Updated Aug 14, 2017 2:16 PM EDT NEW YORK?〞 The CEO of the nation's third-largest pharmaceutical company is resigning from the President's American Manufacturing Council, citing ""a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism."" Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier's resignation comes shortly after a violent confrontation between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one person dead and 19 injured.? The CEO said in a tweet on Monday that the country's leaders must ""honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy."" Mayor Jim Gray of Lexington, Kentucky, is working quickly to relocate two Confederate monuments from outside a historic former courthouse. He sai... Frazier is one of the few African Americans to head a Fortune 500 company. Last month, Merck, Pfizer and Corning gathered at the?White House?to announce a $4 billion collaboration that would create glass packaging for drugs in the U.S. The initiative promised to create 4,000 jobs.? Merck (MRK) shares rose 37 cents, or 0.61 percent, trading at $62.75 a share Monday afternoon. President Donald Trump is being criticized for not explicitly?condemning?the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville. (He finally did so on Monday afternoon.) However, Mr. Trump lashed out almost immediately after Frazier's resignation, taking to Twitter to blame him for ""RIPOFF DRUG PRICES."" Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council,he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES! Drugmakers have come under withering criticism for soaring prices in the U.S., including by Mr. Trump, though he has yet to act on a promise to contain them. With the barb, the president appeared to attack an industry executive who has maneuvered to push prices lower, at least on some drugs. Last year, the company launched a new hepatitis C medicine at a big discount to the drugs already on the market. In January, Merck reported that since 2010 its annual average net price increase has ranged from 3.4 percent to 6.2 percent, roughly half its list price increases. Other drugmakers have hiked list prices 20 percent or more every year and launched new drugs with eye-popping price tags. Merck also is developing cheaper versions of complex injected medicines called biologics that can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. The exchange lit up social media early on Monday, with many people lauding Frazier and blasting the president. Some pointed out that Frazier's resignation would put pressure on executives who remained on the council to speak out. Virginia's governor declared a state of emergency in Charlottesville as white nationalists clashed in the streets with counter-protesters. Groups... There was also support from other executives.? Unilever CEO Paul Polman on Twitter wrote, ""Thanks @Merck Ken Frazier for strong leadership to stand up for the moral values that made this country what it is."" Frazier, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, resigned days after one person was killed and others wounded in violent clashes between white supremacists and protesters. Frazier and his siblings were raised by their janitor father after their mother died when he was very young. He has earned a reputation as a risk taker in the drug industry, pouring money into daunting research areas, particularly trying to develop a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Frazier is not the first executive to resign from advisory councils serving Trump. Tesla CEO Elon Musk resigned from the manufacturing council, and from two other advisory groups to the president, after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement in June. Walt Disney Co. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger resigned from a White House advisory council for the same reason. The manufacturing jobs council?had 28 members initially, but it has shrunk since it was formed earlier this year as executives retire, are replaced or resign.

Afterward, he's expected to head to New York City to stay at Trump Tower. Last week, he said that he was vacationing in New Jersey instead of Trump Tower because he said being in New York causes massive disruptions.

""We will combat the counterfeiting and piracy that destroys American jobs. We will enforce the rules of fair and reciprocal trade that form the foundation of responsible commerce. And we will protect forgotten Americans who have been left behind by a global trade system that has failed to look, and I mean look, out for their interest."" Mr. Trump suggested at the Monday afternoon signing that additional steps would be taken against China on trade issues.

"Last Updated Aug 14, 2017 7:02 PM EDT Steve Bannon's position as President Trump's chief strategist may be in jeopardy, two sources close to the White House told CBS News' chief White House correspondent Major Garrett.

One source says that Bannon could be gone by the end of the week, Garrett reports. Over the weekend, White House officials were not quick to come to Bannon's defense on the subject of his loyalty to the president and the White House's agenda. On Sunday, White House National Security Adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster would not say whether or not he would work with Bannon?during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Breitbart, the right-wing news service that Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign, has run numerous articles critical of McMaster in recent weeks. There's probably a lot you don't know about Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump's controversial chief strategist When asked what was going on between him and Bannon within the White House, McMaster responded that ""there's just a lot of noise, from my perspective."" ""And I think everybody sees the president has assembled a tremendous national security team,"" McMaster said. ""And it's a great privilege for me to be able to support and enable people like Secretary of State Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Mattis, [CIA] Director Pompeo, Ambassador Haley at the United Nations. And despite this noise, we're getting quite a bit done in terms of developing and advancing strategies to prioritize the safety and security of the American people and promote American prosperity."" In an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, former communications director Anthony Scaramucci questioned Bannon's loyalty and did not dispute the idea the president may soon fire him.

""Well, I think the president knows what he's going to do with Steve Bannon,"" Scaramucci said. ""Well, let's leave it up to the president. It's his decision. But I mean, at the end of the day, I think the president has a very good idea of who the leakers are inside the White House. The president has a very good idea of the people that are undermining his agenda that are serving their own interests."" Adding to the tension, reports circulated last week alleging that Mr. Trump suspects Bannon of leaking sensitive information to the press. Just last month, Mr. Trump emphasized his frustration with these breaches of information and called on his administration to be ""much tougher on the leaks."" Bannon may also have some problems with newly appointed Chief of Staff General John Kelly. Kelly, who replaced former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, is eager to reshape the Trump administration, and the president has deferred to Kelly for key staffing decisions. One source said that Kelly wants ""to put more adults in place inside the White House,"" while also clearing the air of rivalries stemming from when former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Bannon were jointly appointed.

"""Being a mayor is all about getting things done,"" said Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. A Democrat in a state with a Republican governor, GOP-led statehouse and two Republican senators, Fischer has nonetheless succeeded enough to be named by Politico as?the most innovative mayor in the country. Louisville has added more than 63,000 jobs since he took office in 2011. Fischer is also working to increase the number of college graduates in the city and creating new job training programs. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. Appearing on ""CBS This Morning"" Monday to discuss challenges facing America's cities (including the kind of ideologically charged violence seen in Charlottesville, Virginia, this weekend), Fischer said the biggest issue ""in the cities, in the countryside and all over America is social mobility, jobs, what's happening to our middle class right now. ""It's being hollowed out. That's one of the reasons why you're seeing some of this hatred that's coming out in the streets, fear. They don't feel connected. They don't feel hope. They don't know where they fit in a rapidly changing global economy, so they don't know what to do. ""We need major system changes that involve everybody so they can have a hopeful path to the future."" ""That's the rise of populism,"" co-host Charlie Rose said. ""We need to fight against that,"" Fischer replied. ""After Brexit, after what happened here in our country, what we need to do is say, how can everybody participate meaningfully in a job that has a future to it where you can have dignity of work and support your family?"" In a statement Sunday following the rallies by white supremacists in Charlottesville and the resulting violence (including the death of a counter-demonstrator in an act of domestic terrorism), Fischer said: ""This is not the country we aspire to be -- and a strong nation recognizes its weaknesses, and continues to work and strive to be a more perfect union. ""We believe in diversity. We believe in inclusion. We believe in free speech, but not hate speech. We believe that the great American melting pot -- black, white, and brown -- is a strength that empowers us. We believe in taking hate and racism straight on. And we must turn these beliefs into actions of compassion, understanding, and unity."" ""Louisville was the home of Muhammad Ali,"" Fischer said. ""It was about a year ago when we laid him to rest, and we saw the whole world come together to celebrate this great man, values of compassion, confidence, spirituality. That's the United States of America. It's not what we saw in Charlottesville over the weekend. We condemn that type of activity. ""This is an easy one for all leaders to get up and say, 'This is not us.' The strength of America is our human values -- that's what we should be celebrating every day. Diversity is what makes us strong."" Confederate monuments have also been a focus of debate in Louisville. Last year, a 70-foot-tall monument honoring Confederate soldiers was removed from its site at the University of Louisville to the nearby town of Brandenburg. ""We had a peaceful discussion about [it] in our city,"" Fischer said. ""We moved it to another location; we didn't destroy it."" On Sunday morning, following the violence in Charlottesville, a statue in a Louisville park of John Breckinridge Castleman (who served in both the Confederate Army during the Civil War and the U.S. Army during the Spanish-American War) was vandalized with orange paint. Fischer has called for any piece of public art that had potential connotations to slavery or racism to be identified, to discuss possibly moving them. ""It is an important part of history but it needs to be in a proper context."" Fischer said that it is important that compassion be one of his city's basic values. ""Compassion means respect for each and every one of our citizens so that their human potential is flourishing, thriving, shining like the sun,?is what Thomas Merton said."" He also decried how divisive talk of ideology can derail progress.? ""America works best when we work together, right? So if you get all hung up on ideology like we see in the health care debate, for instance, people at the local level are not interested in that. When you take health care, we need more health care. We're a rich country. Eighteen percent of our GDP is spent on health care. Germany spends 10 percent, United Kingdom spends 8 percent. We need to figure out the cost issue so that more people have more coverage. That's what people are interested in. They're not interested in political ideology. That's a waste of time in the Main Streets of our cities."" To be a good mayor, Fischer said, ""You have to have the head of a chief executive officer but the heart of a social worker."" With cities being the home of 85 percent of the U.S. population, and the source of over 90 percent of GDP, Fischer said mayors have to take care of business. ""We don't see blue, we don't see red. We see opportunity,"" he said. And when confronted with an issue like income inequality, his course of action, he said, is ""you take it directly on in the workplace and ask yourself, what's happening in these jobs and what can we do as leaders to make sure there are jobs that have good solid middle class wages to them? The way we're doing it right now 每 with just a few people really winning and a lot of people losing -- is not the solution.""

"The violent clash in Charlottesville, Virginia, is the latest in a series of tense demonstrations over plans to remove Confederate monuments.

""When you see the tension, when you see the violence that we saw＃ in Charlottesville, then you know that we must act."" ? The Lexington monuments were built near the historic site of one of the country's largest slave auction blocks. ""I don't think it's right... that we would honor and glorify Confederate men who fought to preserve slavery and honor them on the very grounds that slaves were once sold at auction,"" Gray said.

In New Orleans, city leaders faced two years of court battles and a handful of violent protests over their plan to remove four Confederate landmarks. ? The Southern Poverty Law Center has found 1,500 symbols or places that pay homage to Confederate leaders and said there have been at least 100 state and local attempts to remove the monuments or provide more historical context.

The heads of the black, Hispanic, Asian and progressive caucuses are calling in the letter for the firings of the Trump administration officials in the wake of a violent, racist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

"Last Updated Aug 15, 2017 5:41 PM EDT The next White House staff shake-up could leave Steve Bannon on the outside. Sources told CBS News President Trump's chief political strategist may soon be gone. The former executive chairman of Breitbart News helped Mr. Trump win the presidency, but his future is at risk because the president's new chief of staff is working to restore order in the West Wing. There's probably a lot you don't know about Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump's controversial chief strategist Several high-placed sources inside and outside the White House told CBS News that Bannon has never been in more jeopardy, and one well-placed source said he could be gone by the end of this week, CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett reports. Trump did nothing to quash that uncertainty in statements at Trump Tower Tuesday afternoon. ""Well we'll see 每 look like, I like Mr. Bannon, he's a friend of mine, but Mr. Bannon came on very late, you know that,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that, and I like him, he is a good man, he is not a racist, I can tell you that. He's a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard, but we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon, but he's a good person, and I think the press treats him frankly very unfairly."" Bannon's stock has risen and fallen like other senior White House officials, and he has survived job scares before. His close, personal relationship with the president can't be ruled out, but his fate is the topic of intense internal discussions involving the president and inside and outside adivsers, in part because of Bannon's history of clashing with members of the national security team as well as top economic advisers. He's also accused of using his allies in the conservative media to try to undermine H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser. On Monday, two days after a domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, President Trump condemned the hate groups that organized a white... The new chief of staff at the White House, retired four-star Marine Gen. John Kelly, is trying to eliminate that kind of open, factional warfare within the White House, and he has also tried to strengthen McMaster's position within the White House. There's an ideological dimension to this as well: Bannon's hard-right, nationalist economic perspective and his reluctance to engage or expand military operations makes him clash with comparatively more moderate voices in the White House. In the end, this could come down to the president's newly forged relationship with Kelly. Several sources told CBS News that Kelly wants ""more adults"" in the White House, and where Bannon falls on Kelly's estimation of adult or not adult could decide his fate.

"Expanding charter schools around the country is losing support among Americans, even as President Donald Trump and his administration continue to push for school choice, according to a survey released Tuesday. Trump campaigned on a promise to dramatically improve school choice 〞 charter schools and private school voucher programs 〞 and his Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has made it a priority. But so far the message does not appear to have hit home with the public. About 39 percent of respondents favor opening more charters 〞 schools that are funded by public money, but usually operated independently of school districts 〞 according to the survey by Education Next, a journal published by Harvard's Kennedy School and Stanford University. That's down from 51 percent last year. Supporters of charter schools had feared that Trump's polarizing rhetoric could hurt the school-choice movement. But the authors of the report say the decline in support for charters can't be linked directly to Trump. They say support for charters slipped almost equally across party lines: by 11 percent among Democrats and by 13 percent among Republicans. They also emphasize that private school vouchers and voucher-type programs, championed by Trump, have seen stable support and declining opposition. Finally, when respondents were told that Trump was advocating for charter schools, overall support increased by 6 percentage points. ""We can't say definitively what is responsible for the decline,"" said Martin West, associate professor of education at Harvard University and a co-author of the report. West speculated that the drop may have been caused by continued opposition from teachers unions and many Democrats plus debates over charters' effectiveness. ""These developments may have led to a souring of the charter brand,"" West said. Meanwhile, opposition to publicly funded vouchers that help parents pay private school tuition dropped from 44 percent last year to 37 percent; 45 percent of respondents currently favor the idea. When it comes to tax credit-funded scholarships, resistance fell from 29 percent to 24 percent, while support was at 54 percent now. Proponents of charter schools are not discouraged. Nina Rees, president of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, says the drop in popularity was due to ""expensive, sustained, and coordinated campaigns to discredit charter schools, led by teachers' unions and special interests that feel threatened by families having a choice in public school."" Rees said that more than 300 public charter schools opened last year, with a total over 6,900 charter schools serving over 3 million students across the country. ""The opinions about charter schools that matter most are the opinions of parents and students who have chosen charter schools,"" Rees said. To others, the Trump effect is more apparent. On the campaign trail, Trump spoke of funding a $20 billion school choice program and has proposed major cuts to long-standing K-12 programs, such as teacher preparation and after-school classes, while requesting more funding for charters and vouchers. DeVos has faced criticism from the left for promoting solely school choice and paying little attention to public schools. Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a non-partisan research and policy organization, said the Trump administration's rhetoric has only deepened partisan tensions around charter schools. ""I would be shocked if it were unaffected,"" Lake said. ""I am just hearing a lot from folks on the ground that schools have a lot of conversations with parents that they didn't use to have about why charter schools are public and why they are not a partisan issue."" ""I am not sure it's not the only reason, but I am pretty sure it's a contributing factor."" Rick Hess, director of education policy at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said Trump and DeVos may have turned school choice into a much more federal and divisive issue than it needed to be by talking about it in black-and-white terms and by being too critical of public schools. ""Sometimes the way these things get talked about, you can wind up alienating people who might be with you,"" Hess said. An April poll?conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found greater levels of support for charter schools. Forty-seven percent said they favor opening more public charter schools, 23 percent were opposed, and 30 percent felt neutral about it. Meanwhile, 43 percent of respondents supported giving low-income families tuition vouchers for private schools, 35 percent were opposed and 21 percent didn't have a strong opinion either way. The poll had a sample size of 1,036 and the margin of error was plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. The Education Next survey was based on interviews with 4,214 adults across the country. The margin of error was 1.5 percentage points.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 15, 2017 7:35 AM EDT Three GOP candidates hoping to replace former Rep. Jason Chaffetz in Congress face off in a primary election Tuesday after weeks trying to burnish their conservative credentials and fend off attack ads from deep-pocketed outside groups. Chaffetz abruptly stepped down from his seat in June after making a name for himself as the Republican who relentlessly investigated Hillary Clinton and her emails while he was chairman of the House Oversight Committee. His departure opened up a congressional seat in a district where Republicans outnumber Democrats five-to-one, offering voters and donors a choice between three candidates emblematic of the divisions roiling the GOP under President Donald Trump. Out-of-state organizations and political action committees have spent about $900,000 in Utah's race 〞 on top of about $600,000 in campaign contributions collected by the three Republicans running for Utah's 3rd Congressional District. Outside spending of that magnitude is generally only seen in deep-red Utah when Democrats and Republicans face off occasional close races. Moderate Utah Republicans have backed a popular mayor, John Curtis, who was once a Democrat and said he had strong moral concerns that kept him from voting for Trump. Those further to the right have split their support behind Chris Herrod, a former state lawmaker known for strict immigration positions, and Tanner Ainge, a business consultant, first-time candidate and son of Boston Celtics president Danny Ainge. Herrod, 51, and Ainge, 33, both voted for Trump, but all three candidates say they support the president's agenda 〞 including plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, revamp the tax code and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Curtis, the target of most of the out-of-state attack ads, has faced suspicion and criticism from some Republicans for his 2000 run as a Democrat for the state Legislature and his time leading a county Democratic party. The 57-year-old identifies today as a conservative Republican and points out that Ronald Reagan, Trump and Chaffetz were all Democrats at one point. For Ada Wilson, a 59-year-old Republican homemaker from Orem, Curtis' stint across the aisle is one of the reasons she's voting for him. Wilson said it shows Curtis can work in a bipartisan way to get things done. ""I think he acknowledges that being Republican with an 'R' by your name does not automatically make you a keeper of all the answers,"" she said. David Nelson, a pharmaceutical representative from Salem, Utah, said he thinks Curtis' Democratic past shows he's not a conservative. Nelson said it's OK that Ainge hasn't held public office, and he's voting for the younger candidate because of his ""business-minded"" outlook. ""I think that you don't have to have all the experience in the world to go to Washington and work for the people,"" he said. ""You just have to be in tune with the pulse of the people."" Martin Wilkins, a 39-year-old UPS worker from Orem, said Ainge seems like a nice guy but is too young and inexperienced. ""In the political world, he's just a kid and no one is going to listen to him,"" Wilkins said. ""If you go into college and a kindergarten student starts trying to order people around, no one is going to listen."" Wilkins said he voted for Herrod because seems like the kind of person who tells it straight, whether it's popular or not. The winner coming out of Tuesday's race will face a well-funded Democratic opponent who initially jumped in to challenge Chaffetz earlier this year. Kathryn Allen socked away more than half a million dollars after she called out Chaffetz early this year for his comments suggesting people should spend money on health care instead of iPhones. Chaffetz made a surprise announcement that he was resigning at the end of June, citing a desire to spend more time with family after eight years in Congress. He's since taken a role as a Fox News commentator and announced he will be one of six visiting fellows at Harvard University this fall. Several third-party candidates are also running, including Jim Bennett, the son of the late former U.S. Sen. Bob Bennett, a longtime Republican who lost re-election in 2010, the first of several GOP candidates ousted in tea-party fueled wave. Jim Bennett is running as the first candidate of a new centrist party, the United Utah Party.

"Glad you asked, as the primary is happening on Tuesday. Republican Sen. Luther Strange, the state's former attorney general who was appointed to replace Jeff Sessions when he left the Senate to join President Trump's cabinet, is running in a special election to remain in office. Although Strange enjoys some of the benefits of incumbency, such as the support of GOP leaders in Washington, some of those leaders are awfully unpopular in Alabama. And to make matters worse for the six-foot-nine Strange, who occasionally styles himself ""Big Luther,"" the governor who appointed him to fill the seat was forced to resign in the midst of a sex scandal earlier this year.? Strange's GOP primary opponents are Rep. Mo Brooks, a member of the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus, and Roy Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court judge known for his intense religiosity and social conservatism. Moore has been effectively kicked off the court twice 每 once in 2003 for refusing to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from court grounds, and once in 2016 for refusing to abide by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide. Alabama is a deep red state, and the winner of the Republican primary is all but assured to win the general election in December. To make matters worse for the Democrats, the man many view as their best chance to pull off an upset 每 former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones 每 appears to be trailing businessman Robert Kennedy Jr., a political unknown. He is not, but his name is probably helping him out in a major way, as he's currently lacking for the cash and staff a viable statewide candidate would typically need. Big-name Democrats like Georgia Rep. John Lewis and former Vice President Joe Biden have endorsed Jones in an attempt to block Kennedy from victory, but there's no way of knowing if that will work.? No Republican candidate is expected to get 50 percent of the vote on Tuesday, meaning that the top two candidates will head to a run-off on Sept. 26. And if the polls are right, chances are those two candidates will be Moore and Strange, with Moore coming in first. Despite Moore's high favorability ratings, the conventional wisdom holds that he can't win the run-off, which means Brooks and Strange have been jockeying for second place in Tuesday's primary. Neither has spent much ammunition on Moore, instead opting to hammer each other.? Meanwhile, Republican leaders in Congress, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have steered a lot of money to the race in an effort to help Strange. But McConnell is a pretty unpopular person among rank-and-file GOP voters in Alabama, so Brooks and Moore have tried to use McConnell's support against Strange.? He sure does. Mr. Trump is popular in Alabama, especially among the kinds of people who will turn out for a Republican primary. As a result, Strange, Brooks, and Moore have all tried to make themselves out as the most pro-Trump candidate. But this has been difficult for Brooks, who frequently criticized Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential primaries. Clips of Brooks doing so have given a lot of fodder to his opponents, particularly Strange. Strange was also able to secure Mr. Trump's endorsement last week, and even has the president making robocalls on his behalf. ? Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement! Brooks has tried to fight back by pointing to his strong record defending gun rights, particularly after the shooting of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise earlier this year. Brooks was with Scalise during the shooting, and turned the experience into a head-turning campaign ad?earlier in the summer. But that's unlikely to be enough to overcome Strange, who's made Brooks' knocks against Mr. Trump central to his message. Still, the battle between Brooks and Strange has been an ugly one, and damaging to both contenders.? In particular, Strange has had to fight off insinuations that he was appointed to the seat as a result of a deal with Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican and former church deacon, who resigned in April after having an affair with an aide. Bentley, who was accused of using government resources to keep the relationship under wraps, was staring down a possible impeachment at the hands of the state legislature before Strange asked the state's House of Representatives to stand down and let him investigate.? That was in November. And a few short months later, Bentley had appointed Strange to his current job. Strange denies any wrongdoing, and insists he did not make any kind of deal with the governor, but his opponents frequently bring up his connection to Bentley. When Mr. Trump endorsed Strange, Brooks responded: ""Perhaps the president is unaware that Luther Strange corruptly and unethically held a criminal investigation over the head of disgraced Governor Bentley to obtain the Senate appointment.""? Well, he can, but the thinking is he won't. Moore benefits from have near-universal name ID in Alabama and strong support from conservative evangelicals. On the other hand, he saw his 2010 run for governor go belly up when he finished fourth in the GOP primary. But Strange and Brooks, while ignoring Moore, have been slinging the mud at each other for months. So it's possible, given the amount of acrimony in the race, that Moore pulls out a win in September against a bruised opponent, assuming he survives the run-off. Such an outcome would not be well-received by Republicans in Washington, as Moore has repeatedly promised to be something other than a loyal team player if he gets to the Senate.

"Last Updated Aug 15, 2017 2:14 AM EDT The shortest serving White House communications director in U.S. history, Anthony Scaramucci, gave his raw opinion about a quarrelsome White House when he appeared on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" Monday night. There's probably a lot you don't know about Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump's controversial chief strategist ""It's a tough place,"" he admitted to Colbert. ""There was a lot of infighting ... front stabbing."" Scaramucci, nicknamed ""The Mooch,"" said chief strategist Stephen Bannon isn't a white supremacist. Scaramucci said he noticed that Bannon did have the tendency to tolerate white supremacist ideology and that, Scaramaucci admitted, is ""disgusting"" and ""reprehensible."" As for Bannon's future in the White House, which CBS News chief White house correspondent Major Garrett reports may be in jeopardy, Scaramucci said if he had hiring-and-firing authority, he'd want to see Bannon gone for good.

""Not at all. When you take a job like that, you know your expiration date is coming,"" he said. ""You take that job recognizing that you're serving at the behest of the president, and if he doesn't want you there anymore ＃ you leave with respect.""

He noted that if he'd acted any differently from his true self, the process wouldn't have been right. During the interview, Scaramucci also critiqued Mr. Trump's reaction to the deadly Charlottesville, Virginia, protests over the weekend. He said it was right for the president to openly condemn racist groups like the KKK and neo-Nazis today, but he should have been more specific on the day the events were unfolding. President Trump is facing criticism -- including from members of the Republican party -- for his initial response blaming both the left and right... ""It was late. But he did go today and make a statement that was very declarative against it,"" Scaramucci said. ""He is a compassionate person. I know him as a compassionate person."" At the end of the interview, Scaramucci presented Colbert a knife with his name engraved on it as a parting gift, referencing Colbert's relentless three weeks teasing him about ""front-stabbing"" and ""back-stabbing."" Scaramucci signed off the show recommending that Mr. Trump make an appearance himself sometime in the future.

""The Mooch,"" a few weeks removed from his spectacular flameout following an expletive-laden conversation with a reporter, appeared Monday on CBS' ""Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert. Colbert has seen his ratings soar since Mr. Trump's inauguration with his relentless comedic attacks. Colbert showed a picture of Scaramucci and former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus glaring at each other. Scaramucci said there was ""no love lost"" between the two. He said he and Priebus got along well when he was writing checks to the Republican National Committee, which Priebus once led. Bannon's position?as the president 's chief strategist may be in jeopardy, two sources close to the White House told CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. There is a growing feeling both inside and outside the White House that Bannon is increasingly falling out of favor with Mr. Trump, with the relationship between the two falling to all-time lows. One source says that Bannon could be gone by the end of the week, Garrett reports. Scaramucci said he knows Mr. Trump ""as a compassionate person,"" while reiterating that he thought the president should have spoken more harshly than he did initially of the white supremacists involved in the violent protest in Charlottesville, Virginia. Of Mr. Trump's frequent off-the-cuff remarks, Scaramucci said, ""That's him wearing his heart on his sleeve.""

"Last Updated Aug 15, 2017 2:53 AM EDT NEW YORK --?President Trump went home to Trump Tower on Monday for the first time since his inauguration, with a throng of chanting protesters awaiting -- but never seeing -- him. Thousands of demonstrators roared ""shame, shame, shame"" and ""not my president!"" while awaiting Mr. Trump's motorcade along Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, but it ultimately approached from another direction. A far smaller crowd of Mr. Trump supporters also awaited him. CBS New York reports that at least two protesters were arrested Monday night, according to the New York Police Department (NYPD). Onlookers who did see the motorcade greeted it with cellphone cameras and a few obscene gestures. By the tower, some protesters carried signs with such messages as ""impeach"" and ""the White House is no place for white supremacy"" as chants including ""love, not hate -- that's what makes America great"" and ""New York hates you!"" echoed off the surrounding buildings. Nearby, an inflatable, rat-like caricature of Mr. Trump stood by The Plaza hotel. Anti-Trump protesters gather in Manhattan in New York, on Mon., Aug. 14, 2017. The Rev. Jan Powell, a retired minister of the United Church of Christ, carried a sign that read ""no justice, no peace"" as she stood opposite Trump Tower. She said she was bothered by the Republican president's response to the white supremacist rally that?descended into violence Saturday in Virginia. But ""what bothers me the most is when folks like Trump try to silence our First Amendment right to free speech, either with violence or 'fake news' or hate speech,"" Powell said. Protesters worldwide have taken to the streets since the inauguration of President Donald Trump Still, she said, ""I pray for him every day. We are both human beings."" City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat, was among the protesters. Meanwhile, about two dozen Mr. Trump fans were in a separate pen near The Plaza, chanting ""God bless President Trump"" and carrying American flags and signs with such sentiments as ""now is not the time for divisiveness."" ""Though we may be small in this bubble, they need to know we're here,"" said Shaun Jackson, a tax attorney who sees Mr. Trump as a populist shaking up Washington's elite and the protesters as ignorant people with ""a lot of hate."" ""They'll call me a Nazi, but do you know that you're acting like a Nazi by telling me to get off the street?"" he said. With supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators penned across the sidewalk, both sides yelled at each other, ""Go home!"" A block south of Mr. Trump Tower, police officers with bullhorns confronted protesters pressing against and straining the barricades, telling the demonstrators to step back. Anti-Trump protesters gather in Manhattan in New York on Mon., Aug. 14, 2017. Metal police barricades were up well ahead of time on Fifth Avenue and Mayor Bill de Blasio urged drivers to avoid the area around Trump Tower. In addition to metal fencing there were concrete barriers, and sanitation trucks filled with sand lined up on Fifth Ave in front of Tiffany's and Gucci, CBS New York reports. After Mr. Trump was elected president, security around the tower ramped up dramatically. Barricades and checkpoints were manned by scores of uniformed police officers. Mr. Trump, a native New Yorker, said Friday that he had stayed away because he realized the impact of the street closings and other aspects of a presidential visit. ""I would love to go to my home in Mr. Trump Tower, but it's very, very disruptive to do,"" he said. CBS New York adds that the NYPD were well-prepared for Mr. Trump's visit. ""The NYPD has proven clearly in the time up to the inauguration their ability to secure the president and his family, his team while keeping things moving in the surrounding neighborhood,"" said de Blasio, who begins a weeklong vacation in Rhode Island Monday. Anti-Trump protesters gather on 57th street and 5th avenue in Manhattan in New York on Mon., Aug. 14, 2017. Protester Gabby Parra, however, said she was demonstrating to show Mr. Trump ""he's not welcome here."" ""We need to let him know that New Yorkers and people from around here are not going to accept his blatant idiocy,"" said Parra, a 17-year-old high school senior from Teaneck, New Jersey. After racial violence broke out in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend, President Trump received criticism from all sides for refusing to... She said she feels the president dehumanizes minorities, noting that he launched his campaign by portraying Mexico as a source of rapists and murderers coming into the U.S. and that he initially failed to denounce white supremacists specifically after Saturday's violence. Mr. Trump, under pressure after initially condemning what he called an ""egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,"" on Monday declared that ""racism is evil"" and described members of the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and white supremacists who take part in violence as ""criminals and thugs.""

"Last Updated Aug 14, 2017 8:54 PM EDT BEIJING -- The United States needs China's help with North Korea, but President Trump signed an executive memo on Monday that is sure to anger the Chinese. The order calls for an investigation into whether China stole American intellectual property. In response, the Chinese government used a strongly worded editorial in state run China Daily newspaper accused Mr. Trump of ""exploiting trade as a bargaining chip"" -- one that will ""poison the overall China-U.S. relationship."" President Trump signed a memorandum Monday afternoon, that will probe alleged Chinese violations on U.S. trade. Scott Kennedy of the Center for S... China has repeatedly warned Mr. Trump not to use trade as a means to force stronger action on North Korea. China accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's trade and has been reluctant to punish the regime economically for fear of collapse. But on Monday, China issued an order banning all imports of North Korean coal, iron ore and seafood -- in compliance with tough new?U.N. sanctions. Meanwhile, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, began a tour of Asia meeting to reassure South Korean president Moon Jae-in. The U.S. military is on call at all times to be available to fight. Col. David Shoemaker speaks to CBSN about how the military is preparing for a... Gen. Dunford says the U.S. still prefers diplomacy to force, but that the U.S. is ready to use the full range of its capabilities to respond to any attack. The U.S. staged joint military exercises Monday with Japan and has also said it will go ahead with joint military exercises with South Korea in the region next week -- something that both China and North Korea oppose. Kim Jong Un's regime continued its defiance, claiming 3.5 million North Koreans have volunteered to join its army, and in a new threat warned that even an accidental event could become a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. North Korea did announce Monday that Kim Jong Un has been briefed on military plans to launch four missiles toward Guam, but that he plans to wait. U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said Monday that the U.S. will shoot down any North Korean missiles heading toward Guam. Marine Gen.

"Three days after then-candidate Donald Trump appointed his foreign policy team in March 2016, adviser George Papadopoulos emailed seven campaign officials with the subject line ""Meeting with Russian Leadership -- Including Putin,"" according to a report from The Washington Post. Papadopoulos offered to facilitate ""a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump,"" according to internal campaign emails read to The Post. The emails also expressed that Papadopoulos' Russian contacts welcomed the potential meeting. The conversations are recorded as part of the more than 20,000 pages of documents forfeited this month to congressional committees by the Trump campaign after they were reviewed by White House and defense lawyers. The selection pertaining to Papadopoulos' emails were read to The Post by a person with access to them, and portions of the text were confirmed by two additional sources who also had access to the exchanges. CBS News has confirmed special counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in his investigation into Russian election meddling. Jamil Jaffer, fo... Papadopoulos' proposed meeting set off a chain of concerned reactions from Trump campaign officials. Campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis suggested discussing with NATO allies before making any plans to meet with the Russians and adviser Charles Kubic expressed a variety of legal concerns, citing the Logan act, which prohibits citizens from participating in unauthorized negotiations with foreign governments. Then-campaign manager Paul Manafort rejected one of Papadopoulos' requests in May 2016 for Mr. Trump to participate in a Russian meeting. At the time, the Trump campaign was focused on securing Mr. Trump's position as the Republican Party's candidate. Eschewing the concerns of more experienced campaign advisers, Papadopoulos persisted in suggesting the meeting. Between March and September, he sent at least six requests for Mr. Trump or his team members to meet with Russian officials. It is unclear from Papadopoulos' emails what benefit the Trump campaign would reap from meeting with the Russian government. Three months following Papadopoulos' proposed meeting, Mr. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Manafort met at Trump Tower in June 2016 with a Kremlin-connected lawyer after being promised potentially damaging information on former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. claimed that his father did not have knowledge of the meeting. That meeting, in addition to several other Trump campaign communications, are now under the scrutiny of the Special Counsel led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller assigned to investigate potential Russian collusion with the Trump campaign and interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In July 2016, then-senator and Trump foreign policy adviser Jeff Sessions met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak-- a meeting he has since disclosed in his recusal from any Russia-related investigation into the Trump campaign. In the same month, Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page spoke at an event at a university in Moscow, although he claims the speech was independent of the Trump campaign. President Trump's trip to Huntington, West Virginia, Thursday night featured another all-out defense of his campaign. He told thousands of suppor... Following his previous efforts, Papadopoulos reached out to then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to explain that he was receiving ""a lot of calls over the past month"" about arranging a meeting between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. ""Putin wants to host the Trump team when the time is right,"" Papadopoulos wrote on April 27, according to The Post. A week later, Papadopoulos forwarded a note from the leader of the government-funded Russian International Affairs Council on to Lewandowski and others. In the forwarded message, a senior official to the Russian International Affairs Council Ivan Timofeev explained that Russian foreign ministry officials welcomed a visit from Mr. Trump to Moscow. Timofeev also requested that the Trump campaign coordinate with the Russians to outline a formal letter regarding the meeting. Clovis responded that, ""There are legal issues we need to mitigate, meeting with foreign officials as a private citizen,"" and there is no apparent response from Lewandowski, according to The Post. A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle Papadopoulos later forwarded the same Timofeev message to Manafort. ""Russia has been eager to meet with Mr. Trump for some time and have been reaching out to me to discuss,"" he told Manafort, The Post reports. ""We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips,"" Manafort responded while forwarding the email to his deputy Rick Gates, who agreed with Manafort on the subject. Timofeev confirmed that his organization had discussed a potential meeting with the Trump campaign. ""We discussed the idea informally as one of the opportunities for . . . dialogue between Russia and the U.S.,"" Timofeev said?to The Post in an email. ""RIAC often hosts meetings with prominent political figures and experts from the US and many other countries.,"" he said, noting that his organization would have been open to meeting with other presidential candidates' campaigns.

"Last Updated Aug 15, 2017 2:03 AM EDT More than two dozen executives from some of the country's most prominent corporations serve on President Trump's business and manufacturing advisory councils 每 and at first, Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier was the only one to resign in the wake of Mr. Trump's response to the weekend's deadly white supremacist protests in Charlottesville. CBS News reached out to the more than 40 members of two outside advisory panels: the White House Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum, asking if they planned to stay on board. Many of them condemned the violence, while others obliquely criticized the president's reluctance to initially condemn the group of protestors that included neo-Nazis, KKK members and white nationalists. At least one company simply declined to comment. Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, who initially did not return CBS News' request for comment, announced after this story was published that he was stepping down from Mr. Trump's Manufacturing Council. ""I love our country & company. I am stepping down from the council to focus on inspiring & uniting through power of sport,"" Plank tweeted Monday night.? I love our country & company.

""America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,"" he said in a statement. ""As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.""

"Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, called the ""the so-called 'alt-right'"" movement's attacks on President Trump's national security adviser H.R. McMaster ""disgraceful"" in a statement released today. Right-wing groups and websites have criticized McMaster after his removal of several people from the National Security Council (NSC). The removals include former Senior Director for Intelligence programs at the NSC, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who was dismissed by McMaster from the administration in early August. Michael Cernovich, a right-wing blogger, launched a website with the intent of seeking potentially damaging information on McMaster, both from inside and outside the White House. In the past, Cernovich has posted stories on a separate website attacking former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, falsely claiming that she has Parkinson's disease and that her ""inner circle"" was involved in a sex cult.? McCain, who has known McMaster for several years, denounced the anti-McMaster movement and their efforts to damage his reputation. ""Since this fringe movement cannot attract the support of decent Americans, it resorts to impugning the character of a good man and outstanding soldier who has served honorably in uniform and sacrificed more for our country than any of his detractors ever have,"" McCain's statement reads. Adding fuel to the anti-McMaster efforts, the national security adviser dodged questions relating to his willingness to work with White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon in a Meet the Press (NBC) interview on Sunday. Prior to his role in both the Trump campaign and administration, Bannon ran Breitbart, a far right-wing news service. In recent weeks, the website has run several articles which are highly critical of McMaster. ""Such smear tactics should not be tolerated and deserve an emphatic response,"" McCain said. ""I hope the president will once again stand up for his national security adviser and denounce these repugnant attacks, which arise from the same purveyors of hatred and ignorance who precipitated the recent violence in Charlottesville.""

"BOISE, Idaho?-- A group that represents farmers is calling the costs of saving imperiled salmon in the largest river system in the Pacific Northwest unsustainable and is turning to the Trump administration to sidestep endangered species laws. The Columbia-Snake River Irrigators Association wants the government to convene a Cabinet-level committee with the power to allow exemptions to the Endangered Species Act. Known as the ""God squad"" because its decisions can lead to extinctions of threatened wildlife, it has only gathered three times - the last 25 years ago during a controversy over spotted owl habitat in the Northwest. The irrigators association is frustrated with court rulings it says favor fish over people, claiming the committee could end years of legal challenges over U.S. dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers and bring stability for irrigators, power generators and other businesses that rely on the water. Environmental groups call the request a publicity stunt and say it could hurt fishing companies and others that rely on healthy runs of federally protected salmon and steelhead. The FDA has approved the first genetically modified fish for human consumption in the U.S. Scientists say it's been proven safe, but some consume... The association sees hope in a series of pro-industry environmental decisions by President Donald Trump. His administration has rescinded an Obama-era rule that would shield many small streams and other bodies of water from pollution and development, enacted policies to increase coal mining on federal lands and proposed giving Western states greater flexibility to allow development in habitat of sage grouse, a threatened bird. Darryll Olsen, association board representative, said the irrigators requested the committee during former President Barack Obama's tenure but got nowhere. He said the Trump administration has been encouraging during talks, leading to a formal request last month for a meeting with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. ""What we're asking for is that the secretary give direction to the (Interior) Department to work with us to review the steps for implementing the God squad,"" Olsen said. Zinke can gather the committee, which he would chair and would include other natural resource agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency. It also would include representatives from Washington state, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. If five of the federal committee members agree, they could exempt U.S. agencies from Endangered Species Act requirements for one or more of the thirteen species of salmon and steelhead listed since the early 1990s. The irrigators group, which has 120 members growing food crops in Washington state and Oregon, expects to meet with Zinke soon, Olsen said. Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said in an email that the agency could not comment on a committee that had not been formed and that she had no information about Zinke's meetings. Joseph Bogaard, executive director of a coalition of conservation, commercial, sport fishing and business groups called Save Our Wild Salmon, blasted the irrigation association's request. ""It's a terrible idea that will deliver great harm to the people and businesses of the Pacific Northwest,"" said Bogaard, whose coalition relies on the fish to produce millions of dollars of revenue. A federal judge ruled last year that the government had not done enough to improve salmon runs despite spending billions of dollars and urged it to consider removing four dams on the lower Snake River. Todd True, a lawyer with the environmental law firm Earthjustice who represented some plaintiffs in that 2016 ruling, said the God squad request should go nowhere. ""There isn't any basis to convene the committee because there are reasonable alternatives to save the fish,"" he said, pointing to the dam removal option. ""Their removal would be a big step forward."" This year, fish counts at dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers have been well below the 10-year average, which biologists blame on droughts in 2014 and 2015 and warming ocean conditions. Various results have emerged the three times the God squad has convened. It refused to grant an exemption for a Tennessee dam in the 1970s over a fish called the snail darter. Regarding crane protection in the Midwest, a settlement was reached before the panel offered a decision. In 1992, it voted to sidestep protections for the northern spotted owl and allow the Interior Department to sell timber on land in Oregon.

"WASHINGTON?-- The Trump administration's own actions are triggering double-digit premium increases on individual health insurance policies purchased by many consumers, a nonpartisan study has found. The analysis released Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that mixed signals from President Donald Trump have created uncertainty ""far outside the norm,"" leading insurers to seek higher premium increases for 2018 than would otherwise have been the case. The report comes with Republicans in Congress unable to deliver on their promise to repeal and replace the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. Trump, meanwhile, insists lawmakers try again. The president says ""Obamacare"" is collapsing, but he's also threatened to give it a shove by stopping billions of dollars in payments to insurers. Some leading Republicans are considering fallback measures to stabilize markets. Researchers from the Kaiser foundation looked at proposed premiums for a benchmark silver plan across major metropolitan areas in 20 states and Washington, D.C. Overall, they found that 15 of those cities will see increases of 10 percent or more next year. Over the weekend, President Trump threatened to pull federal funding from the Affordable Care Act, which would cause health care premiums to incr... The highest: a 49 percent jump in Wilmington, Delaware. The only decline: a 5 percent reduction in Providence, Rhode Island. About 10 million people who buy policies through HealthCare.gov and state-run markets are potentially affected, as well as another 5 million to 7 million who purchase individual policies on their own. Consumers in the government-sponsored markets can dodge the hit with the help of tax credits that most of them qualify for to help pay premiums. But off-marketplace customers pay full freight, and they face a second consecutive year of steep increases. Many are self-employed business owners. The report also found that insurer participation in the ACA markets will be lower than at any time since ""Obamacare"" opened for business in 2014. The average: 4.6 insurers in the states studied, down from 5.7 insurers this year. In many cases insurers do not sell plans in every community in a state. The researchers analyzed publicly available filings through which insurers justify their proposed premiums to state regulators. To be sure, insurers continue to struggle with sicker-than-expected customers and disappointing enrollment. And an ACA tax on the industry is expected to add 2 to 3 percentage points to premiums next year. But on top of that, the researchers found the mixed signals from the administration account for some of the higher charges. Those could increase before enrollment starts Nov. 1. ""The vast majority of companies in states with detailed rate filings have included some language around the uncertainty, so it is likely that more companies will revise their premiums to reflect uncertainty in the absence of clear answers from Congress or the administration,"" the report said. Once premiums are set, they're generally in place for a whole year. Insurers who assumed that Trump will make good on his threat to stop billions in payments to subsidize copays and deductibles requested additional premium increases ranging from 2 percent to 23 percent, the report found. Insurers who assumed the IRS under Trump will not enforce unpopular fines on people who remain uninsured requested additional premium increases ranging from 1.2 percent to 20 percent. ""In many cases that means insurers are adding double-digit premium increases on top of what they otherwise would have requested,"" said Cynthia Cox, a co-author of the Kaiser report. ""In many cases, what we are seeing is an additional increase due to the political uncertainty."" That doesn't sound like what Trump promised when he assumed the presidency. In a Washington Post interview ahead of his inauguration, Trump said, ""We're going to have insurance for everybody."" ""There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it,"" he added. ""That's not going to happen with us."" People covered under Obama's law ""can expect to have great health care,"" Trump said at the time. ""It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better."" But the White House never produced the health care proposal Trump promised. And the GOP bills in Congress would have left millions more uninsured, a sobering side-effect that contributed to their political undoing. The Trump administration sidestepped questions about its own role raised by the Kaiser study. Spokeswoman Alleigh Marre said rising premiums and dwindling choices predate Trump. ""The Trump administration is committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare and will always be focused on putting patients, families, and doctors, not Washington, in charge of health care,"" Marre said in a statement. The ongoing political turmoil for people who buy individual health insurance stands in sharp contrast to relative calm and stability for the majority of Americans insured through workplace plans. The cost of employer-sponsored coverage is expected to rise around 5 or 6 percent next year, benefits consultants say.

"NEW YORK 〞 Two LGBT-rights organizations filed a lawsuit in federal court Wednesday challenging President Donald Trump's tweets declaring he wants a ban on transgender people serving in the military. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington on behalf of five transgender service members with nearly 60 years of combined military service. Transgender people have been allowed to service openly in the military since June 2016. Trump, in a series of tweets on July 26, announced that he planned to end that policy. The government ""will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military,"" he tweeted, contending that their service entailed ""tremendous medical costs and disruption."" The lawsuit, filed by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, says such a ban is unconstitutional, denying transgender service members equal protection and due process. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff says transgender people can continue serving for now in the United States military. President Trump pro... Dozens hold ""Resist"" signs near a Times Square military recruitment center to show their anger at Trump's decision to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving in the military on July 26, 2017, in New York. Spencer Platt / Getty Images file Lawyers handling the lawsuit said they hoped the court would move swiftly to prevent a ban from taking effect, given the uncertainty that transgender service members now face in regard to their livelihoods and retirement benefits. ""The damage is happening now,"" said Jennifer Levi, Director of GLAD's Transgender Rights Project. ""These service members were told in June 2016 they could come out and continue to openly serve."" The five plaintiffs 〞 who were not identified in the lawsuit 〞 serve in the Air Force, the Coast Guard and the Army. Their years of service range from three years to two decades, and include tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Pentagon had no immediate comment. Named in the suit, along with Trump, are Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other national security officials. When Trump first tweeted his plan, Dunford said the military would not act on the tweets until a formal order to do so was issued by the president, who is also the commander-in-chief of the military. But a team of military lawyers has been pulled together to figure out how to handle the matter. The American Civil Liberties Union says it told the White House on Tuesday that it intends to sue, and requested that relevant documents be preserved in preparation for the lawsuit.?

North Korean state television said the launch would be sent as a warning to the U.S. -- pending approval from Kim Jong Un.

""The warheads that can be carried on my missiles are extremely powerful,"" he said -- ""much more powerful"" than the American bomb that levelled the Japanese city of Hiroshima during World War II. Up to 30 times more powerful, notes Martin, and the Kentucky is just one of several U.S. ballistic missile submarines which, on any given day, are hiding somewhere in the world's oceans. In a tweet yesterday, President Trump claimed he had updated and modernized the U.S. nuclear arsenal since he took office in January, saying ""it is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before."" ? President Trump followed up his tough talk on North Korea with a series of tweets touting the U.S.'s nuclear arsenal, which he called ""far strong... Nuclear weapons experts, however, including independent analyst Jon Wolfsthal, dispute the president's claim that any changes have occurred since he became commander in chief. ""There have been no changes to the U.S. nuclear arsenal,"" he tells CBS News. ""Some of the numbers have actually gone down from where they were when President Trump took office, so I view his statements as much more posturing and trying to project strength."" The Kentucky alone can carry enough nuclear weapons to annihilate North Korea. There is no question who would win a conflict between the U.S. and the North, says Martin. The question, which no one can answer yet, is can it be avoided?																																																																																																																					"
"Mike Pence, despite his recent protestations to the contrary, is clearly considering the possibility of running for president in 2020. And why wouldn't he? Given Donald Trump's anemic approval ratings, and the metastasizing Russia scandal, it would be political malpractice for Pence not to be preparing for the possibility. It would also be a disservice to the GOP, which may come to count on him to keep the White House in Republican hands. And like every politician of his stature, Pence clearly wants to be president, and a Trump implosion is likely his best shot of ever getting the chance. This is not to say that Trump is now doomed, or that he's invariably heading towards impeachment. In all likelihood, he'll be the Republican nominee in 2020, and will enjoy the profound electoral advantages given to any presidential incumbent. Despite all the baggage he has and continues to accumulate, he's still, at this very early stage, more likely to be reelected than not. FBI agents raided the home of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into possible collusion... For more on that point, look at the internal dysfunction of the Democratic Party, which shows no signs of abating in the near future. ""Resistance has given the Democrats the illusion of unity, but the reality is deeply conflicted,"" Franklin Foer wrote in a piece published this week by The Atlantic. ""Two of the party's largest concerns〞race and class〞reside in an increasing state of tension, a tension that will grow as the party turns toward the next presidential election."" A preview of this looming intraparty battle came when Kamala Harris, California's newly elected Democratic senator, was floated as a potential standard bearer for the Party's establishment. Almost instantly, leftists took aim at Harris and other candidates touted by the moderates, in particular former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Cory Booker, a New Jersey senator. Astounding how quickly the Bernie Sanders crew has mobilized against Kamala Harris. pic.twitter.com/ERUuhfFSvw Given the Democrats'?preoccupation with racial issues, it's worth noting that Harris, Patrick, and Booker are black. The African-American vote is essential to Democrats' success at the national level, a fact that's been obscured somewhat with their newfound fixation on the white working class. Hillary Clinton prevailed against Bernie Sanders in large part due to her support among black voters in the 2016 primary, providing a useful roadmap for establishmentarian Democrats looking to stave off a left-wing takeover of their party. And given the fall-off in minority turnout last cycle, there's an argument to be made that the Party shouldn't risk running a white nominee in the near future. If establishment Democrats successfully rally around someone like Harris, it would also open up her left-wing detractors to accusations of racism and sexism, however unfounded. Accusing opponents of bigotry can be a bit of a reflex with some liberals; an undercurrent of Foer's article is the tendency of modern Democrats to not only view Republicans as hopelessly racist, but many of their own voters as well. Neera Tanden, a longtime Clinton ally and president of the Center for American Progress, has already begun to insinuate that race has something to do with leftist objections to Harris and Booker. So odd, no, that these folks have if in for Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.... hhhhmmm. Needless to say, a Democratic primary openly fought along the lines of race and class is likely to get astoundingly ugly. And given the likelihood that more than a dozen Democrats could easily wind up running in 2020, each attempting to break out via naked appeals to various subsections of the base, it's not hard to imagine the Party hobbling into the general election after a contentious, bruising primary battle that leaves them weaker and less unified than they are today. The cultural dynamics of the Democratic Party may also preclude a concerted effort to win back the white working class that was largely responsible for Trump's crucial victories in Pennsylvania and the Midwest. Regardless of faction, nearly every Democratic-leaning intellectual and pundit agrees that the Party must adopt a more populist message. The question, which is sure to bedevil all Democratic aspirants for the presidency in 2020, is what the populism will look like, and which demographics it should prioritize.? Does populism mean some combination single payer, a minimum wage hike, and a massive expansion in the welfare state? Leftists say yes, though all of that would necessitate trillions of dollars in new taxes, which could scare away the moderate professionals Democrats have been cultivating for years. Does populism mean a continued focus on identity politics, increased immigration, and charges of institutional discrimination? Well, these are the cultural fault lines that in large part scared away white working class voters in the first place, and doubling down will probably alienate them further. The obvious compromise for Democrats is to combine both ways of thinking, which would mark the Party's transformation into an aggressively left-wing coalition in the mold of Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. In this scenario, the Democrats would not pick between class war and culture war, instead choosing to fight the Republicans on both fronts. Perhaps there's a hidden pining among the broad electorate for this kind of unabashed leftism, but chances are there isn't, and that such a pivot would result in moderates fleeing the party en masse. A profound leftward shift could pave the way for an independent centrist candidate to pick off Democratic votes, which might allow Trump to win reelection despite subterranean approval ratings. This would be similar to the dynamic that's emerged in Maine in recent years, where the flamboyantly right-wing Republican Paul LePage is now in his second term as governor. Democrats are likely to have a lot going for them in 2020. Regardless of whether the GOP is led by Trump or Pence, it's difficult to imagine either being held in high esteem by voters. But what the Republicans do have is an opposition on the verge of war with itself, and that alone could ensure their continued political dominance into the next decade. ??

"Last Updated Aug 14, 2017 11:05 AM EDT Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday defended President Trump's response to the?attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend, but made clear that it's wrong to equate white nationalists with the people who protested against them. In an interview on ""CBS This Morning,"" Sessions said that Mr. Trump delivered a long statement Saturday about ""violence, bigotry and hatred."" ""He condemned it. He called for unity in our country. He was strong about that,"" Sessions said, adding that a White House spokesman on Sunday ""explicitly condemned it by name."" On Saturday, the president condemned the hatred, however, ""on many sides,"" a statement that prompted criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Asked if it's wrong to make a moral equivalence between the two groups, Sessions said, ""Absolutely."" ""Justice will be done. We're coming after these people. It cannot be tolerated in America,"" he said. Asked if his home state of Alabama should remove statues of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, Sessions said that cities and states ""have a right to decide their monuments and that nobody should use violence to stop them either way."" Sessions dismissed South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham's comment that white supremacists and hate groups have a ""friend"" in the White House. ""I don't believe that's the case,"" he said. ""We will not allow these extremist groups to obtain credibility -- morally, legally. They are unjustified in their actions and their approach to American democracy.""																																																																																																																					"
"BEDMINSTER, N.J.?〞 As President Donald Trump remained out of sight and silent, pressure mounted from both sides of the aisle for him to explicitly condemn white supremacists and hate groups involved in deadly, race-fueled clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump, who has been at his New Jersey golf club on a working vacation, was set to make a one-day return to Washington on Monday to sign an executive action on China's trade practices. But he will likely be unable to escape questions and criticism for his initial response to the Saturday's violence, for which he blamed bigotry on ""many sides."" His attorney general, Jeff Sessions, vigorously defended Trump in a nationally televised interview Monday morning, saying that Trump had ""clearly"" denounced such violence and ""he totally opposes"" the values of white supremacy organizations. In an interview that aired on NBC's ""Today"" show, Sessions also said Trump will be conferring with advisers and that the president would ""do what is correct"" in connection with the Virginia incident. The attorney general said a more sweeping condemnatory statement released by the White House on Sunday, a day after Trump's remarks, reflected the president's views. Democrats and Republicans are criticizing President Trump for not specifically condemning white supremacists and hate groups over the violence in... President Donald Trump said Saturday there was ""no place"" in the United States for the kind of violence that broke out at a white nationalist rally in Virginia and appealed to Americans to ""come together as one."" The White House statement came as Trump aides tried to stem the damage. Senior aides were dispatched to the morning news shows, yet they struggled at times to explain the president's position. The new White House statement explicitly denounced the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups, but it was attributed to an unnamed spokesperson and not the president himself. Vice President Mike Pence, traveling in South America, condemned ""these dangerous fringe groups"" and said they ""have no place in American public life and in the American debate."" Trump said nothing, save for a few retweets. One was about two Virginia state policemen killed in a helicopter crash while monitoring the Charlottesville protests, another about a Justice Department probe into the violence. In the hours after a car plowed into a group of anti-racist counter-protesters on Saturday, Trump addressed the violence in broad strokes, saying that he condemns ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides."" Speaking slowly from his New Jersey golf club while on a 17-day working vacation, Trump added: ""It's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump. Not Barack Obama. It's been going on for a long, long time."" The White House statement Sunday went further. ""The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred and of course that includes white Supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups."" It added: ""He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together."" The White House did not attach a name to the statement. Usually, a statement would be signed by the press secretary or another staffer; not putting a name to one eliminates an individual's responsibility for its truthfulness and often undercuts its significance. Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said Sunday that he considered the attack to be terrorism. On Saturday, Trump had not responded to reporters' shouted questions about terrorism. ""I certainly think anytime that you commit an attack against people to incite fear, it is terrorism,"" McMaster told ABC's ""This Week."" ∪It meets the definition of terrorism. But what this is, what you see here, is you see someone who is a criminal, who is committing a criminal act against fellow Americans."" The president's homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, defended the president's initial statement by suggesting that some of the counter-protesters were violent, too. When pressed during a contentious interview on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" he specifically condemned the racist groups. The president's daughter and White House aide, Ivanka Trump, tweeted Sunday morning: ""There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis."" Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said he spoke to Trump in the hours after the clashes and that he twice told the president ""we have to stop this hateful speech, this rhetoric."" He said he urged Trump ""to come out stronger"" against the actions of white supremacists. Republicans joined Democrats in criticizing the president for not specifically calling out white nationalists. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. said on NBC Sunday that ""This isn't a time for innuendo or to allow room to be read between the lines. This is a time to lay blame."" The president did not have any public events on Sunday. White House staff did not share any information on his activities except that he and his staff were monitoring the aftermath of the violence in Virginia. White nationalists had assembled in Charlottesville to vent their frustration against the city's plans to take down a statue of Confederal Gen. Robert E. Lee. Counter-protesters massed in opposition. Alt-right leader Richard Spencer and former Ku Klux Klan member David Duke attended the demonstrations. Duke told reporters that the white nationalists were working to ""fulfill the promises of Donald Trump."" Trump's initial comments drew praise from the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, which wrote: ""Trump comments were good. He didn't attack us. He just said the nation should come together. Nothing specific against us. ... No condemnation at all."" The website had been promoting the Charlottesville demonstration as part of its ""Summer of Hate"" edition. Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer, a Democrat, slammed Trump's stance toward hate groups, saying on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that he hopes Trump ""looks himself in the mirror and thinks very deeply about who he consorted with."" ""Old saying: when you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, the devil changes you,"" Signer said. In Cartagena, Colombia, Pence responded to a reporter's question about the violence in Charlottesville and said, in part: ""We have no tolerance for hate and violence, white supremacists or neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms."" Trump, as a presidential candidate, frequently came under scrutiny for being slow to offer his condemnation of white supremacists. His strongest denunciation of the movement has not come voluntarily, only when asked, and he occasionally trafficked in retweets of racist social media posts during his campaign. His chief strategist, Steve Bannon, once declared that his former news site, Breitbart, was ""the platform for the alt-right.""

"CARTAGENA, Colombia -- Vice President Mike Pence is demonstrating the delicate balancing act that has thus far defined his term, walking a line during a trip to Latin America between the region's opposition to possible U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, and President Donald Trump's surprising refusal to rule out that option. Speaking during a joint news conference with Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos shortly after his arrival Sunday, Pence also declined to rule out possible military action against Venezuelan President Nicol芍s Maduro, whose efforts to consolidate power in the country have drawn alarm. Still, Pence stressed the U.S. would much prefer what he called a ""peaceable"" solution to the growing political and humanitarian crisis. Several people were arrested after an attack on a military base in Venezuela, as political unrest continues. Patricia Mazzei, a political writer ... ""President Trump is a leader who says what he means and means what he says,"" Pence said. ""But the president sent me here to continue to marshal the unprecedented support of countries across Latin America to achieve by peaceable means the restoration of democracy in Venezuela, and we believe it is achievable by those means."" Mr. Trump's startling comments Friday sparked backlash across the region, including from Venezuela's chief opposition coalition and the Colombian government. Standing at Pence's side in Cartagena after the two met, Santos said he had repeatedly told Pence in no uncertain terms that the U.S. must not even consider military action in response to Venezuela's crisis. The two countries are important allies, Santos said. ""But since friends have to tell each other the truth, I have told Vice President Pence that the possibility of a military intervention shouldn't even be considered, neither in Colombia nor in Latin America,"" Santos said through a translator. ""America is a continent of peace. It is the land of peace. Let us preserve it as such."" An economic meltdown in Venezuela is at the heart of the political crisis there. An inflation rate of 800 percent has decimated savings, and some... Analysists said Mr. Trump's comments played into Maduro's hands by awakening dark memories of U.S. intervention in the region and making it harder for other Latin American countries to join the anti-Maduro coalition. ""The phantom of military interventions in Latin America disappeared a long time ago, and we don't want it to return,"" Santos said. Pence emphasized the U.S. will work together with many nations in Venezuela's ""neighborhood"" to pressure Maduro so that democracy can be restored. ""We simply will not accept the emergence of a dictatorship in our hemisphere,"" he said, continuing the tough talk that has been Mr. Trump's approach to Maduro. ""The United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles,"" he said. Pence also addressed the deadly violence that broke out Saturday during a march by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, using words the president would not. ""We have no tolerance for hate and violence, white supremacists or neo-Nazis or the KKK,"" Pence said. ""These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms."" Mr. Trump has been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for not singling out those groups directly in a lengthy Saturday statement and instead blaming ""many sides"" for the violence. Pence also addressed a spike in coca production in Colombia, saying the worsening crisis required ""swift action to protect the people of both our countries."" A July report from the United Nations showed that coca production in Colombia had reached levels not seen in two decades, complicating Colombia's efforts to make its vast, lawless countryside more secure. Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami lashed out at Pence, rejecting what he called ""interventionist"" comments intended to hide the failure of US anti-narcotics policies in Colombia. He dismissed Pence's meeting with Santos as ""an encounter between the world's largest producer of drugs and the nation with the most consumers."" El Aissami was sanctioned by the Trump administration in February for allegedly running a drug trafficking network of corrupt officials in Venezuela. Pence and his wife, Karen, arrived Sunday in Colombia for a six-day, four-country trip through the region. Pence has other stops scheduled in Argentina, Chile and Panama, giving speeches and meeting with leaders. White House officials tried Sunday to explain Mr. Trump's decision to raise the prospect of possible military action in Venezuela. CIA Director Mike Pompeo said Trump was trying ""to give the Venezuelan people hope and opportunity to create a situation where democracy can be restored."" Pompeo told ""Fox News Sunday"" that Venezuela ""could very much become a risk"" to the U.S. if it descended into further chaos. Yet a Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee who calls himself ""a pretty hawkish guy"" expressed skepticism about the idea of American troops in Caracas. ""I have no idea why we would use military force in Venezuela. I'm open-minded to a reason, but at the end of the day, our military should be deployed when there's a national security interest that can be articulated to the American people,"" South Carolina's Lindsey Graham told ""'Fox News Sunday."" Mr. Trump's national security adviser, who has previously warned against military talk, said the Trump administration wants to get a handle on the current situation under Maduro's embattled government and ""understand better how this crisis might evolve."" ""The president never takes options off the table in any of these situations and what we owe him are options,"" H.R. McMaster told ABC's ""This Week.""																																																																																																																					"
"The White House has made raising the debt ceiling this fall seem like a simple task, but a looming conservative uprising will likely make it a highly contentious and complicated effort. Trump administration officials have made their request to Congress crystal clear: Pass the ""cleanest possible"" debt limit increase despite calls from conservatives who demand spending cuts to go along with it. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney delivered that message at a briefing with reporters earlier this month once the House had already left Capitol Hill for a month-long recess.? The hike, Mulvaney said, should be tied to a continuing resolution (CR) that would keep the government funded past Sept. 30 and would prevent a shutdown. This would likely extend the debt limit and government funding battle into December. That proposal won't fly with the conservative Freedom Caucus in the House. ""We just don't think that's the right approach,"" a Freedom Caucus source told CBS News. ""Why when we have Republicans in the House, the Senate and the White House are we doing what we criticized Democrats for doing for eight years, which is just clean raising of the debt ceiling without big structural reforms?"" The House speaker discusses how Congress and the Trump administration plan to deal with the debt ceiling Rep. Mark Walker, R-North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, has echoed that position in an op-ed in the Washington Examiner, arguing against a ""clean"" increase. Walker says that any legislation should reflect the Republicans' support for a smaller federal government. ""It is what our voters expected when they brought this historic party unity, and it is how they will measure our success. The buck stops with us,"" he wrote. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has been calling on lawmakers for months to raise the debt ceiling to avoid defaulting on the nation's debt. Congress will likely have to pass an increase by the end of September because the beginning to middle of October has been eyed as the drop-dead deadline. The government has been relying on so-called extraordinary measures to continue borrowing and have sufficient cash to make its usual payments since mid-March, when the suspension of the debt ceiling expired. Mnuchin huddled with Republican and Democratic leaders -- Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer -- at the beginning of August to discuss the plan to lift the debt ceiling when Congress returns to Washington in September. ""We are going to be looking for a way forward to do that together to make sure America continues to never, ever default,"" McConnell told reporters. The bipartisan nature of the initial discussions so far is unusual considering the fact that Republicans have always put up a fight over the debt ceiling when President Obama was in office, and now they are in control of the White House and Congress. But they may have come to terms with two issues: the Senate's 60-vote procedural hurdle and the fact that they are way behind on their legislative agenda. The GOP Congress hasn't passed a budget resolution or tax reform, they've failed to pass a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and they haven't passed an infrastructure package or border wall funding. Jim Dyer, principal at Podesta Group who specializes in budget and appropriations, suspects that GOP leaders will have to make a sales pitch on the debt ceiling to conservative members that could sound along the lines of, ""'Look, if you really believe that tax reform may be the key to your political survival, then you have got to be with us and you have got to support us, keeping the levers of power going until we can accomplish these things.'"" Still, conservatives are going to make their frustration heard when they return to Capitol Hill. Heritage Action Vice President Dan Holler said that a debt ceiling hike should be paired with ""serious spending reforms"" that begin to reduce federal spending, adding that ""Congress cannot simply kick the can down the road."" However, Bill Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center, thinks that kicking the can down the road is inevitable. This partly stems from the fact that the House is only scheduled to be in session 12 days in September. ""I'm beginning to think that we're looking at a suspension of the debt limit for a period of time as we continue to negotiate,"" he said. ""I just don't think 12 or 17 days in September is going to be enough time to work out all these angles."" Lawmakers last lifted the debt ceiling almost two years ago as part of a bipartisan budget agreement that also lifted spending levels for two years for both defense and non-defense domestic programs. Those spending caps will expire at the end of September and more serious limits on spending set by a 2011 law will return in 2018 unless Congress passes a similar deal. There may be an appetite for another budget agreement -- after all, Congress has twice approved a budget deal of this kind since 2013. In fact, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, negotiated the first one with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, when they chaired the Budget Committees.? The support among President Trump and congressional Republicans for an increase in military spending could also justify one. Democrats, however, have always made clear that they wouldn't agree to an increase in defense spending unless it's coupled with a boost to nondefense programs, which cover the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Veterans Affairs, for example. Tying a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase to a budget deal that lifts spending caps likely would not be supported by the Freedom Caucus, which plans to continue exert pressure on the White House and leadership in September. ""I do think that the base cares about [the debt limit] so I'm guessing the White House is going to hear a bit of pushback and maybe that will change things,"" the Freedom Caucus source said. The Freedom Caucus came out against a ""clean"" debt ceiling hike in May, and has proposed a menu of options that could get its members to back an increase. The group, for instance, would support measures that would pay interest on the debt and put structural reforms in place.? Another idea that's being circulated is codifying into law one of the president's executive orders on regulations. This would open up the possibility of the Freedom Caucus supporting a debt ceiling increase if it were tied to a measure that would require the elimination of two former regulations for every new regulation. Nothing is set in stone: ""House Republicans discussing [the plan] with the Senate and the administration, and we will act before the deadline,"" said AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for Speaker Ryan. In the last two debt limit debates, leadership eventually ignored the Freedom Caucus and turned to Democrats to pass an increase. ""I think you get to a point around here where you're not going to let these people run the place,"" Dyer said. ""It's going to be run by the leadership and they're going to do what they have to do to get these things done because their agenda is not going anywhere without some government continuity here.""

"Last Updated Aug 13, 2017 11:46 PM EDT Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has been under increased security the past three weeks after a possible threat to his life was uncovered by the U.S. government, CBS Miami confirms. CBS Miami has obtained a memo detailing the threat, written by a federal agency, and sent to local law enforcement through the Department of Homeland Security. CBS Miami agreed not to show the memo and to not cite names, locations or identifying information. The Miami Herald first reported the memo on Sunday. The two page memo is marked ""law enforcement sensitive"" but does not appear to be classified. The U.S. became aware of a ""possible threat against Florida United States Senator Marco Rubio"" and refers to a ""potentially grave threat to Sen. Rubio."" The Trump administration slapped economic sanctions on Nicolas Maduro, the president of Venezuela. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Maduro ... The memo says the threat comes from Diosdado Cabello, a top Venezuelan lawmaker who is a former top military official. However, the memo stresses the information concerning the possible assassination plot is not corroborated. Rubio is known for being a harsh critic of the Venezuelan regime. Last month, Rubio called Cabello the ""Pablo Escobar of Venezuela."" Rubio has been under increased security the last three weeks or so, beginning in Washington and now in South Florida. ""The U.S. Capitol Police [USCP] is responsible for the security of members of Congress. It would be inappropriate for DHS to comment on the seriousness of the threat.

"Last Updated Aug 14, 2017 12:44 AM EDT BEDMINSTER, N.J. -- The White House on Sunday defended President Trump's reaction to the events that rattled Charlottesville, Virginia the previous day. A day of violent clashes between white nationalists and counter-protesters ended with a car slamming into the counter-protesters, killing one woman and leaving 19 others injured. ""The president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremists groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together,"" a White House spokesman said in a statement. The White House would not attach a staffer's name to the statement. Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer joins ""Face the Nation"" moderator John Dickerson to discuss the violence in Charlottesville. The president has drawn criticism from Republicans and Democrats for not explicitly denouncing white supremacists in the aftermath of the violent clashes in Virginia, with lawmakers saying he needs to take a public stand against groups that espouse racism and hate. Vice President Mike Pence, traveling in South America, condemned ""these dangerous fringe groups"" and said they ""have no place in American public life and in the American debate."" In Cartagena, Colombia, Pence responded to a reporter's question about the violence in Charlottesville and said, in part,""We have no tolerance for hate and violence, white supremacists or neo-Nazis or the KKK. These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate, and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms.""? On ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Leon Panetta, who previously served as White House chief of staff, defense secretary and CIA director, said the president's failure to call out the groups by name sends the wrong message.? ""His failure to address what really happened in Charlottesville, and the role of white supremacists, I think also sends a message that he is not recognizing the real causes of crises even within our own country,"" Panetta said. Mr. Trump, on a working vacation at his New Jersey golf club, addressed the nation Saturday soon after a grey Dodge plowed into a group of anti-racist counter-protesters in Charlottesville, a college town where neo-Nazis and white nationalists had assembled to march. The president did not single out any groups in his remarks, instead accusing ""many sides"" of violence. Mr. Trump condemned, ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides."" He added: ""It's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump. Not Barack Obama. It's been going on for a long, long time."" ""Hate and the division must stop, and must stop right now,"" he said. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation and ... true affection for each other."" The president did not answer questions from reporters about whether he rejected the support of white nationalists or whether he believed the car crash was an example of domestic terrorism. Aides who appeared on the Sunday news shows said the White House did believe those things, but many fellow Republicans demanded that Mr. Trump personally denounce the white supremacists. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, tweeted: ""Mr. President -- we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism."" Praying for those hurt & killed today in Charlottesville. This is nothing short of domestic terrorism & should be named as such. Added Sen.

Very important for the nation to hear @potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists GOP Chris Christie of New Jersey, a staunch Trump supporter, wrote: ""We reject the racism and violence of white nationalists like the ones acting out in Charlottesville. Everyone in leadership must speak out."" On the Democrat side, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of New York said ""of course we condemn ALL that hate stands for. Until @POTUS specifically condemns alt-right action in Charlottesville, he hasn't done his job."" Of course we condemn ALL that hate stands for. Until @POTUS specifically condemns alt-right action in Charlottesville, he hasnt done his job And Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, who spoke to Trump in the hours after the clashes, said he twice ""said to him we have to stop this hateful speech, this rhetoric."" He urged Mr. Trump ""to come out stronger"" against the actions of white supremacists. Mr. Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said Sunday that he considered the attack in Charlottesville to be terrorism: ""I certainly think anytime that you commit an attack against people to incite fear, it is terrorism,"" McMaster told ABC's ""This Week."" ""It meets the definition of terrorism. But what this is, what you see here, is you see someone who is a criminal, who is committing a criminal act against fellow Americans."" Was the President's condemnation enough? Many GOP leaders are questioning President Trump's response to the deadly protest in Charlottesville. Ar... The president's homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, defended Mr. Trump's statement by saying that some of the counter-protesters were violent, too. When pressed, he did specifically condemn the racist groups. The president's daughter and White House aide, Ivanka Trump, tweeted Sunday morning: ""There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis."" White nationalists had assembled in Charlottesville to protest against the city's plan to take down a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Counter-protesters massed in opposition.? On Saturday, after hours of violent encounters between the two groups, a car drove into a crowd of people peacefully protesting against the white nationalist rally. The driver was later taken into custody. Alt-right leader Richard Spencer and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke attended the demonstrations. Duke told reporters that the white nationalists were working to, ""fulfill the promises of Donald Trump."" Mr. Trump's reaction drew praise from neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, which wrote: ""Trump comments were good. He didn't attack us. He just said the nation should come together. Nothing specific against us... No condemnation at all."" The website had been promoting the Charlottesville demonstration as part of its ""Summer of Hate"" edition. Mayor Michael Signer, a Democrat, said he was disgusted that the white nationalists had come to his town and he blamed Mr. Trump for inflaming racial prejudices with his campaign last year. ""I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in America today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president,"" he said. Mr. Trump, as a candidate, frequently came under scrutiny for being slow to offer his condemnation of white supremacists. Across the country, people rallied for peace in honor of the victims of the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Paula Reid reports. Meanwhile, the University of Virginia (UVA) office of the president Teresa A. Sullivan released a statement on Sunday calling out the violence and offered condolences to the lives lost over the weekend. ""The University supports the First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceable assembly. Acts of violence, however, are not protected by the First Amendment,"" the statement read. ""Violence and bigotry are not political positions. We strongly condemn intimidating and abhorrent behavior intended to strike fear and sow division in our community."" The statement added, ""As a public institution, we value diversity, inclusion and mutual respect. We value an environment in which learning happens. The views of many of the groups who converged on Charlottesville are in direct contradiction with this. There were racist, anti-immigrant, homophobic and misogynistic chants. Such rhetoric is not intended to bring us together; it is intended to drive us apart."" Thousands of students and hundreds of faculty and staff will convene on UVA next weekend for a new academic term, the statement said, and the campus will provide safety and health resources.

"Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Sunday that if North Korea takes a wrong step, the U.S. has the capability to wipe the regime ""off the face of the Earth."" ""I think the North Koreans understand that if they take the wrong step, it's the end of the regime, period,"" Panetta said in an interview on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" Responding to President Trump's rhetoric toward North Korea last week, Panetta said that he's never felt that you can ""out-bully a bully by trying to threaten that individual with words."" ""The reality is, what speaks the loudest for the United States of America is the fact that we're the most powerful country on the face of the Earth and we have the military capability to wipe that regime off the face of the Earth."" He said the U.S. must convey a clear strategy of ""containment and deterrence"" and added that the country needs a president who is steady, calm, responsible, ""and who recognizes that the most important thing right now is to find a way that we do not get into a war.""? The president's ""fire and fury"" and ""locked and loaded"" remarks on North Korea last week, Panetta said, have ""frankly created even greater tensions in that part of the world."" On the weekend violence in Virginia, Panetta said President Trump's ""failure to address what really happened in Charlottesville, and the role of white supremacists, I think, also sends a message that he is not recognizing the real causes of crises, even within our own country."" Panetta also contradicted current CIA Director Mike Pompeo's characterization,?in a separate interview on ""Face the Nation,""?of the progress made by North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. Pompeo dismissed reports that the North's weapons programs had advanced faster than previously expected. ""That's actually not true,"" Pompeo said. ""It's not moving faster than policymakers knew."" Panetta disagreed: ""I think that the rapid nature of how they've been able to come to that capability is something, frankly, that has surprised both the United States and the world.""

""In fact, this administration has done a fine job of not drawing red lines that we're not prepared to enforce,"" Pompeo added.

Mr. Trump, Pompeo said, has made it ""very clear"" that the U.S. finds it ""unacceptable for a rogue leader like Kim Jong Un to have the capacity, a ballistic missile with a warhead, that has integrated and fully deliverable to the United States, and to hold America and the world at risk. He finds that unacceptable and he is simply not going to permit it to happen."" Pompeo dismissed reports that North Korea's nuclear and missile program are moving faster than previously thought. ""That's actually not true,"" he said. ""It's not moving faster than policymakers knew."" Pompeo said that the U.S. was, ""not at an imminent risk of an attack taking place today"" from North Korea. ""It's not something that is imminent and the American people should know that this administration is doing everything within its power, the president has enabled the intelligence community, the Department of Defense, to be sure that we're protecting America from this threat."" Pompeo also added that the goal, from the administration's standpoint, remains a ""denuclearized"" Korean peninsula.

That has to stop and it can stop now."" The mayor criticized Mr. Trump for his statement on Saturday, in which he says the president should have called out the white nationalist, neo-Nazi groups by name. CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid joins ""Face the Nation"" moderator John Dickerson to share the latest on the violent events in Charlottesvill... ""I didn't hear the words 'white supremacy,' and I think it's important to call it for what it is,"" he said.

He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together."" Host John Dickerson also asked Mayor Signer to respond to the Washington Post's characterization of Charlottesville law enforcement agencies' response to the clashes as ""anemic.""

"President Trump says the U.S. military is ""locked and loaded"" in its confrontation with North Korea. But how exactly would all that firepower be used? Here's David Martin at the Pentagon: Behind the ""fire and fury"" rhetoric, there is one very hard fact: If the U.S. were to unleash its military power against North Korea, it would result -- in Secretary of Defense James Mattis' words -- in ""the end of its regime and the destruction of its people."" Before he retired, Admiral James Winnefeld was the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the number two man in uniform, during the Obama Administration.? He knows that one submarine like the USS Kentucky can by itself carry enough nuclear weapons to annihilate North Korea. When asked to compare America's nuclear forces to Korean nuclear forces, Adm. Winnefeld replied, ""Well, there's just no comparison whatsoever."" Martin asked, ""Were Kim Jong Un, for whatever reason, to launch a nuclear weapon against the United States, would he, in essence, be committing suicide?"" ""Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, there is just no question that we would undertake a proportional response,"" Adm. Winnefeld replied. ""But in the case of a nuclear weapon, that proportional response would be overwhelming and would probably mean the end of the Kim regime -- and he knows it."" The submarine USS Kentucky can carry up to 24 Trident II D-5 ballistic missiles, each with multiple independently-targeted warheads. ""But people say this guy's different -- young, brash, unpredictable. Do you think the logic of overwhelming force really means much to him?"" ""I think it does. The people I've spoken to in the intelligence community and elsewhere, and my own judgment, is that even though he's young and he's brash, he's not irrational. He's not suicidal."" But Kim knows one other thing: Even in defeat he could cause horrendous destruction to his enemies in South Korea, as Defense Secretary Mattis made clear to John Dickerson of ""Face the Nation"" in his only television interview: Defense Secretary James Mattis is interviewed on Face the Nation. ""A conflict in North Korea, John, would be probably the worst kind of fighting in most people's lifetimes,"" he said. Kim would take tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of innocent people down with him. ""The North Korean regime has hundreds of artillery cannons and rocket launchers within range of one of the most densely-populated cities on Earth, which is the capital of South Korea,"" said Mattis. Kim -- like his father and grandfather before him -- has lived under what he believes to be the constant threat of an attack from the south.? That fear (some would call it paranoia) is what is driving his quest for a nuclear weapon. ""He wants to have what we would view as a credible nuclear threat so we won't attack him,"" WInnefeld said, ""which is sort of ludicrous because we don't have any intent to attack him in the first place."" ""So this is his great equalizer against the great American superpower?"" Martin asked. ""It's his insurance policy, in his view."" Although Kim has tested missiles with a range great enough to hit the United States, and is credited with being able to produce a nuclear warhead small enough to go on top of those missiles, he is not yet insured. To have a reliable weapon, his scientists still must develop a nose cone that can shield that warhead from the heat and vibration of entering the Earth's atmosphere. The Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that could happen as soon as next year. Eventually, Winnefeld said, the day is coming: ""They are going to get there."" The U.S. military has been preparing for that day for the past 15 years, spending $40 billion on radars and interceptor missiles to shoot down an incoming North Korean warhead. Earlier this year, the ballistic missile defense system shot down a mock North Korean ICBM launched from an atoll in the Pacific. ""No system's perfect, to be sure,"" Adm. Winnefeld said, ""but I've got a lot of faith in that system."" ""No system is perfect, but when you're dealing with nuclear weapons, one getting through is an absolute catastrophe,"" said Martin. ""It is."" But look at it from Kim's point of view; he could not be certain a nuclear armed missile would get through the missile defense system, but he could be certain that if he tried, it would be the end of his regime. ""I think At the end of the day,"" said Adm. Winnefeld, ""two essential facts stand out: The first is, it's very unlikely that he will ever willingly give up his program. But it's also very, very unlikely that he will ever use it, as long as we don't try to overthrow his regime."" Can the U.S. live with that? It's up to the commander-in-chief, who has said he will not allow North Korea to threaten America or its allies.

"SEOUL, South Korea -- Chinese President Xi Jinping made a plea for cool-headedness over escalating tensions between the U.S. and North Korea in a phone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday, urging both sides to avoid words or actions that could worsen the situation. The call came after Mr. Trump unleashed a slew of fresh threats against North Korea on Friday, declaring the U.S. military ""locked and loaded"" and warning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that he ""will regret it fast"" if he takes any action against U.S. territories or allies. Mr. Trump has pushed China to pressure North Korea to halt a nuclear weapons program that is nearing the capability of targeting the United States. China is the North's biggest economic partner and source of aid, but says it alone can't compel Pyongyang to end its nuclear and missile programs. The White House said in a statement that Mr. Trump and Xi ""agreed North Korea must stop its provocative and escalatory behavior."" It also said that the two ""reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" But White House readouts of calls with foreign leaders in the Trump era are notoriously sparse in detail.? State-run China Central Television quoted Xi as telling Trump the ""relevant parties must maintain restraint and avoid words and deeds that would exacerbate the tension on the Korean Peninsula."" But restraint was not the word of the day on Friday as Mr. Trump sent out a cascade of unscripted statements, including what appeared to be another red line - the mere utterance of threats - that would trigger a U.S. attack against North Korea and ""big, big trouble"" for Kim. North Korea's Minju Joson newspaper, meanwhile, lashed back at the U.S. in an editorial Saturday. ""The powerful revolutionary Paektusan army of the DPRK, capable of fighting any war the U.S. wants, is now on the standby to launch fire into its mainland, waiting for an order of final attack,"" it said. DPRK stands for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The tough talk capped a week in which long-standing tensions between the countries risked abruptly boiling over. New United Nations sanctions condemning the North's rapidly developing nuclear program drew fresh ire and threats from Pyongyang. Trump, responding to a report that U.S. intelligence indicates Pyongyang can now put a nuclear warhead on its long-range missiles, vowed to rain down ""fire and fury"" if challenged. The North then came out with a threat to lob four intermediate-range ""Hwasong-12"" missiles near Guam, a tiny U.S. territory some 2,000 miles from Pyongyang. At the epicenter of the rhetoric, Mr. Trump's New Jersey golf course, the president seemed to put Kim on notice, saying, ""If he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat - which by the way he has been uttering for years and his family has been uttering for years - or he does anything with respect to Guam or anyplace else that's an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast."" Asked if the U.S. was going to war, he said cryptically, ""I think you know the answer to that."" But Mr. Trump's comments did not appear to be backed by significant military mobilization on either side of the Pacific, and an important, quiet diplomatic channel remained open. As a precaution, Japan deployed missile defense batteries under the path a North Korean missile might take. Life on the streets of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, also remained calm. There have been no air raid drills or cars in camouflage netting as has been the case during previous crises. State-run media ensures that the population gets the North Korean side of the story, but doesn't convey any sense of international concern about the situation. U.S. officials say they will be going ahead with long-scheduled military exercises with South Korea. Pyongyang says it will be ready to send its missile launch plan to Kim for approval just before or as the drills begin. Called Ulchi-Freedom Guardian, the exercises are expected to run Aug. 21-31 and involve tens of thousands of American and South Korean troops on the ground and in the sea and air. North Korea claims the exercises are a rehearsal for war, but Washington and Seoul say they are necessary to deter North Korean aggression. Mr. Trump began his Friday barrage with an especially fiery tweet: ""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!"" He later retweeted a posting from U.S. Pacific Command that showed B-1B Lancer bomber planes on Guam that ""stand ready to fulfill USFK's #FightTonight mission if called upon to do so."" ''Fight tonight"" has long been the motto of U.S. forces in South Korea to show they're always ready for combat on the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Trump also brushed away calls for caution from other world leaders, including Germany's Angela Merkel. ""I don't see a military solution and I don't think it's called for,"" Merkel said Friday, calling on the U.N. Security Council to continue to address the crisis. ""I think escalating the rhetoric is the wrong answer,"" Merkel added. ""Let her speak for Germany,"" Mr. Trump said, when asked about the comment. ""Perhaps she is referring to Germany. She's certainly not referring to the United States, that I can tell you."" By evening, he seemed to have mellowed a bit. ""Hopefully it'll all work out,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump."" Speaking to Guam Gov. Eddie Calvo, he promised: ""You are safe. We are with you a thousand percent.""																																																																																																																					"

Mr. Trump on Friday promised ""big, big trouble"" if North Korea targets the U.S. territory of Guam, and said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will ""regret it fast"" if that happens.? Earlier Friday, Mr. Trump dismissed critics who wonder if he is escalating tensions with North Korea. ""Well you know my critics are only saying that because it's me,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""If somebody else uttered the exact same words that I uttered, they'd say 'what a great statement, what a wonderful statement.' They're only doing it but I will tell you, we have tens of millions of people in this country that are so happy with what I'm saying because they're saying finally we have a president that's sticking up for our nation and frankly sticking up for friends and our allies."" Earlier this week, North Korea announced it is planning to launch rockets that would fly over the islands of Japan and into the ocean, and could land 18 to 25 miles away from the U.S. airbase on Guam. North Korean state television said the launch would be a warning to the U.S.?																																																																																																																					"
"PENTAGON -- When it comes to North Korea, the U.S. military has been ""locked and loaded"" for years.

Officials say if the North fired a missile at the American homeland or a U.S. military base overseas, the Pentagon would first try to shoot it down. Then second, the U.S. would retaliate with an attack of its own, perhaps with a cyber weapon.

But retired Adm. James Winnefeld, formerly the No. 2 man in uniform, says that would be a long shot. ""It's a very difficult target,"" Winnefeld told CBS News. ""It's a very mountainous country. They have buried much of what they do. It's very hard to locate. So it's a very risky operation to try to take all of those diverse and dispersed targets out at one time.""?

"The House Freedom Caucus on Friday launched a petition to force a vote on the House floor on a straight Obamacare repeal bill, meaning the fight over health care isn't dead 〞 at least, not yet. The group of conservative Republicans needs 218 members to sign the discharge petition to bring H. Res. 458, a clean repeal of Obamacare, to the floor for a vote. The petition is a type of parliamentary procedure used to bypass the committee process. A handful of House Freedom Caucus members, including Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Tom Garrett (R-Virginia), and Scott Perry (R-Pennsylvania) signed the petition from the House floor on Friday.? ""It's critical that we keep our promise to the American people and repeal Obamacare and replace it with a policy that works for American families,"" said caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-North Carolina), in a statement.""We cannot drag this process out any longer. This bill 每 with a two-year delay on implementation of repeal 每 will force Congress to come together on a replacement bill. President Trump is eager to sign repeal and replace, it's time we get to work and send both to his desk."" The petition is an attempt to push forward the stalled health care reform in Congress. The House passed a bill to repeal and replace parts of Obamacare in May, but the Senate failed to do so twice, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Republicans made it clear the Senate is moving on to other issues like tax reform.? Chances of a straight Obamacare repeal in the House or the Senate don't look good. The Senate rejected a clean Obamacare repeal bill last month.?

"The Trump administration has filed a brief to the Supreme Court defending the president's revised travel ban as the exercise of the president's broad powers to exclude aliens from U.S. territory for national security reasons. Jeffrey Wall, the acting solicitor general, argued in the brief filed Thursday that the federal appeals courts in Richmond and San Francisco that stayed the ban should ""not second-guess the political branches' decisions to exclude aliens abroad."" The ban, which excludes refugees and citizens of Syria, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Libya from entering the U.S., stems from President Trump's revised executive order signed in March. An earlier version, which also banned Iraqis from the U.S., was signed in January but was stymied by lawsuits. The Supreme Court ruled that the ban would be blocked in cases applying to travelers with a bona-fide relationship with people or entities in the U.S. Two appeals courts blocked the ban from taking effect, but the Supreme Court in June ruled that much of the ban could be implemented. The Supreme Court will hear the case on Oct. 10.? The U.S. Supreme Court upheld part of a lower court ruling on President Trump's travel ban Wednesday, while allowing a strict ban on refugees to ... The 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Virginia, said the ban was ""rooted in religious animus"" toward Muslims, relying both on Mr. Trump's campaign remarks, in which he promised to ban Muslims, and on tweets and remarks he's made since he's been president. Among those post-campaign remarks was one he made as he signed the travel ban. Wall argued that the 4th Circuit erred in concluding the president's comment as he signed the original executive order -- ""we all know what that means"" -- was meant to be an exclusion of Muslims. Immediately before that comment, Mr. Trump had said of the order that ""this is the protection of the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States."" ""[T]he President's passing remark is reasonably understood to refer to terrorist groups like ISIL and al Qaeda, not all Muslims,"" Wall argued, although he conceded, ""It is at least ambiguous,"" and given that ambiguity, ""the court erred in setting aside an Executive Order of the President based on an offhand, six-word comment made in connection with a prior directive."" The 9th Circuit, in San Francisco, said that the ban does not comply with federal immigration law, which bars discrimination based on nationality. This court also stayed parts of the ban keeping all refugees out for 120 days and cutting by over half the cap on refugees under current law. Mr. Trump cut the number of refugees to 50,000 ?(a number that was just reached in the U.S.), whereas the prior number was 110,000.

"BATON ROUGE, La. -- A Louisiana private investigator accused of trying to illegally obtain President Trump's tax returns before last year's U.S. presidential election has been arrested for violating conditions of his pretrial release, prosecutors said.? Jordan Hamlett, 32, committed ""numerous violations,"" including hacking into email and social media accounts of a man at the request of the man's wife and traveling out of state without approval, prosecutors wrote in court records unsealed Friday.? Hamlett also accessed the internet with devices that are not monitored, prosecutors said. Last year, Hamlett tried unsuccessfully to obtain Mr. Trump's tax returns using a U.S. Department of Education financial aid website, prosecutors said. Federal agents arrested him on a charge that he misused a Social Security number in the effort.? Hamlett's attorney accused agents of tricking his client by luring him to a Baton Rouge hotel where they questioned him on Oct. 27, less than two weeks before the election.? At that time, the agents did not know whether Hamlett had been successful in obtaining Mr. Trump's tax returns, prosecutors said in court records. The agents feared a public release of the documents could influence the election, according to a transcript of testimony obtained by The Associated Press.? Hamlett's lawyer didn't immediately return phone and email messages Friday. On Wednesday, a judge ordered him held by the U.S. Marshals Service but left open the possibility he could return to home detention at some point while awaiting his December trial.? Court records describe how federal agents in October worried that Hamlett could be armed as they orchestrated an elaborate operation to lure him to the Embassy Suites in Baton Rouge for questioning. Plainclothes officers blended in with guests inside the hotel. Other officers took up positions outside.? Hamlett agreed to an interview in the hotel's atrium and the agents questioned him for hours in hushed tones inside the crowded lobby, authorities said.? Hamlett immediately took credit for his ""genius idea"" to seek Mr. Trump's tax returns from a U.S. Education Department financial aid website -- even before he was accused of anything, Treasury Department Special Agent Samuel Johnson testified.?

"Last Updated Aug 11, 2017 4:17 PM EDT The Department of Health and Human Services is cutting off grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs across the country, leaving the groups that receive the grants -- and Democratic members of Congress -- perplexed.? The dozens of localities that receive funding for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program, a program that began under former President Barack Obama in 2010, were taken aback when the date was changed last month on their notice of award documents from an office within HHS, noting their grants would end in June 2018, instead of in 2020. That means they won't receive roughly $200 million they were expecting to receive over that two-year period. ""Needless to say, this was a surprise to everyone, all 81 grantees,"" said Bill Albert, chief innovation officer at the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.? ""I think what has been confounding for a lot of the grantees is there really has been no specific explanation for why the grant is ending two years early,"" Albert added.? The closest thing to an explanation grantees have heard, he said, is the grants didn't quite align with administration priorities. But grantees aren't the only ones perplexed. Democratic senators and members of Congress have written HHS Secretary Tom Price, asking who made the decision to cut the grant short and what the justification is. The program is not included in Mr. Trump's 2018 budget proposal.? ""These notices of shortened project periods are highly unusual, especially given that Congress has yet to act on FY 2018 appropriations,"" a July 21 letter from 37 Democratic senators reads. ""This action is short-sighted and puts at risk the health and well-being of women and our most vulnerable youth who depend on the evidenced-based work that TPP Program grantees are doing across the nation."" Democratic members in the House sent a similar letter to Price. Representative Tom Price, Trump's cabinet pick for Health and Human Services secretary, delivers an opening statement in front of the Senate Comm... HHS did not respond to a request for comment.? Only a handful of the groups receiving the grant under the Obama administration supported abstinence-only approaches to sex education, which could be a point of contention in the more conservative Trump administration. Price himself has advocated for abstinence-only sex education in the past.? The teen pregnancy rate has fallen almost continuously over the last two decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In 1991, the U.S. teen birth rate was 61.8 births per 1,000 females ages 15-19. In 2014, the rate was 24.2 births per 1,000 teens.? There was also a steep drop after 2010, when the grants took effect. Now, the teen birth rate is at a record low.? ""It would be fanciful at best to say these programs were solely responsible for the decline, of course that's not the case,"" Albert said.? But he believes the funding has contributed to the continuing downward trend.? ""Some of that leaves you scratching your head wondering, why mess with success?"" Albert said.?																																																																																																																					"

"The Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., made $1.97 million in profit in the first four months of the year, dramatically outpacing the expectations of the Trump Organization. ? In fact, according to new financial documents first reported by The Washington Post, the Trump family projected a $2.1 million loss for the same period of time when it opened last fall. Instead, from January to April, the hotel's profits were $4 million higher, a 192-percent difference from its original projections. Located just blocks away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office Pavilion-turned-hotel charges more per room than most other stays in the district, despite the 263-room hotel's low occupancy rate of around 42 percent. According to General Services Administration (GSA) documents cited by the Post, guests are paying an average of $652.98 a night, 57 percent more than the Trump Organization estimated. That price puts it above other luxury hotel properties like the Hay-Adams, Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons and Willard Hotels. On Friday, a Google search showed per night prices of $483 for the Four Seasons, $365 for the Ritz-Carlton and $329 for the Hay Adams. The Trump Organization rents it from the General Services Administration for $250,000 each month. Data obtained by the Post about the profits did not show how much of the money arrived through foreign governments. The hotel pledged to donate profits from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury to remedy complaints that Mr. Trump is violating the emoluments clause, a constitutional provision barring elected officials from receiving money from foreign governments.? The Justice Department contended in a June filing that the emoluments clause does not apply to fair-market transactions such as hotel bills.? In her first interview since becoming assistant to the president, Ivanka Trump tells Gayle King about how she's managing the potential conflict o... One aspect of the hotel that has seen considerable growth since the beginning of the year is food and beverage sales, over $8 million since January. This also beat the Trump Organization's expectations, the Post reported -- by 37 percent. The inside of the hotel, featuring a ritzy-atrium-topped lobby open to the public, has transformed itself into a social hangout for Trump insiders, MAGA supporters and curious tourists.? The president's oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, has business ventures connected to the hotel, such as her own line at the hotel's gift shop and spa. However, these ventures have not been as fruitful financially. According to her financial disclosures, she has made $2.4 million from her stake in the hotel. She stepped down from the Trump Organization before taking an advising role with her father's administration but maintains an ownership stake in the hotel.? The Trump International's sprawling ballroom and other meeting spaces have facilitated Hollywood-sized parties and political gatherings such as a fundraising event featuring Mr. Trump in June. The event was closed to the press, but according to the Post, an estimated $10 million was raised for the GOP.? Other notable patrons of the hotel include members of the ruling family of United Arab Emirates, business leaders from Turkish Airlines and even the Kuwaiti government. Their stays and events raise questions about how the hotel is documenting the foreign cash and planning to donate relevant foreign cash to the U.S treasury, as it has promised. Before Mr. Trump was inaugurated, he attempted to distance himself from the hotel that he helped to open, passing management to his two sons. Ethics experts pointed out that Mr. Trump still profits by retaining an ownership interest.? Since then, several lawsuits have surfaced by ethics watchdog groups, federal legislators and businesses, claiming that the hotel's ownership and operations at they currently stand violate the law.?

"Last Updated Aug 11, 2017 11:48 AM EDT Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned on Friday that a war between the U.S. and North Korea would be disastrous, and said his country was proposing -- in conjunction with China -- a path to a peaceful resolution of the nuclear standoff. The cornerstone of his plan, however, is a call for the U.S. military to call off long-scheduled joint exercises with South Korea, like the one set to begin in just a couple weeks. In exchange, the North would halt missile tests. CBS News chief Washington correspondent and ""Face the Nation"" anchor John Dickerson joins ""CBS This Morning"" from Washington to discuss why Presi... China has floated this proposition before, after past North Korean missile launches. CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy says that China, in particular, would be happy to see the annual joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises end. As Tracy notes, both the U.S. and South Korea confirmed earlier Friday that the exercises were set to go on as scheduled at the end of August. In a statement to CBS News, Marine Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said approximately 17,500 U.S. service members would be participating in the exercise, an increase of about 3,000 from the number stationed on the Korean Peninsula. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin notes that the exercise is a ""command and control exercise,"" which means that it's largely an exercise using computers as opposed to a field exercise. The U.S. government has long rejected the terms of what the Chinese and Russians are proposing as a ""suspension for suspension"" deal. Lavrov also seemed to appeal to President Trump's sensibilities in his remarks on Friday, urging the nation ""that is stronger and cleverer"" to take the first step in diffusing the crisis. He warned that the costs of a military conflict between the U.S. and North Korea would be severe. As Tracy reported earlier Friday on ""CBS This Morning,"" Mr. Trump has fanned the flames of the rhetorical battle with North Korea even as he appeals to China to solve the crisis diplomatically. On Friday, Mr. Trump tweeted that U.S. ""military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded,"" to respond if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un should chose to act ""unwisely."" Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path! The State Department, at least, continues to stress that dialogue remains the preferred means of easing the tension with the North. The administration has put the vast majority of its diplomatic efforts toward pressuring China to rein in its wayward, and arguably unpersuadable, ally Kim. If the U.S. is still trying to convince China to take significant action against the North Korean regime, however, Tracy says the Trump administration is using more stick than carrot. On Thursday, the U.S. Navy sailed a destroyer through contested waters in the South China Sea -- just 12 miles off the shore of one of the islands China claims as its own territory. In a terse statement, China's Foreign Ministry said Friday that the sail-by ""severely harmed China's sovereignty and security,"" and that ""China is very displeased."" The Chinese government made another statement Friday morning, urging the U.S. and North Korea to act with caution, and to stop taking turns showing off their military strength.?

That's the resounding word from a national poll released Friday by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. The survey was taken following last month's Senate derailment of the GOP drive to supplant much of President Barack Obama's statute with a diminished federal role in health care. Around 4 in 5 want the Trump administration to take actions that help Obama's law function properly, rather than trying to undermine it. Trump has suggested steps like halting subsidies to insurers who reduce out-of-pockets health costs for millions of consumers. His administration has discussed other moves like curbing outreach programs that persuade people to buy coverage and not enforcing the tax penalty the statute imposes on those who remain uninsured. Just 3 in 10 want Trump and Republicans to continue their drive to repeal and replace the statute. Most prefer that they instead move to shore up the law's marketplaces, which are seeing rising premiums and in some areas few insurers willing to sell policies. While speaking to reporters at his New Jersey golf course, President Trump took shots at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the failed vo... Ominously for the GOP, 6 in 10 say Trump and congressional Republicans are responsible for any upcoming health care problems since they control government. That could be a bad sign for Republicans as they prepare to defend their House and Senate majorities in the 2018 elections. And by nearly 2-to-1, most say it's good that the Senate rejected the GOP repeal-and-replace bill last month. Trump has been publicly browbeating Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to continue trying to pass legislation tearing down Obama's 2010 overhaul. After using Twitter to blame McConnell for last month's Senate failure despite years of GOP vows to repeal it, Trump suggested Thursday that McConnell should perhaps step aside if he can't push that and other legislation through his chamber. On three separate attempts in late July, McConnell fell short of the 50 GOP votes he needed to pass legislation scrapping Obama's law. With a 52-48 GOP majority and Vice President Mike Pence available to cast a tie-breaking vote, McConnell has said he's moving onto other matters unless ""people can show me 50 votes for anything that would make progress."" With the Kaiser survey consistently showing clear overall public support for retaining Obama's law, the numbers help explain why some centrist Republicans who rely on moderate voters' support opposed repeal or backed it only after winning some concessions. Strikingly, while large majorities of Democrats and independents back efforts to sustain the statute, even Republicans and Trump supporters lean toward saying the administration should try making the law work, not take steps to hinder it. But in other instances, Republicans and Trump supporters part company with Democrats and independents and strongly back the president's views. For a White House that often seems more concerned with cementing support from Trump's loyalists than embracing the political center, that might help explain Trump's persistence on the issue. For example, 6 in 10 Republicans and Trump backers want the GOP to continue its repeal and replace drive in Congress. And around two-thirds from those groups want Trump to stop enforcing the tax penalty Obama's law levies on people who don't buy coverage. Analysts say that would roil insurance markets because fewer healthy people would buy policies, leaving them with greater proportions of expensive, seriously ill customers. Trump has frequently tried pressuring Democrats to negotiate on health care by threatening to halt federal subsidies to insurers. While around 6 in 10 overall say Trump should not use such disruptive tactics, a majority of Republicans back that approach. The companies use the money to trim out-of-pocket costs for deductibles and copayments for around 7 million low- and middle-income people. Since insurers are legally required to reduce those costs, they say blocking the subsidies would force them to increase premiums for millions who buy private insurance, including those whose expenses aren't being reduced. The poll found that 52 percent have a positive view of Obama's law, a 9 percentage point increase since Trump was elected last November. The Kaiser Health Tracking Poll was conducted Aug. 1-6 and involved random calls to the cell phones and landlines of 1,211 adults. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

"LAS VEGAS?-- More than a third of U.S. states have created school voucher programs that bypass thorny constitutional and political issues by turning them over to nonprofits that rely primarily on businesses to fund them. But the programs are raising questions about transparency and accountability at a time when supporters are urging that they be expanded into a federal program. Unlike traditional school vouchers, which are directly funded by the states or in the case of Washington, D.C., the federal government, these programs don't use any public money. Instead, those who contribute to the voucher program get tax credits. Seventeen states now have the so-called tax-credit scholarships. Both President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos have promoted the scholarships as a way to give parents greater choice in deciding where their children will go to school. Supporters are pushing the administration to launch a federal program extending the tax credit scholarships nationwide. Asked whether such a proposal might be included as part of a tax overhaul, DeVos said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press: ""It's certainly part of our discussion."" Depending on who you ask, the programs are either another avenue for school choice drawing on the generosity of taxpayers, or a workaround to existing bans on giving public money to religious organizations - in this case schools - with a set-up that's ripe for abuse. It's hard to know who's right, given that the states purposefully limit their fingerprints on their own programs. For Mayra Puentes of Las Vegas, it was simply a way to get her children a better education. Her son, she said, was struggling in public school, in a state that is ranked at or near the bottom of national lists on the quality of public education. Puentes said would not have been able to afford the combined $22,000 tuition for her three children at Mountain View Christian Schools. In Nevada, scholarships are capped annually at about $7,700 per child. They can be used at 86 private schools, not all of them accredited. How the program works: ""They are this weird blend of tax policy and education policy, and in a lot of ways, they are treated more like tax policy,"" said Josh Cunningham of the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks the programs. Nevada lawmakers secured a $20 million boost for the scholarships this year, after Republicans suffered a crushing blow when they couldn't get money for their embattled Education Savings Accounts, a different type of school choice program. Assemblyman Paul Anderson, a Republican, said government transparency laws do not and should not apply to the tax-credit scholarships because the tax component is confidential by nature, and the private sector is handling the rest. He said it was no different than a church asking its parishioners for donations - even though the state created the voucher program. Supporters have on their side the U.S. Supreme Court, which has ruled that the contributed money is private funds because the cash is never touched by the state. But government transparency watchdogs have warned that the set-up can be problematic, with abuses well-documented. In Alabama and Georgia, for example, groups advertised the programs as money-making for contributors. In Arizona, a lawmaker makes six figures annually by running a scholarship group in the same system that he has supported. Critics say under certain circumstances, wealthy contributors could even make a profit by claiming the ""charitable"" deduction multiple times over at the state and federal levels. The AAA Scholarship Foundation Inc. which runs programs in Nevada and five other states, says it doesn't give tax advice but has, when asked, shared an IRS memo on the matter. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy say loopholes in the tax code would allow contributors to both eliminate their state tax bill and also get a charitable deduction off their federal taxes, and in some cases, also their state taxes. Carl Davis, the Washington-based think tank's research director, likened the system to a money-laundering tax scheme because the contributions are officially considered donations - even if the scholarship money goes to for-profit schools. ""That's not charity. That's just helping facilitate the movement of funds. These so-called donors are really like middlemen,"" Davis said. ""They're not making a financial sacrifice."" The research firm estimates that states give away $1 billion annually in tax credits for these voucher programs. Aside from closing the loophole, states could also rein it in by requiring contributors to show their federal tax return to prove that they aren't ""double-dipping,"" Davis said. EdChoice, a leading school choice advocacy group, defends the tax-credit program, saying it's accountable to parents who can choose to take their kids elsewhere if they don't like a school, even if there are, like in all government programs, some cases of abuse. Acknowledging that there are things to address, EdChoice's policy director Jason Bedrick says his team has advised scholarship groups not to mischaracterize the system as a ""get rich quick"" scheme. But he's not apologetic about the tax loophole, saying it's no different compared to tax credits for other charitable causes that in some states, though very rarely, is also a dollar-for-dollar contribution. And if there is tax code reform to address double-dipping, it should apply uniformly to all donor tax credits - not just for a highly political issue like vouchers. ""Some people might not like that, but they're acting within the letter of the law. I see no problem with that,"" Bedrick said. ""Nobody's going to go to jail for this.""																																																																																																																					"
"WASHINGTON?-- A deputy assistant to President Donald Trump has dismissed statements by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson regarding a military response to North Korea as ""simply nonsensical."" He says Tillerson was stepping beyond his administration role as the nation's top diplomat. A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle ""The idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical,"" Trump aide Sebastian Gorka said in an interview with the BBC.? Gorka said that it is Defense Secretary James Mattis' job ""to talk about the military options"" whereas he said Tillerson is ""the chief diplomat of the United States and it is his portfolio to handle those issues.""? His remarks come after media criticism that the Trump administration - the president as well as Tillerson and Mattis - had offered mixed messages as tension rose over North Korea's nuclear program. While Trump on Tuesday warned North Korea not to threaten the U.S. and spoke of meeting the North with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen,"" Tillerson on Wednesday played down those comments.

"President Trump said Friday that U.S. military solutions against North Korea are now ""locked and loaded."" The president said that the U.S. military is ready in a tweet and said he hopes North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, ""will find another path."" Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path! His comment comes after several days of increasing tensions between the two nations. Earlier this week, Mr. Trump threatened ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it continued to threaten the U.S. On Thursday, he wondered if his statement was not tough enough. ""Frankly, the people who are questioning that statement, was it too tough? Maybe it wasn't tough enough."" Mr. Trump said. ""They've been doing this to our country for a long time - for many years, and it's about time someone stuck up for this country and for the people of other countries. So if anything, maybe that statement wasn't tough enough."" President Trump renewed his threat to the North Korean regime on Thursday, telling reporters his warnings of ""fire and fury"" may not have gone fa... The ""fire and fury"" warning then prompted North Korea to threaten to attack Guam, a U.S. territory in the western Pacific Ocean. A?new U.S. intelligence assessment concludes that North Korea has developed the ability to build a nuclear warhead?small enough to fit on top of a ballistic missile, including an intercontinental missile that can reach the U.S.																																																																																																																					"
"BEIJING -- South Korea's military said on Friday morning that joint military exercises with the U.S. will go on as planned at the end of August. North Korea claims the large-scale drills, which will involve about 40,000 combined troops, are rehearsals for war. After the same annually-scheduled exercises last year, Kim Jong Un's regime carried out North Korea's fifth nuclear test. China is North Korea's only ally, and yet Beijing is not inclined to get involved in the war of words between the Washington and Pyongyang. CBS N... Earlier, a newspaper on the U.S. island territory of Guam blared the headline: ""14 minutes."" That's how long it would take for North Korean missiles to reach the island. This week, North Korea's military laid out detailed plans to launch a salvo of four ballistic missiles over Japan and into the sea, landing within about 20 miles of Guam. The North said Kim would be presented the prospective plans for approval right around the same time the U.S.-South Korean military exercises are scheduled to get underway. President Trump has, again, asked the president of China, North Korea's most valuable trading partner, to step in and pressure Kim to negotiate. But China's Foreign Ministry told CBS News on Friday that Beijing has been working hard on the North Korea issue, and paid a big price for its efforts. CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy says the statement appeared to be a reference to China going along with the recent U.N. sanctions that will limit China's trade with the North. But President Trump still wants China to do what he simply calls ""more."" President Trump renewed his threat to the North Korean regime on Thursday, telling reporters his warnings of ""fire and fury"" may not have gone fa... ""I think China can do a lot more, yes, China can,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And I think China will do a lot more."" As Tracy reports, President Trump is simultaneously fueling the escalating confrontation with North Korea, issuing military threats of ""fire and fury,"" while pressuring China to solve the crisis peacefully. He's threatened a trade war with Beijing if China doesn't give the help he wants. ""Look, we have trade with China. We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel. It's not going to continue like that,"" Mr. Trump asserted. ""But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade, a lot differently toward trade."" ? ? If the U.S. is trying to convince China to take significant action on North Korea, however, Tracy says the Trump administration is using more stick than carrot. On Thursday the U.S. Navy sailed a destroyer through contested waters in the South China Sea -- just 12 miles off the shore of one of the islands China claims as its own territory. In a terse statement, China's Foreign Ministry said Friday that the sail-by ""severely harmed China's sovereignty and security,"" and that ""China is very displeased."" The Chinese government made another statement Friday morning, urging the U.S. and North Korea to act with caution, and to stop taking turns showing off their military strength.?

"Last Updated Aug 11, 2017 10:10 AM EDT President Trump's support and opposition falls into four groups, as the CBS News Nation Tracker has shown over the course of the year. CBS News' polling unit has explored each group's attitudes and views on the president, and here we're taking a closer look at their demographics 每 who they are, and where we find them, using more conventional labels. First, here's an overview: The president has both loyal backers (""I am a strong Trump supporter, period"") whom we have labeled ""Believers,"" as well as more transactional supporters who say he has to deliver what they want to keep their support. This second group we're callling ""Conditionals.""? As President Trump continues his working vacation in New Jersey, a new CBS News poll shows his approval rating remains low but views on the econo... Then there are the opponents who could turn into supporters if Mr. Trump reaches out to them. These we've labeled them the ""Curious."" Lately they have been trending away from the president, feeling that he has not earned their support. Finally, there are the ""Resisters,"" who are the four in ten Americans saying they firmly oppose President Trump. Their numbers have grown slowly but steadily over the last six months. Believers are President Trump's staunchest supporters and include almost one in five Americans. They tend to be on the older side, with three in four aged 45 or over a third 65 or over. A third are retired. Believers are the least racially diverse group. Over eight in ten are white. Geographically, almost half live in the South, a region that went heavily for Trump in the election, and three in ten live in rural areas. About four in ten identify as born again Christians. These identities are important to them: in the most recent survey, this group is the most likely to feel that the President is fighting and standing up for their culture and way of life, and also working for people of their faith, as much as their economic class. According to the newest CBS News Nation Tracker Poll, a joint project with YouGov, most Americans say President Trump is creating unnecessary con... This sentiment is mixed with strong conservativism. Believers are most likely to call themselves ""very conservative,"" and twice as likely to do so as other Trump supporters, more of whom call themselves ""somewhat"" conservative. Their conservatism extends into today's top policy debates. Believers are the least likely group to view health care as a right 每 most say health care is a service to be purchased like any other. (In the rest of the country, a three-to-one majority takes the opposite view, saying healthcare is a right that everyone deserves.) Their view seems to be based more on principle, as nearly half receive health insurance primarily through Medicare and Medicaid, the highest proportion in any group. Conditionals currently support President Trump, but they say that he has to deliver what they want to keep them. This group makes up nearly a quarter of the public. They are similar to Believers in that eight in ten are white, and geographically, with a similarly sized plurality residing in the South and three in ten living in rural areas. On the other hand, Conditionals tend to be younger than Believers are. Four in ten are under 45; only 21 percent are seniors. They are more likely to get their health insurance through an employer than through government programs. While more than a third identify as born again, they are overall less likely than Believers to say that religion is ""very important"" in their lives. Conditionals tend to be more economically focused than culturally focused, which may partially stem from being younger and less religious. Younger adults face greater economic difficulties, such as unemployment and student debt, than older generations, according to recent research. Along these lines, Conditionals are less confident than Believers are that the American Dream is still achievable, and more likely to say circumstances and opportunities determine outcomes more than hard work and effort do. Only half say the economy is better than it was one year ago, compared to over eight in ten Believers. And three quarters say that if President Trump does not fix the economy, he would lose some or all of their support. Conditionals are also much less likely than Believers to say that their culture and way of life have become safer since President Trump took office. They are more mixed on social issues like Mr. Trump's transgender ban in the military. They are warmer towards immigrants and more likely to describe their general viewpoint as ""moderate"". The Curious are currently against President Trump but are willing to reconsider him if he does a good job. This group is approximately one sixth of the country. They are the youngest of the four groups, with 59 percent under 45 and almost a third under 30. They are also the least likely group to be covered by health insurance. By a large margin, they want to see Republicans and Democrats work together to improve Obamacare. The Curious are also the most racially diverse of the four groups. Only half are white, with 17 percent Hispanic and 17 percent black. The non-white Curious feel that Trump does not speak for people like them and that, if anything, he is working against their racial group. The Curious are also the only group more likely to live in cities (four in ten do) than in suburbs or rural areas. A quarter live in the Northeast, and a fifth live in the West. This group's demographic profile has political consequences. First, their diversity is associated with more positive views about immigrants 每 nearly half say immigration makes society better in the long run, and six in ten are opposed to a U.S.-Mexico border wall. They also feel warmer towards Muslims than either group of Trump supporters. Second, the relative youth of the Curious likely contributes to their lack of partisan loyalty and political engagement. They are the least likely group to have voted, with more than half doubting the efficacy of voting (""Whoever you vote for, things go on pretty much the same""). This group is also the only one in which a majority feel that political opponents nonetheless share many other values and goals. They are less polarized, leaving them more in play politically, and possibly more open to supporting Trump. They are largely self-described ""moderates"" and more than half would consider voting for a Republican in 2018, though probably someone independent from Trump, rather than someone in line with him. Resisters, who are strongly against President Trump, are by far the largest group, comprising more than four in ten people nationwide. Like the Curious, they tend to be racially diverse and young. Over half are under 45, over a quarter under 30. They also have the most women of any group, at 56 percent female. Like the Curious, many of them are in cities, but more live in the suburbs. Only a third live in the South 每 the lowest proportion of any group 每 with the rest evenly spread out between the Northeast, Midwest, and West. Unlike the Curious, Resisters are politically engaged and much more polarized. More than any other group, they rely on newspapers for political news and information. More than half have shared their political opinion on social media, such as Facebook and Twitter. Half call themselves ""somewhat"" or ""very"" liberal, which is twice as high as the national average. And eight in ten say that political fights today are a fundamental matter of how our democracy works. They primarily receive health insurance through Medicare or Medicaid, and one third are covered by an employer. Nearly six in ten report having a preexisting condition. Nearly nine in ten view healthcare as a right that everyone deserves. People's financial situation bears little on which of the four groups they identify with. In terms of family income, for example, Believers and Resisters are not so different, nor are Conditionals and the Curious. There is a bit of a difference in terms of formal education, with the Believers and Conditionals being less likely than the Curious and Resisters to hold a college degree.

"Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh is optimistic that tax reform, the next big push for the Trump administration, can be achieved with bipartisan support. ""I'll be candid＃ one of the areas of agreement in even contentious times in the Obama administration was that our corporate tax rate is way too high,"" Sayegh said on the latest episode of ""The Takeout"" podcast. ""And it's made us uncompetitive. I mean, that is a point that both Republicans and Democrats largely agree on. We're going to really tackle that tax rate."" Sayegh's boss, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn have spent the last few months speaking with over 200 members of Congress, including Democrats, and hundreds of business leaders, trade associations, home builders and manufacturers in order to whip up support for their tax plan.? But how do you get at least 50 votes in the Senate, especially after efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare failed to garner the support of all Republican senators? ""There is no more greater multiplier of revenue than economic growth,"" Sayegh argued, over a Trout Parmesan meal with CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett and Political Director Steve Chaggaris. ""And that is the bottom line. And we again are forecasting some serious growth projections being able to be achieved if you enact tax reform."" In April, the administration put out a one-page document laying out a rough blueprint of their goals: Reduce seven tax brackets to three and repeal the alternative minimum and death taxes for individuals, as well as cut the ""business tax rate"" down to 15 percent. They also promised that more details would emerge in the coming months. Sayegh says those are still being ironed out. For now, the administration expects to get a cohesive bill in front of the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction in the beginning of September, with mark-up completed by the first half of the month. After an effort to merge a House and Senate tax reform bill together, ""it's going to get done"" by late October or November, Sayegh said. ""It's going to get done this year.

"Employees at Trump Organization properties have been told they must give up their right to sue their employer or else they will lose their jobs.? This arrangement is called a mutual arbitration agreement, and the document was obtained by CBS News. Arbitration means that instead of going to court, employees must take any complaints to a third party arbitrator paid for by the Trump Organization to resolve disputes.? Matters before an arbitrator are secret. The Trump presidency has dominated headlines daily, but we hear very little from the Trump business empire. CBS News correspondent Julianna Goldm... A Trump Organization spokesperson provided this statement via email to CBS News: ""Because it is faster, more cost effective and tends to level the playing field, it is commonplace for large companies like The Trump Organization to use arbitration as the preferred method for resolving disputes."" The document was presented to all employees, including gardeners, housekeepers and manicurists.? The document was paired with?a mandatory gag order obtained by CBS?News that required all Trump employees to keep any information, pictures or opinions of the Trump family confidential.? Employees were also told that if they didn't sign the confidentiality agreement, they would lose their jobs. The arbitration agreement states that ""Arbitration is intended to provide a less time- consuming, less expensive, and less complicated means of settling disputes."" Because arbitration takes place behind closed doors, the number and nature of employee complaints against the president's company will never become public.? The agreement also requires Trump employees to give up their rights to join a class action lawsuit. ""It is part of a major trend to privatize justice,"" said Deborah Soltis, a partner at the litigation firm Kiyonaga & Soltis who has been practicing for 25 years, ""What employers have been doing for about the last 20 years is slowly taking away their employees' rights to level the playing field and go to court,"" Soltis told CBS News.? Complaints that would now be secret include matters related to ""unpaid compensation, missed meal or rest breaks, wrongful termination, unfair competition, discrimination, harassment, retaliation"" according to the agreement. The Trump Organization is using the arbitrator?JAMS, which has arbitration centers around the country and, according to Lewis Maltby of the National Workrights Institute, JAMS is known as ""reasonably fair"". It's estimated that up to 20 percent of all businesses nationwide require employees to give up the right to sue.? It's favored by some, as the Trump Organization indicated, because arbitration is cheaper for both parties, and it tends to be faster than the courts.? In recent years, decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court have supported the rights of corporations to force employees to sign arbitration agreements.

"CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro said he wants a meeting with President Donald Trump, the same man he ridicules as a crass imperial magnate, as the U.S. weighs slapping crippling economic sanctions on his socialist administration. In a lengthy address Thursday to members of a new, all-powerful constitutional assembly, Maduro instructed Venezuela's foreign minister to approach the United States about arranging a telephone conversation or meeting with Mr. Trump at next month's United Nations General Assembly. Several people were arrested after an attack on a military base in Venezuela, as political unrest continues. Patricia Mazzei, a political writer ... ""Mr. Donald Trump, here is my hand,"" the socialist president said, adding that he wants as strong a relationship with the U.S. as he has with Russia. The remarks came a day after the Trump administration slapped sanctions on eight close Maduro allies, accusing them of violating human rights and democratic norms, and debated whether to pile on with additional economic sanctions to further isolate the government. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he discussed Venezuela along with North Korea and Afghanistan in a security briefing with top national security aides and Vice President Mike Pence, who travels to neighboring Colombia on Sunday in a trip where discussions on how to pressure Maduro is expected to feature prominently. ""We had some very good meetings, some very good ideas, very good thoughts, and a lot of decisions were made,"" Mr. Trump said following the briefing, without providing any details. An economic meltdown in Venezuela is at the heart of the political crisis there. An inflation rate of 800 percent has decimated savings, and some... Maduro's apparent olive branch was undermined in the same speech by his own angry rant against Mr. Trump, who he accused of backing a failed attack on a military base a week ago. The Trump administration in turn has called Maduro a ""dictator"" and issued sanctions against him and more than two dozen other former and current officials. Even as the U.S. for now holds back applying economic sanctions, the Maduro government is finding itself increasingly isolated from financial markets. On Thursday, Credit Suisse bank said it banned trading in Venezuelan bonds over what it said were ""recent development and the political climate"" in the country, according to an internal memo. Any future transactions involving Venezuelan officials or assets will have to go through additional screening, according to the memo whose authenticity was confirmed by the bank. Venezuela is in the midst of a severe economic downturn caused by low oil prices and government policies that have scared away private investment. The country's bonds are one of the few ways the current government is able to raise money to support its collapsing economy. But as the country's political crisis has worsened, the bonds issued by the government as well as the state-owned oil company PDVSA have become a point of contention and concern for investors who increasingly worry they are supporting an oppressive regime as well as a country that is a great risk of defaulting on its debts. Goldman Sachs came under political pressure earlier this year for buying a reported $2.8 billion in Venezuelan bonds on the open market at a significant discount.

"A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the State Department to search ""state.gov"" email accounts of former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's top aides Human Abedin, Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan for information relating to the 2012 Benghazi consulate attack. U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta agreed with conservative watchdog Judicial Watch in an ongoing legal dispute from a 2015 Freedom of Information Act request seeking Clinton's communications related to Benghazi. The group claims the department's prior searches for emails about Benghazi were ""deficient"" and needed to be enhanced.? ""Although this matter began with much fanfare, the only remaining dispute is whether Defendant Department of State ＃ conducted an adequate search for records responsive to Plaintiff,"" Mehta wrote in the opinion. ? ?? Mehta weighed the watchdog's updated requests, including reviews of ""state.gov"" email accounts of three Clinton aides for material ""concerning, regarding or relating"" to Benghazi and emails from a 2016 FBI investigation of Anthony Weiner, Abedin's estranged husband. The later request was deferred to a pending case within the District of Columbia.?

""If Secretary Clinton sent an email about Benghazi to Abedin, Mills, or Sullivan at his or her state.gov email address, or if one of them sent an e-mail to Secretary Clinton using his or her state.gov account, then State's server presumably would have captured and stored such an email,"" Mehta wrote. ""State has an obligation to search its own server for responsive records."" ?? Mehta took into account the figures stemming from prior department searches. He wrote that the department formerly reviewed 30,000 emails given directly from Clinton, analyzed thousands of documents from her aides and evaluated supplementary emails acquired by the FBI in its own investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server.? According to the judge, from the 30,000 emails that Clinton turned over, the department found 342 relevant documents. From the thousands of documents from Clinton's aides, only one was flagged. The FBI search yielded just three results.? Judicial Watch still found that these reviews were lacking, claiming there could be potentially crucial information about Benghazi buried somewhere within the State Department's expansive server. Mehta agreed and turned some focus back to resulting factors of Clinton's decision to use a private email server. ""Because Secretary Clinton used a personal e-mail for work-related communications, Plaintiff's request caused State to look beyond its own e-mail servers for responsive records,"" he wrote. ""The court is unconvinced 'beyond material doubt' that a search of the state.gov accounts of Abedin, Mills, and Sullivan is 'unlikely to produce any marginal return.'"" ? The State Department contends that the court would create an ""unworkable standard in future FOIA cases"" by requiring it to search through Clinton aides' ""state.gov"" email servers.?

"The U.S. Department of Defense funded more than $76 billion dollars of weapons, communication devices, and other security equipment to the Afghan security forces since 2002, according to a new report by the Government Accountability Office?(GAO).? Yet, according to top U.S. military commanders and other experts, the Afghan military is still unprepared to operate independently. Since the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the U.S. has allocated funding for nearly 600,000 weapons to be put in the hands of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), according to Defense Department data. Nearly 81 percent of these weapons were rifles and pistols. The firepower funding also included more than 25,000 grenade launchers and almost 10,000 rocket-propelled weapons used by the Afghan Border Police. Additional items given to the ANDSF included 162,643 pieces of communications equipment and nearly 76,000 vehicles. These vehicles were primarily light tactical vehicles like Ford Ranger pickups and cargo trucks, but also included more than 22,000 Humvees, according to the DOD data. When the equipment reached Afghanistan, it was divided between the two main security forces: The Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police. Senator Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, discusses Russia's habit of interference, the plan for Afghanistan, and the proposed legislation to protect Speci... The Pentagon has shipped 110 helicopters and 98 plane since 2007, when the Pentagon authorized sending aircraft. These aircraft could have carried the 314,000 unguided rockets, 8,700 ""general-purpose bombs"" and 1,815,000 helicopter rounds, which was also funded by the Pentagon, according to their data. Even with all of this equipment, Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan,?told Congress in February?he needs a?""few thousand"" more troops to properly train and advise the Afghan military so they can eventually operate independently. Claude Chafin, communications director for the House Armed Services Committee, told CBS News the GAO report?was sought as ""an objective review of major weapon systems and equipment provided to ANDSF to evaluate the extent to which such equipment supports the ability of ANDSF to provide security for the Afghan people.""? Stephen Tankel, an American University professor and adjunct senior fellow at the Center for New American Security, said to CBS News that he agrees with top U.S. commanders that the Afghan military is still unprepared after more than a decade of American military guidance.? The ""U.S. continues to spend money every year, our forces continue to die, and the mission continues to drift,"" Tankel said. Some in Congress are now calling on President Trump to change U.S. policy in Afghanistan. Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,?announced in a press release Thursday a new amendment to the 2018 defense authorization bill that aims to ""strengthen the capability and capacity of the Afghan government and security forces."" While no funding specifics were outlined in the release, McCain said that ""adopting a clear policy and strategy in Afghanistan, backed with the authorities and resources necessary for success, would be a critical step toward restoring that kind of leadership, which has been absent for far too long.""? The conflict in Afghanistan is still claiming the lives of American troops. A suicide attack in Kandahar killed two U.S. service members last week.? The Trump administration has said it will soon release its plan on the path forward in Afghanistan, but no details have surfaced yet.?

"WASHINGTON --?Fines for illegal pollution have plummeted under President Trump, according to analysis by an environmental advocacy group. The Environmental Integrity Project looked at that civil penalties paid by polluters during the first six months under Mr. Trump. The group published an analysis Thursday that found penalties were less than half their levels under each of the past three presidents. The analysis found that Mr. Trump's Justice Department settled 26 civil cases against companies over environmental violations, totaling $12 million in penalties. That's a 60 percent drop on average from comparable time periods under presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush or Bill Clinton, even before adjustments for inflation. Besides reaching fewer settlements, the group said, environmental offenders also were required to perform less cleanup under Mr. Trump and make smaller reductions to future pollution. A spokesman for the Justice Department said Thursday it continues to ""vigorously enforce"" environmental laws. The report's authors cautioned that six months represent only an eighth of a presidential term but said the early news is neither encouraging nor surprising. Mr. Trump and his Environmental Enforcement Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, have complained that federal regulations are often too onerous and stifle the growth of American businesses. ""President Trump campaigned on a promise of 'law and order,' but apparently law enforcement for big polluters is not what he had in mind,"" Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement. He previously served as director of EPA's civil enforcement office under both Clinton and Bush. ""If this drop-off in environmental enforcement continues, it will leave more people breathing more air pollution or swimming in waterways with more waste,"" Schaeffer said. Under the first six months under Obama, the Justice Department brought 34 civil cases for violations of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and other federal environmental laws, with polluters agreeing to pay $36 million in penalties. Bush logged 31 cases with $30 million in penalties, while Clinton accounted for 45 cases with $25 million in penalties. In the scientific community there is a strong consensus that global temperatures have increased in recent decades and that this trend is largely ... The group did not include settlements for pollution cleanups agreed to as part of the federal Superfund program, cases that can often drag on for decades. The comparison between presidential administrations is more stark when figures are adjusted for inflation. For example, the $25 million in civil penalties under Clinton in the first half of 1992 would equal more than $43.5 million in today's dollars. The Justice Department did not dispute the study's numbers, but a spokesman said figures for civil penalties do not tell the full story because they do not include fines from criminal prosecutions. In our series, Issues That Matter, we take a closer look at climate change. Former Vice President Al Gore has spent decades working on this globa... ""The department continues to vigorously enforce environmental laws to better protect the American people,"" said Mark Abueg, a public affairs specialist at Justice. ""For example, in just the last six months, (we) filed major new Clean Air Act litigation and obtained a $40 million criminal penalty in a vessel pollution case that safeguards the environment."" The $40 million fine Abueg cited was finalized in April as part of the sentencing of Princess Cruise Lines over the illegal dumping and concealment of oil-contaminated waste from its ships. However, the settlement, the largest ever in such a case, was actually negotiated under the Obama administration and announced in December --?the month before Mr. Trump took office -- as part of the company's guilty plea to felony crimes in federal court.

"CBS News senior security contributor Michael Morell, a former deputy director of the CIA, joined the ""CBS Evening News"" from Tokyo Thursday to discuss the latest tensions between the U.S. and North Korea.? In a conversation with CBS News' Anthony Mason, he called President Trump's recent statements on North Korea ""reckless,"" and said that Mr. Trump is narrowing policy options. He also said the ""playground game of dare, double dare is dangerous.""? ANTHONY MASON: Michael, the president said his ""fire and fury"" warning wasn't tough enough. From your vantage point in Tokyo what do you think? MICHAEL MORELL: Anthony, I think the president's statements of the last two days are reckless and I think they're reckless for two reasons. One is that Kim Jong-Un has been shown to be provokable. And so this playground game of dare, double dare is dangerous. The second is that statement such as this box the president in from a policy perspective. At a time when he should be trying to maximize policy options, he's narrowing them. He's at risk of making the same mistake here that President Obama made on the Syria red line. So, I don't think the statements are helpful to - to U.S. interests. Michael Morell MASON: At the same time Secretary of State Tillerson appears to be trying to calm things down. Are mixed signals damaging U.S. credibility though? MORREL: Anthony, clarity in foreign policy is one of the keys to success. And right now we have three voices. We have the president's very tough rhetoric that's being read as possible U.S. preemptive action. You got Secretary Tillerson's statements which walk back significantly. And then you got Secretary of Defense Mattis' statements that are tough but they talk about a U.S. response to a first step by North Korea.? One of the great frustrations here in East Asia is they don't know what U.S. policy is and they're asking, what is U.S. strategy? MASON: Michael Morell in Tokyo, thanks very much for being with us. MORELL: You're welcome.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 10, 2017 8:16 PM EDT President Trump on Thursday said he doesn't believe Iran is in compliance with the 2015 deal to curtail its nuclear weapons program, weeks after his administration certified that it is in compliance.? The president made the comments to reporters during his working vacation in Bedminster, New Jersey, after his administration certified in July that Iran is living up to its end of the bargain under the nuclear agreement. The administration is required to notify Congress every 90 days whether Iran is in compliance with the deal reached under former President Obama, and July was the second time Mr. Trump's administration?certified compliance.?

The rising tensions with North Korea are increasing concerns about a possible military conflict. Jake Sullivan, former foreign policy adviser to ... ""I don't think they're living up to the spirit of the agreement,"" Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. ""President Obama in his wisdom gave them $150 billion. He gave them $1.8 billion in cash. That's a hard one to figure. But that was his decision. I think it's a horrible agreement. But they are not in compliance with the agreement and they certainly are not in the spirit of the agreement in compliance, and I think you'll see some very strong things taking place if they don't get themselves in compliance."" Mr. Trump has long condemned the agreement his predecessor made, and on the campaign trail, pledged to rip up and renegotiate the deal.? ""This deal -- if I win -- will be a totally different deal. This will be a totally different deal,"" Mr. Trump said at a rally on Sept. 9, 2015.? But Mr. Trump has yet to renegotiate the deal.? Mr. Trump did recently sign legislation Congress passed targeting sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea, although Mr. Trump called the legislation ""flawed."" The measure targets Iran's ballistic missile program and support for terrorism and human rights violations, while complying with the Iran deal. It also imposes sanctions on any foreign person or entity that does business with any entity the administration has already designated as having a connection to Iran's ballistic missile program.?

"Last Updated Aug 10, 2017 7:21 PM EDT President Trump thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin Thursday for expelling hundreds of U.S. diplomatic employees from Russia, saying he appreciated the ability to cut the federal government's payroll.? ""I want to thank him because we're trying to cut down our payroll and as far as I'm concerned I'm very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll,"" Mr. Trump told reporters during his 17-day working vacation in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""There's no real reason for them to go back. I greatly appreciate the fact that we've been able to cut our payroll of the United States. We'll save a lot of money."" Mr. Trump's remarks Thursday were his first comments on the topic, since Putin last month announced the U.S. diplomatic mission in the Kremlin would need to cut its staff by 755 personnel. Putin explained that was tired of waiting to see whether Russia' relationship with the U.S. would improve. Expelling U.S. diplomats, however, doesn't necessarily remove them from the federal government's payroll -- they just can't stay in Russia.? In an interview with The New York Times, President Trump downplayed his second, previously undisclosed discussion with Russian President Vladimir... ""We had hoped that the situation will somehow change, but apparently if it changes, it won't be soon,"" Putin said in an interview televised on Rossiya 1, explaining why Moscow decided to retaliate. ""I thought it was the time to show that we're not going to leave it without an answer."" The president's latest comments about the U.S. relationship with Russia are unlikely to ease criticism that Mr. Trump is too close to or too easy on Putin. Mr. Trump continues to dismiss the ""witch hunt"" Russia investigation. In the same press conference in which he thanked Putin for expelling U.S. diplomats, Mr. Trump decried the investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia. The FBI recently conducted a raid on the home of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign manager.?

""The opioid crisis is an emergency and I'm saying officially right now it is an emergency,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's a national emergency. We're going to spend a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money on the opioid crisis""? Mr. Trump made the announcement before holding a security briefing Thursday at his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""We're going to draw it up and we're going to make it a national emergency. It is a serious problem, the likes of which we have never had,"" he said. ""You know when I was growing up they had the LSD and they had certain generations of drugs. There's never been anything like what's happened to this country over the last four or five years."" During his campaign, President Trump vowed to tackle the opioid epidemic. More than six months into his term, Julianna Goldman spoke with the act... Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Thursday night that he ""applauded"" Mr. Trump's announcement. ""Just last week the Department of Justice announced its new Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit and we continue to follow the President's lead and use every tool we have to combat this deadly crisis,"" Sessions said.? Two million Americans are addicted to prescription opioids, according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. An additional 600,000 are addicted to heroin and some estimates say over 59,000 people died from drug overdose deaths in 2016.

But this is a national emergency and we are drawing documents now to so attest.""? A drug commission convened by Mr. Trump recently called for a national emergency declaration to help deal with the opioid crisis. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price earlier this week seemed to suggest the president was leaning against the recommendation when he said the administration could deploy the necessary resources and attention without declaring a national emergency. Still, Price stressed that ""all things"" were ""on the table for the president.""

"President Trump called it ""a disgrace"" that the Republican-controlled Senate couldn't pass a bill to repeal and replace the health care law, placing the blame on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""They should have had this last one done. They lost by one vote. For a thing like that to happen is a disgrace,"" the president told reporters, as the vice president stood next to him at his golf club at Bedminster, New Jersey. ""Frankly, it shouldn't have happened, that I can tell you."" ""I just want him to get repeal-and-replace done,"" he said. He added that he also wants to see legislation for tax cuts and infrastructure on his desk. Asked whether it was time for McConnell to step down, he suggested that if the Senate fails to produce results on these agenda items. ""If he doesn't get repeal-and-replace done, and if he doesn't get taxes done -- meaning cuts and reform and ... infrastructure -- if he doesn't get that done, then you can ask me that question,"" the president said. Earlier, Mr. Trump directed his third tweet at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in two days, this time urging him ""get back to work"" and pass legislation on health care, tax reform and infrastructure. Mitch, get back to work and put Repeal & Replace, Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing. You can do it! This followed another tweet Thursday chiding McConnell for failing to pass the Senate GOP plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act: ""Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years couldn't get it done?""

The president's tone Wednesday was sharp in response to that remark: ""Senator Mitch McConnell said I had ""excessive expectations,"" but I don't think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?"" The Senate majority leader also made it clear in his Kentucky remarks that he does not plan to revisit repealing the ACA any time soon. ""If people can show me 50 votes for anything that would make progress on that, I'll turn back to it. But in the absence of that, we're going to be moving on. We have a number of things to do in September,"" he said.? Topping the agenda when the Senate returns in September are bills that will keep the government running, raise the debt ceiling to prevent default and cut taxes. McConnell acknowledged that something would likely have to be done to help stabilize the private insurance market, which is concerned that the Trump administration will stop paying subsidies that help lower the cost of health insurance for consumers.

"If President Trump proposed delaying the 2020 election until the U.S. could ensure that only eligible citizens were able to vote, 52 percent of Republicans would support the move, according to a survey from a pair of academics reported Thursday in the Washington Post. The number of Republicans supporting the hypothetical delay jumped to 56 percent when respondents were told that both Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress proposed the move. The survey, from Yeshiva University psychology professor Ariel Malka and University of Pennsylvania communication professor Yphtach Lelkes, surveyed 1,325 Americans between June 5 and June 20 this year. The results that purport to document Republican views are based on the responses of 650 GOP or GOP-leaning independents. Quick with a caveat, the pair noted that their survey ""is only measuring reactions to a hypothetical situation."" Trump's effort to expose alleged voting fraud is running into a brick wall. The president has insisted that 3 to 5 million illegal votes were cas... ""Were Trump to seriously propose postponing the election, there would be a torrent of opposition, which would most likely include prominent Republicans,"" they wrote in the Post. ""Financial markets would presumably react negatively to the potential for political instability. And this is to say nothing of the various legal and constitutional complications that would immediately become clear. Citizens would almost certainly form their opinions amid such tumult, which does not at all resemble the context in which our survey was conducted."" ""Nevertheless, we do not believe that these findings can be dismissed out of hand,"" they added. ""Postponing the 2020 presidential election is not something that Trump or anyone in his administration has even hinted at, but for many in his constituency floating such an idea may not be a step too far."" The survey also revealed the extent to which Mr. Trump's base has embraced his claim that millions of ineligible voters in the 2016 election deprived him of a popular vote victory. Forty-seven percent of GOP or GOP-leaning respondents surveyed said they believe Mr. Trump won the popular vote. (In fact, he trailed Hillary Clinton in the national popular vote by roughly three million ballots.) Sixty-eight percent of the same group said they believe millions of illegal immigrants voted in 2016, and 73 percent said they believe voter fraud happens somewhat or very often. There is no evidence of such widespread fraud.																																																																																																																					"
"Two former Trump campaign staffers announced -- separately -- the birth of their child, the product of a campaign affair. A.J. Delgado, who was an adviser to the Trump transition, gave birth to a son, William, in July. She tweeted about it earlier this week. Dear friends: Beyond thrilled to share with you that I'm now the proud mother of a beautiful son (!), William!!! Born 7/10 Then, the New York Post's Page Six first reported that the father of the child is Jason Miller, a married Trump campaign spokesman, who said in a statement, ""My wife and I, along with our two daughters, are excited to welcome William into the world and into our family, and we appreciate the well wishes we've received from so many."" This apparently came as a surprise to Delgado, who indicated that she had not been contacted by Page Six. She then tweeted that she and Miller had dated for two months during a period when he said he was separated from his wife. Delgado tweeted that Miller's statement to Page Six was ""news to me."" And I'm not sure what Jason means that he and his wife are excited to welcome Will. Really? News to me. Let me shut up before I say more... She also tweeted, ""Actually the father did not/has not sent the child even a $1, or a single gift/item. I have had to pay for/cover everything myself. Cheers."" And while the New York Post may have been the venue for Miller's statement on the story, Delgado said she'd be giving her side to The Atlantic. Miller, who was then-President-elect Trump's first choice to be communications director, was appointed to the position in December and withdrew two days later, saying wanted to spend more time with his family. ""After spending this past week with my family, the most amount of time I have been able to spend with them since March 2015, it is clear they need to be my top priority right now and this is not the right time to start a new job as demanding as White House Communications Director,"" Miller said in December in a statement.?

"President Trump's ""fire and fury"" warning to North Korea on Tuesday prompted more measured statements of reassurance from other administration officials both nations ratcheted up current tensions over the nuclear threat. Late last week, he welcomed the U.N. resolution's expanded sanctions against the regime. The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact! In recent months, the president has turned to China for help in containing North Korea. In April, he issued a number of tweets on the subject. One expressed confidence that ""China will properly deal with North Korea."" He suggested that he might not deem China a currency manipulator because it was working with the U.S. on North Korea. He pointed out that China is ""very much the economic lifeline to North Korea,"" and ""if they want to solve the North Korea problem, they will."" By May and June, when the North was launching test missiles, the president pointed out the ""disrespect"" it was showing China, and he acknowledged the death of Otto Warmbier, a college student who had been imprisoned by the regime and then released to the U.S. while he was comatose. On June 20, he tweeted that ""While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & china to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!"" By the end of July, though, Mr. Trump was growing impatient with China: ""...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem,"" he tweeted. Over the years, the president's statements about North Korea have differed. In fact, nearly 20 years ago, Mr. Trump said that he would ""negotiate like crazy"" with the country. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he conveyed mixed messages about his approach to North Korea. Oct. 24, 1999: ""Meet the Press"" host Tim Russert asked Mr. Trump in an interview if he would be willing to launch a preemptive strike on North Korea's nuclear capabilities as president. ""First, I'd negotiate. I would negotiate like crazy and I'd make sure that we try to get the best deal possible＃These people in three or four years they're going to be having nuclear weapons.

Mr. Trump said, ""Yes, I would. I would not do so happily, but I would be willing to do it."" April 27, 2016: ""President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach,"" Mr. Trump said during his foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C. ""Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don't understand it."" May 18, 2016: In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said he was open to speaking to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""I would speak to him, I would have no problem speaking to him,"" he said. He also said during the interview that he'd pressure China. ""I would put a lot of pressure on China because economically we have tremendous power over China...China can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call."" June 15, 2016: Mr. Trump said in a speech in Atlanta that he would ""accept"" a visit by the North Korean dictator as part of ""opening a dialogue."" He said, ""If he came here, I'd accept him, but we wouldn't have a state dinner like we do for China and all these other people who rip us off."" April 30, 2017: CBS News ""Face the Nation"" host asked the president what he makes of the North Korean leader. Mr. Trump said, ""People are saying, ""Is he sane?"" I have no idea. I can tell you this, and a lot of people don't like when I say it, but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died. He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others. And at a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie.""																																																																																																																					"
"WASHINGTON 〞 The Trump administration imposed sanctions Thursday on eight more individuals in Venezuela, including the brother of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, in the latest U.S. bid to try to deter further democratic backsliding in the South American country. The penalties focus on current or former Venezuelan government officials accused by the U.S. of supporting President Nicolas Maduro's creation of a constituent assembly. That body has been given the job of rewriting Venezuela's constitution, in what the United States has said was an attempt by Maduro to solidify his hold on power. The assembly, formed by a July 30 election, has declared itself superior to all other government institutions and has ousted Venezuela's outspoken chief prosecutor. ""President Maduro swore in this illegitimate constituent assembly to further entrench his dictatorship, and continues to tighten his grip on the country,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. Many of those targeted by the U.S. are regional representatives on the new assembly, including Adan Chavez, the brother of Venezuela's former leader, who died in 2013. Adan Chavez has been appointed secretary of the new assembly and also is a former governor and minister in Venezuela's government. The sanctions freeze any assets the individuals may have in the U.S. and prevent Americans from doing business with the Venezuelans. The U.S. has said the vote to create the assembly was illegitimate and a sign that Maduro is trying to strengthen what the U.S. calls his ""dictatorship."" Last week, the U.S. targeted Maduro with sanctions, in a rare action against a foreign head of state. Those sanctions followed a previous round, days before the planned vote, that hit 13 current or former top officials in Maduro's government.

In a tweet, Mr. Trump disagreed with McConnell's remark and questioned why the health care law had not been repealed and replaced under his watch. Senator Mitch McConnell said I had ""excessive expectations,"" but I don't think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done? Earlier in the day, Trump aide Dan Scavino, Jr., slammed McConnell in a tweet, suggesting that the majority leader might have needed ""another 4 years - in addition to the 7 years"" to repeal the Affordable Care Act. More excuses. @SenateMajLdr must have needed another 4 years - in addition to the 7 years -- to repeal and replace Obamacare..... https://t.co/6FOVBm6BQU The response comes two days after McConnell said at a Kentucky rotary club, ""Now our new president, has of course, not been in this line of work before and I think had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process."" ""So part of the reason I think people think we're underperforming is because too many kind of artificial deadlines unrelated to the reality of the complexity of legislating may not been fully understood,"" McConnell added. Republicans in the Senate failed to pass a plan last month to repeal and replace Obamacare. Three were voted on and Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, cast the surprise ""no"" vote on the final plan, dooming the effort at the end of the process. Sen. Orrin Hatch said Senate Republicans are not going to return to health care in the fall and will instead focus on tax reform.

""The DPRK must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons,"" Mattis continued. ""The DPRK should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people."" Mattis wrote that Mr. Trump was informed of the ""growing threat"" back in December and upon taking office, his first orders to the defense secretary ""emphasized the readiness of our ballistic missile defense and nuclear deterrent forces."" And?although the State Department?is trying to pursue a diplomatic solution?in preventing the North from attacking the West, ""it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth,"" Mattis said. ""The DPRK regime's actions will continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates,"" Mattis added.

""Nothing that I have seen and nothing that I know of would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours,"" Tillerson said Wednesday. President Trump on Tuesday?also warned Kim about continuing to threaten the U.S.? ""They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,"" he said of North Korea. ""He has been very threatening -- beyond a normal statement,"" Mr. Trump added. ""As I said, they will be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before."" In an interview with?""CBS This Morning""?on Thursday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, supported the aggressive U.S. posture. ""President Trump has basically drawn a red line saying he'll never allow North Korea to have an ICBM missile that can hit America with a nuclear weapon on top, he's not going to let that happen, he's not going to contain the threat, he's going to stop the threat,"" said Graham. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters at the U.N. on Wednesday that the tone right now is too ""bellicose"" and that a military response is not a solution. Nebenzia said that the U.S. and North Korea should begin a ""dialogue,"" reports CBS News' Pamela Falk, and he added that the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. is in touch with North Korean officials.

"Sen. Ron Johnson on Wednesday suggested Sen. John McCain's brain tumor and the late hour influenced the Arizona senator's surprise vote against the GOP's proposed partial repeal of Obamacare last month.? McCain was one of only three GOP senators to vote against his party's ""skinny repeal"" proposal, tanking the bill and quashing GOP hopes of tackling health care reform anytime soon. McCain, who had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer shortly before the vote, flew from Arizona to Washington, D.C., to help with the health care battle before returning to Arizona for further treatment. It was unclear where McCain would side on the legislation in the long moments leading up to the vote.?

"A conservative group on Wednesday launched a $2.5 million TV ad campaign in 24 congressional districts, urging Congress to pick up the pace on tax reform. American Action Network's Middle-Class Growth Initiative is running the ad campaign, in conjunction with a previously announced $1 million radio campaign, in districts across the country with Republican members in Congress -- including in Speaker of the House Paul Ryan's Wisconsin district. Congressional leaders have indicated that, after multiple attempts to tackle health care reform have failed, they're moving on to taxes. Overhauling taxes, some pundits have argued, may be the GOP's best hope in appeasing the base and passing major legislation before the end of the year. The AAN ad features Albert Jones, a former Ohio metal worker and father who was laid off because, he explains in the ad, his employer couldn't keep up with foreign competition anymore. Jones laments that America's tax code is outdated, and forces jobs like his overseas. ""I was proud of my job,"" says Jones in the ad, against the backdrop of a warehouse. ""I was middle class, and it meant a better life for my daughter. But with more foreign competition -- I got laid off. America's tax code is so complicated -- we can't be as competitive. Thousands of jobs like mine are lost to places like China. So when I see Congress working to cut taxes for working families, and bring jobs back, I know how that matters. Congress, pass tax reform that brings the middle class back.""? In a statement, AAN Executive Director Corry Bliss said his organization is ""committed"" to standing with American workers to fight for lower tax rates.? ""There are millions of middle class Americans just like Albert who had the dignity of a good-paying job and the ability to provide for his family until our tax code failed to keep up with foreign competition,"" Bliss said. ""We are committed to standing up for Americans who have been left behind by our broken tax code, and sharing real stories to raise awareness on how jobs have fled to countries like China. It's time for Congress to act and defend hard-working Americans and their families across the country.""

"Immigration was one of the topics covered in the latest CBS News Poll -- here's a closer look at those findings. There is division among the American public on some of the components of recently unveiled proposals for legal immigration endorsed by President Trump, but most remain opposed to a border wall. President Trump is backing a Republican plan to cut legal immigration in half over the next 10 years and impose a merit system for would-be immig... Forty-six percent of Americans prefer the U.S. give priority to immigrants based on education, job skills and work experience, while 44 percent think those with family members here should be given priority. When the CBS News poll last asked this question in 2013, nearly six in 10 thought priority should be given based on education and work skills.? Indicative of how opinions are often shaped by partisanship these days, this shift in opinion is largely due to changing views among Democrats (and independents). Now, more than half of Democrats (54 percent) think family members should have priority but four years ago a majority (57 percent) thought entry in the U.S. should be based mostly on education and work skills. Republicans' views have held steady with most saying preference should be based on education and work skills. Americans are less supportive of requiring legal immigrants to speak English when they arrive in the U.S. More than half oppose (55 percent) such a requirement. Older Americans are likely than those who are young. Overall, Americans feel legal immigration into the U.S. should be kept at the level it is (43 percent), rather than increased (23 percent) or decreased (30 percent). Republicans are more likely than Democrats and independents to want legal immigration decreased. As for the President, Mr. Trump gets negative marks on his handling of the issue of immigration 每 57 percent disapprove. Most Americans continue to oppose a wall along the southern border of the U.S. to help stop illegal immigration, although seven in 10 Republicans favor it. And even if the wall is built, 85 percent think the U.S. will foot the bill, up six points from January. Only one in 10 think Mexico will pay.? Those who support the border wall also don't think Mexico will pay for it 每 70 percent say it will be the U.S. Just 23 percent believe Mexico would end up paying.

"While the rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea heat up over threats of a possible military conflict, Jake Sullivan, a top foreign policy adviser to both Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden, is urging ""resolve, calm and consistent leadership"" in the face of the regime.? Sullivan suggested that the message in?Mr. Trump's Tuesday fiery warning to North Korea?Tuesday may have been misguided. ""The problem with what the president said yesterday is it puts all the attention on the U.S. and what the U.S. is thinking, when the attention should be on North Korea and building pressure against North Korea so we can produce a diplomatic outcome,"" said Sullivan on ""CBS This Morning"" Wednesday. ""It just doesn't help when our allies and countries in the region can't tell whether it's Donald Trump or Kim Jong Un who's the crazier one,"" he added.? Sullivan, who was part of negotiations that led to the crafting of the Iranian nuclear deal during the Obama administration, says it's vital for Mr. Trump not to scuttle that deal, particularly as the U.S. weighs similar consequences in dealing with North Korea's nuclear provocations.? ""If you look at what were dealing with in North Korea right now, we are running up against the possibility of having to use military force to stop the North Korean's from putting a bomb on top of missile. That is not a concern we have today with Iran because Iran's nuclear program is in a box,"" said Sullivan.? ""Blowing up the Iran nuclear deal at a moment when we're dealing with North Korea seems like it is creating a problem that doesn't currently exist."" Despite his criticism of the Trump administration's approach, Sullivan is sympathetic to its efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear programs. ""Anyone who works on North Korean policy has to approach it with humility, because both Democratic and Republican presidents have failed to stop North Korea's march forward,"" Sullivan said. ""That's been true going back 30 years."" ? He added, ""Trump has the possibility of getting China's attention in a way that's more direct and decisive than previous administrations could because of how far North Korea has come."" The adviser suggested that it's possible now to have ""the U.S. and China sit down and essentially get the North Koreans to freeze testing, freeze the progress and put us in a position where we can slow this clock down"" in return for a number of incentives, such as direct monetary payments to the North.? ""In the past it was on the U.S. to make those payments. I would argue it's time for China to actually step up,"" said Sullivan. ?""China should be paying not just for North Korean coal, but compliance."" He added, ""If there's one thing the Chinese have to be able to put to use in this, it's that and no previous administration has really tried this approach. I think it's worth trying today.""?																																																																																																																					"

""They understand, as I do, that we're never going to make America great again unless we have senators in office supporting President Trump,"" he added. ""Dean Heller wasn't just one of the first Never-Trumpers in Nevada, he was one of the most influential. He actually helped Hillary Clinton win the state of Nevada.""

"Last Updated Aug 9, 2017 11:23 AM EDT President Trump on Wednesday seemed to take credit for the the strength of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, a day after warning North Korea that it would be met with ""fire and fury"" if it continues to threaten America. Mr. Trump suggested in tweets that in his nearly seven months of serving as commander in chief, he has made the arsenal more robust. My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before.... ...Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world! Much of the improvements to the arsenal, however, were carried out by the Obama administration, CBS News' Major Garrett reports. The Defense Department and Energy Department spent billions of dollars on refurbishing the arsenal and bringing aging nuclear weapons up to modern capabilities as well as guidance systems and related technologies. Mr. Trump did order a review of U.S. nuclear posture and strategy early in his presidency, but that's different from modernization and bringing old systems up to usable standards. The credit really lies with former President Obama and defense hawks in Congress who funded the work, especially during a time when the federal budget is subject to spending limits. Mr. Trump has requested a 11 percent funding boost in his 2018 budget blueprint to Congress. Ultimately, Obama advocates eliminating all nuclear weapons, a goal he has acknowledged might not be realized in his lifetime.? ?

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said this week, ""To just say we're going to keep doing what we've been doing, the president is not willing to accept that."" The Trump administration is, however, considering a plan proposed by Blackwater founder Erik Prince to privatize a large portion of the U.S. effort in Afghanistan. Prince's plan would send about 5,000 private military contractors to replace U.S. troops helping the Afghan army.

He also said his plan would ""attach"" the contracted forces to the Afghan army because ""the U.S. is not doing any training or mentoring, really, at the battalion level, where the rubber really meets the road."" Prince asserts the contractors would not be mercenaries. ""The way the United Nations defines mercenaries, by being attached to the Afghan army, they would not be mercenaries,"" Prince said.

This is a slight alteration of how they would be used."" CBS News' Margaret Brennan pointed out the contractors would be put ""into combat-like situations."" ""Sure, but it's not a private army. They're attaching to the Afghan army,"" Prince said. ""They're basically, imagine them as skeletal support on which each Afghan battalion is built around. The Afghan special forces are functional. They do well. They conduct 70, 80 percent of the offensive missions. They are mentored in exactly this way by U.S. Special Forces. The problem is the U.S. Army does not have enough sergeants. They can't send 4,000 sergeants and above to go do this mission."" Prince said his plan would ""complete"" the U.S. strategy of having the Afghans fight the war themselves.

A financial disclosure released by the Justice Department and made public by Politico also shows that Mueller's former law firm, WilmerHale, represented some big-name companies, including Facebook, Intel and Apple. Mueller's finances are public record because of his appointment as special counsel. The former FBI director's finances will likely face scrutiny from President Donald Trump's attorneys and Trump supporters who have been looking for conflicts of interest to call into question his independence. Mueller is investigating Russia's interference in the election and possible collusion with Trump associates. His filing shows a Justice Department ethics official found ""no apparent conflicts of interest."" Mueller is using a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C.?as part of the federal probe he's leading into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed him in May after Mr. Trump abruptly?fired James Comey?as FBI director.

"Dissatisfied with Democratic fortunes in the era of President Donald Trump, a group of prominent Democrats is forming an organization outside the formal party structure with the goal of winning again in Republican-dominated middle America. Calling itself ""New Democracy,"" the group includes sitting and former governors, former Cabinet members, mayors and lawmakers from Congress to statehouses. Among the affiliated politicians: Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, considered a possible future presidential candidate; former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, also a former Iowa governor; and Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, current head of the nonpartisan U.S. Conference of Mayors. ""We have to expand this party, and make it a bigger tent,"" said Will Marshall, the Democratic policy veteran who is running the group. Another one of the organizers, former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, told The Associated Press in a recent interview that Democrats ""cannot be a successful national policy by winning races only on our two coasts."" The party, Beshear said, ""has to get back to the basics and appeal to folks all over our country."" The group plans to form affiliated political action committees to endorse and raise money for candidates. It has met twice in recent months and plans another gathering this fall in Iowa. Marshall, who helped run a similar effort for moderate Democrats like Bill Clinton in the 1980s, said New Democracy isn't trying to run a shadow party or foment ""sectarian battles"" between moderates and liberals. But he said the official party leadership ""reflects the places Democrats have already won,"" adding that ""you have got to have credible messengers."" Democrats' highest ranking elected leaders are House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. It's not unintentional that the new effort echoes the Democratic Leadership Council, the group that then-Arkansas Gov. Clinton used to popularize his ""third way"" political philosophy. Calling himself a ""New Democrat,"" Clinton tilted the Democratic Party away from its more liberal coastal anchors and helped his party reclaim the White House in 1992 after several landslide defeats. In 2017, Democrats face an even starker power deficit, despite Hillary Clinton, Bill's wife, having won the presidential popular vote last November. Trump sits in the White House, while Republicans control both the House and Senate and two-thirds of U.S. statehouses. In 25 states, Republicans control the entire legislature and the governors. Democrats have that dominance in just six states, none between the West Coast and the Northeast. Last week, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice switched parties, leaving the Democrats to become a Republican, in a dramatic announcement alongside Mr. Trump at the president's rally.? WV Gov. Jim Justice switches parties: ""I'll tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democrat governor."" pic.twitter.com/bWaBdWXu0r ""Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me,"" Gov. Justice said. ""Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."" The rally erupted in cheers. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez acknowledges the party's struggles between the coastlines. He's made modest increases in the national party's support of state and local parties. But he also has found himself in public spats between liberals who want an absolutist position on issues like abortion rights and moderates who would back candidates who veer from party orthodoxy. Marshall said economic policy arguments rise above ""these litmus tests."" An example, he said, is highlighting Trump's more isolationist trade policy and how it is steering foreign partners away from U.S. agriculture. ""This is coming home to roost in rural America,"" Marshall said, ""so we need to talk about that the right way and in the right places.""

"Last Updated Aug 9, 2017 8:16 AM EDT WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged calm and said Americans should have ""no concerns"" after North Korea and President Donald Trump traded fiery threats, insisting Wednesday he doesn't believe there is ""any imminent threat."" ""Americans should sleep well at night,"" Tillerson said. In more tranquil terms, Tillerson sought to explain the thinking behind Mr. Trump's warning to Pyongyang that it would be ""met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"" if it made more threats to the United States. Tillerson said Mr. Trump was trying to send a strong and clear message to North Korea's leader so that there wouldn't be ""any miscalculation."" Some Republicans and Democrats say President Trump's strong words against North Korea are not helping the situation. Mr. Trump echoed the tone of... ""What the president is doing is sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong Un can understand, because he doesn't seem to understand diplomatic language,"" Tillerson said. ""I think the president just wanted to be clear to the North Korean regime on the U.S. unquestionable ability to defend itself, will defend itself and its allies."" He said North Korea's escalating threats showed it was feeling the pressure from a successful U.S. strategy. Tillerson downplayed any speculation that the alarming developments suggested the U.S. was moving closer to a military option to dealing with the crisis over the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. ""Nothing that I have seen and nothing that I know of would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours,"" Tillerson said. Nonetheless, as CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy reports, the Chinese government fears the escalating war of words between Pyongyang and Washington will spark a regional arms race -- which already seems to be happening. Japan and South Korea say they will reshape their militaries in response to North Korea's latest threat against the American territory of Guam. T... South Korean President Moon Jae-In is calling for a complete overhaul of South Korea's military in the face of North Korea's rapidly evolving nuclear capabilities, and in Japan, some lawmakers are pushing for new weapons that could give the country a preemptive strike capability, reports Tracy.? In response to a query from CBS News, the Chinese government would only say that, ""the situation on the Korean peninsula is highly sensitive. We hope the parties will be cautious with words and behavior and stop provoking each other and avoid escalation."" Tillerson spoke to reporters aboard his plane as he returned from Malaysia to Washington, stopping along the way in Guam. Hours earlier, North Korea's army had said in a statement it was exploring plans for attacking the tiny U.S. territory, which houses U.S. military bases and is a common refueling stop for U.S. government aircraft traversing the Pacific Ocean. Tillerson said he never considered re-routing his trip from Malaysia so as to avoid stopping in Guam. Though he insisted there was no imminent threat, he noted that even if there were, ""the North Korean missile capability can point in many directions, so Guam is not the only place that would be under threat."" Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are reacting to President Trump's latest comments on North Korea. Congressional reporter for The Hill Molly ... The comments put Tillerson once again in the role of translating the president's aggressive rhetoric into more diplomatic terms, and of working to minimize the chances of a public panic. Though it's extremely unlikely the North would risk annihilation by pre-emptively attacking American citizens, the escalating rhetoric has heightened concern that a miscalculation could spiral out of control and lead to military conflict - a concern that residents of Guam said they felt particularly acutely. Tillerson, who spent the past days in Asia working the North Korea conflict, said he didn't believe a new diplomatic strategy was needed. To the contrary, he said the latest threat from the North suggested the current strategy was working. After months of frustration over China's reluctance to pressure Pyongyang economically, the U.S. on Saturday secured a unanimous U.N. Security Council vote to authorize sweeping new sanctions that target one-third of the North's exports. ""The pressure is starting to show,"" Tillerson said. ""I think that's why the rhetoric coming out of Pyongyang is beginning to become louder and more threatening. Whether we've got them backed into a corner or not is difficult to say, but diplomatically, you never like to have someone in a corner without a way for them to get out."" To that end, Tillerson said there was still an off-ramp available to Pyongyang: A return to negotiations with the U.S., a step that Tillerson has previously said can happen only if Kim Jong Un's government gives up its nuclear aspirations, starting with an extended pause in missile tests. ""Talks,"" Tillerson said when asked if North Korea had a way out. ""Talks, with the right expectation of what those talks will be about.""																																																																																																																					"
"After President Trump issued his latest threat to North Korea amid news that the regime passed yet another milestone in developing their nuclear capabilities, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, says the U.S. is ""headed"" toward military action and that the president would go to war to prevent North Korea from striking America. ""President Trump has basically drawn a red line saying he'll never allow North Korea to have an ICBM missile that can hit America with a nuclear weapon on top, he's not going to let that happen, he's not going to contain the threat, he's going to stop the threat,"" Graham told ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday. Speaking from Clemson, South Carolina, the Republican said two scenarios in which the U.S. would act with force would be if ""they attack Guam or some other American interest or our allies, or if they try to keep developing an ICBM."" He added that he feels the U.S. will head toward war with the North ""unless the world can stop North Korea"", saying Mr. Trump will ""pick homeland defense over regional stability and he has to."" Graham's comments come one day after Mr. Trump's ""fire and fury"" warning to the regime. President Trump drew a line Tuesday for North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and warned of ""fire and fury"" if threats against the U.S. continue. Th... Mr. Trump delivered the message to the North during a briefing on the opioid epidemic from his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club where he is currently staying for the duration of his 17-day ""working vacation."" Democrats were less than inspired by Mr. Trump's tough talk, leaving many key lawmakers under the impression that the rhetoric will only make the tense situation even worse. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who previously served as a top member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted that isolating North Korea ""has not halted their pursuit of nuclear weapons."" She said ""diplomacy is the only path forward."" Feinstein went on to say Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who's currently in Asia, should discuss the reopening of North Korea talks with U.S. regional partners. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a frequent Graham ally, delivered a warning to Mr. Trump himself, saying to make sure he can back up what he's promising. ""I take exception to the president's comments because you've got to be sure that you can do what you say you're going to do,"" he said in an interview on KTAR Phoenix. Graham said Mr. Trump's warning was also message to China. ""China should have two options: deal with the nut job in your back yard or realize there will be a war in your backyard,"" Graham said. While the Republican lawmaker did not waver over the threat of war, he said he still had hope for a more diplomatic resolution. ""I hope diplomacy will work, sanctions haven't worked before, maybe they will now,"" he said. ""But if there's going to be a war, it's going to be in the region, not in America.""

"Republicans face a problem as they try to defend a slim majority in the Senate and win races elsewhere: Insurgent primary candidates are trying to lay claim to President Donald Trump's mantle, and knock out the establishment's choices. The latest case is in Nevada, where endangered GOP incumbent Sen. Dean Heller drew a challenge Tuesday from businessman and repeat failed candidate Danny Tarkanian, who announced his bid in an early morning Fox News Channel appearance seemingly aimed at an audience of one: the president himself. ""We're never going to make America great again unless we have senators in office that fully support President Trump and his America-first agenda,"" Tarkanian said, criticizing Heller as ""one of the first never-Trumpers in Nevada"" and arguing he had obstructed Trump's agenda in Congress. Heller opposed early versions of Mr. Trump-backed health care legislation in the Senate before voting for a final version that failed anyway. His campaign spokesman, Tommy Ferraro, dismissed Tarkanian as a ""perennial candidate."" The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is the official Senate GOP campaign arm, quickly announced its support for Heller, and a super PAC backed by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., committed to spending what it takes to support him and other GOP incumbents. The dynamic mirrors longstanding clashes between the GOP's establishment and activist wings, which played out disastrously in 2010 and 2012 when hard-core conservatives won Senate primaries but went on to lose to Democrats. McConnell and his allies vowed never to let that happen again and have subsequently intervened in primaries when necessary to produce candidates who could win. The X factor now is the appeal Mr. Trump may hold to Republican primary voters 〞 and what Mr. Trump himself will do. The president offered one clue Tuesday night, backing the establishment candidate in next week's GOP Senate special election primary in Alabama, hours after an Associated Press story noted the absence so far of a presidential endorsement in the race. Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement! ""Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement!"" the president wrote, bypassing a firebrand House conservative, Mo Brooks, and an evangelical former state chief justice, Roy Moore, in favor of the appointed senator strongly backed by McConnell. The candidates are fighting over the seat previously held by now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But whether Heller will get the presidential seal of approval in his primary is far less clear, and he is not alone. Next door in Arizona, GOP incumbent Sen. Jeff Flake, another Trump skeptic during last year's campaign, faces at least one challenge from the right in conservative Kelli Ward, who repeatedly denounces Flake while praising Trump. In each case, to their annoyance, establishment-aligned Republicans face the prospect of spending millions to protect an incumbent from a challenger who might have a tough time getting out of the general election. Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority and are playing offense against Democratic incumbents in 10 states Mr. Trump won. ""It's a critical time to make sure that Republican members know, when they're casting tough votes, that we'll have their backs,"" said Steven Law, a former McConnell chief of staff who heads the Senate Leadership Fund, in describing the decision to come in with millions to back Strange in Alabama. Until Mr. Trump weighed in with his endorsement late Tuesday, the Alabama race had underscored questions about the role the president would play in Senate primaries. A former GOP Senate campaign official with knowledge of the situation said the NRSC has sought help from the Trump White House on Senate races but those requests went unanswered under the leadership of recently ousted Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, leading to widespread frustration. The former campaign official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal party matters. While Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have said they want to increase the Republican majorities in the House and Senate, the White House's approach to contentious primaries isn't clear yet. And Mr. Trump has already worked against McConnell's goals, ignoring his pleas not to appoint former Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, a likely Senate candidate, as Interior secretary, while boosting endangered Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia by hosting them at Trump Tower. As for Heller, he is already walking the Trump tightrope. Heller's initial denunciation of a Senate plan to repeal and replace Obamacare drew the ire of a political nonprofit promoting Mr. Trump's agenda. America First Policies tied Heller to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in a social media push and threatened to spend more than $1 million trashing him on television and radio on his home turf. McConnell called the group's attacks ""beyond stupid."" In addition to the health care episode, Heller in 2015 said he was donating Mr. Trump's previous campaign contributions to charity 〞 a move he announced after Mr. Trump came under fire for characterizing some illegal immigrants from Mexico as rapists. For a president with a famously long memory for slights, Heller may have little hope of getting back into his good graces.

"Here's what we know, as of last week: Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, the man tasked with leading the investigation into Russian interference, is using a grand jury in Washington, D.C. And he's hired a lot of prominent lawyers to work on his team, including experts in white-collar crime and national security. These are all newsworthy developments because it shows that Mueller's investigation is ramping up, not slowing down, which means he thinks there's something to the case. According to Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, the use of a grand jury ""means that Mueller believes there is sufficient evidence that a crime was committed to warrant a criminal investigation."" ""It confirms what we already suspected〞that this is a criminal investigation, not just a counter-intelligence investigation,"" Mariotti told CBS News. On the other hand, as Georgetown Law professor Julie Rose O'Sullivan points out, it's not really surprising that Mueller as turned to a grand jury. CBS News has confirmed special counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in his investigation into Russian election meddling. Jamil Jaffer, fo... ""It is actually not a big deal〞for people in the white-collar crime field it was totally expected,"" O'Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor who worked on the Whitewater investigation into President Bill Clinton, told CBS News. ""In such cases, often the only way to get the documents and electronic and other records one needs is with grand jury subpoenas. And although witnesses can decline to talk to federal agents, they cannot refuse to testify before the grand jury unless they have a valid claim to a Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination or other privilege."" ""A grand jury is an important tool that allows prosecutors to issue subpoenas that require people to produce documents and other evidence,"" Mariotti explains. ""Subpoenas can also be used to compel people to testify under oath before the grand jury."" Additionally, the he grand jury is also supposed to serve as a check on federal prosecutors. ""Grand juries first ensure that no one is indicted for a federal felony without proof by the government that there is probable cause to believe that he or she committed a crime,"" O'Sullivan says. ""This grand jury?can?return an indictment, but the mere fact that a grand jury is impaneled does not mean there will be an indictment, although most federal criminal investigations result in someone being indicted,"" Mariotti says. ""Indictments are usually sought at the very end of an investigation, and grand juries are typically impaneled at the very beginning of an investigation. So it's unlikely that an indictment will be returned soon. It's too early to tell whether indictments will be issued＃Only a grand jury can issue an indictment, which is the only way that someone can be charged with committing a felony according to the Constitution."" ""There's an old saying that a grand jury would 'indict a ham sandwich' if a prosecutor asked, because no opposing lawyer is present,"" Mariotti says. ""Another reason that grand juries tend to return indictments when prosecutors present them is because prosecutors need to have proof 'beyond a reasonable doubt' and grand juries only have to consider a much lower standard, called 'probable cause.'"" As President Trump began his 17-day vacation on Saturday, news emerged that his administration has been contacted by special counsel Robert Muell... According to Sullivan, ""the statistics prove that most grand juries indict when asked〞but it is difficult to know whether that is because the grand jurors are overly compliant or because prosecutors, fearing a declination, are disciplined in proving probable cause."" It's just a bunch of everyday American citizens, and they're picked from the same pool as regular trial jurors. ""Grand jurors are ordinary citizens who agree to serve on a regular basis, typically once a week,"" Mariotti says. But because grand juries tend to take more time than regular trial juries, they are often excused if their responsibilities at home or work take preclude them from participating for a month or more. ""In my experience, many grand jurors are retired or unemployed,"" O'Sullivan says. ""There are 16 to 23 grand jurors at random and vetted by the federal district court,"" Matiotti says. ""Unlike a trial, there is no one from the defense asking questions or striking jurors that the defense dislikes."" Without a defense attorney present to screen jurors, vetting them falls to the court and the prosecution for what O'Sullivan calls ""bias or other disqualifying circumstances."" Washington voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in November, with exit polls showing that roughly nine in ten district voters pulling the lever for the Democratic nominee. Some Trump defenders, such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, have tried to insinuate that this means the jury will be biased against President Trump and his associates. President Trump got 68.63% in West Virginia, 4.8% in Washingtoin DC. Guess where Mueller has a grand jury? Guess how biased it will be? But will this actually matter? It's hard to predict, says O'Sullivan, given how many people tend to ignore jury summons altogether. ""If you check the statistics, I think you will find that many, many citizens called to jury duty ignore the summons,"" she says. ""Generally, only those who care about complying with law or civic responsibility show. I'm not sure what that that sub-group's political affiliations or political biases might be."" The inherently political nature of the case also makes it difficult to say how jurors will act. ""I have seen cases in which a special grand jury came to be identified with prosecution team and was very pro-prosecutor,"" O'Sullivan says. ""But if you look at the grand jury minutes from the Lewinsky investigation＃you will see that the grand jury appeared to be hostile, at least in some instances, to [independent counsel] Ken Starr's prosecutors and so more defense oriented."" And if Muller's investigation leads him to possible crimes that were committed outside Washington, he may need to find a new grand jury to use. ""Because the grand jury is based in D.C., that means that any indictment returned by the grand jury has to concern crimes that have a significant connection to Washington D.C.,"" Matiotti says. ""If Mueller uncovers a crime that is not connected to D.C., he will have to present evidence before a grand jury in another jurisdiction to obtain an indictment there, unless the crime is part of a broader conspiracy that is connected to D.C."" In any event, the location probably doesn't matter that much given how friendly grand juries tend to be to prosecutors. ""It doesn't really matter that the grand jurors are in D.C. because any grand jury would very likely return an indictment presented by a prosecutor,"" Mariotti says.?

"By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto The American public is frustrated that Congress hasn't gotten much done and Republicans split on whether their party is getting in the way of President Trump's agenda. Meanwhile, by two to one Americans think Congressional Democrats are doing more to get in the way of Mr. Trump's agenda, but not offering their own agenda for the country. Congress has left Washington for summer recess, and nearly nine in 10 Americans -- 86 percent -- say it didn't get much done. Most 每 particularly Republicans - feel frustrated about that. Among those who say Congress didn't accomplish much, three in four are frustrated, feeling a lot of unfinished business was left behind. Frustration is evident across the political spectrum, but some Democrats (about a third) are glad Congress didn't get much done because it didn't have the right priorities. Underscoring this sentiment, Congress continues to get dismal overall ratings from the public. Seventy-three percent disapprove of the job they are doing, six points worse than in February. Some Republicans express frustration with how their party in Congress is approaching the President's agenda. Fifty-six percent of them say Congressional Republicans are getting in the way of that plan; just 13 percent think they are helping it, and another quarter feel Congress is striking the right balance on Trump's agenda. Among those Republicans who say their party is impeding Trump's agenda, nine in 10 are frustrated about that. With many members of Congress now back home, eight in 10 Americans think it's very important that members personally attend town halls to hear from their constituents. But many Americans are uncertain that their own member of Congress would actually listen to them. Fifty-five percent say their representative might be available but wouldn't listen, or else wouldn't be available at all. Fewer than four in 10 think their member of Congress would be available and hear them out. When Congress returns to Washington in September, Americans most want them to get to work on an issue they left unfinished 每 health care. Improving health care is the top priority for both Democrats and Republicans, far ahead of other issues like reforming the tax system and infrastructure. ? By two to one, Americans think congressional Democrats are getting in the way of Mr. Trump's agenda, more than they're offering their own agenda for the country. Nearly eight in 10 of those who feel congressional Democrats are doing more to block Trump than offering their own agenda are frustrated by that. Most Americans think the Democratic Party is more focused on civil rights and social justice these days, but a majority thinks it should be more focused on economic opportunity. Republicans and independents are especially likely to say this. Democrats themselves are divided over which of those their party should focus on. Liberal Democrats are more likely to say civil rights and social justice, while moderate and conservative Democrats think the party's focus should be more on economic opportunity. ?Americans don't feel that either Democratic party or the GOP has the only good ideas for the economy. Many think their ideas are a mix of good and bad. Even most party stalwarts describe their party's economic ideas as a mix of good and bad. Right now, Americans do not believe that the country would be better off with the Democrats in control of Congress than the Republicans. Almost four in 10 think things would be the same. Three in 10 think things would be worse. Just six in 10 Democrats think things would be better. This is underscored by the negative opinions Americans continue to have of both political parties, although the Democratic Party is viewed slightly more favorably -- 39 percent have a favorable view of the Democratic party, while 32 percent view the Republican party favorably. ? More Americans approve than disapprove of the job Mike Pence is doing as Vice-President. His ratings are similar to what they were in February. Forty-seven percent now approve of the job he's doing, compared to 50 percent in February. Pence gets very high approval ratings from his own party (88 percent), while most Democrats disapprove (61 percent). Independents are divided (42 percent approve and 39 percent disapprove). This poll was conducted by telephone August 3-6, 2017 among a random sample of 1,111 adults nationwide.? Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Glen Mills, PA.? Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request.

""I don't believe that President Reagan or President Eisenhower or other presidents that I've admired would have said the same thing. They might have done as much as we could but not that kind of rhetoric, I'm not sure how it helps.""

"President Trump is currently at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey on what a White House official has described as a ""working vacation."" ""Working in Bedminster, N.J., as long planned construction is being done at the White House. This is not a vacation - meetings and calls!"" Mr. Trump tweeted out from his personal Twitter account last week.? Working in Bedminster, N.J., as long planned construction is being done at the White House. This is not a vacation - meetings and calls! Mr. Trump departed for the 17-day trip on Friday. It marks his fifth visit to the club and his 13th overall vacation-like trip since the beginning of his presidency. Mr. Trump's last trip to his namesake golf course happened three weeks ago when it hosted the U.S. Women's Open golf tournament. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump made his first on-camera appearance since beginning his trip. In a briefing on the U.S. opioid epidemic, alongside Kellyanne Conway as well as Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, the president went off subject and focused on North Korea. A gallery of America's leaders on the golf course over the years ""North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,"" Mr. Trump said. ""They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,"" he added. Mr. Trump's words of warning come following a U.S. intelligence assessment that determined North Korea has developed the ability to build a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on top of a ballistic missile, including an intercontinental missile that is capable of reaching the United States. Unlike in past presidencies, the Trump administration has not released a daily schedule of Mr. Trump's activities. However, glimpses of Mr. Trump's activities and whereabouts while on the trip have surfaced via social media. For example, a since-deleted Instagram photo tagged at the Bedminster course showed Trump behind the wheel of a golf cart. Mr. Trump has still received briefings from his staff. The president was briefed Saturday morning from chief of staff Gen. John Kelly about the Marine Osprey helicopter crash, according to a White House official. While on the New Jersey trip, Mr. Trump also ""had an hour long call with the Secretary of State Tillerson and Chief of Staff General Kelly to discuss North Korea and receive an update on Secretary Tillerson's trip,"" according to the White House. For the duration of the trip, the president will continue to have meetings and briefings with White House advisers and lawmakers, according to a White House official. Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump's daughter, and her husband Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, have also joined the president on his trip. Both serve as senior advisers to Mr. Trump. Although he is out of the Oval Office, Mr. Trump has not taken a vacation from Twitter. The subjects of the president's tweets include his dissatisfaction with leaks of sensitive information from the White House and updates on the United States' increasingly tumultuous relationship with North Korea. He also launched an attack on Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, in which the president expressed that he ""should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there."" I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there While the president is away, the White House is undergoing $3.4 million worth of renovations, which had been approved by the previous administration. Mr. Trump said in a tweet that he plans to be ""Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation."" Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation.

"Last Updated Aug 9, 2017 11:35 AM EDT President Trump has not directly exchanged private messages with special counsel Robert Mueller, Mr. Trump's chief counsel John Down told CBS News Chief White House correspondent Major Garrett, clarifying an earlier USA TODAY report in which Dowd said the president ""has sent messages back and forth."" Dowd, calling the description in USA TODAY a misunderstanding, said he has personally communicated with Mueller. Dowd said there are no direct messages between Mr. Trump and Mueller or vis versa. Dowd said he has been in communication with Mueller since joining the president's legal team and that in the process has ""shared the president's thoughts"" as well as his own with Mueller about the probe. Mueller is overseeing the federal investigation into Russia's influence on the 2016 election. ""I am the communicator,"" Dowd told CBS News. ""The communications have been appropriate and professional. In both directions."" In the earlier USA Today report, Dowd had said, ""The president has sent messages back and forth."" CBS News has confirmed special counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in his investigation into Russian election meddling. Jamil Jaffer, fo... ""We get along well with Bob Mueller; our communications have been constructive,"" he told USA TODAY. ""But it is important that our communications remain confidential. It's important that there not be any breakdown in that trust.'"" Dowd told CBS News speculation that Mueller might be fired is ""nonsense."" ""It is not on the table,"" Dowd said. But the president himself and one of his lawyers have not ruled out firing Mueller, who Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed in May after Mr. Trump abruptly fired James Comey as FBI director. The report on Tuesday comes just a few days after it became known that Mueller is using a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. as part of his probe into Russia. Meanwhile, two senators introduced a bipartisan measure last week that would protect Mueller's job in that it would allow any Department of Justice special counsel to challenge his or her removal in court. CBS News Chief White House correspondent Major Garrett contributed to this report.

"On October 15, 2016, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump outlined steps his administration would take to combat the opioid crisis. Below is a check-up on the 12 promises he made in that speech. We will update this list as new steps are taken by the administration. The problem:?Two million Americans?are addicted to prescription opioids, 600,000 are addicted to heroin and some estimates say over 59,000 people died from drug overdose deaths in 2016. 1. We will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country. ?The number of illegal border crossings has dropped by more than half in the last year. In June, there were 21,659 illegal crossings compared to 45,722 in the same month last year,?according to the US Customs and Border Protection?statistics. However, it's unclear if that decline has made a difference in the amount of heroin or fentanyl coming across the border. The number of opioid deaths rose in the first nine months of 2016, according to the?National Center for Health Statistics. There are no figures for 2017 yet. 2. We are also going to put an end to ""sanctuary cities,"" which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation. The administration has aggressively sought to end the designation of sanctuary cities and that effort has now been?challenged in a lawsuit. 3. We will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and we will send them swiftly out of our country. While Immigration, Customs and Enforcement agency (ICE) arrests have risen by 37 percent,?actual deportations have fallen during the Trump Administration, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The head of ICE has pointed to a backlog in the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review as a cause of the lack of deportations. 4. We will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs. The president?requested a 3.7 percent increase in spending?for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in his fiscal year 2018 budget. 5. We will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service. In order to ""close the shipping loophole,"" experts say the first step is to digitally scan all postal packages that come into the United States. The U.S. Postal Service recently told Congress that they scan about half of all packages, but a?bill introduced by Sen. Rob Portman?would require the scanning of all packages. The White House supports this bill but the legislation has stalled in the Senate Finance Committee, where it has been for almost a year. CBS News checks on the promises Trump made about fighting the opioid epidemic while campaigning. 6. The FDA has been far too slow to approve abuse-deterring drugs.?The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)?approved the abuse deterrent drug RoxyBond?in April. The FDA also took the historic step of?removing the opioid Opana ER?from the market specifically because of its addictive qualities. 7. And when the FDA has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treat. As president, I'd work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision.? The Obama Administration bumped the cap on the number of patients a doctor can treat from 200 to 275, but advocates say it should be at 500. The Trump Administration has not acted on this. 8. At the same time, DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S.?In early August 2017, the DEA announced?it is proposing to further reduce the amount of opioids that can be produced in the United States by 20 percent. 9. I would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment. The Trump Administration has tried to take credit for steps for work that happened during the Obama Administration. ""Trump Administration Awards Grants to States to Combat the Opioid Crisis"" reads an April press release from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that announced a $485 million infusion to the states. But the bipartisan bill authorizing that money was supported by Vice President Biden and signed by President Obama in 2016. 10. I would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment. The president's fiscal year 2018 budget requested an increase in drug treatment funding by $200 million to $10.8 billion, although advocates say even that number falls short. Health care reform bills supported by the White House cut Medicaid's growth significantly, even though some 1.8 million people who got Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act rely on the program for drug abuse treatment. The president's budget request for 2018 also called for a $167 million cut to drug abuse prevention. 11. I would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives. When CBS News interviewed Richard Baum, the acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy in late July 2017, he said the administration has been ""advocating for access to Narcan"" but they ""have a lot more work to do."" 12. I would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration. Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention. ?In late June, 2017?President Trump signed the bipartisan bill Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 that was supported by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Since becoming president the President and administration officials have made other promises regarding the opioid crisis.? We are tracking them here as well. 13. On March 29th, the president announced the creation of an ""opioid commission,"" noting that an interim report would be produced by the end of June. ?The commission didn't meet for two months because of ""scheduling delays"" and the?interim report?was released a month late. It called for the president to declare the opioid crisis a ""national emergency."" No word from the White House on whether that will happen. 14. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway?told CBS News?in mid-July that one of her goals was to ""de-stigmatize addiction.""?To date there has not been any initiatives announced on that front.

Senator Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement! Strange, 64, who previously served as state attorney general, has been temporarily filling the seat that was held by Jeff Sessions, who now serves as attorney general. The incumbent is fighting a spirited battle to keep his seat against Roy Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice and Rep. Mo Brooks, who has served in the House since 2011.? All three candidates have been tying themselves closely to Mr. Trump. Strange and Moore, for example, have ads promoting their desire to ""drain the swamp.""

""FBI agents executed a search warrant at one of Mr. Manafort's residences. Mr. Manafort has consistently cooperated with law enforcement and other serious inquiries and did so on this occasion as well,"" said Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni. Federal agents came to his home in Alexandria, Virginia last month in the predawn hours of July 26, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. This would have been a day after he met privately with the Senate Intelligence Committee. According to the Post's report, the search warrant was wide-ranging and FBI agents left his home with various records. The New York Times, citing a person briefed on the matter, reported that agents were searching for tax documents and foreign banking records, ? The Senate Judiciary Committee had also subpoenaed Manafort to appear at a public hearing last month, but his attorney said that Manafort would be willing to provide a ""single transcribed interview to Congress."" In late June, Manafort retroactively registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for his political consulting work for a Ukrainian political party.

"BATON ROUGE, La. -- A federal judge has permanently blocked a Louisiana law that prevented foreign-born U.S. citizens from getting married if they couldn't produce a birth certificate. U.S. District Judge Ivan Lemelle's ruling resolves a lawsuit Lafayette resident Viet Anh Vo filed last year after he and his U.S.-born fiancee had their application for a marriage license rejected two weeks before their wedding. The permanent injunction benefits anyone whom the 2016 law prevented from obtaining a marriage license. The judge initially blocked enforcement of the statute in March, pending Tuesday's final ruling. Lawmakers responded in June by allowing marriage license applicants who can't produce a birth certificate to get a judicial waiver. But Lemelle said that new law, which took effect on Aug. 1, preserved other unconstitutional provisions, such as passport and visa requirements, that apply only to foreign-born citizens. The state failed to demonstrate a ""compelling governmental interest"" in creating a two-tiered system based on whether a citizen was born inside or outside the U.S., he said. ""The State of Louisiana is not harmed by having to issue a marriage license to, in this case, a United States citizen who merely lacks a birth certificate due to circumstances beyond his control,"" Lemelle wrote, adding that the right to marriage is ""fundamental."" The Louisiana Department of Health ""supports and encourages"" marriage and always intended to ""treat everyone equally,"" agency chief of staff Andrew Tuozzolo said Wednesday in response to the ruling. ""It has been our intention from the very beginning to cure this issue,"" he added. State Rep. Valarie Hodges, a Republican who sponsored the 2016 law, has said it was designed deter foreigners from gaining visas and citizenship through sham marriages. Vo, 32, was born in an Indonesian refugee camp after his parents fled Vietnam as refugees, and neither country's government recognized his birth. Vo has lived in Louisiana since he was 3 months old and became a U.S. citizen when he was 8 years old. Vo and his fiancee, Heather Pham, spent thousands of dollars and invited 350 guests to their wedding in February 2016 before their application for a marriage license was rejected last year by court clerks in three parishes. They went ahead with the ceremony, but couldn't make their marriage official. Alvaro Huerta, one of Vo's lawyers, said the couple hasn't legally married yet because they wanted to wait for a final ruling from the judge. Huerta said his client is thrilled and proud to have helped other people in the same predicament. ""He has come a long way, because I think he was reluctant at first to challenge the system,"" added Huerta, a Los Angeles-based attorney for the National Immigration Law Center. Vo's court challenge allowed Tiana Nobile, 29, to get married in April. Nobile was born in South Korea, adopted as an infant and became a U.S. citizen as a toddler. She had her citizenship paperwork, passport and driver's license, but didn't have a birth certificate. Nobile and her husband, Austin Feldbaum, began following Vo's case and obtained their marriage license in New Orleans about a week after Lemelle's ruling in March. Cutting through the red tape to get a waiver from a judge and secure the license consumed nearly an entire day. ""I think the whole process is incredibly alienating,"" Nobile said. ""My partner and I decided to get married and the state's response was, 'Well, where are you really from?'""

"As tensions flared between North Korea and the U.S. this week, Facebook and Twitter uses responded with unusual levels of engagement, according to an analysis released Wednesday of social media interactions with stories involving North Korea-related terms.? The social media company SocialFlow tracked Facebook and Twitter interactions with stories that included the terms, ""fire and fury,"" World War III,"" ""apocalypse,"" ""nuclear war,"" ""nuclear arms race,"" North Korea threat,"" ""missile threat,"" ""nuclear holocaust"" and ""nukes,"" over the last week. The company found Twitter users' mentions of ""nuclear war"" surged. The term, which received only a few thousand mentions on days earlier in the week, shot up to roughly 140,000 Twitter mentions on Wednesday. The term ""fire and fury,"" which President Trump used to depict the U.S.' potential response to North Korean aggression, also surged from virtual non-existence on Twitter to more than 100,000 mentions on Tuesday.? The mentions jumped after reports broke that North Korea is one step closer to being able to target the continental U.S. with a nuclear missile, and Mr. Trump pledged to meet North Korean aggression with ""fire and fury"" of a kind the world ""has never seen ?before."" Mentions for ""World War III"" also increased as the week progressed.? SocialFlow analyzed Twitter mentions of particular terms surrounding the North Korean crisis in early August. But SocialFlow discovered this week's events sparked a rare social media occurrence as well. Facebook and Twitter users shared and retweeted stories with those aforementioned terms more than they ""liked"" those stories. That, according to SocialFlow, is a unusual event in hard news stories, showing high levels of engagement and interest. Retweets and shares also surpassed likes, for example, when Mr. Trump?fired FBI Director James Comey. On Twitter Tuesday, stories involving any of those terms received 13,528 retweets and 11,607 likes. On Facebook Tuesday, stories involving any of those terms had 58,990 shares and 48,229 likes.? Also on Tuesday, stories involving those terms saw unusually high numbers of comments on Facebook, a clear indication of active user engagement. Stories with those terms had 32,381 comments, not too far behind the number of likes they received -- 48,229.?

"A statement released Wednesday by the North Korean army says President Trump is ""a guy bereft of reason."" ""Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him,"" reads the statement by General Kim Rak Gyom. It was released on state-run media. The latest communication from North Korea came amid heightened tensions between the reclusive nuclear power and the U.S. On Tuesday, President Trump said threats from Pyongyang would be met with ""fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which the world has never seen before."" Earlier that day, a Defense Intelligence Agency report concluded North Korea is now capable of miniaturizing a nuclear warhead, stoking fears the country could soon be able to mount one on an ICBM capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. Faced with new evidence of North Korea's nuclear progress, and knowing President Trump had grown weary of diplomatic niceties, Mr. Trump's nation... Wednesday's statement came just one day after North Korea's military threatened an attack on?Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific that is home to a major American naval base. That statement said U.S. bombers from Guam ""openly stage actual war drills and muscle-flexing in a bid to strike the strategic bases of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea]."" In Wednesday's statement, Gyom also reiterated their threat to fire missiles at the waters off Guam. Gyom is the head of North Korea's rocket command. ""As already clarified, the Strategic Force of the KPA is seriously examining the plan for an enveloping strike at Guam through simultaneous fire of four Hwasong-12 intermediate-range strategic ballistic rockets in order to interdict the enemy forces on major military bases on Guam and to signal a crucial warning to the U.S."" the statement says. According to the statement, this plan would call for North Korea to fire missiles over Japan and into the water ""30 to 40km [about 18 to 24 miles] away from Guam."" It says North Korea's military will complete their plan by ""mid-August and report it to the commander-in-chief of the [North Korean] nuclear force and wait for his order."" The statement also blasts Mr. Trump for playing golf while ""failing to grasp the ongoing grave situation.""

"The war of words between North Korea and the U.S. is escalating. Last week, the United Nations Security Council approved new sanctions against the country, which responded with a vow of ""thousand-fold revenge"" against the U.S.? On Tuesday, an intelligence report that came to light concluded that North Korea has the ability to build a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on top of a ballistic missile. President Trump then warned North Korea, vowing ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" if threats against the U.S. continue. CBS News' Anthony Mason spoke with Bill Richardson, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and an expert on North Korea, about the increasing tensions -- and where we go from here.? What follows is a transcript of the interview, which aired August 9, 2017, on the ""CBS Evening News."" ANTHONY MASON:?Mr. Ambassador, where do we go after ""fire and fury""? What's the best option for the U.S. now? BILL RICHARDSON: The best option is diplomacy, the best option is continued sanctions, see if they work. Continue to pressure China, continue the military exercises, but find a way to talk to the North Koreans. Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson MASON: But Kim Jong Un hasn't shown a lot of interest in diplomacy to this point. RICHARDSON: We don't know what he wants. He's an unpredictable character. We don't know what his intentions are. He wants to stay in power. But I think in the end, once he knows that he can hit the United States with a missile, he can start negotiating. That's the way his father was. But I think keeping the talk about preemptive military strikes and the president's very incendiary statement, which was not helpful, is not the way to go. MASON: What do you make of North Korea's threat towards Guam? RICHARDSON: This is part of their foreign policy. However, the intensity of the attack, the specificity bothers me. The fact that the foreign minister himself -- who's a reasonable guy, I've dealt with him, Foreign Minister Re -- was so intense that I'm just a little worried that that intensity is a little too strong. What you don't want to have is a miscalculation. MASON: What's the risk here that we could start a war by accident? RICHARDSON: The risk is strong. A fishing boat is shot by the North Koreans, airspace is invaded and the North Koreans react, the South Koreans react -- everybody's trying to out-macho each other. MASON: Lastly, Mr. Ambassador, U.S. intelligence seemed to be surprised by the technical advances in North Korea. Does that worry you? RICHARDSON: That worries me because we should've been on this long ago. We should consider finding ways to put more intelligence, over-flights, more spies, because we were caught off guard. North Korea was way more advanced than our intelligence people told us. That's a massive intelligence failure that should never happen again. MASON: Ambassador Bill Richardson, thank you so much for being with us. RICHARDSON: Thank you.																																																																																																																					"

CNN first reported the overflight.? Under the?Open Skies Treaty, first signed in 1992, 34 countries including the U.S. and Russia allow member states to conduct unarmed observation flights in order to foster transparency about military activity and help monitor arms control and other agreements.? An armed Russian jet came within five feet of a U.S. reconnaissance plane over the Baltic Sea. The U.S. Air Force considers the incident to be an... In 2016, Russia requested permission to equip its observation aircraft with digital electro-optical sensors, which some member states thought might allow Russia to collect more detailed intelligence. In June 2016, the U.S. allowed a Russian jet with the technology to fly over the U.S. Observation flights by member countries are allowed over the entire territory of other member states. States have to provide 72 hours' advance notice of their flyover plans, but the host country, under the treaty, may not restrict access to any part of its territory except for safety reasons. In the past, Russia has been accused of unfairly restricting some of its territory from view, in particular, over Chechnya or within 10 kilometers of its border with Georgia, according to the Arms Control Center. The treaty was signed during President George H.W. Bush's presidency, though President Dwight Eisenhower had the idea for it. He felt that transparency between the U.S. and Russia would reduce the risk of direct conflict between the two, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. Moscow didn't think much of the idea at the time, but after the Cold War, Russia reconsidered when Bush brought it up again.

"MANILA, PHILIPPINES -- Less than weeks before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson landed here in the Philippines, the U.S. delivered piloted aircraft and drone to the small Southeast Asian country.? The delivery was sent to bolster the nation's ability to combat the rise of ISIS-aligned terrorists that are besieging cities in the south. The shipment had been sped up, according to one U..S government official, because the threat was real and the U.S. saw an urgent need to support government forces. In a hotel room in Manila, just hours before meeting with President Rodrigo?Duterte at his palace, Tillerson told reporters that he sees ""no conflict"" in supporting the country's battle against ISIS -- even in the face of the government's heinous drug war. Tillerson was the first member of Trump's cabinet to meet with Duterte, who launched his drug war just over a year ago. Trump has commended Duterte for the ""unbelievable job"" he has done fighting drugs. The operation has slaughtered over 7,000 drug users, according to Human Rights Watch.? Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says there is ""no imminent threat"" from North Korea, despite heated rhetoric from both sides. CBSN's Anne-Marie ... Tillerson did not use the moment to take a stand for human rights. As Duterte and Tillerson stood and shook hands in the presidential palace, each donning a wide grin, Tillerson ignored a CBS News reporter's questions about the agenda of the meeting. Another reporter blurted out a question about human rights 每 which was hard to hear above the loud, incessant camera clicks in the room -- but Tillerson didn't say anything. ""I am your humble friend in Southeast Asa,"" Duterte said to Tillerson with reporters in the room. It marked a change of tone for the president, who is known for anti-American rhetoric. Amid reports of police backing vigilantes that carry out rampant masked murders of drug users, the poor areas in Manila are ravaged by violence. Poor Filipinos feel hopeless and voiceless. The government argues that decreased crime shows that its efforts are working.They also say homicide numbers are actually down, when compared to previous years.? The Philippine government says human rights groups are conflating regular homicides with drug war-related deaths. The Philippine National Police (PNP) statistics say that 14,160 Filipinos have been killed in homicides in the last year, according to their latest statistics from July. They say that 2,163 of those deaths are drug related and 2,855 are non-drug related. The PNP says the motive for the majority of the murders -- 9,142 每 has yet to be determined. Regardless of the data set one looks at, most accept the basic reality: the drug war has been bloody. The Philippine government shut down the operation earlier this year to recalibrate their efforts and make the conflict lees violent. The U.S. is reluctant to ""micro-manage"" how the country should handle the situation, according to an American government official. And while the U.S. would support a Filipino investigation into the rampant murders, it is not actively advocating for a UN investigation.? Over the last seven months, a U.S. government official has met with Duterte seven times. They describe him as ""substantive, thoughtful and detailed."" And Tillerson never publicly addressed the brutal anti-drug tactics while he was in the country. When Tillerson met one on one with Duterte, two Filipino government officials say that Tillerson didn't mention the U.S. government's human rights concerns with regard to the anti-narcotics tactics. ""I don't know why he didn't raise it. Maybe he thought it didn't need to be raised,"" one of them said. Tillerson's press aide, R.C. Hammond, says that that is incorrect and that the secretary did raise the ""concerns of the American people"" over the country's handling of drug cartels. Tillerson also referenced efforts to combat drug cartels in the U.S. and offered assistance to help the country implement better tactics to solve the problem.? Tillerson has received criticism for sidelining human rights as a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy, which he said had gotten ""a little bit out of balance"" in past years. ""Our values around freedom, human dignity, the way people are treated. Those are our values. Those are not our policies; they're values,"" Tillerson said in a speech to State Department employees in the spring. ""If we condition too heavily that others must adopt this value that we've come to over a long history of our own, it really creates obstacles to our ability to advance our national security interests, our economic interests."" The State Department's human rights report does signal out Duterte for the killings in the country.? ""The most significant human rights problems were killings allegedly undertaken by vigilantes, security forces, and insurgents; cases of apparent governmental disregard for human rights and due process; and a weak and overburdened criminal justice system notable for slow court procedures, weak prosecutions, and poor cooperation between police and investigators,"" it states. As it helps bolster Philippine forces, the Trump administration has otherwise largely stayed away from harsh public condemnation of Duterte. U.S. assistance is support of the country's anti-ISIS war has been ""small but effective,"" said a U.S. government official. The country is also looking at next steps and considering providing more help with infrastructure projects in an effort to ensure that peace takes root. Meanwhile, the Philippine government is seeing how they can ""reduce the dependency"" on the U.S. by turning to Russia and China. Purchasing arms from China comes with no strings attached, and Beijing is wooing the strategically located island nation that was once home to a robust American military presence. Just last month, China donated more than 3,000 rifles and ammunition to the Philippines, and most of that is now in the hands of the PNP.? ""The U.S. Congress attaches a lot of conditions, where as other countries don't attach the same conditions. If we really need it is it is probably best to get it from a country where it is more transactional,"" explained a Filipino government official.

"WASHINGTON -- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Wednesday distanced herself from her comment earlier this year about the nation's historically black colleges and universities being pioneers of school choice, saying that in the past ""there were no choices"" for African-Americans in higher education. ""When I talked about it being a pioneer in choice it was because I acknowledge that racism was rampant and there were no choices,"" DeVos said in an interview with The Associated Press in her office at the Education Department. ""These HBCUs provided choices for black students that they didn't have."" DeVos, who marks six months in office this week, alienated many African-Americans in February when she described historically black colleges as ""real pioneers when it comes to school choice."" In May, she was booed while attending the commencement ceremony at a historically black college in Florida. U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos was booed while speaking at the commencement ceremony at Bethune-Cookman University, a historically black... ""My intention was to say they were pioneering on behalf of students that didn't have another choice. This was their only choice,"" DeVos said. ""At the same time I should have decried much more forcefully the ravages of racism in this country."" The Trump administration and DeVos have come under criticism from civil rights advocates for undoing some civil rights protections, including rescinding Obama-era federal guidance that instructed schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice and President Trump calling for banning transgender individuals from serving in the military. DeVos, a billionaire Republican donor and long-standing school choice activist from Michigan, said that she has spent her career campaigning on behalf of minority children. ""That's where my heart has been for three decades is to really empower and allow all families the same kind of opportunities I've had for my kids,"" she said. At the same time, DeVos acknowledged that she could have done more to reach out to African-American communities around the country to make her position more clear. ""I've had these conversations with some of the African-American organizations that represent higher education, but probably not as explicitly as I am right now,"" DeVos said. The NAACP did not immediately return a call for comment about DeVos' remarks. The issue of minorities' access to higher education remains controversial today. The Justice Department said last week it would conduct an inquiry into how race influences admissions at Harvard University after a coalition of more than 60 Asian-American groups brought a complaint alleging the school uses race as a factor in admissions and discriminates against Asian-Americans by holding them to a higher standard. DeVos said her department was not involved in that process and added that this ""has been a question for the courts and the courts have opined."" The Supreme Court last year upheld a University of Texas program that considers race, among other factors, in admissions, offering a narrow victory for affirmative action. A white Texan who was denied admission to the university sued, but the high court said the Texas plan complied with earlier court rulings that allow colleges to consider race in an effort to bolster diversity. At America's elite private colleges, many of which have drawn criticism over race-conscious admission policies, incoming classes have become increasingly diverse in recent years. Asked whether race should play a role in college admissions, DeVos said it is already being considered in the selection process. ""Well, they are looking at that, that is a factor today,"" DeVos said referring to college admissions officers. ""I am not going to debate that, I am not going to discuss that."" But DeVos said the key to giving students equal access to higher education lies in elementary and secondary school. ""It is not fair to think that when students transit through a K-12 system that is not preparing them for beyond, that somehow we are going to waive a magic wand and things are going to be perfect for them at the higher-ed level,"" DeVos said. ""So I've always said: What we should really be talking about is what are we doing to ensure that every single child no matter their family income, no matter their racial background, no matter their zip code has equal opportunities to access a quality education.""

"Last Updated Aug 10, 2017 10:19 AM EDT The U.S. State Department confirms that ""some"" U.S. government personnel in Havana on official duty have reported ""incidents which have caused a variety of physical symptoms."" A spokesperson for the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs says the department does not have ""definitive answers on the source or cause of the incidents."" ""What this requires is providing medical examinations to these people, initially when they started reporting what I will just call 'symptoms,' it took time to figure out what it was,"" State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said on Wednesday. ""We're monitoring it."" A source familiar with the incidents said Thursday that U.S. officials are looking into whether the incidents were caused by a possible type of acoustics device that was in or outside homes of embassy workers provided by the Cuban government. State Department employees suffered loss of hearing, constant painful headaches, sleeplessness, exhaustion and other symptoms. The source says as many as 8 or 9 USG employees had their assignments cut short, but some affected by the incidents still remain on the island who were ""encouraged not to leave."" Dozens of embassy employees reported the incidents that began in late 2016. The U.S. is expelling two Cuban diplomats from the country following an incident in which a number of Americans working for the State Department ... Nauert told reporters that while the ""incident"" appears to have only affected State Department employees and not private U.S. citizens in Cuba, ""we don't have any definitive answers about the source or the cause of what we consider to be incidents."" On May 23, the State Department took punitive action and asked two officials accredited to the Embassy of Cuba to depart the United States. Those officials have left the country. The Associated Press reports that about five diplomats -- several with spouses -- were affected and that no children were involved. Late Wednesday night, the Cuban government released a statement saying that ""Cuba has never permitted, nor will permit, that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families, with no exception."" The statement also added that the Cuban Foreign Ministry was informed of the incidents on February 17 and launched an ""exhaustive, high-priority, urgent investigation at the behest of the highest level of the Cuban government."" The State Department says it has reminded the Cuban government of its obligations under the Vienna Convention to protect U.S. diplomats and says it's taking these incidents ""very seriously"" and is ""working to determine the cause and impact of the incidents."" ""We requested their departure as a reciprocal measure since some U.S. personnel's assignments in Havana had to be curtailed due to these incidents,"" Nauert said, according to the AP. There were no additional details about the symptoms.

"The reverberations from the violence in Charlottesville continue to echo as President Donald Trump faces further fallout from his handling of the situation. Members of his own party have come out against his response and now two of his economic councils have disbanded as business leaders distance themselves from his remarks about the nature of the crowds in Charlottesville. Here's how the events in recent days have led to Trump's latest turmoil.  The activity this past weekend in the small college town centered around a protest of the planned removal of a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee, who commanded the Confederate army during the Civil War. The events started on Friday, Aug. 11, when a large group of people -- many of whom were carrying lit tiki torches -- marched through the University of Virginia campus. Many members of the crowd were seen wearing Nazi-related clothing and at points chanting anti-Semitic cries. The planned rally came the next day, and the members of the groups protesting the removal of the statue, including a number of so-called alt-right groups and white supremacists and neo-Nazis, were confronted by counterprotesters. Violent clashes ensued, and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe ultimately declared a state of emergency in Charlottesville just before noon in response to the violence. The most violent incident occurred at 1:42 p.m., when a car rammed into a crowd of people demonstrating against the white nationalist gathering, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring others.  First lady Melania Trump was the first member of the Trump family to respond to the violence, posting a call to ""communicate w/o hate in our hearts"" on Twitter. Her husband followed suit, writing that ""We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for,"" before making his first public statement in Bedminster, New Jersey. ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides. On many sides,"" he said, without going on to mention or directly call out the white supremacists and neo-Nazis involved. [To read a full timeline of all of Trump's statements and tweets, click here.] A number of Republicans, including two of Trump's former rivals, Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, issued statements using harsher words than Trump. Cruz named the groups and called them ""repulsive and evil,"" while Rubio wrote on Twitter that it was ""Very important for the nation to hear @potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists."" The following morning, Sunday, Aug. 13, a White House spokesperson who would not be publicly identified clarified Trump's statement, saying that his condemnation ""of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.""  After nearly two full days of criticism from members of his own party and the public, Trump made another statement from the White House, where he was more direct. ""Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,"" Trump said Monday. His statement was seen as being ""too little, too late,"" by some critics, including Jonathan Greenblatt, the director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. ""Let's be clear: I think we should expect our leader in the highest office in the land to step above the lowest possible bar,"" Greenblatt said on a call with reporters on Monday shortly after Trump's comments. ""We have seen a pattern of the president equivocating§ when it comes to denouncing hate groups, including white supremacists and anti-Semitic groups, Greenblatt said.  On Tuesday, Trump took questions at a press conference about infrastructure reform plans and ended up lashing out at the media, questioning the nature of the crowds in Charlottesville and defending his initial ""excellent"" statement. ""I think there is blame on both sides. You look at both sides. I think there is blame on both sides,"" he said. ""You had some very bad people in that group. You also had some very fine people on both sides,§ he added. The press conference prompted outcry once again, and a number of key Republicans reiterated that they stand against racism. ""We must be clear. White supremacy is repulsive. This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for. There can be no moral ambiguity,"" House Majority Leader Paul Ryan, R-Wis., wrote on Twitter about an hour and a half after the news conference. One of the first ones to respond, however, was David Duke, former imperial wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, who tweeted, ""Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa,"" he wrote, apparently referring to the Black Lives Matter and the anti-fascist movements. The pushback from establishment Republicans carried on today, with Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel speaking to ""Good Morning America"" and telling white supremacists, ""We don't want your vote, we don't support you, we'll speak out against you."" Trump's remarks also led several business leaders to leave the American Manufacturing Council beginning on Monday, with the president eventually announcing on Twitter Wednesday that he was disbanding the manufacturing council and the separate Strategic and Policy Forum.  Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all! 																																																																																																																					"
"Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has called for all of the state's public Confederate statues to be removed and relocated. The governor said on Wednesday that he hoped residents in the state would agree the statues represent a ※barrier to progress, inclusion and equality.§ ※As we attempt to heal and learn from the tragic events in Charlottesville, I encourage Virginia's localities and the General Assembly -- which are vested with the legal authority -- to take down these monuments and relocate them to museums or more appropriate settings.§ McAuliffe said in a statement. McAuliffe, who called a state of emergency in Virginia in the wake of Saturday's violence, added that Charlottesville showed how monuments ※that celebrate the leadership of the Confederacy§ have now become a symbol of hatred and division. The Virginia state legislature has the authority to remove the Confederate monuments. McAuliffe doesn＊t have the power to act on it unilaterally. McAuliffe made the statement after attending the memorial service Wednesday morning for 32-year old Heather Heyer, who died after 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. allegedly rammed a car into other vehicles in a crowd of counter-protesters on Saturday. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va, was also in attendance. Dr. Ralph Northam, a Democrat who is backed by former president Barack Obama as a candidate to replace Gov. McAuliffe in November, also said the statues should be ※moved to museums.§ ※We should also do more to elevate the parts of our history that have all too often been underrepresented. That means memorializing civil rights advocates like Barbara Johns and Oliver Hill, who helped move our Commonwealth closer towards equality,§ Northam said in a statement, referring to Johns, a civil rights pioneer, and Hill, the civil rights attorney who helped end the doctrine for racial segregation, ※separate but equal.§ Richmond, Virginia mayor Levar Stoney also spoke out about the statues on Wednesday, urging the immediate examination of removal or relocation of some or all of the statues lining the city's Monument Avenue. Stoney stressed that this process would allow for the ※public to be heard§ and for a decision to be made after ※constructive dialogue.§ The mayor＊s decision marks a sharp turn from his initial plan two months ago to maintain the statues but add historical context on why they were erected, according to a statement. McAuliffe, Northam and Stoney＊s push for the removal of the monuments is at odds with President Donald Trump＊s comments at a press conference Tuesday, where the president sarcastically asked if statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson＊s should also be taken down. ""George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? ... How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him. Good. Are we going to take down his statue? He was a major slave owner,§ Trump said. The Charlottesville city council＊s decision to remove the Lee statue -- which went up in 1924 -- sparked the Unite The Right rally from white supremacists and neo-Nazis on Saturday. Not all Virginia politicians agreed on the need to remove the statues. Republican gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie called for education instead on his website. ※Rather than glorifying their objects, statues should be instructional. While ensuring that Confederate statues are not exalting them but educating about them, we should do more to elevate Virginia＊s history in expanding freedom and equality by extolling the many Virginians who played critical roles in this regard,§ said Gillespie. Gillespie was joined by Republican state attorney general candidate John Adams on Twitter who cautioned that Virginians should be concerned of a government that wanted to ※erase history.§  Terrible idea. Tearing down our history will not be unifying, and all should be concerned about a government that attempts to erase history. https://t.co/YUgC18AEIw  Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer supported keeping his city's Robert E. Lee statue in an interview with National Public Radio on Sunday, saying that while he respected ""different opinions,"" he believed one of his African-American neighbor's reasoning that the statues should be there ""so that [her] grandchildren know what happened there,"" was important to the discussion.

"Would Ruby Bridges have been able to go to school safely if Donald Trump were president? It's in our history books now -- that picture of a brave little black girl, book bag in hand, escorted by four federal marshals into an all-white school in New Orleans. Norman Rockwell＊s version of that iconic moment even hung in the Obama White House. It＊s history now, but history I lived through in New Orleans in 1960 where the federal judge who ordered the schools to comply with the law of the land was one of the key players in promoting racial integration throughout the 1950s and 1960s. J. Skelly Wright was one of the heroes of the civil rights movement. But his heroism came with a price. Those people we saw over the weekend shouting their hateful slogans in Charlottesville were out in force in the South in that era. That beautiful first-grade girl had to walk through screaming haters, haters just like the ones we saw in Virginia, as she made her way to school. She spent her first year in a classroom of one, with no white child willing, or allowed, to join her. What incredible courage that took. Think of it. That child went every day to school with a posse surrounding her. In later years those marshals wondered at her fortitude. And what courage it took for her parents to persist in their insistence that Ruby receive an equal education to that of the white children her age.     The Bridges family paid the price〞threatened by thugs, fired by bosses. So did the judge. President Kennedy was ready to appoint Wright to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals but feared the reaction of southern senators. So the judge came to Washington as a member of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He had to leave New Orleans when the haters threatened not just him and his wife but also their only child. Those are the people we saw marching in Charlottesville this weekend. People who threatened a first-grader on her way to school. People who vowed to destroy a federal judge insisting that the law be followed. Those are the people President Trump referred to as ※very fine people.§ We have come to rely on our presidents as the men (a woman someday, please God) who stand for the principle that the country protects all its people. We saw President Eisenhower call in the National Guard to surround children in Arkansas so they could walk into school unharmed. We watched President Kennedy assemble hundreds of U.S. marshals as James Meredith enrolled in the University of Mississippi. Would President Trump do the same? Would he mobilize the power of the federal government to assure the safety of a black child who simply wanted to go to school? After the events of the last few days, it＊s hard to believe that he would. When faced with the kind of hate that we had hoped was behind us as a country, Trump failed to condemn it with the force that we have come to expect from our presidents. That failure of moral leadership will live with us forever, just like that picture of Ruby Bridges.

In an interview published Wednesday by The American Prospect 〞 which, according to its website, aims to ""advance liberal and progressive goals"" 〞 Bannon, the White House's chief strategist, dismissed the far right as irrelevant and downplayed his role in its development. ""Ethnonationalism 〞 it's losers,"" he said. ""It's a fringe element. I think the media plays it up too much, and we gotta help crush it, you know, uh, help crush it more ... These guys are a collection of clowns."" While talking about the far right, Bannon took the opportunity to slam Democrats' fondness for ""identity politics."" ""The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,"" he said. ""I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats."" In the interview, Bannon seemed to counter President Trump's incendiary comments about unleashing ""fire and fury"" on North Korea if it continues to threaten the U.S. ""There's no military solution [to North Korea's nuclear threats]. Forget it,"" Bannon said. ""Until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in Seoul don't die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons, I don't know what you're talking about. There's no military solution here. They got us."" He had harsh words for China, which he said is at war with the U.S. economically. He added that the U.S. is at risk of losing its economic superpower status to China, the world's most populous country. ""We're at economic war with China,"" Bannon said. ""It's in all their literature. They're not shy about saying what they're doing. One of us is going to be a hegemon in 25 or 30 years, and it's going to be them if we go down this path. On Korea, they're just tapping us along. It's just a sideshow."" He continued, ""To me, the economic war with China is everything. And we have to be maniacally focused on that. If we continue to lose it, we're five years away, I think, 10 years at the most, of hitting an inflection point from which we'll never be able to recover."" Bannon's plan to counter China's increasingly strong economic influence is to file a complaint under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act against Chinese coercion of technology transfers from American corporations doing business there and follow-up complaints against Chinese steel and aluminum dumping. ""We're going to run the tables on these guys. We've come to the conclusion that they're in an economic war and they're crushing us.§ 																																																																																																																					"
"The political map doesn't look very good for Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, according to a new analysis published by FiveThirtyEight. The analysis, written by Cook Political Report's David Wasserman, says that if Democrats were to win every single House and Senate race next year in places that Hillary Clinton won or that President Trump by less than 3 percentage points last November, they could still lose the House and lose five Senate seats. Democrats, for example, hold six seats in the Senate out of the 26 Republican-leaning states and six are at risk next year, the report notes. Democrats will have to defend 25 of the 48 seats they currently occupy in the upper chamber while Republicans only have to defend eight of their 52 seats. The political map, Wasserman wrote, is a product of Democratic clusters in urban areas and Republican gerrymandering. Their odds don't look strong: the last time the Senate had such a strong Republican bias, it was 1913 when direct Senate elections were ratified, the report said. Democrats, however, did win back control of the House and Senate in 2006 when a GOP bias existed that year. Hillary Clinton is hoping to get involved in the 2018 midterm election cycle, The Hill reported last month. The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee has been studying House districts she won in last year's election, two sources told The Hill. And she could appear on the campaign trail. ""She's very well aware of how she performed in those districts,"" said one longtime Clinton confidant said, who pointed out she won Republican Rep. Darrell Issa's district in California by 8 percentage points. ""She knows she came close in about a handful of others. She has studied this stuff thoroughly.""																																																																																																																					"
"A new U.S. intelligence assessment concludes North Korea has developed the ability to build a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on top of a ballistic missile, including an intercontinental missile that can reach the United States, CBS News' David Martin has confirmed. If that's true, North Korea has reached a crucial milestone towards developing a nuclear weapon able to threaten the continental United States. U.S. intelligence has also estimated North Korea has enough nuclear material to build dozens of weapons. The last time North Korea conducted a nuclear test, the estimated yield was roughly twice that of the bomb the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. To cross the final threshold in developing a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the U.S., North Korea will still need to develop a reentry vehicle that can withstand the heat and the vibration of reentering the earth's atmosphere, and develop the means to accurately target the warhead, Martin reports. The Washington Post initially reported the intelligence assessment that North Korea is now making missile-ready nuclear weapons. Many analysts believed, the Washington Post noted, that North Korea would take much longer to reach this latest milestone in developing its nuclear weapons program. President Trump has emphasized the need to be ""tough"" on North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-un, most recently with a tweet while on his working vacation in Bedminster, New Jersey. After many years of failure,countries are coming together to finally address the dangers posed by North Korea. We must be tough & decisive! But Americans are uneasy about the North Korean crisis, and are also unsure about the president's ability to handle it. A CBS News poll released Tuesday?found nearly three in four Americans are uneasy about the possibility of a conflict with North Korea, and most are also uneasy about Mr. Trump's approach to the situation. Of those polled, 61 percent were uneasy about Mr. Trump's ability to handle North Korea's nuclear situation, while 35 percent were confident in his ability. The U.S. in May successfully carried out its first-ever missile defense test to intercept an ICBM-type weapon, but other tests have had mixed results.

"COLUMBUS, Ohio?-- President Donald Trump's administration has reversed the government's position on a voter roll case before the U.S. Supreme Court and is now backing Ohio's method for purging voters. Ohio's system for removing inactive voters from the rolls does not violate the National Voter Registration Act, the Justice Department said Monday. The government's filing said it reconsidered its position following the change in administrations. The Justice Department under President Barack Obama said Ohio's method was prohibited. Ohio's process involves a three-part test that starts with voters who haven't cast ballots in two years, then fail to respond to a notice trying to verify their address, and then fail to vote for an additional period of two federal elections. As a result, the Justice Department said, ""Registrants who are removed in part because they failed to respond to an address-verification notice are not removed solely for nonvoting."" The Supreme Court said in May it would hear the case. The Justice Department declined to comment. Civil liberties groups are challenging the state's program for removing thousands of people from voter rolls based on their failure to vote in recent elections. Those groups say Ohio was unfairly disenfranchising eligible Ohio voters. The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and the New York-based public advocacy group Demos sued Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted over the practice. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ruled last year that the process violates the national voting law. Following that decision, a federal district court entered an injunction for the November 2016 presidential election that allowed more than 7,500 Ohio voters to cast a ballot. The ACLU called the Justice Department's decision disappointing, saying the agency has consistently rejected the notion of purging people from rolls just for voting infrequently. ""We have a Justice Department that's supposed to be protecting and expanding people's ability to vote,"" Mike Brickner, senior policy director for the agency's Ohio chapter, said Tuesday. ""By allowing these types of purges, that will mean people who are eligible to vote will have their registration suspended."" Husted welcomed the Justice Department's position. Several other groups, including former attorneys with the Justice Department's Civil Rights division and attorneys general from 17 states, have adopted the same position, Husted said. ""This case is about maintaining the integrity of our elections, something that will be harder to do if elections officials are not be able to properly maintain the voter rolls,"" said Husted, who is running for governor next year.

A post on Mr. Trump's social media site reads, ""Join Kayleigh McEnany as she provides you the news of the week from Trump Tower in New York!"" The post went up on Sunday, just one day after McEnany left her role at the cable network. Join Kayleigh McEnany as she provides you the news of the week from Trump Tower in New York! #MAGA #TeamTrump Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. In the minute and a half-long video, McEnany summarizes positive stories for Mr. Trump, including the positive economic data, the awarding of the Medal of Honor to a Vietnam war veteran, his endorsement of a Senate immigration bill named the RAISE act, which would limit the number of legal immigrants allowed into the U.S. primarily through the use of a points-based system. McEnany announced, ""President Trump has created more than 1 million new jobs,"" noted the low unemployment rate, high consumer confidence and surging stock market and concluded, ""President Trump has clearly steered the economy back in the right direction."" As McEnany ends her segment, she signs out, ""And that is the real news."" However, as the Washington Post pointed out, as far as jobs creation is concerned, Mr. Trump hasn't changed the direction of the economy -- under his predecessor, former President Obama, the last six months of his administration showed job creation at a slightly faster rate than the Trump administration. It's the second of the network-news style segments featured on the Trump campaign's Facebook page, after Mr. Trump's daughter-in-law Lara had hosted the previous edition. Like McEnany, Lara Trump devoted the segment to applauding her father-in-law's accomplishments which she claims were not covered due to ""so much fake news out there."" The segments are not being posted on the White House Facebook page. Want to know what President Trump did this week? Watch here for REAL news! Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. Some have attacked the Trump TV online newscasts -- the former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul tweeted, ""Wow. Feels eerily like so many state-owned channels I've watched in other countries."" But the positive-spin, week-in-review theme is hardly new in the realm of the digital-age presidency. The Obama White House released a video series dubbed ""West Wing Week"", narrated by former White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and was featured on the administration's social media sites. The Obama-era videos, however, focused primarily on the comings and goings within 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., not so much on dispelling ""fake news"" that the administration doesn't like. While it's not clear if McEnany will be the regular host of the ""real news"" segments, which are being paid for by the Trump campaign, the former network commentator now has a new role at the Republican National Committee (RNC) as the party's spokesperson. In a statement released by the RNC on Monday, the party called McEnany a ""seasoned television commentator who brings years of communications and media relations experience to her new role."" ""Kayleigh will be an integral part of our Party's ongoing commitment to promoting the Republican message to Americans across the country, said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. She added, ""Her wealth of experience will be invaluable to the RNC as we continue to support President Trump and build on our majorities in Congress as we head into 2018."" McEnany said in a statement she was ""Eager to talk about Republican ideas and values and have important discussions about issues affecting Americans across the country."" Could not be more honored to join the @GOP as Spokesperson. Humbled to speak on behalf of this party & the powerful movement behind @POTUS! McEnany will also serve as the Republican party spokesperson on TV and radio.																																																																																																																					"
"Sen. Orrin Hatch said Senate Republicans are not going to return to health care in the fall and will instead focus on tax reform. The Utah Republican used a colorful metaphor to describe his party's failure to pass a repeal of Obamacare. ""We're not going back to health care. We're in tax now. As far as I'm concerned, they shot their wad on health care and that's the way it is. I'm sick of it,"" Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told Politico last week. Hatch then defended his comment on Twitter with a visit to a thesaurus entry that defines wad as ""a plug of tow, cloth, etc., a disk of felt or cardboard, to retain the powder and shot in position in charging a gun or cartridge."" That plug, Urban Dictionary explained, would ""create a seal between the gunpowder and the bullet, increasing the internal pressure when the gunpowder fired,"" which increased the speed of the bullet. When a soldier ran out of bullets, he shot his ""wad."" The entry Hatch cited goes on to define ""to shoot one's wad"" as ""to do all that one can do."" As few of you were alive during the Civil War, here's a valuable jargon lesson on ""wads"" and the shooting of them. https://t.co/dOYvcfgImO pic.twitter.com/wk9aaNb3s2 However, another meaning of the phrase is to spend all of one's money - as in, a ""wad"" of cash. And yet another is a vulgar colloquialism.? Republicans in the Senate failed to pass a plan last month to repeal and replace Obamacare and want to move onto tax reform when they return to Capitol Hill after Labor Day. The House and Senate are on their month-long August recess.?																																																																																																																					"
"CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- President Trump's administration has opened the door to industry-friendly changes to a sweeping plan imposed by his predecessor to protect a ground-dwelling bird across vast areas of the West. Wildlife advocates warn that the proposed changes would undercut a hard-won struggle to protect the greater sage grouse. Representatives of the ranching and energy industries cheered the policy shift as needed to give states flexibility. A document outlining the recommended changes was released Monday by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, confirmed that she received a phone call from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke over her vote on health care, saying t... It recognized for the first time the importance of livestock grazing on sage grouse habitat, said Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. It also backed away from requirements to keep rangeland grasses and shrubs at a prescribed minimum height, which ranchers had complained was arbitrary. ""I was very pleased with what I saw there in terms of the tone,"" Magagna said. The ground-dwelling sage grouse has lengthy, pointed tail feathers and is known for the male's elaborate courtship display in which air sacs in the neck are inflated to make a popping sound. Millions of sage grouse once populated the West but development, livestock grazing and an invasive grass that encourages wildfires has reduced the bird's population to fewer than 500,000. States affected by the conservation plan are California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Just how much Zinke intends to tinker with the plan that was years in the making remains to be seen. It was hashed out under President Obama and unveiled in 2015 as a solution to keeping the sage grouse off the endangered species list following a decade-long population decline caused by disease and pressure on the birds' habitat from energy development, grazing and wildfires. These are the wildlife populations in danger of becoming extinct, if drastic conservation measures are not taken The proposed changes, the result of a 60-day review of the plan by Zinke's agency, could give states wiggle room in areas such as setting population goals for sage grouse and drawing boundaries of recognized sage grouse habitat. Advocacy groups such as The Wilderness Society and National Wildlife Federation said the proposal was a backdoor attempt to allow unfettered oil and gas development that ignored previous scientific studies showing that drilling too close to sage grouse breeding areas would harm the birds. ""Wholesale changes to the plans are not necessary and could derail years of hard work,"" National Wildlife Federation President Collin O'Mara said in a statement. ""We cannot fall victim to the false dichotomy that pits wildlife conservation against the administration's energy development goals."" The birds inhabit parts of 11 states including large swaths of Wyoming, Utah, Idaho and Nevada - big ranching states that include areas with vast wind energy and gas drilling potential. Wyoming has a larger number of greater sage grouse than any other state and keeping the bird off the endangered list remains a priority, Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead said. ""We've come a long ways to get to this point,"" Mead said. ""As we make changes - and certainly I think there's room for improvement - we have to move cautiously because we don't want to get to the point where the bird is listed."" Wyoming officials are glad the Trump administration has been talking to them about sage grouse policy, and the proposed changes include improvements, Mead said. Officials remain concerned, however, by how the administration wants to set population goals for sage grouse. The birds are difficult to count and their numbers can fluctuate significantly from year to year in response to weather patterns, Mead said. ""We want to move cautiously as to not disrupt the great work that has been done by so many over the many years,"" Mead said. Idaho Gov. Butch Otter said Zinke's announcement marked an appropriate step toward giving the state more power to manage sage grouse. Idaho, along with Utah and Nevada, had filed a lawsuit challenging the Obama-era conservation plans for the birds. ""My staff and I stand ready to roll up our sleeves and work with the Department of the Interior to bring the federal plans into alignment with Idaho's science-based conservation plan,"" Otter said in a statement. The proposed changes drew a muted reaction from some other Western governors who had been heavily involved in crafting conservation plans for the birds. Democrat Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who co-chaired a federal-state sage grouse task force established in 2011, was still reviewing Zinke's announcement, according to spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery. Gov. John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, and Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, discuss how their states are finding solutions to the many problems they face d... In Nevada, Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval didn't have any immediate comment. Sandoval had worked closely with former Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to develop sage grouse protection plans for the state. Sandoval, Mead and Hickenlooper met with Zinke in April and urged him to coordinate with states before changing the Obama-era plans. Areas where sage grouse habitat and gas drilling overlap include the upper Green River Basin of western Wyoming, home of some of the biggest onshore natural gas fields in the U.S. A third gas field, the Normally Pressured Lance field, could add another 3,500 wells in a 220-square-mile area. Drilling could begin next year if the U.S. Bureau of Land Management signs off. Jonah Energy LLC recognizes the existence of sage grouse winter range in the southern part of its proposed gas field about 200 miles northeast of Salt Lake City, said Paul Ulrich, government affairs director at the Denver-based petroleum company. ""From our perspective, that definitely presents challenges but also provides an opportunity to do what we've done from day one, which is follow the science,"" he said.

"A new federal climate report awaiting final approval by the Trump administration shows the impacts of climate change are far more grave than the White House lets on. The report, acquired and released by the New York Times on Tuesday, shows that the average temperature in the United States has risen rapidly and drastically since 1980 and recent decades have been the warmest of the past 1,500 years. The findings drafted by scientists from 13 federal agencies, as part of the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment, reveal well-documented impacts of climate change on land and in the air and reaffirms Americans are indeed feeling its effects.? ""Evidence for a changing climate abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans,"" the draft report states, according to the Times. Researchers say the effects of climate change could worsen air pollution and cost tens of thousands of lives per year in the coming decades. Nikk... The release of the draft, however, directly contradicts Mr. Trump's long-held beliefs that climate change is not as dire as the report shows. Scientists said in the report that human interaction has a direct correlation to the impact of climate change, a notion Mr. Trump once said was?""a hoax"" created by China.? ""Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases, are primarily responsible for recent observed climate change,"" the report said. Just last week, the Trump administration officially notified the United Nations that the U.S. intends to pull out of the internationally accepted 2015 Paris climate agreement -- a move the State Department described as a ""strong message"" to the world following Mr. Trump's June announcement. In the scientific community there is a strong consensus that global temperatures have increased in recent decades and that this trend is largely ... Mr. Trump is ""open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its business, its workers, its people and its taxpayers,"" the department said. Under the agreement, countries set their own national plans for cutting climate emissions. That means Mr. Trump can come up with different targets for the United States than those set by former President Obama. But Mr. Trump can't unilaterally change the text of the Paris deal. Mr. Trump's addition of those who doubt the impact of climate change to?vital Cabinet positions also adds to the administration's loose stance on the environment. The president's own EPA head, Scott Pruitt, has set a record of undoing, delaying or blocking over 30 environmental regulations since his February confirmation -- that's more rollbacks than any other administrator in the agency's 47-year history over such a short period of time. Former Vice President Al Gore told CBS News last week the idea of nominating ""persistent deniers"" like Pruitt to the administration is ""horrible."" In our series, Issues That Matter, we take a closer look at climate change. Former Vice President Al Gore has spent decades working on this globa... ""The president has surrounded himself with a 'rogues gallery' of climate deniers coming out of close ties with the carbon polluters,"" Gore said on ""CBS This Morning."" ""These persistent levels of denial unique in the U.S. have been intentionally created by the large carbon polluters taking the playbook from the tobacco companies, hiring pseudo-scientists and putting out false data, and all of us, as human beings, are resistant to thinking about something that's hard to think about,"" Gore said of climate change deniers. While the National Academy of Sciences has signed off on the draft report, the authors now await permission from the Trump administration to formally release it, amid experts' concerns the administration will suppress its findings. These images paint a startling picture of the environmental changes afoot across the globe as temperatures rise																																																																																																																					"
"A long-simmering dispute between two top White House aides has boiled into a public battle over the direction of President Donald Trump's foreign policy, with a cadre of conservative groups pushing for the ouster of national security adviser H.R. McMaster. In recent days, conservative groups and a website tied to Trump adviser Steve Bannon have targeted McMaster as insufficiently supportive of Israel and insufficiently tough toward Iran. They've expressed outrage about the firings of several aides regarded as sympathetic to their views. An online campaign 〞 under the hashtag #FireMcMaster 〞 prompted Trump to declare his support for his adviser. The dispute reflects the tensions at the heart of Mr. Trump's foreign policy coalition. McMaster is one of several powerful generals in Mr. Trump's orbit who hail from the Republican foreign policy establishment. But Mr. Trump is equally sympathetic to the views of firebrands like Bannon, who are trying to push the party in a new, isolationist direction embodied by his ""America First"" doctrine. McMaster and Bannon have clashed loudly and repeatedly during recent White House discussions over Afghanistan war strategy, according to four administration officials and outside advisers. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss private conversations. Afghanistan, however, represents only the latest dispute between McMaster and Bannon, who've also fought over White House personnel. McMaster, an Army general, recently purged three National Security Council officials who were viewed as close to Bannon or to Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's previous national security adviser. For people close to Bannon, the moves were seen as telling. The former chief of Breitbart News, who wants Mr. Trump to upend the Washington foreign policy establishment, has bitterly argued against further U.S. entanglement in global conflicts and believes McMaster is adhering to holdover Obama administration policies. Breitbart, which holds significant influence in Mr. Trump's White House, has promoted a series of anti-McMaster headlines on its website. The Zionist Organization of America on Monday announced it has undertaken a review of McMaster's views on Israel. Dozens of conservative and alt-right social media stars have hammered the national security adviser on Twitter. The outcry grew so loud that Mr. Trump responded Friday: ""General McMaster and I are working very well together. He is a good man and very pro-Israel. I am grateful for the work he continues to do serving our country."" Months earlier, Mr. Trump also defended his adviser, taking a printout of a story suggesting he might fire McMaster and scrawling on it with a Sharpie pen, ""This is bull----. You're doing a great job,"" along with his signature. He had it delivered to McMaster, according to someone who speaks regularly with officials in the Trump administration. But privately, Mr. Trump has at times expressed some dissatisfaction with McMaster and rued losing Flynn, according to people who have spoken with the president. The White House has said Flynn was dismissed because he did not tell White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the full extent of his contacts with Russian officials. Mr. Trump often vents about aides without making changes. And McMaster's position was strengthened by the recent appointment of ret. Gen. John Kelly as Trump's chief of staff. Bannon's allies say the recent dismissals are evidence that McMaster is ridding the National Security Council of Trump supporters while deferring to career officials left over from former President Barack Obama's tenure. They also chafe at McMaster's involvement in removing Bannon from a prominent role on the NSC earlier this year. Among those fired: White House intelligence adviser Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Flynn prot谷g谷 who previously clashed with CIA leaders. The Iran nuclear deal also has been a source of disagreement. That Obama-era pact is opposed by Israel and prominent GOP donor Sheldon Adelson, who backs the Zionist Organization of America group that attacked McMaster. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced the accord, even as he has granted Iran continued relief from U.S. sanctions under the arrangement. McMaster was among the Trump aides advocating for that course.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 8, 2017 7:04 AM EDT By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto President Donald Trump's approval rating is unchanged from June and remains at 36 percent, while favorable views of the U.S. economy continue to soar to heights not seen in more than fifteen years. The president does get better marks on his handling of the economy than for other issues, but his overall approval remains where it is partly because Americans say they're evaluating him more on culture and values than on how they're faring financially, and partly because his ratings for other domestic issues are negative.? It is only those who are very confident about their own personal financial situation who give the president approving marks overall, and only half of Americans say the stock market's performance matters to them, personally, even as it reaches new highs. The president gets his relatively highest marks on handling the economy, compared to other topics tested, and is up four points from June when it was net negative. However, Americans say economics aren't the only measure of a president, and more say that they're evaluating Mr. Trump by whether or not he promotes the kind of culture and values they believe in, more so than whether or not he helps their economic situation. This is particularly true among those who disapprove of his job performance right now.? Overall, positive assessments of the economy have climbed again, now reaching 69 percent, up five points from June, and comparable today to how Americans felt in 2001 and 2002. Looking at their own pocketbooks, one-third of Americans call themselves very confident in their own economic and financial situation, an increase from this time last year. Still, only those who say they are very confident approve of the president overall 每 those merely somewhat confident and those uneasy do not approve, suggesting that his overall ratings could be more tied to how Americans feel about their own prospects than to the economy overall. While the stock market may be one indicator of how the economy is doing, only about half of Americans -- 49 percent -- say the market matters to them and their personal finances. Meanwhile, the president's handling of other domestic policies like trade, immigration and health care all get net negative marks. Health care, in particular, gets high disapproval. An economic item where the President gets net positive marks is on keeping jobs in the U.S., which more feel his policies are doing: 47 percent think they are keeping jobs here, while 42 percent think they are not. So, many opinions 每 especially overall approval 每 are driven by partisanship, and the President's approval rating among Republicans is at 80 percent, up from the 72 percent who approved in June, and back around where it had been for most of his term so far, as more of them now approve of how he is handling the economy. But it's down a bit among the larger group of independents. This poll was conducted by telephone August 3-6, 2017 among a random sample of 1,111 adults nationwide.?

"U.S. officials are abandoning plans to require sleep apnea screening for truck drivers and train engineers, a decision that safety experts say puts millions of lives at risk. The Federal Railroad Administration and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration said late last week they are no longer pursuing the regulation that would require testing for the fatigue-inducing disorder that's been blamed for deadly rail crashes in New York City and New Jersey and several highway crashes. The agencies argue that it should be up to railroads and trucking companies to decide whether to test employees. One railroad that does test, Metro-North in the New York City suburbs, found that 11.6 percent of its engineers have sleep apnea. The decision to kill the sleep apnea regulation is the latest step in President Trump's campaign to drastically slash federal regulations. The Trump administration has withdrawn or delayed hundreds of proposed regulations since he took office in January - moves the president has said will help bolster economic growth. Late last year, the FRA issued a safety advisory that was meant as a stopgap measure urging railroads to begin sleep apnea testing while the rules made their way through the legislative process. Without a regulation mandating testing, which would have needed approval from Congress, regulators couldn't cite trucking companies or railroads if a truck or train crashed because the operator fell asleep at the helm. Sleep apnea is especially troubling for the transportation industry because sufferers are repeatedly awakened and robbed of rest as their airway closes and their breathing stops, leading to dangerous daytime drowsiness. Treatments include wearing a pressurized breathing mask, oral appliances or nasal strips to force the airway open while sleeping. Some severe cases require surgery. ""It's very hard to argue that people aren't being put at risk,"" said Sarah Feinberg, the former administrator of the FRA, who had issued the safety advisory in December. ""We cannot have someone who is in that condition operating either a train going 70 mph or operating a multi-ton truck traveling down the interstate. It's just not an appropriate level of risk to be exposing passengers and the traveling public to."" The National Transportation Safety Board said it was disappointed the agencies decided to scrap the ""much-needed rulemaking."" ""Obstructive sleep apnea has been in the probable cause of 10 highway and rail accidents investigated by the NTSB in the past 17 years and obstructive sleep apnea is an issue being examined in several, ongoing, NTSB rail and highway investigations,"" NTSB spokesman Christopher O'Neil said. The NTSB has long recommended sleep apnea testing for engineers, and Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road started requiring it after finding the engineer in a 2013 Metro-North crash had fallen asleep at the controls because he had a severe, undiagnosed case of sleep apnea. The engineer, William Rockefeller, told investigators he felt strangely ""dazed"" right before the crash, which occurred as he sped through a 30 mph curve at 82 mph. The engineer of a New Jersey Transit train that slammed into a station in Hoboken last September, killing a woman, also suffered from undiagnosed sleep apnea, according to his lawyer. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will push the federal agencies to reconsider withdrawing the proposed regulation. ""There are some regulations that go too far but this is not one of them,"" Schumer told The Associated Press. ""Repealing it will risk lives."" When asked about the government's contention that businesses could enact their own testing policies, the New York Democrat said, ""Tell that to the families of the people who died in Spuyten Duyvil,"" referring to the neighborhood where the Metro-North train crashed in 2013, killing four people. Train engineers are currently required to undergo vision and hearing testing at least every three years. Some railroads require annual physicals, but there are no federal standards for comprehensive medical exams. Many of the largest passenger railroads, including Amtrak, require engineers to undergo sleep apnea screening. The Association of American Railroads, an industry group, said railroads are continuing to take steps to combat worker fatigue, including confidential sleep disorder screening and treatment. Marc Willis, a spokesman for the FRA, said the agency sought information from the public about sleep apnea and ""believes that current railroad and FRA safety programs sufficiently address this risk."" Feinberg said that isn't sufficient and the government shouldn't rely on industries regulating themselves. A notice posted in the Federal Register said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration would consider updating a 2015 bulletin to medical examiners about the physical qualifications standard and respiratory dysfunction. Duane DeBruyne, a spokesman for the agency, declined to answer questions about the NTSB's concerns.

"Last Updated Aug 8, 2017 9:42 AM EDT Frustrated because his agenda is moving at a snail's pace in Congress, President Trump has demanded that the Senate change its rules and lower the threshold for most major pieces of legislation to a simple majority vote in order to stop obstruction by Democrats. Most legislative measures, like government spending bills, however, are subject to a 60-vote procedural hurdle, known as the filibuster, that's needed to end debate and advance bills to a final vote. This is made possible by Rule 22 of the Senate rules, and senators are not keen on making such a drastic change to it. ""The very outdated filibuster rule must go. Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate. Mitch M, go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT'S TIME!"" Mr. Trump tweeted after Senate Republicans failed to pass any form of an Obamacare repeal, adding that they look like ""fools."" The president issued a similar request in mid-July and in May. (""Mitch M"" refers to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.) But for two major priorities -- health care and tax reform -- Senate Republicans have relied on, or plan to use, the budget reconciliation process that allows certain legislation to pass with 51 votes instead of 60. Even with the lower threshold, Republicans were unable to pass a health care bill last month. As McConnell has said before, the rules are not the GOP's problem, and he dismissed the president's call to change them. ""It's pretty obvious that our problem on health care was not the Democrats. We didn't have 50 Republicans,"" he told reporters. ""There are not the votes in the Senate, as I've said repeatedly to the president and to all of you, to change the rules of the Senate. There are not enough. It would require 50 or 51 Republicans to agree to do that and the votes are simply not there."" The Senate is expected to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch as the next Supreme Court justice on Friday. His confirmation vote follows a controversial r... The Senate, along with the House, have?recessed for the rest of August, and Republicans are planning to take up tax reform when they return to Capitol Hill in September. Republicans will use reconciliation, McConnell said, to try to pass an overhaul of the tax code. With McConnell's opinion on the issue unchanged, it's pretty unlikely that the upper chamber will comply with Mr. Trump's demand to get rid of the filibuster for legislation. Rich Arenberg, an adjunct professor at Brown University who co-authored ""Defending the Filibuster: Soul of the Senate,"" told CBS News that the filibuster is in the Senate's DNA and getting rid of it would turn the upper chamber into a majoritarian body, which is not what it was designed to be. ""I think that would damage the Senate and its historic role and it would be a disaster to do that,"" he said. ""I wasn't happy that they did it on the nominations, but to do it on legislative matters would be far worse. It's important in that it requires the majority to work with the minority and come to a compromise."" Senate Republicans already took a risk when they eliminated the filibuster, also known as invoking the nuclear option, earlier this year to confirm Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice. After they took the plunge, a bipartisan group of 61 senators in April called on Senate leaders in a letter to preserve ""existing rules, practices and traditions"" in the Senate and not get rid of the filibuster for legislation. Republicans, however, are not giving up on their quest to reform procedures on the Senate floor that they say promote delay tactics by the other party. On one hand, Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, a former member of the House where the pace of floor movement is much faster than the Senate's, argues that the filibuster should remain intact. ""The Senate should not go to a 51-vote majority for every vote. Because the Senate is the one entity in the federal government where the minority view is heard and deliberation is protected,"" he wrote in a recent op-ed published by The Wall Street Journal. On the other hand, Lankford said something must change. ""First, the minority party has for months abused Senate rules to stall the nomination process and therefore the entire Senate calendar. Second, the arcane rules of the Senate always force a painfully slow legislative pace,"" he wrote. The Senate should consider doing three things, Lankford said: Several Senate Republicans told CBS News that they like the idea of at least lowering the threshold for the ""motion to proceed"" vote. ""One area that I really do like is the suggestion that we'd be able to get on a bill without having to have a 60-vote margin just to get on it because how do you actually get in to discuss it and work on it unless you can bring it to the floor and start publicly discussing what you want to do with it,"" said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota. ""I am intrigued with Senator Lankford's idea about eliminating the filibuster on the motion to proceed,"" said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi. ""That is something that might speed the process along."" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, also seems to like the idea, and he's also favors changing the rules to require 51 votes to limit debate on the Senate floor to just two hours on nominees. ""I think changing the rules to streamline the process in an appropriate way -- I mean, we should take a look at this,"" he said. All three poured cold water on the idea of eliminating the filibuster for major legislation. ""There are going to be times when the Republicans are in the majority, and there are going to be times when we're in the minority,"" Wicker told CBS. ""I still think there's a need for a body where consensus has to take place. If we hadn't had the 60-vote rule during the early days of President Obama, this would be a far different federal government. So I think we should tread very carefully when it deals with filibuster reform."" When Democrats still controlled the Senate, they invoked the nuclear option in November 2013 and eliminated the filibuster for most presidential nominations, except for the Supreme Court. It was the first major change in rules since 1975 when the Senate reduced the number of votes required for cloture, or ending debate, from two-thirds to three-fifths of the Senate, or 60 of 100 senators.? Given these developments, and the elimination of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations earlier this year, some fear that the Senate is creeping toward the elimination of the filibuster for legislation. ""I've described it as a slippery slope,"" said Arenberg. ""I suspect that we'll come to a day when a majority in the Senate will face an issue so important to their base that they'll be tempted to roll this precedent out and use it. I hope we don't get to that, but I do fear that.""?																																																																																																																					"
"CHICAGO -- Mayor Rahm Emanuel has taken his fight against President Donald Trump's immigration policies to court, with Chicago becoming one of the first cities Monday to sue over what many U.S. cities argue are illegal bids to withhold public safety grants from so-called sanctuary cities. Hours later, Attorney General Jeff Sessions hit back at Chicago, saying the Trump administration ""will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety."" ""So it's this simple: Comply with the law or forego taxpayer dollars,"" he said in a toughly worded statement. A 46-page lawsuit, which names Sessions, was filed earlier Monday in U.S. District Court in Chicago a day after Emanuel announced the litigation and said the city won't ""be blackmailed"" into changing its values as a city welcoming of immigrants. It's the latest round in a battle pitting several U.S. cities against the Trump administration. The cities have opted to limit cooperation with government enforcement of immigration law while federal officials threaten to withhold funding if those cities don't comply.? A church in New Haven, Connecticut, is providing a safe haven for a single mother from Guatemala who faces deportation. More than 800 churches an... While estimates vary, there are thought to be about 300 jurisdictions -- including cities and counties -- with sanctuary-like policies. Among the other the bigger U.S. cities with such policies are New York and Philadelphia. A first order of business now that Chicago's suit has been filed will be to ask a judge to put a freeze on the policy as the civil case plays out, said Edward Siskel, the head of City Hall's legal department. That request for a preliminary injunction could be made within days. Chicago has received the grant funds at the heart of the lawsuit since 2005. It spent $33 million in grants to buy nearly 1,000 police cars in that 12-year period; it got $2.3 million last year. In addition to cars, funds were also used for radios and SWAT equipment. While the grant money amounts to a fraction of Chicago's public safety budget, Emanuel has said fighting the government now could help prevent the withholding of more money later. He described the Trump measures so far as just ""the camel's nose under the tent."" In his Monday statement, Sessions said Chicago stood out in its ""open hostility"" to enforcing immigration laws. ""To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country's lawful immigration system,"" he said. Chicago's suit focuses on new conditions set by Sessions for cities to qualify for grant money. They include the sharing immigration-status records with federal agencies, providing 48-hours notice of a detainee's release if immigration violations are suspected and giving federal agents unfettered access to jails. ""The government,"" the lawsuit says, can't ""unilaterally"" set new conditions that weren't approved by Congress ""and that would federalize local jails and police stations, mandate warrantless detentions in order to investigate for federal civil infractions, sow fear in local immigrant communities, and ultimately make the people of Chicago less safe."" Chicago's sanctuary policies date back to the mid-1980s and successive city councils have confirmed or expanded the protections. The city prohibits police from providing federal Immigration and Customs officials access to people in police custody, unless they are wanted on a criminal warrant or have serious criminal convictions. Local police are also barred from allowing ICE agents to use their facilities for interviews or investigations and from responding to ICE inquiries or talking to ICE officials about a person's custody status or release date. City authorities say the policies help encourage residents of the immigrant community to inform police when they are victims of crimes. ""If Chicago submits to the Department's demands, it will forfeit decades' worth of trust and goodwill that its police force has built in the communities it serves,"" the new lawsuit argues. ""And as those decades of experience show, that kind of trust, once lost, is lost forever.""? In late 2015, an undocumented immigrant went to a San Francisco police station because his stolen car had been recovered. Officers then arrested ... Sessions alluded to arguments also made by Mr. Trump that enforcing immigration laws can reduce crime. He calls Chicago's ""hostility"" to such laws especially ""astounding"" given that numbers of homicides in the city in 2016 outpaced the numbers in New York and Los Angeles. ""The city's leaders cannot follow some laws and ignore others and reasonably expect this horrific situation to improve,"" Sessions said. He also characterized Emanuel as complaining it would have to reorder longstanding policies to conform. ""But that's just what Chicago needs: a recommitment to the rule of law and to policies that rollback the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city,"" Sessions said. The city's lawsuit says the Trump administration's contention that more lenient immigration policies contribute to crime ""is divorced from reality."" In March, the Justice Department sent letters to officials in California and major cities including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and New Orleans, all places the Justice Department's inspector general has identified as limiting the information local law enforcement can provide to federal immigration authorities about those in their custody. The department warned that the administration will punish communities that refuse to cooperate with efforts to find and deport immigrants in the country illegally. But some of the localities remained defiant, despite risking the loss of funds that police agencies use to pay for everything from body cameras to bulletproof vests.

"By Anthony Salvanto, Kabir Khanna, Jen De Pinto, Fred Backus More Americans prefer the Republicans now work with Democrats to improve Obamacare (47 percent), rather than try to repeal it outright (21 percent) or replace it with something exclusively of their own (19 percent). This sentiment is particularly strong among Democrats and independents, but a quarter of Republicans want to keep Obamacare with bipartisan improvements as well. Just over half of Americans said they'd be glad if Obamacare was not repealed (interviewing was being conducted through Thursday night when the Senate voted) and only 22 percent say they're angry about the prospect of it not being repealed. Fewer than half of Republicans are angry, at 44 percent. Those who are glad feel at least some parts of Obamacare should stay. Another 26 percent of Americans 〞 including one-third of Republicans 每 expressed disappointment but a willingness to move on. By 4 to 1, Americans disapproved of the Republicans' health care plans (which fell short Thursday night while the poll was being conducted) 每 but half said it was hard to say because there were not enough details provided. Among those who opposed the plan, seven in 10 said it was because it went too far in eliminating protections and coverage. More Americans felt the plan 每 to the extent they could comment on it 每 would make their own coverage worse, not better, though half (including most older Americans and Republicans) felt it would have no impact on them.

Of those polled. 61 percent favored allowing transgender people to serve in the military, while 39 percent think they should be banned from service. There is a partisan split: more than eight in 10 Democrats support allowing transgender individuals to serve, while two-thirds of Republicans disagree. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump sent a series of tweets indicating he would no longer allow transgender people to serve in the military in any capacity.? Most Americans don't know enough to say whether Jeff Sessions is doing a good job or a bad job as attorney general, suggesting that, as with many personnel things like this, these players aren't well known beyond the beltway. Those who do have an opinion choose bad job (26 percent) over good one (17 percent), with Democrats driving the negative numbers. Republicans who know him give him a favorable rating by 3 to 1.? Lately, Mr. Trump has taken to disparaging his attorney general on Twitter.? Majorities of Americans across the political spectrum favor new sanctions on Russia, including most Republicans. Americans remain divided in their views of Russia's possible influence in the 2016 election. About eight in 10 Republicans are not concerned about it, while about as many Democrats are. Among those concerned, they say the biggest reason is that it's a security risk and could happen again. Those not concerned say it's because they feel Russia's influence, if it occurred, did not change minds or votes. Should Trump be able to pardon himself? Three in four Americans say Donald Trump should not be able to pardon himself. Majorities of all partisan stripes hold this view, however, more than four in 10 Republicans think the president should be able to do this.

"BUFFALO, N.Y. ?-- One-time Republican candidate for New York governor Carl Paladino, whose published insults of former President Obama provoked a public uproar, was removed from Buffalo's school board Thursday for improperly discussing teacher contract negotiations.? State Education Commissioner MaryEllen Elia announced her decision Thursday, a day after Paladino protesters disrupted the school board's latest meeting with calls for his ouster.? Paladino said Thursday that he believes the decision is a ""sign of the times,"" CBS affiliate WIVB reports.? ""It's like nothing's normal anymore, or what we would refer to as legal or normal,"" Paladino said. ""These people in Albany, they are very easily influenced by politics."" Paladino's lawyer said he would appeal the decision, which he suggested may have been influenced by the country's mood in the wake of a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Attorney Dennis Vacco said that although Paladino was kicked off the board for writing about confidential board business, the monthslong campaign for his removal has centered on Paladino's ""vile"" comments about Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama.? ""It's not lost on me that just last night, protesters were at the board of education hearing again protesting Carl and attempting to link Carl to the unfortunate events in Charlottesville,"" Vacco, a former state attorney general, said.? The ruling comes after a five-day hearing in Albany, a formal petition by the school board for his ouster, according to WIVB. The protests have been happening since December, when Paladino, who helped chair President Trump's campaign in New York, told a local arts newspaper he wished Obama would die of mad cow disease. But it was a later article written by Paladino detailing closed-door teacher contract negotiations that led to his removal.? Elia sided with fellow school board members who said Paladino had willfully disclosed confidential discussions, including the superintendent's ""panic"" over the threat of a teacher strike. The revelations revealed vulnerabilities that ultimately benefited the teachers' union and other units with pending contract negotiations, union and school board officials testified during a hearing in June. Paladino had argued his disclosures more than two months after an agreement was reached were justified because his intent was to inform his constituents about what he viewed as ""a scheming and rigging of a contract."" Elia also rejected Paladino's contention that the board's real reason for the removal petition was retaliation for his Obama comments, which he said were not meant for publication but nevertheless protected by his constitutional right to free speech. A federal lawsuit filed by Paladino against the board accuses members of attempting to stifle that right. The Obama comments may have set into motion Paladino's ouster, Elia wrote, but Paladino's subsequent executive session disclosures ""provided a new, independent ground for seeking (Paladino's) removal."" The commissioner's ruling disqualifies Paladino, the Republican nominee for New York governor in 2010, from appointment or election to any district office for one year. The wealthy developer was elected to the school board in 2013 and re-elected by a narrow margin in 2016. ""There is absolutely no place in public education for someone who flagrantly disregards the rules and spouts disgusting, racially charged ideas that harm students and the teaching environment,"" New York State United Teachers said in one of several statements issued by organizations in support of Elia's decision. The Education Trust's New York chapter, invoking last weekend's violence in Virginia, said the issue was ""much deeper"" than contained in the limited ruling. ""As we've seen from the recent events in Charlottesville, we have a long way to go as a country to combat hate and intolerance"" the organization said, ""and elected leaders at every level from the local school board to the president must be held accountable for the tone they set and for the lessons their words teach young people."" School board President Barbara Nevergold said Elia's ruling confirms that it's not for individual board members to decide what is confidential and what should be made public. She said she hopes Paladino's removal clears the way for more productive meetings. ""There has been a lot that has occurred at this board table and outside that has really been due to the behavior of Mr. Paladino,"" Nevergold told reporters inside the City Hall meeting room. ""We're looking forward to being able to move forward without the distractions that have accompanied his behavior."" Paladino's remarks about Obama were part of an end-of-the-year Artvoice article that posed questions to high-profile, Buffalo-area personalities about the year ahead. When asked what he'd like to happen in 2017 and what he'd like to see go away, Paladino replied he wanted Obama to die of mad cow disease and Michelle Obama to ""return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla.""

"West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who is up for reelection in a state President Trump won by a wide margin, says he doesn't ""give a s**t"" about losing his Senate seat. ""I don't give a s**t, you understand? I just don't give a s**t,"" he told the Charleston Gazette-Mail on Sunday. ""Don't care if I get elected, don't care if I get defeated, how about that. If they think because I'm up for election, that I can be wrangled into voting for s**t that I don't like and can't explain, they're all crazy."" ""I'm not scared of an election, let's put it that way,"" the senator went on. ""Elections do not bother me or scare me. I'm going to continue to do the same thing I've always done, extremely independent."" Manchin's colorful comments come as a response to a letter written by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey asking Manchin to resign from Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's leadership team. ""I am writing to urge you to put West Virginia's interests and values first and resign immediately from Sen. Chuck Schumer's leadership team,"" Morrisey's letter to Manchin reads. Morrisey, a Republican, is running to replace Manchin in 2018. Although once a Democratic stronghold, West Virginia has become one of the safest Republican states in the country, and gave President Trump one of his largest margins of victory last November. Last week, the state's governor, Jim Justice, publicly announced his switch from the Democratic Party to the GOP at a local rally held by Mr. Trump. ""Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me,"" Justice said. ""Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking...today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor.""

"Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a federal grand jury which is believed to be meeting at the U.S. District Court, as part of the investigation into Russian interference and related matters, according to sources familiar with the matter, CBS News' Pat Milton, senior producer with the investigative unit, reports. On Monday, at the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse, located just blocks from the U.S. Capitol, about 20 people sporadically filed through the double doors leading to the grand jury hearing rooms. Many of the individuals were wearing badges which said ""JUROR,"" and they were casually dressed.? According to the New York Times, special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the White House for documents related to former National Security Advis... The heavy brass doors on the third floor leading to the four separate grand jury hearing rooms are guarded by U.S. marshals. It is not known how many of those rooms were in use Monday. Grand juries are secret proceedings.? It is unclear at this point whether the grand jury being used by Mueller's investigators is the one apparently meeting Monday. It is also not known whether the grand jury used by the special counsel meets once a week or is a sitting grand jury that meets regularly on other cases and is readily available to Mueller's team when needed.? On Sunday, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller to be special counsel -- was not confirming that Mueller was using a grand jury, but he did talk with ""Fox News Sunday's"" Chris Wallace about how grand juries are used in investigations. ""It's an appropriate way to gather documents, sometimes to bring witnesses in, to make sure that you get their full testimony,"" Rosenstein explained. ""It's just a tool that we use like any other tool in the course of our investigations."" Grand juries can be used in part to issue subpoenas for those documents and testimony. ? The E. Barrett Prettyman Federal court in Washington, Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. He also told Wallace that he and Mueller ""understand the specific scope of the investigation, and...it's not a fishing expedition."" If there's evidence outside that scope, however, Mueller ""needs to come to the acting attorney general, at this time, me, for a permission to expand his investigation,"" Rosenstein said. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's use of a grand jury in Washington, D.C., as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, is considered to be a sign that the probe is ramping up. Investigators are exploring whether there were any improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives. Grand juries give prosecutors the ability to put witnesses under oath if there is evidence of a crime. Mueller and his expanding team will also have the power to seek indictments and subpoena documents. A grand jury had been part of the FBI's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn and was impaneled in Virginia, the Wall Street Journal reported. That probe has since been taken over by Mueller. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller special counsel in May, and Mueller was given a broad mandate to investigate and prosecute any potential crimes he uncovered. The appointment came after Mr. Trump fired then-FBI director James Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation, delegating oversight of the probe to Rosenstein.

"AIKEN, S.C. 〞?A former South Carolina legislator is expected to plead guilty Monday to a domestic violence charge in an attack on his wife, a felony that could land him in prison for a decade. Attorneys for Chris Corley have informed state prosecutors their client is planning to change his plea to guilty during a hearing in Aiken, according to Robert Kittle, spokesman for the state Attorney General's Office. He's expected to plead guilty to first-degree criminal domestic violence, which carries a sentence from probation to 10 years in prison. His wife, Heather Corley, prepared a statement to be read to Judge Doyet A. Early III asking for leniency. She blames a previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder for his behavior, according to the Aiken Standard, which obtained a copy from her lawyer.? A grand jury initially indicted the 36-year-old lawmaker on aggravated domestic violence - the state's toughest category of such crimes, punishable by up to 20 years in prison - enhanced when the alleged abuse occurs in the presence of children.? The Republican from Graniteville had just been elected to a second term when authorities say he attacked his wife during an argument over his infidelity the day after Christmas. In a police report, authorities said the couple's young children were present when Corley attacked his wife, biting her nose bloody and pointing a gun at her.? ""Just stop, Daddy. Just stop,"" his children can be heard on a 911 call. ""Daddy, why are you doing this?""? Corley's wife said he stopped hitting her only after noticing she was bleeding and hearing the children screaming, authorities said. Prosecutors said he took away his wife's cellphone to keep her from summoning help, but that she managed to call 911 on her Apple Watch.? Authorities said that after Corley threatened to kill her and then said he'd kill himself, his wife took the children to her mother's house across the street.? Local solicitors asked Attorney General Alan Wilson to take over the domestic violence case. Suspended from the state House after his indictment, Corley resigned his seat a month after his arrest, as lawmakers prepared to introduce legislation calling for his expulsion.? Heather Corley had begged prosecutors to drop the case or allow him to plead guilty to a lesser charge that would enable him to keep his law license.? She said they need his income as a lawyer to support their three children. The Attorney General's Office said it would move forward with the criminal case.? ""None of this was my intention,"" she said in the statement. ""I only wanted my husband to get the help he needed. We sought medical help for his mental state for one year. As the year progressed, it became increasingly worse. He has since been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and the medications he was taking, which were prescribed, were increasing and prolonging manic stages which caused his behavior to become erratic.""? She said that he's been in treatment since January and ""we have our Chris back."" Heather Corley also said she feels her husband was ""coerced into this plea"" when the Attorney General's Office subpoenaed their 8-year-old daughter to testify against her father if the case goes to trial. He ""would do anything to protect our baby girl from the psychological damage that would inflict,"" she wrote.? As a legislator, Corley voted against South Carolina's stronger domestic violence laws in 2015, saying he didn't think guns should be taken away from people charged in abuse cases. Corley may be best known in the House as a staunch defender of the Confederate flag. After the flag was removed from Statehouse grounds in July 2015, following the massacre of nine black churchgoers by a self-avowed white supremacist who embraced the flag, Corley sponsored a bill for a statewide vote on whether to return it. The bill went nowhere.? He also sent a Christmas card with the Confederate flag on it to Republican lawmakers after the flag came down, suggesting they ""ask for forgiveness of all your sins such as betrayal,"" calling it a joke in his smart-aleck style.

"Last Updated Aug 7, 2017 4:40 PM EDT North Korea's top diplomat is saying that ""under no circumstances"" will it put its nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles on the negotiating table, after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the U.S. was open to talks if the North completely halts its nuclear program and stops conducting intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) tests. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho also stated at a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that his country has no intention of using nuclear weapons against any country ""except the U.S."" He says the only way that would change is if another country joined in an American action against North Korea.? President Trump is spending the next two weeks at his golf club in New Jersey and says it's ""not a vacation."" There are new signs recent staff sh... Ri had been scheduled to hold a news conference in Manila, Philippines, where Asian diplomats are attending the ministerial meetings. Instead, Ri's spokesman handed reporters a copy of a speech that Ri had given at the meeting. Ri says in the speech that responsibility for the Korean Peninsula crisis lies solely with Washington. He says the North is ""ready to teach the U.S. a severe lesson with its nuclear strategic force."" Over the weekend, the?U.N. Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions to punish the North including a ban on coal and other exports worth over $1 billion. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley called the U.S.-drafted resolution ""the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against"" North Korea. ? ? A statement from the North Korean government on Monday said that the U.N. sanctions resolution ""is an outcome of diabolical attempts of the U.S. to isolate and stifle"" the North, and it called the resolution an infringement on the regime's sovereignty. The regime claimed its pursuit of nuclear force is a self-defense measure against ""the high-handed and arbitrary acts of the U.S.,"" which it accused of pursuing policies of ""extreme hostility"" and which poses a nuclear threat against North Korea.? The North said it would take an unspecified ""resolute action of justice"" and would never place its nuclear program on the negotiating table or ""flinch an inch"" from its push to strengthen its nuclear deterrence as long as U.S. hostility against North Korea persists. North Korea also mocked the U.S. for being ""so frightened"" by the ICBM tests and said the North's neighbors and the U.S. are ""making such a scene baying at each other"" over the missile launches. It went on to say that it's ""only a forlorn hope"" that North Korea would change its stance because of the sanctions. In the statement, North Korea also threatened to ""make the U.S. pay dearly for all the heinous crime [SIC] it commits against the state and people of this country."" South Korea's government said the North would face stronger sanctions if it doesn't stop its nuclear and missile provocation. Lim Eul Chul, a North Korea expert at South Korea's Kyungnam University, said the comments by the North demonstrate how angry it is over the U.N. sanctions, but the country is not likely to launch a pre-emptive strike against the United States. He said the North could still carry out further missile tests or a sixth atomic bomb test in the coming months under its broader weapons development timetable. North Korea test-launched two ICBMs last month as part of its efforts to possess a long-range missile capable of striking anywhere in the mainland U.S. Both missiles were fired at highly lofted angles, and analysts say the weapons could reach parts of the United States such as Alaska, Los Angeles or Chicago if fired at a normal, flattened trajectory. The centerpiece of the U.N. sanctions is a ban on North Korean exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood products - and a ban on all countries importing those products, estimated to be worth over $1 billion a year in hard currency. The resolution also bans countries from giving any additional permits to North Korean laborers, another source of foreign currency for the North, and prohibits all new joint ventures with North Korean companies. Analysts say that North Korea, already under numerous U.N. and other international sanctions, will feel some pain from the new sanctions but is not likely to return to disarmament negotiations anytime soon because of them. Lim, the North Korea expert, said the North will probably squeeze its ordinary citizens to help finance its nuclear and missile programs. Shin Beomchul of the Seoul-based Korea National Diplomatic Academy said sanctions that can force a change from North Korea would include a ban on China's annual, mostly free shipment of 500,000 tons of crude oil to North Korea and the deporting by U.N. member states of the tens of thousands of North Korean workers currently dispatched abroad. CBS News' Pam Falk contributed to this report.																																																																																																																					"
"MANILA -- Secretary of State Rex Tillerson laid out the most specific preconditions yet for U.S.-North Korea talks, soon after the United Nations Security Council adopted the largest economic sanctions package ever against the regime. The regime must stop missile launches, Tillerson told reporters in Manila. Though the administration has still not ruled out a preemptive military strike against the North, talks are the preferred option to convince North Korea to completely halt its nuclear program. Tillerson did not specify how long the missile launches would have to be suspended as a precondition to launch talks. President Trump is spending the next two weeks at his golf club in New Jersey and says it's ""not a vacation."" There are new signs recent staff sh... ""We will know it when we see it,"" he said. ""If they can demonstrate they are ready to sit with the spirit of finding a way forward in these talks by no longer conducting these missile tests -- so this is not a 'give me 30 days and we are ready to talk' -- it's not quite that simple."" These preconditions provided some context for Tillerson's comments on U.S.-North Korea talks earlier this year. ""North Korea must take concrete steps to reduce the threat that its illegal weapons programs pose to the United States and our allies before we can consider talks,"" Tillerson said at the U.N. in late April. The secretary of State has repeatedly said that sitting down with North Korea would benefit the regime. He said dialogue will lead the regime to ""feel secure and prosper economically."" Two days earlier, the U.N. had voted on its strongest sanctions ever against the North after it launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. The sanctions prevent North Korean exports of iron, lead and seafood. The U.N. says the measures will cost the North over $1 billion a year in hard currency. And they will also ban countries from green-lighting the admission of more North Korean laborers, who are said to economically fuel the country's illicit programs.? North Korean workers, who allegedly send their earnings to the regime, have been mentioned by Tillerson in the past. And he talked about them again during a lunch meeting with Japan and South Korea. He reiterated the intention of the U.S. to urge countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East to stop utilizing North Korean contract labor.? ""What we tell people is to stop supporting the regime and let people return home,"" Tillerson said. ""This is a human rights concern because of the unfair treatment, trafficking conditions and misuse of wages."" Tillerson has also been mulling what actions the U.S. should take in response to Russia's expulsion of a large number of American diplomats in Russia. The U.S. will have a response by Sept. 1, he told Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in their meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN ministerial meeting. Tillerson asked Lavrov ""several clarifying questions"" about the decision, which was announced soon after the passage of sanctions legislation targeting Russia, which neither Tillerson nor President Trump support.

"Last Updated Aug 7, 2017 2:51 PM EDT While many members of Congress are preparing for their 2018 re-election races, half of the 18 members leaving the House of Representatives next year are now eyeing a gubernatorial run in their home states, according to a Politico report. As some are looking to escape the Washington gridlock to help shape policy at home, there are some risks in leaving the comfort of the House. ?Politico reports that the last time this many sitting representatives had run for governor, which was back in 2006, twice as many candidates lost as won.? The sudden surge of those looking for a gubernatorial seat can probably in part be attributed to the Republican hold on the presidency, the House and the Senate. Members of the Democratic minority may be feeling they can more effective from home.? Rob Richie, Executive Director for FairVote, a non-partisan advocacy group?focusing on electoral reform, told CBS News that the rise in House members on the Democratic side making a leap for the governor's mansion may also be due to financial factors and overall political impact.? The biggest factors, he said, are ""the allure for Democrats of establishing themselves as national leaders in an era of a thin gubernatorial bench, the increased money for campaigns associated with the awareness of how important governors are to federal and state partisan control -- as affected by redistricting in 2021 -- and the breakdown of the House as a well-functioning governing body."" The ability to impact those redistricting efforts has moved to the forefront for those in the Democratic party in making new gains across the country. ?A new Democratic group led by former Attorney General Eric Holder?is now focusing on redistricting challenges to counter political advances Republicans have made since the 2010 census and the redrawing of electoral districts that followed. Richie adds that if more ex-House members are elected governor, it could encourage a national conversation about fair House elections.? ""Governors on their own can advance that idea, too, by calling for congressional election or proposing interstate compacts with other states so that a group of states can be fair together in giving their voters a level playing field in House races."" Joe Rassenfoss of the Western Governors' Association echoed the benefits of governors working to shape national policy, saying, ""Each executive department and agency should have a clear and accountable process to provide states with early, meaningful and substantive input in the development of regulatory policies In a recent letter sent to a White House official, the association asserted that they ""believe realigning the relationship of the federal government and states so that it operates as a true partnership is one of the most important reforms the President could undertake."" It's a sentiment also shared the by the collective voice of the nation's governors. ""The desire of many House members to run for governor of their states shows how critically important and influential governors in our country have become, "" said Scott Pattison, executive director and CEO of the National Governors Association, in a statement to CBS News. ""Governors of the states are effective policymakers and moving the needle every day for their citizens."" For those running, it's also a chance to use their Washington expertise in stopping legislation that negatively impacts their constituents.? ""It's a good partnership to have folks who have federal experience, have relationships here but can be the governor of their states so they don't execute some of these federal changes in a way that harms their citizens,"" said Rep.

"Last Updated Aug 7, 2017 1:06 PM EDT Sen. Richard Blumenthal on Monday responded to tweets posted earlier in the morning by President Trump in which he called the Connecticut Democrat a ""phony Vietnam con artist."" Blumenthal tweeted that the president's ""bullying"" won't be effective. Mr. President: Your bullying hasn't worked before and it won't work now. No one is above the law. This issue isn't about me - it's about the Special Counsel's independence and integrity. In a series of tweets earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump, on his vacation in Bedminster, New Jersey, tweeted that it was ""interesting"" to watch Blumenthal talk about ""hoax Russian collusion,"" given his background in Vietnam. Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a phony Vietnam con artist! Never in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal. He told stories about his Vietnam battles and.... ...conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie. He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child. Now he judges collusion? Blumenthal held a press conference in Hartford Monday morning to discuss the special counsel legislation that he is co-sponsoring. He was repeatedly pressed, however, on the president's tweeted attacks. The Connecticut senator declared that that he was ""not going to be distracted or bullied by these slurs."" When asked whether they were slurs given that he admitted he misstated his service, he answered, ""They are slurs and I am not going to be distracted or bullied by them and they simply reinforce in fact the need in my view for special counsel legislation because these kinds of tweets, intimidation directed at the special counsel indicate that the president might try to fire them."" In 2010, Blumenthal, when he was serving as Connecticut's attorney general, admitted that he had ""misspoken"" about his service during Vietnam. The New York Times had reported at the time that Blumenthal had received at least five deferments that kept him out of the war. He was in the Marine Corps Reserves for six years in the U.S. The president's comments hit Twitter soon after the Connecticut senator had appeared on CNN Monday morning.? ""The impanelment of the grand jury shows that Bob Mueller is pursuing this potential wrongdoing by the Russians, the attack on our democracy, seriously and diligently,"" Blumenthal said in the interview. He also said of the Russin meddling that ""it was purposeful and relentless, and it involved propaganda and hacking into our voting machines 〞 or at least an attempt to do it 〞 and potential collusion by the Trump campaign, and then obstruction of justice. That investigation must be pursued.""? Blumenthal serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee and has been outspoken about the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.?

"Last Updated Aug 7, 2017 1:18 PM EDT President Trump claimed Monday that his base is ""getting stronger"" despite what he calls ""fake news"" from major media outlets. The comment was part of a stream of tweets from Mr. Trump during his vacation in Bedminster, New Jersey. Hard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES & WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger! He first tweeted about ""the failing @nytimes,"" which he said ""made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win."" He claimed the Times ""apologized,"" though there's no evidence that that happened. Mr. Trump then tweeted about how ""the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs...Supreme Court pick, economic enthusiasm, deregulation & so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together.

"NEW YORK?-- For the third time in six months, President Donald Trump is on the hunt for a new communications director. But in practice, the job is filled. It's Trump who's the White House's leading expert and the final word on what and how he communicates with the public. Despite decrying most negative media coverage as ""fake news"" and personally insulting members of the media, he has inserted himself into the White House's press operations in an unprecedented fashion for a president. Trump has dictated news releases and pushed those who speak for him to bend the facts to bolster his claims. He has ignored the advice of his legal team and thrown out carefully planned legislative strategies with a single 140-character tweet. His direct, hands-on style helped him win the White House and still thrills his supporters. It also, however, poses increasing political and potentially legal risks. The clearest example is his involvement in crafting a statement for son Donald Jr. about a meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. That declaration was quickly proven erroneous and raised questions about whether the president was trying to cover for his son. Trump has struggled to find a communications adviser that meets his approval. His first, Mike Dubke, stayed behind the scenes and never clicked with Trump, leaving after three months. Then Sean Spicer, Trump's oft-beleaguered press secretary, took on the communications director job as well. He resigned both posts last month when Trump brought in hard-charging New York financier Anthony Scaramucci. Scaramucci lasted only 11 days before being fired in the aftermath of an expletive-filled interview. A fourth candidate for the post, campaign spokesman Jason Miller, was named to the job during the transition but turned it down days later, citing a need to spend time with his family. More recently there have been some informal internal conversations about an increased communications role for White House aide Stephen Miller, according to an administration official who was not authorized to discuss private talks by name and requested anonymity. Those talks are still seen as preliminary. Miller recently clashed with some reporters over immigration policy at a contentious press briefing. This past week, as White House staffers readied a statement accompanying Trump's signature on legislation approving toughened sanctions on Russia - a bill Trump criticized - word came down that the president wanted to add some off-topic language into the statement. That's according to two officials familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly talk about internal discussions. ""I built a truly great company worth many billions of dollars,"" the new section read. ""That is a big part of the reason I was elected. As president, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress."" That personal and boastful rhetoric is a far cry from the formal language normally found in presidential statements. It also appeared aimed at angering the same lawmakers he will need if he wants to pass any major legislation. ""All presidents are their own best messengers,"" said Ari Fleischer, a press secretary for President George W. Bush. Fleischer said that Bush, too, would at times get involved with the White House press shop. Fleischer noted there was always a safety net of advisers at work. That does not appear to exist around the current president - particular around his Twitter account. ""The lesson for this president is that it's perfectly fine to be involved and to, at times, go around the mainstream media with Twitter,"" Fleischer said. ""But he needs to tweet smarter."" Corralling the president's impulses is a challenge that now falls to new White House chief of staff John Kelly, a four-star Marine general tasked with straightening out an unruly West Wing. But many Trump allies don't believe he'll alter his ways. ""The reality is President Trump is sitting in the Oval Office,"" said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign staffer. ""And before that, he was a mogul with a business that spanned continents. He did it his way. He's not going to change. It got him where he is and it will keep him where he is."" Trump has long considered himself his own best spokesman and cares deeply about his public perception. While a budding real estate magnate in New York in the 1980s and 1990s, he was known to call reporters to plant anonymously sourced scoops about himself. He vaulted to national stardom with ""The Apprentice"" and micromanaged aspects of his appearances, including his hair and lighting. During the 2016 campaign, Trump was known to obsess over single images in a commercial or the font for an ad. As president, he frequently has raged about his communications staff, blaming them for White House's stumbles while almost never taking responsibility himself. An avid consumer of cable news, Trump scolds surrogates when he thinks they are not adequately defending him on television. His frequently shifting positions also challenge his staffers, who have grown to be fearful of answering basic questions about the president's beliefs for fear of later being contradicted, according to more than a half dozen White House officials and outside advisers speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. And the president has pushed staff to defend untruths, including when he ordered Spicer, in Spicer's first White House briefing, to claim that the size of Trump's inauguration crowd was larger than his predecessor's, according to three White House officials and outside advisers familiar with the encounter. More untruths have followed. In March, Trump tweeted without evidence that President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower. And soon after firing FBI Director James Comey, Trump tweeted a warning that Comey had better hope there were no tapes of their White House conversations. There weren't. Another statement has received bipartisan condemnation and could face scrutiny from investigators probing possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russian officials. As news broke last month that Trump Jr. had met with Russians in June 2016, the president's eldest son released a statement - which was in part crafted on Air Force One by the president and a small group of aides while flying home from a summit in Europe - that claimed the meeting was about adoptions. But within days, Trump Jr. had to revise his story several times before eventually acknowledging that he was trying to procure damaging, Russia-produced information about Hillary Clinton. ""This was a bad decision by the president,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ""When you get caught in a lie about one thing, it makes it hard to just say let the other stuff go."" Press secretary Sarah Sanders said last week that Trump ""weighed in as any father would, based on the limited information that he had.""

"MUKWONAGO, Wis. -- With a dysfunctional Congress on recess, House Speaker Paul Ryan has turned his focus back home, touring flood-damaged areas and visiting local businesses in Wisconsin. But he can't escape the questions about why Republicans in charge of Washington aren't delivering. And though he's won re-election easily for years, Ryan faces the prospect of challenges from left and right and an energized Democratic base in next year's midterm elections. ""We have a majority in the House and Senate and it feels like nothing's getting done,"" 32-year-old James Hulsey said just before Ryan recently toured his workplace. Sensing the angst, Ryan has been much more visible in his southeast Wisconsin district as Republicans failed to deliver on their yearslong promise to scrap the health care law and new polling numbers show the speaker is less popular among Republicans in Wisconsin than President Donald Trump. Trump won Wisconsin by less than a percentage point, but he carried Ryan's district by 10 points. In the remaining months of the year, Ryan and the Republican-led Congress are determined to deliver major legislation, elusive so far due to GOP infighting, and the top priority is overhauling the nation's tax code. Failure to produce could cost Republicans their House majority in the 2018 midterms and, for Ryan, his job as speaker and Republican leader. ""This is the third time in 100 years we've had this alignment of government that we've got to get it done or else I really worried our country will continue down a bad path,"" Ryan said after his tour of the wire manufacturer Banker Wire, in Mukwonago, Wisconsin. He later told the Wisconsin State Journal, ""If we don't do our job, we will depress turnout. I am frustrated as well."" Republican Keith Ketzler, 62, worries that the GOP will pay politically next year. Democrats need to flip 24 seats to regain control. ""Everybody that voted Republican is getting very frustrated,"" Ketzler said, after prodding Ryan about why Congress hasn't achieved more. ""People crossed the line last time, but they're not going to stay crossed if they don't get things done."" Ryan angered some conservatives during the campaign with comments critical of then-candidate Trump. But in the first six months of Trump's term, Ryan has been far less critical of the president than other Republican lawmakers who have challenged a number of Trump moves, including his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator. Ryan's Republican primary challenger last year, Paul Nehlen, initially won the backing of then-candidate Trump, who later switched to Ryan. Ryan beat Nehlen by 70 percentage points in the primary. But Nehlen, who is running again, thinks 2018 will be more difficult for Ryan, arguing that he hasn't done enough to appease Republican Trump supporters. ""President Trump has given Paul Ryan way more opportunities to stand up and back him and what he has done is really undermine him,"" Nehlen said. Beating Ryan will not be easy. No Democrat has represented the district since 1995. Ryan has cruised to re-election ever since he joined Congress in 1999 - winning by 35 percentage points last year. He has $11.5 million in the bank and is a familiar face in Janesville where he was born and raised and still lives with his wife and three children. Democrats are pinning their hopes on Randy Bryce, an Army veteran and union iron worker with the nickname ""Iron Stache."" He appears to have walked out of Hollywood central casting - complete with a dark mustache, thick biceps, faded blue jeans and a promise to fight for the working man. Bryce is trying to capitalize on disenchantment over Ryan's role in the health care bill as he mounts a long-shot campaign. Bryce generated excitement among Democrats both in Wisconsin and nationally for his announcement video in June that has now been viewed more than 550,000 times. It begins with a clip of Trump praising Ryan's attempts to undo Democrat Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act and then shows Bryce getting emotional as his mother details her struggle with multiple sclerosis. ""You can come work the iron,"" the hardhat-wearing Bryce challenges Ryan, ""and I'll go to D.C."" Bryce raised $430,000 in the first two weeks after the spot ran. Ryan has tried to shift the conversation from the collapse of the GOP health care effort and toward tax reform and the news that Taiwanese iPhone manufacturer Foxconn plans to invest $10 billion on a factory in his congressional district that could employ 13,000 people. Ryan launched a series of campaign-style online ads highlighting the news that the plant was coming near abandoned automobile factories in his hometown of Janesville and nearby Kenosha. But Ryan's involvement doesn't seem to be resonating quite yet with voters in his district. ""Paul Ryan? I don't know what he's done for it,"" said Republican voter Jeff Lunde of Ryan's role in the Foxconn deal. ""They're all working on this stupid health-care crap.""																																																																																																																					"

Working in Bedminster, N.J., as long planned construction is being done at the White House. This is not a vacation - meetings and calls! It should be noted that the renovations have nothing to do with Mr. Trump's reported opinion that the White House is a ""dump""?(the president tweeted that the report was ""TOTALLY UNTRUE"").? The president will spend 17 days at his residence at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, while renovations are underway.? ""All of us in lower press will miss seeing you guys every day but we're definitely looking forward to the much-needed renovations in the HVAC system, as well as throughout the rest of the West Wing,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters told members of the media during a gaggle on Air Force One. The 27-year-old White House heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems are showing their age, so they're being replaced, leaving the West Wing without air conditioning temporarily.

"Last Updated Aug 7, 2017 1:23 AM EDT President Trump took to Twitter late Sunday night to announce that he had spoken with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Mr. Trump wrote: ""Just completed call with President Moon of South Korea. Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions."" Just completed call with President Moon of South Korea. Very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions. The tweet came a day after the United Nations Security Council endorsed new sanctions on North Korea?over Pyongyang's recent tests of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The White House issued a statement to CBS News saying in part that the two leaders are ""committed"" to the sanctions and urge the international community to follow suit. ""The two leaders affirmed that North Korea poses a grave and growing direct threat to the United States, South Korea, and Japan, as well as to most countries around the world,"" the statement read. ""The leaders committed to fully implement all relevant resolutions and to urge the international community to do so as well."" Reports that North Korea's latest missile test came dangerously close to an Air France jet are raising new concerns about the safety of passenger... Meanwhile, a welcome boost came Sunday from China, the North's economic lifeline, as Beijing called on its neighbor to halt its missile and nuclear tests. For the U.S., it was a long-awaited sign of progress for Mr. Trump's strategy of trying to enlist Beijing's help to squeeze North Korea diplomatically and economically. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, meeting with North Korea's top diplomat during the gathering in Manila, urged the North to ""maintain calm"" despite the U.N. vote. ""Do not violate the U.N.'s decision or provoke international society's goodwill by conducting missile launching or nuclear tests,"" Wang said, in an unusually direct admonition. Tillerson didn't meet with North Korea's envoy, Ri Yong Ho. In fact, on his first day in Manila, Tillerson appeared to go out of his way to avoid crossing paths with Ri. In remarks to reporters Monday morning, Tillerson said the best signal North Korea could give that it was prepared for negotiations with the U.S. would be to halt its missile launches. Tillerson, in his most specific outline to date of what preconditions the U.S. had for talks with Pyongyang, said stopping the launches would be the ""first and strongest signal."" But he also said it was not as simple as North Korea stopping launches for a few days or weeks. He wouldn't give a concrete time frame but said the U.S. would ""know it when we see it."" The U.S. has ""other means of communication"" open to North Korea if the country wants to express to the U.S. a desire to talk, Tillerson said, but didn't offer specifics. Though Beijing repeated its call for Washington and Pyongyang to resume talks, the U.S. said that was still premature, and rejected yet again a Chinese call for the U.S. to freeze joint military exercises with South Korea in exchange for the North halting nuclear development. Pyongyang views the military exercises as rehearsals for an invasion. The U.S. also warned it planned to rigorously monitor China's compliance with the new penalties. Susan Thornton, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia, said Beijing had historically cooperated with sanctions after flagrant North Korean violations but then slipped back over time. ""We want to make sure China is continuing to implement fully the sanctions regime,"" Thornton told reporters in Manila. ""Not this kind of episodic back and forth that we've seen.""? Michael Morell, former CIA acting and deputy director and CBS News senior national security contributor, joins ""CBS This Morning"" to discuss the ... Would Tillerson interact with his North Korean counterpart, even informally, if they crossed paths in Manila? It was a question driving the hallway chatter at the gathering, but the U.S. shot down that prospect and said Tillerson had no plans to interact with Ri. Tillerson, who was scheduled to attend a gala dinner Sunday, skipped it. Ri did not. The North Korean was spotted at the gala smiling and toasting with the other foreign ministers. Tillerson aide R.C. Hammond said that after a productive first day, Tillerson spent several hours preparing for Day 2. Instead, the U.S. was represented at the dinner by Thornton, whose official title is acting assistant secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs. But Wang, the Chinese envoy, cast Ri's presence in Manila as a positive, enabling him to ""hear the voices from other sides."" Speaking in Chinese, Wang said that Ri ""also has the right to share his opinions."" Ri hasn't spoken publicly since arriving in the Philippines. But a commentary in the ruling party's Rodong Sinmun newspaper said Washington had disregarded the warning the North sent with its intercontinental ballistic missile tests and was pursuing ""desperate efforts"" in the form of stepped-up sanctions. ""Now the U.S. mainland is on the crossroads of life and death,"" the commentary warned.?

"Last Updated Aug 6, 2017 9:17 PM EDT Mayor Rahm Emanuel says Chicago will keep fighting President Trump's immigration policies with a federal lawsuit alleging it's illegal for the federal government to withhold public safety grants from so-called ""sanctuary cities."" The mayor said Chicago won't ""be blackmailed into changing our values, and we are and will remain a welcoming City."" The lawsuit will be filed Monday. Chicago officials say there are new qualifications for a public safety grant requiring cities to share information with federal immigration authorities. City officials allege they're unconstitutional. Chicago received about $2.3 million in such grants last year, which have been used for buying police vehicles. President Trump endorsed a Senate immigration bill that would slash legal immigration to the United States in half. The bill favors high-skilled,... The city is being helped by two outside law firms on a pro bono basis. Federal officials have threatened to withhold federal funding for sanctuary cities, saying they don't comply with federal laws. Asked to comment on Emanuel's statement, U.S. Department of Justice spokesman Ian D. Prior said via email: ""In 2016, more Chicagoans were murdered than in New York City and Los Angeles combined. So it's especially tragic that the mayor is less concerned with that staggering figure than he is spending time and taxpayer money protecting criminal aliens and putting Chicago's law enforcement at greater risk."" Meanwhile, in one high-profile immigration case unfolding in Los Angeles, a 42-year-old pastor was detained and could be soon deported. Victoria Carias is praying her husband, pastor Noe Carias, will come home soon. He was recently detained by U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement after living in the U.S. with his American-born wife and two young children. ""On my children, it's been its been very, very hard -- terrible. Emotionally, it's been very hard for them. They cry at night, they miss their father, I miss my husband deeply,"" Victoria Carias told CBS News correspondent Mireya Villarreal. In a statement to CBS News, ICE said ""Mr. Carias is a repeat immigration violator who assumed multiple identities"" and ""his actions have established a pattern or misrepresentation."" A church in New Haven, Connecticut, is providing a safe haven for a single mother from Guatemala who faces deportation. More than 800 churches an... As a teenager, Noe Carias had several run-ins with ICE. He was granted two stays, but his third was denied last month. The family's attorney, Noemi Ramirez, told Villarreal she thinks her client is ""just a victim of the new administration."" Ramirez believes the president's promise to target criminals is far from what's happening in the field. ""The detentions, internally here in the United States, have increased 150 percent since the Obama administration,"" Ramirez said. This week, President Trump rolled out a new immigration bill that restricts what kind of immigrant should be eligible for a green card. In another Southern California case, Romulo Avelica, was detained after dropping his daughter off at school. The Mexican citizen had been living in the U.S. for 25 years. In the last nine months, ICE has made more than 102,000 immigration arrests and removed more than 171,000 people. ""I didn't feel like my family -- any one of us -- would be a priority for deportation. I never thought this could happen to us,"" Brenda Avelica told Villarreal. Avelica's attorneys are trying to intervene, but as of this Monday, he's eligible for deportation. Pastor Carias had his green card application in when ICE picked him up. There's no word yet on when he'll get his hearing, Villarreal reports.																																																																																																																					"
"Prosecutors don't intend to go after reporters for doing their jobs but could more forcefully try to get them to reveal their sources, a Justice Department official said Sunday. ""We're after the leaker, not the journalist. We're after people who are committing crimes,"" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told ""Fox News Sunday."" His comments come two days after officials pledged to clamp down on government leaks they believe undermine American security. Still, Rosenstein left open the possibility that reporters could be investigated for breaking other, unspecified laws. He declined to comment Friday when asked whether prosecutors would seek to jail journalists. Officials are reviewing guidelines that make it difficult for prosecutors to subpoena journalists about their sources, Rosenstein reiterated Sunday. He said some of the ""procedural hurdles"" may be delaying leak investigations. Without providing specifics, Rosenstein said the number of criminal leak probes had more than tripled in the early months of the Trump administration. Meanwhile, an Obama administration official echoed Rosenstein's concerns. ""The leaks right now are really bad. I've never seen it this bad,"" former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" But he cautioned the Justice Department that going after reporters for their sources could have unintended consequences. ""Before you decide to take on journalists, reporters, and perhaps subpoena their sources, be aware that the courts are going to get involved, and that has the potential for making bad law in this area,"" Johnson said.

"In a tweet seemingly responding to the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, President Donald Trump referenced a factually inaccurate anecdote about combatting Muslim enemies that he often repeated on the campaign trail. Thirteen people were killed when a van drove through a crowd of pedestrians on a busy street in Spain's second largest city Thursday. ISIS later claimed responsibility for the act that left 100 people injured as well. ""Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,"" wrote Trump, less than four hours after the attack. ""There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!""  Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!  The president's post was apparently in reference to a legend about World War I-era Army Gen. John J. Pershing that he first told publicly during a campaign rally in Charleston, South Carolina, in February 2016. According to Trump, Pershing dipped the bullets used to execute Muslim terrorists in pig blood. The Quran prohibits the consumption of pork, which is considered to be ""impure."" ""They had a terrorism problem and there's a whole thing with swine and pigs and you know the story they don't like them ... and Gen. Pershing was a rough guy and he sits on his horse and he's very astute, like a ramrod. ... And he caught 50 terrorists that did tremendous damage and killed many people ... and he dipped 50 bullets in pig's blood,"" Trump explained. ""And he had his men load his rifles and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people,"" he continued. ""And the 50th person he said, 'You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years there wasn't a problem, OK? Twenty-five years there wasn't a problem!""     At the time the story was told, Politifact, an organization that fact-checks the claims of politicians, evaluated Trump's tale and concluded it to be ""ridiculous."" Politifact cited eight historians who not only noted that the evidence for the blood-dipped bullet aspect of the story ""is thin,"" but also that violence and unrest continued in the referenced region in the Philippines for years during and after U.S. involvement. It is unclear why Trump's original claim of ""25 years"" without ""a problem"" increased to ""35 years"" in his tweet Thursday. Snopes, an additional fact-checking outlet, similarly rated the story as false. In its analysis, Snopes writes of a 1927 Chicago Daily Tribune story noting Pershing ""sprinkled some prisoners with pig's blood,"" which was ultimately ""more powerful than bullets"" as a warning before releasing the prisoners, as well of a separate account that ""attributed the deed to someone other than Pershing."" At a press conference from Trump Tower in New York Tuesday, the president outlined his stance on adhering to factual information in response to a question about his hesitancy to condemn hate groups following violent protests last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don＊t know the facts. And it's a very, very important process to me,"" said Trump, continuing, ""So I don＊t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts.""																																																																																																																					"
"In response to Donald Trump＊s controversial remarks about the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, three Democrats want to censure the president. Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., announced their intent to introduce a formal resolution of censure tomorrow when the House is back in session. A censure resolution, if adopted, would be a formal and historic rebuke from Congress of Trump's remarks. The draft resolution from the small group of Democrats cites specific actions the representatives believe merit censure:       What is censure? A censure in the context of the United States government is an official statement of disapproval or condemnation towards a public official, including cabinet members, judges, members of Congress and the president. While a censure does not remove an individual from office, it can send a powerful message rebuking his or her past actions or statements. Members of the House of Representatives who are censured are forced to give up any committee chairmanships. How does it work? The Constitution does not specifically mention censures, though article 1, Section 5, Clause 2 of the Constitution states that ※each house may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.§ There is no one process for passing censure motions in Congress. Unlike impeachment proceedings, which have very set procedural rules, a motion to censure could be introduced, debated or voted on in the House, the Senate or both chambers simultaneously. It could be introduced jointly, in the form of what＊s called a concurrent resolution, in both chambers or not. As is the case with other calls for other resolutions, there is no guarantee an individual representative＊s motion to censure will be brought to the floor for a vote When have censures been used? According to the National Constitution Center, censure motions were introduced against presidents Abraham Lincoln, John Tyler, James Polk, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. However, the U.S. Senate has only successfully passed a censure motion against one president. In 1834, the Senate censured President Andrew Jackson when he refused to submit notes from his Cabinet meeting regarding his veto against a Congressional motion to re-charter the First Bank of the United States. Henry Clay, a member of the rival Whig political party, then led the decision to censure Jackson. After 10 weeks of debate, Senate members voted 26-20 to pass the censure against Jackson for using ""authority and power not conferred by the Constitution."" Largely symbolic in nature, the motion did not prevent Jackson from making his proposed changes to the bank, but according to the National Constitution Center, he remained angry about the decision for years. In a message to the Senate in April 1834 Jackson said the censure was ※wholly unauthorized by the Constitution, and in derogation of its entire spirit.§ The censure was expunged three years later in 1837 when the Democratic party regained control of the Senate. Since 1978, nine senators have been censured, with the most recent case in 1990. The House last passed a censure measure against then-Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., in 2010 over violating ethics rules by misusing donations and failing to pay income taxes. According to the Congressional Research Service, 23 representatives have been censured.

"President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence each offered condemnation of the terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain Thursday, and expressed that the United States is prepared to assist in efforts to pursue those found to be responsible. ""The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!"" wrote Trump on Twitter Thursday afternoon.  The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!  A van drove into pedestrians on a boulevard and public square popular with tourists in Barcelona earlier in the day, leaving at least 13 people dead and more than 80 others injured 〞 which law enforcement in the city labeled an act of terrorism. Trump faced criticism over the weekend for not labeling a similar attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, as terrorism. In that attack, one woman died and 19 other people were injured when a car rammed into people demonstrating against a white nationalist rally in the city. Attorney General Jeff Sessions told ABC News on Monday that the Charlottesville attack met ""the definition of domestic terrorism.""     From Panama, where he was traveling Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence expressed that ""the latest scenes of carnage and and mayhem sicken us all."" ""Whatever inspired today's terror attack, the United States stands ready to assist the people of Spain and find and punish those responsible,"" said Pence.   The president's and vice president's comments followed remarks earlier by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who offered the U.S.'s condolences and a strong warning to others who attempt to instigate attacks. ""Terrorists around the world should know the United States and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice,"" said Tillerson.

"Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee offered up a stinging rebuke of President Trump this afternoon by questioning Trump's stability and competence as a leader in the wake of a deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate that he needs to be successful,"" Corker said Thursday to group of reporters after an event in his home state. Corker called for ""radical changes"" from the White House, delivering a pointed critique of Trump for his lack of discipline in handling a national crisis. Corker, a conservative, excoriated Trump for his failure to appropriately speak to a nation still reeling from the racially charged incident over the weekend. Corker said Trump helped to fuel divisions in an attempt to generate support from his political base. ""Helping inspire divisions because it generates support from your political base is not a formula for causing our nation to advance and overcome the many issues that we have to deal with right now,"" Corker said. ""He also recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation,"" he went on. ""He has not demonstrated that he understands what has made this nation great and what it is today."" These are exceptionally strong statements from a U.S. senator against a member of his own party, and by far one of the most damning critiques of the president by a conservative GOP senator during Trump's presidency. ""He's got to demonstrate the characteristics of a president who understands that, without the things that I just mentioned happening, our nation is going to go through great peril,"" he said. When asked by reporters if he thinks Trump has done enough to denounce Nazis and white nationalists, Corker said Trump didn't say what he should have. ※I don＊t think that the president has appropriately spoken to the nation on this issue. And I think that sometimes he gets in a situation when he doubles down when he tries to ... make a wrong a right. I think he＊s done that in this case. I would ask that he take stock of who he is as president of all the people in the nation,"" Corker said. ""Those of us who have positions of responsibility we have to understand that at the end of the day, in spite of whether people misunderstand or understand differently, our role is to make our nation great and to overcome these issues and it takes far more discipline sometimes, way more discipline, a lot of strength, inner strength to be measured and to try to solve problems,"" he said. ""I will say we're at a point where there needs to be radical changes take place at the White House itself, it has to happen,"" Corker warned. ""The president needs to take stock of the role that he plays in our nation and move beyond himself, move way beyond himself and move to a place where daily he's waking up thinking what is best for this nation.""

"President Trump on Friday will huddle with his national security team at Camp David in Maryland to discuss the country's strategy in Afghanistan. The president is being presented with a variety of options, including withdrawing all American troops or adding 3,900 more to the current 8,400 total. Here is a look at the options being considered by the Trump administration for what is now being called the South Asia strategy. What is the South Asia strategy? The Trump administration has been debating for months what strategy to pursue in Afghanistan. The debate originally focused on the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan and a request for additional American troops to advise and assist the Afghan military fighting the Taliban and the ISIS affiliate in that country.   But that deadline came and went because Trump's national security team debated whether the strategy should be broader in scope. It has evolved into what is now known as the South Asia strategy, and it includes the regional implications for neighboring countries like Pakistan, India, China and Russia. The strategy would also look at what role these countries can play in reversing Taliban gains on the battlefield. Mattis told reporters Thursday that the Camp David meeting will ""move this toward a decision."" Mattis, however, did not say that a final decision would be made on Friday, only noting that a decision will occur in ""the very near future."" Will more American troops head to Afghanistan? A lot of the attention initially focused on whether the Trump administration would add more U.S. troops. In February, Gen. John Nicholson, the senior U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told Congress the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan was ""a stalemate"" and that he would like additional troops to enhance the advise and assist mission being carried out by 8,400 American troops and 5,000 NATO forces. Those troops would buttress the advise and assist mission helping the Afghan military fighting the Taliban, as well as add additional firepower to the counterterrorism mission against ISIS and al Qaeda. U.S. officials have said that Mattis favors a Pentagon proposal to send 3,900 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan. One official said as recently as this week that recommendations were still being made as to what kinds of U.S. military support those additional troops could provide. But Mattis has been firm that the debate over an Afghanistan strategy should be more than just a decision about whether or not to send more American troops. Military officials are now evaluating whether neighboring countries can play a role in the strategy. For example, it＊s clear the administration wants Pakistan to do more on its side of the border to take on the resurgent Taliban and ISIS-Khorasan. The internal debate has also broadened into a discussion of whether American troops should remain in Afghanistan. What are the options? Last week, Trump said he would be making a decision soon on Afghanistan. ""I've been looking at it,"" he said. ""It's our longest war in history, 17 years. That's unacceptable."" Trump is said to have been dissatisfied with the original strategy review and the request for more American troops, one reason why his national security team has developed additional options. Mattis said on Monday the Pentagon is still working on options for the president. ""We're sharpening each one of the options, so you can see the pluses and minuses of each one,"" Mattis said. ""So that there's no longer any new data you're going to get."" Another option would shift a portion of the U.S. military role to private military contractors. When asked specifically about that option, Mattis responded, ""It's part of the options being considered, and the president's open to the advice of the secretary of state and myself and the director of the CIA.""

"Amid the fallout from President Trump's comments that ""both sides"" are to blame for the weekend's violence in Charlottesville, his personal lawyer John Dowd forwarded an email to friends and associates casting Confederate army commander Robert E. Lee as a ""great man"" and saying that the Black Lives Matter movement has been ""totally infiltrated by terrorist groups."" The email, first reported by the New York Times, was not written by Dowd -- but contained arguments promoting pro-Confederate propaganda. The email was sent to Dowd shortly after the president＊s contentious press conference on Tuesday. Dowd later forwarded the email. ""The following information and argument President Trump should put forth concerning Charlottesville and General Robert E. Lee,"" wrote Jerome Almon, the author of the email. Almon, who has promoted a number of conspiracy theories online and claims to have predicted several terrorist attacks, told ABC News in a phone interview that he is glad to see the information in the email he sent to Dowd ""is getting out§ and argued that Black Lives Matter is ""just as racist as the KKK."" Almon, who is black, said his email was not meant to be sympathetic of the Confederacy but to make the case that Lee saved the country by surrendering at the war＊s end rather than resorting to guerrilla tactics. ※Instead, [Lee] ordered the commander to tell his troops to go home, plant crops, and rebuild,§ Almon said in the email he sent to Dowd, adding that ※the protesters need to heed General Lee＊s advice and go back to the ghettos and do raise their children.§ Almon's email praises Lee's actions ending the Civil War but doesn't go into the divisive issue of slavery. ※You cannot be against General Lee and be for General Washington, there literally is no difference between the two men,§ Almon writes in the email, equating the actions taken by the nation＊s first president in leading the Revolutionary War to the actions of Lee. A source familiar with Dowd's actions says the lawyer was simply forwarding on an email and was not espousing the ideas that it contained. The source said that Dowd is now receiving ""hate calls"" and that the frenzy created over the email demonstrates how the political discourse has gone ""off the rails."" Almon describes himself as supportive of Trump's policies and said that the president was correct on Tuesday when he said there was blame on both sides for the violence in Charlottesville.

"President Donald Trump is headed back to the rustic presidential retreat Camp David, the site of many historic discussions and private meetings between presidents and foreign dignitaries. On Friday, the president will meet with his administration＊s national security team at Camp David, along with Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Vice President Mike Pence, who cut his week-long trip to Central and South America a day short to attend. The talks will focus on the president＊s strategy in Afghanistan and in South Asia, according to White House officials. Trump＊s return to Camp David marks his second trip to the retreat, after his first visit over Father＊s Day weekend with First Lady Melania Trump, their 11-year old son Barron and the first lady＊s parents. At the time, Trump tweeted, ※Camp David is a very special place. An honor to have spent the weekend there. Military runs it so well and are so proud of what they do!§  Camp David is a very special place. An honor to have spent the weekend there. Military runs it so well and are so proud of what they do!  Camp David, located in the Catoctin Mountain Park in Frederick County, Maryland, has played a prominent role in many presidential administrations, for both diplomatic meetings and personal vacations. The retreat is also an active military installation. Camp David is only a 30-minute helicopter ride from the White House. It is inaccessible to the public. History of the camp The camp was originally called Hi-Catoctin by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) prior to the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps transforming it into a military installation. WPA built the recreational area between 1936-1939 and federal employees used it for family camps. President Franklin Roosevelt first visited the camp in April 1942, after which it was chosen as the country location for presidential retreats. He renamed it ※Shangri-la,§ based on the fictional Himalayan paradise in James Milton＊s 1933 novel ※Lost Horizon.§ President Dwight Eisenhower renamed the site Camp David during his first visit in honor of his grandson, David. Eisenhower also named the main president＊s lounge ※Aspen§ in honor of the first lady, Mamie Eisenhower, who grew up in Colorado. The retreat boasts bedrooms, a small office, fireplaces, an outdoor flagstone patio, a heated swimming pool and a single golf hole with multiple tees.   How former presidents used the camp Roosevelt started the tradition of hosting foreign leaders at the camp by inviting Sir Winston Churchill in 1943 at the height of World War II to review plans for the Allied invasion of Normandy. Roosevelt was photographed fishing with Churchill at a creek near the camp, and Churchill remarked that ※no fish were caught§ but Roosevelt ※seemed to enjoy it very much, and was in great spirits§, according to Churchill＊s ※War Memoirs.§ Eisenhower visited the retreat frequently and added a bomb shelter, the golf course and several golf tees, as the Eisenhower archives note. Eisenhower was the first president to travel to Camp David from Washington, D.C., by helicopter, which greatly reduced the commute. He held meetings with his Cabinet and National Security Council at the retreat while recovering from a heart attack in 1955. In 1959, in the midst of the Cold War, Eisenhower hosted the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev was suspicious of the site, calling it initially where ※stray dogs went to die.§ They had two days of meetings about the Cold War, after which the two leaders released a joint statement agreeing to reopen talks. However, shortly after the Soviets shot down an American spy plane, Eisenhower＊s Soviet Union trip was scrapped. Foreign affairs brought Eisenhower back to Camp David again in 1961 when he met then-President John F. Kennedy to review the failed Bay of Pigs military invasion of Cuba.   In 1978, then-president Jimmy Carter hosted Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David. Their 13 days of meetings led to a peace agreement known as the Camp David Accords, a major step in curbing years of conflict between Egypt and Israel, according to the State Department＊s Office of the Historian. Sadat and Begin were both awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as a result of the agreement. In the midst of the energy crisis in 1979, Carter traveled to Camp David for a series of secret meetings over the course of ten days, according to the Carter Center. After leaving the camp, Carter delivered his famed ※malaise speech§ in which he discussed problems facing the country, including a ※crisis of confidence.§ ※I invited to Camp David people from almost every segment of our society -- business and labor, teachers and preachers, Governors, mayors, and private citizens,§ Carter said in the address. Former president Ronald Reagan hosted prominent foreign leaders including Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone at Camp David, according to Reagan＊s presidential library archives. Reagan reportedly loved the camp, and particularly enjoyed riding horses with his family at the retreat. In her memoir, ""My Turn,"" former first lady Nancy Reagan described how Camp David ※gave her a tremendous feeling of release§ and helped her and the president ※get their thoughts in order.§   In 1989, then-president George H.W. Bush invited Britain's Prince Charles to Camp David. In 1992, his daughter Dorothy married Bobby Koch at the retreat, the first wedding at the camp. Former president Bill Clinton attempted to broker a peace accord between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat at the retreat. The leaders stayed at the camp for more than a week in 2000, with Arafat and Barak both threatening to walk out on talks. Despite round the clock efforts, the summit ended without an agreement. Visiting Camp David 150 times in his two terms, former president George W. Bush hosted many foreign leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen.   Former president Barack Obama hosted the 38th G8 summit at Camp David in 2012 with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, former British Prime Minister David Cameron, former French President Francois Hollande and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at the camp, according to Obama＊s White House archives. During the summit, Obama discussed climate change and announced a new alliance on food security with African leaders. ※I think the surroundings gave us an opportunity to hold some intimate discussions and make some genuine progress,§ Obama said of the location in a statement. In 2015, Obama hosted the Gulf Cooperation Council summit at the retreat, welcoming leaders from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to discuss topics including Iran＊s nuclear activities and the Syrian chemical war, an archived statement read.

"President Donald Trump has yet to speak with the family of Heather Heyer, the woman killed in Saturday's violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, the White House said, despite his assurances on Tuesday that he would do so. Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters told reporters in New Jersey Thursday that the White House is working to identify a convenient time for the discussion between Trump and Heyer's family to take place. ""We appreciate the unifying words that Heather's mother spoke yesterday,"" Walters told reporters. ""We are working on identifying a time that is convenient for the family to speak with the president. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family. In the midst of a highly charged press conference Tuesday, Trump highlighted the fact that Heyer's mother, Susan Bro, had thanked him for saying something about her daughter publicly. ""Thank you, President Trump, for those words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred,"" Bro had said in a statement on Monday. Trump said Tuesday that a conversation with the family would be forthcoming. ""I will be reaching out, I'll be reaching out,"" he said. When a reporter followed up to ask when the call would take place, the president pivoted to talk instead about Bro and his remarks denouncing the ""hatred, bigotry and violence"" that occurred over the weekend.     ""I thought that the statement put out -- the mother's statement -- I thought was a beautiful statement,"" said Trump of Bro's comments. ""I＊ll tell you, it was something that I really appreciated. I thought it was terrific. And really, under the kind of stress that she＊s under, and the heartache she＊s under, I thought putting out that statement to me was really something I won't forget. Thank you all very much. Thank you."" Trump was criticized both for not specifically condemning hate groups on Saturday, and again during Tuesday's news conference when he reiterated that ""both sides"" were to blame for the violence in the central Virginia city. Trump has utilized social media in recent days to speak about Heyer and the two Virginia state police officers who died in a helicopter crash as they were assisting in response efforts related to the protests. Trump's most recent tweet was published ahead of Heyer's memorial service Wednesday. ""Memorial service today for beautiful and incredible Heather Heyer, a truly special young woman. She will be long remembered by all!"" he wrote.  Memorial service today for beautiful and incredible Heather Heyer, a truly special young woman. She will be long remembered by all!  On Saturday, he tweeted, ""Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!""  Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!  The White House has not commented on whether Trump has reached out to the families of the police officers who were killed in the helicopter crash or if he intends to.

"""Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that,"" a famous refrain from Martin Luther King Jr. reads. The United States is about to experience something it has not seen in nearly 100 years: a total solar eclipse stretching from coast to coast. As with the last total eclipse of the sun, the country is already experiencing dark times. It was June 8, 1918, when we in this country last saw this type of eclipse 〞 a moment when U.S. forces suffered 9,777 casualties on the western front of World War I in the horrific battle of Belleau Wood, as they pushed back a late German offensive. Little did those Marines know that, despite those massive losses, it would be only a few months until the Great War would finally end and light would shine again on our planet. As Madeleine L'Engle wrote, ""Maybe you have to know the darkness before you can appreciate the light."" But even her books, filled with beautiful words that touched many people, were banned for many years. Watching the tragic events of Charlottesville, Virginia, this past week and saddened by a president who abdicated any moral authority in the midst of it, I realize our country, while having the best of ideals and people, often experiences an eclipse of that light by dark moments in our history. Looking back over the expanse of our shared American experience, we see times of darkness 〞 oppression, wars, discrimination, riots and hate. To list just a few: slavery, Jim Crow, religious persecution, mistreatment of women and children, genocide of Native Americans, internment of Japanese-Americans, the Know-Nothing movement and the Civil War.       From my experience as an Irish Catholic from Detroit, I have seen evidence of these injustices. My ancestors felt discrimination because of their Irish heritage, the religion they practiced, and as a young child, I witnessed the devastation of the Detroit riots. We and our country do not have to be defined by our dark moments, but we must learn from them and continue on a path, as the Constitution says, to ""a more perfect union."" Though we should expect light to break through, even as good people, we will be part of some darkness. We each stumble and fall, and we each have our own biases. Often we choose fear over love and slip into division instead of unity. But we shall 〞 and we must 〞 overcome. We must also understand that our ideals and democracy are gifts; they are not a given. It takes good people reminding others, through both words and deeds, that we must move forward to reach the promised land of love and justice. The best of us was also revealed as we watched Charlottesville. Heather Heyer died fighting for justice and freedom. Her parents spoke to our hearts about forgiveness and calling us to that light even in the midst of their devastating sadness, the darkness of losing a child. And many good citizens stood up with candles of compassion, instead of torches of intolerance, as beacons on a dark night. CEOs stood up and said enough is enough. They spoke out against a president who doesn't seem to understand who we are as a country and what is most valuable in this experiment called America. At the same time, I was disappointed to see that not one member of President Trump's Evangelical Advisory Council resigned, even as his business councils disbanded after the resignation of several CEOs. It seems business leaders showed more of a moral compass than the religious leaders surrounding Trump. At the same time, I was heartened to see religious leaders outside this circle walk arm in arm against hate. The total eclipse will fade quickly next week, and we will enjoy the light our sun offers. We will also get through this moment and emerge with our wounds bandaged and the will to reform and heal our brokenness. I have faith that we will show a strong force of love to push out the hate. As Desmond Tutu said, ""Hope is being able to see that there is light in all the darkness."" Matthew Dowd is an ABC News analyst and special correspondent.

"President Trump this morning went after two Republican senators who criticized his comments about the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday. Trump tweeted earlier today, ※Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against§ Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is up for re-election in 2018, adding that he is ※a non-factor in Senate. He＊s toxic!§  Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake, who is WEAK on borders, crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic!  Trump and Flake have had a rocky relationship. Flake refused to vote for Trump in the presidential election, and earlier this year, Flake＊s book, ※Conscience of a Conservative,§ was published, which can be seen as a strong rebuke of Trump. Flake criticized the president's comments on Tuesday that white supremacists and counterprotesters were equally at fault for the violence in Charlottesville, where dozens of people were injured and Heather Heyer was killed when a driver rammed his car into a crowd of counterdemonstrators.  We can't accept excuses for white supremacy & acts of domestic terrorism. We must condemn. Period.   We can＊t claim to be the party of Lincoln if we equivocate in condemning white supremacy      John McCain, who has feuded with Trump and is the senior senator from Arizona, came to Flake's defense.  .@JeffFlake is a principled legislator & always does what's right for the people of #AZ.

On Wednesday, referring to Trump＊s remarks on Charlottesville, Graham said in a statement, ※Through his statements yesterday, President Trump took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally and people like Ms. Heyer. I, along with many others, do not endorse this moral equivalency.§ Trump wrote in a series of Twitter posts the next day, ※Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists and people like Ms. Heyer.§ ※Such a disgusting lie,§ Trump continued. ※[Graham] just can＊t forget his election trouncing.§  Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists......   ...and people like Ms. Heyer.

"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY      Pillars of corporate America have said they cannot work with the businessman president. It remains to be seen whether Republican lawmakers will agree they cannot either. Republicans have distanced themselves before from the words of this president, only to carry on the next day.

"Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, urged President Trump not to equivocate when addressing white nationalists and the protesters who opposed them, after the president blamed ""both sides"" for the violence that broke out in Charlottesville on Saturday. ""Hatch urged him to speak clearly and unequivocally on these issues, because even the appearance of tolerating hate and bigotry only divides us further,"" an aide to the senior Utah senator told ABC. Hatch, who initiated the call with the White House, also said he wants Trump to find opportunities to unify the nation ""and come together so we can grow from this."" Hatch, who has occasionally defended the president even when his fellow Republican senators decry his actions, also stressed that he wants to help Trump be successful in any way. Hatch issued a detailed statement Monday saying the nation ""has some soul-searching to do."" He also spoke about his brother who died fighting in World War II. ""I was just eight years old when my older brother Jesse was killed in World War II. As I said on Saturday, Jesse didn't give his life fighting Hitler for Nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home. I will never hesitate to speak out against hate -- whenever and wherever I see it."" A White House spokesperson did not respond to requests for their own readout of the call.

"Fallout from President Donald Trump's response to the Charlottesville, Virginia, violence Wednesday cost the White House two key economic advisory councils made up of the nation's top CEOs and business leaders. Trump announced via Twitter that he was ending both the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum, rather than ※put pressure§ on the leaders involved in both councils.  Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!  The development deals a major blow to the president's signature initiatives to create jobs, and to his claim of harnessing the best and brightest of America's business leaders to get it done. Just 24 hours earlier, as more business leaders stepped down from Trump＊s manufacturing council, the president remained bullish and said he had many candidates to replace those who had left.  For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!  But, on a conference call convened shortly after 11:30 a.m. ET, members of the president's Strategic and Policy Forum -- formed in December 2016 and loosely known as the ""CEO council"" -- agreed to disband amidst growing concerns following Trump's statements on Charlottesville in recent days, sources familiar with the call told ABC News. News of the move broke publicly around 12:50 pm ET. A source close to the forum said the panel had informed the White House of its decision to disband before 1 p.m. ET. Following Trump's press conference Tuesday, all the CEOs on the forum were invited to a mandatory phone call Tuesday night to discuss the panel＊s future, and the discussion led to many wanting to quit, according to sources familiar with the call. The group unanimously voted to end the panel then. The panel, chaired by Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, released a statement around 1.40 p.m. ET Wednesday on its decision. ※As our members have expressed individually over the past several days, intolerance, racism and violence have absolutely no place in this country and are an affront to core American values,§ the statement read. The forum, a bipartisan group of business leaders, stressed that they were ※called to serve [the U.S.] to ※provide independent feedback and perspectives directly to the President§ on economic growth and job creation in the U.S. ※We believe the debate over Forum participation has become a distraction from our well-intentioned and sincere desire to aid vital policy discussions on how to improve the lives of everyday Americans ... as Americans, we are all united in our desire to see our country succeed,§ the statement added. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a key member of the group whom Trump once called a ※good guy§ in 2012, sent a separate statement to employees, stating that he ※strongly disagreed with Trump＊s reaction to Charlottesville§ and that ※there is no room for equivocation here: The evil on display by these perpetrators of hate should be condemned.§ ※Constructive economic and regulatory policies are not enough and will not matter if we do not address the divisions in our country. It is a leader＊s role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart,§ Dimon added. Members had floated the idea of asking Trump to dissolve the panel weeks before Charlottesville, sources close to the call said. The panel's dismantlement didn't come as a surprise as many had voiced privately to each other their concerns to stay on board after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord on June 1 and announced a transgender military ban on July 26, sources close to the call said. Members felt pressure to step down from employees and customers, and were anxious about being regarded as supportive of the policies Trump had signed on due to their panel positions, according to the sources. The council had only met two times in the past eight months, and members felt they weren't achieving much. At the same time, the president＊s manufacturing council suffered a continuous stream of defections from CEOs and business leaders following Trump's remarks Saturday. Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison, 3M CEO Inge Thulin and GE CEO Jeff Immelt all abruptly resigned before noon ET today, joining six other members who had resigned in the wake of Trump＊s Charlottesville response. Morrison said she believes Trump ※should have been-and still needs to be-unambiguous§ on white supremacy in Saturday＊s violent rally. Merck＊s CEO Kenneth Frazier led the stream of resignations on Monday, saying in a statement that as a ""matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism."" The American Manufacturing Council has not yet issued a statement following the president＊s tweet Wednesday. However, more resignations came on the heels of Trump＊s ※blame on both sides§ comment Tuesday, when the president lashed out at Trump Tower, attacking the ""alt-left"" and saying that there were ※fine people§ among both the protesters and counterprotesters in Charlottesville.

"Vice President Mike Pence has slammed a report suggesting he is preparing for a possible 2020 run for the White House. In a written statement from Pence's office on Sunday, the vice president called ""allegations"" in?The New York Times report?-- about individuals in the Republican party starting what adds up to ""a shadow campaign"" -- ""categorically false,"" and said they represent ""the latest attempt by the media to divide"" the Trump administration. The Times reported on Saturday that ""in interviews with more than 75 Republicans at every level of the party, elected officials, donors and strategists expressed widespread uncertainty about whether Mr. Trump would be on the ballot in 2020 and little doubt that others in the party are engaged in barely veiled contingency planning."" It also outlined how Pence has taken actions that include establishing a political fund-raising committee and packing his already busy schedule with political-heavy events like acting as keynote speaker for at least eight Republican events since February and hosting private gatherings for party donors at his residence. The article ""is disgraceful and offensive to me, my family, and our entire team,"" Pence said. Pence also praised President Trump, saying ""we are rebuilding the military,"" that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is ""on the run,"" and that more than a million jobs have been created as the stock market hits all-time highs. ""The American people know that I could not be more honored to be working side by side with a president who is making America great again,"" Pence said. ""Whatever fake news may come our way, my entire team will continue to focus all our efforts to advance the President's agenda and see him re-elected in 2020. Any suggestion otherwise is both laughable and absurd,"" he added. Pence previously?established his own political action committee, the Great America Committee, in order to help raise money to get pro-Trump candidates elected. Mr. Trump's daughter and White House adviser Ivanka even stepped out for Pence's PAC, speaking at a fundraiser that raised upward of $1 million. Nick Ayers, Pence's chief strategist?told CBS News?that that any speculation that the PAC is anything more than a vehicle to help other candidates, pay for the vice president's political travel, and a ""legal necessity"" to ""all of Pence's political assets in an entity that he could use"" is just that: speculation. The report also mentioned potential interest in a 2020 run for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas.																																																																																																																					"
"Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and Ohio Governor John Kasich say the next step toward changing the Affordable Care Act -- after lawmakers failed to follow through on health care reform?-- should now include a bipartisan effort.? ""Let's get a bipartisan group of people together, and include some governors, who are the guys who have to- the people who have to implement these plans, and look at how do we stabilize private markets, how do we, you know, deal with these high-cost pools, and what's the best way,"" Democratic Gov. Hickenlooper said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.? ""There are some basic remedial steps that can improve our health care system without having to throw everything out the window,"" he added. Hickenlooper noted that Americans will be ""surprised"" at the number of senators willing to ""roll up our sleeves, and work on a bipartisan basis, and see how far we can go."" Kasich, who has been collaborating with Hickenlooper in recent weeks, echoed Hickenlooper's comments, saying that once lawmakers realize the system is ""melting down,"" he's hopeful Congress can put aside their philosophical differences and provide a bipartisan solution. ""I think there is a hunger in the Congress at least in the Senate to try to do what they went to do, which is to solve problems. And you can't solve immense, difficult problems without both sides,"" Kasich said on Sunday.? When asked what compromises both parties would likely be making in such a bipartisan effort, Kasich said Democrats may have to be willing to allow more choices in the insurance marketplace to help drive costs down, while Republicans will have to admit that ""there's going to be a group of people out there who are going to need help."" When asked for specific ways in which a revised policy could include a bipartisan solution on the issue of individual mandates, Hickenlooper said, ""The key here is to recognize that when you let healthy people not be part of the pool, you're going to concentrate people with serious health issues, so much more expensive insurance risks, into the market. And that's of course going to raise the cost for everyone."" He added, ""whether it's a mandate or a reinsurance type pool, that's where we can sit down."" Kasich said that while differences may persist in Washington, putting aside which party ""wins"" in the end could help ensure a successful outcome.? ""If you don't worry about which party gets the credit or which politician gets the credit, it can work,"" he said. ""Now, I can't guarantee you that Hickenlooper and I are going to agree on this, but I'm hopeful.""

"Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Sunday he is concerned that the U.S. remains ""vulnerable"" to election meddling, and that the cyber threat facing the U.S. is ""going to get worse before it gets better."" ""The Department of Homeland Security very much was on alert on Election Day and in the days leading up to it, along with the FBI. And we were very concerned,"" Johnson said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" He said that ""a number of vulnerabilities"" in election infrastructure were identified and addressed. ""But that process needs to continue,"" he said. ""I'm concerned that we are almost as vulnerable perhaps now as we were six, nine months ago."" ""Bad cyber actors are becoming more aggressive, more ingenious, and more tenacious,"" he added. ""And that's why we need a national campaign from the president, from the next secretary of Homeland Security to really address this problem. Nothing would surprise me at this point in terms of their capabilities."" Johnson said that back in October, while he was serving as Homeland Security secretary, a statement that the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued declaring that Russia intended to interfere with the U.S. election was not given the level of media attention he and others expected -- and that it deserved. ""I think that in the heat of the campaign, there were a lot of things going on, a lot of charges back and forth,"" he said. ""We thought it was critical that the American voter and the American people know that there was a superpower attempting to put his thumb on the scale of our American elections before the elections occurred, so that the American people could know what was behind a lot of the activity that we were seeing. There's still, however, a threat out there to our election infrastructure that this administration needs to address."" When asked about cyber threats directed at President Trump's national security adviser H.R. McMaster calling for his termination from the White House, Johnson said he was ""certainly suspicious"" of a concerted effort directed at McMaster. The New York Times reported that many critics on the right were angered by McMaster's move to push out several conservative staff members on the national security team who had been brought on by Michael Flynn, McMaster's predecessor. The hashtag #FireMcMaster has been tweeted more than 50,000 times since Wednesday, the Times reported, including by accounts linked to Russian cyber operations. Looking ahead, as Mr. Trump now faces a vacancy at DHS left by his current chief of staff Gen. John Kelly, Johnson said the administration should look for ""a national champion and a national spokesperson when it comes to cybersecurity."" ""DHS is charged with the cybersecurity mission and cybersecurity has become, in my judgment, the other cornerstone of the department's missions, along with counterterrorism,"" he said. ""So we need someone to champion and drive cybersecurity policy for the government, and we need to continue to focus on countering violent extremism here in the United States."" When asked how he feels Kelly will do as chief of staff, Johnson said that based on his first five days in the position, ""so far so good."" ""John is a Marine. And he is dedicated to his commander in chief's mission, whatever that mission may be. I don't believe John is a political animal, he accepts the mission and he follows it and will do it energetically,"" Johnson said.

"Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said Sunday he does not see two bills that seek to stop President Trump from firing special counsel Robert Mueller ""going very far."" ""Congress is a co-equal branch of government. And in my opinion, for decades, Congress has ceded too much authority to the executive branch,"" Cotton said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" ""And we should exercise our constitutional responsibilities seriously and with vigor."" ? ""The independent counsel statute in the 1970s and '80s and '90s was a disaster,"" he said. ""We have an executive branch in which the power of all the departments and all the agencies reports to the single elected member of the president."" Cotton's comments come amid a clear sign that Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is ramping up: Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington, D.C., as part of the probe. Senator Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, discusses Russia's habit of interference, the plan for Afghanistan, and the proposed legislation to protect Speci... The investigation now includes Russian interference in the election, hacking by Russian operatives, influence campaigns and possible financial wrongdoing, according to individuals familiar with the matter. It is unclear whether Mueller has empaneled a new grand jury or is using an existing one. A grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, was previously used in the FBI's investigation into Flynn's activities. That probe has been taken over by Mueller's team. ? When asked Sunday about Russia's continuing influence on the United States, particularly after reports of Mr. Trump's national security adviser being targeted by pro-Russian efforts to undermine his White House role, Cotton said, ""it should come as no surprise that Russia continues its effort to manipulate Western democracies in a way to sow discord and disagreements"" within the U.S. Cotton noted that there are steps the administration should be taking to safeguard against Russian influence, including providing defensive weaponry to Ukraine.? ""I encourage the president and the administration to take a look at those steps. I know they are doing so through deliberate, careful National Security Council meetings,"" Cotton added.?

"A week after an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he'd consider a bipartisan effort to continue payments to insurers to avert a costly rattling of health insurance markets. McConnell told reporters Saturday there is ""still a chance"" the Senate could revive the measure to repeal and replace ""Obamacare,"" but he acknowledged the window for that is rapidly closing. The Kentucky senator noted Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is working on ""some kind of bipartisan approach"" that would involve subsidies for insurance companies. Last last month, President Trump tweeted: ""If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!"" If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon! The ""bailouts,"" as Mr. Trump called them, are government payments that allow insurers to compensate for providing lower-deductible plans to low and middle income enrollees. The payments are slated to cost the government $7 billion this fiscal year and $10 billion in 2018. Withdrawing that support, however, could have a ripple effect through the health care economy.? Experts said in a health care conference call last week that slashing funding would likely hurt consumers who buy their insurance through the ACA exchanges, as well as throw the marketplace into greater turmoil.? ""It's important to lay out the consequences of not paying these payments, because they're not what the president thinks they are,"" said Andy Slavitt, the former director of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.? He added, ""This is money that goes directly to low-income individuals. If you lay out the fact they're not paid, you'd like to think that would have an impact on the White House's thinking.""

"MANILA, Philippines --?Hours after the United Nations Security Council voted to adopt fresh sanctions against North Korea, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attended a meeting of Southeast Asian countries and their partners Sunday -- and discussions of the regime's destabilizing nuclear and missile activity were front and center. Tillerson called the new U.N. sanctions a ""good outcome"" as he embarked on his first day at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ministerial meeting. While his North Korean counterpart is in attendance, Tillerson will not meet with him during the summit, according to a U.S. State Department official. The sanctions, the strongest U.N. action taken against the regime in a decade, are in retaliation for the regime's two intercontinental ballistic missile?tests in July. North Korea is now banned from exporting all iron, lead and seafood. The U.N. says the measures will cost North Korea over $1 billion a year in hard currency. In a rare vote, both Russia and China backed the sanctions, allowing for their passage. President Trump commended the sanctions and singled out Russia and China, saying he appreciates their ""cooperation in securing passage of this resolution."" Susan Thornton, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia who is traveling with Tillerson in Manila, described the Chinese as ""helpful and instrumental"" in drafting the U.N. sanctions. This is a ""good step"" that shows the Chinese are serious and recognize the gravity, she said.? The United States is trying to put more pressure on North Korea after the regime's second successful ballistic missile test. It responded to Frid... Recent tensions between the U.S. and China, however, have emerged as the U.S. has pushed the Asian powerhouse to do more when it comes to North Korea and China has come up empty-handed.? ""I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet... they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!"" Mr. Trump tweeted last week.? On Sunday, however, China urged North Korea to stop its nuclear and missile tests. The U.S. embraced the cooperation, although the threat of the U.S. taking unilateral action against Chinese entities remains on the table. ""We want to make sure that China is continuing to implement fully the sanctions regime and that it is a working actively to continue putting pressure on North Korea and not just kind of episodic back and forth that we have seen,"" Thornton said. ""If we see that they are not being implemented then we will again continue to go after those entities ourselves."" Thornton called it ""fortuitous"" that all of these countries are meeting just after the U.N. has passed sanctions. The U.S. had been pushing to eject North Korea from the meetings, but that did not happen. Still, the U.S. is pushing for this action in the future. On the sidelines of Tillerson's first day at the conference, he met with counterparts from China, Russia, South Korea and Myanmar. Before meeting with Tillerson, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi also had a bilateral meeting with his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho. ""We had an intensive conversation, China urges North Korea to remain calm in dealing with the recent decision given by the U.N. Security Council,"" the Chinese minister said. He warned the country not to ""provoke the international society's goodwill"" with a missile launch or nuclear test. Wang said the purpose of the sanctions is to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. Yet, the U.S. still says the time is not right for talks, and rejects the Chinese and North Korean-backed freeze-for-freeze proposal. The agreement, allegedly one that would bring North Korea to the table, would halt North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile tests and require the U.S. to halt its military exercises with South Korea. Earlier in the week, Tillerson, once again, spoke about the administration's aspiration to sit down with North Korea. But preconditions remain. ""We're trying to convey to the North Koreans we are not your enemy, we are not your threat, but you are presenting an unacceptable threat to us, and we have to respond,"" Tillerson said. ""We would like to sit and have a dialogue with them about the future that will give them the security they seek and the future economic prosperity for North Korea, but that will then promote economic prosperity throughout Northeast Asia."" Reports that North Korea's latest missile test came dangerously close to an Air France jet are raising new concerns about the safety of passenger... North Korea's delegation in Manila has not commented on the new sanctions. Before the U.N.'s adoption of the sanctions resolution, however, a North Korean newspaper said that sanctions or nuclear action would lead to a ""sea of fire,"" according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency. ""The day the U.S. dares tease our nation with a nuclear rod and sanctions, the mainland U.S. will be catapulted into an unimaginable sea of fire,"" it wrote. ""The more the Trump gang strives to break out of today's quagmire, the more our military and people get aroused, giving more reasons for the (North Korean) republic to own nuclear weapons.""? The U.S. has not responded to those words. There are also other topics expected to be addressed at the ASEAN conference, including intensified terror threats in the region and the dispute over the South China Sea. In his opening remarks at the conference, Tillerson did not reference North Korea by name. Instead, he sought to solidify U.S. commitment to the region as a whole, in referencing areas of mutual security and economic interests. The State Department asserts that U.S. remains engaged in the South China Sea dispute and is actively supporting the diplomatic process. Thornton said that the U.S. advocates for players in the region to halt activity, including the militarizing of outposts, in an effort to keep diplomacy's wheels churning. The U.S. is also actively engaged in combating growing terror threats in the region, namely in the southern Philippines. It is expected to be a topic of conversation when Tillerson meets with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday. On Sunday, Tillerson made a morning visit to the American Cemetery and Memorial in Manila where he took a tour of the grounds and jotted a note in the guestbook.? ""Let us never forget - FREEDOM,"" he wrote.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 6, 2017 11:49 AM EDT Summer vacation has hit Washington. Politicians getting out of town have to be careful though, not to look like they're enjoying themselves too much. The White House, which treats the president's golf outings like a state secret, wouldn't say what the president did yesterday, but thanks to social media, we found out soon enough. The President took a break from golfing to tweet out that his 17 days out of Washington are not a vacation. This is one instance where the President parts ways with Vladimir Putin. The Russian president this week was baring his chest, engaging in lionhearted struggles with fish and generally manspreading across Siberia. Congress is gone until after Labor Day. They had promised to stay until they passed health care legislation, but left when they failed. Some might be outraged: Why should Congress get a month off when they don't do their work? Maybe that's backwards. An old theory holds that air conditioning ruined Congress. Members no longer had to flee the Washington heat to spend the summer back home. The long vacation forced them to bond with their constituents. That's harder to do now because it's harder to hear constituents through all the manufactured outrage fed by partisan pundits, fundraising built on alarming people and apocalyptic social media. The bubble now travels back home with members. But if Congress stayed home?longer, members might have time to run into the people who aren't permanently aggrieved. The silent majority who simply want results, are fine with honest compromise and would like to stop being made anxious by the partisan-outrage-complex. So Congress should stay home as long as it takes＃.to get fortified with that spirit of public service that sent many of them to Washington in the first place. Once they return, it'll help them fight the heat. Back in a moment.																																																																																																																					"
"Here is a transcript of the question-and-answer portion of President Donald Trump's press conference on Tuesday, Aug. 15, at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The press conference itself was focused on infrastructure reforms he plans to make, and then he invited questions. TRUMP: If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. Q Mr. President, why do you think these CEOs are leaving your manufacturing council? TRUMP: Because they're not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country. And we want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you're talking about they＊re outside of the country, they're having a lot of their product made outside. If you look at Merck as an example, take a look where -- excuse me, excuse me -- take a look at where their product is made. It's made outside of our country. We want products made in the country. Now, I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they're leaving out of embarrassment because they make their products outside. And I've been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you're referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country. You can't do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places. You have to bring this work back to this country. That's what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit. Q Let me ask you, Mr. President, why did you wait so long to blast neo-Nazis? TRUMP: I didn＊t wait long. I didn＊t wait long Q You waited two days -- TRUMP: I didn＊t wait long. Q Forty-eight hours. Q (Inaudible) Why do Nazis like you? TRUMP: I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct -- not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement. But you don＊t make statements that direct unless you know the facts. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don＊t know the facts. And it's a very, very important process to me, and it's a very important statement. So I don＊t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to -- Q So you had to (inaudible) white supremacists? TRUMP: In fact, I brought it. I brought it. I brought it. Q (Inaudible) TRUMP: As I said on -- remember this, Saturday -- ※We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America.§ And then it went on from there. Now, here's the thing -- Q (Inaudible) many sides. TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me. Take it nice and easy. Here's the thing: When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didn＊t even happen yet, as we were speaking. This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts. So I don＊t want to rush into a statement. So making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman, who I hear is a fantastic young woman, and it was on NBC -- her mother wrote me and said through, I guess, Twitter, social media, the nicest things. And I very much appreciated that. I hear she was a fine -- really, actually, an incredible young woman. But her mother, on Twitter, thanked me for what I said. And honestly, if the press were not fake, and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. But unlike you, and unlike -- excuse me, unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts. Q Why do Nazis like you -- (inaudible) -- these statements? TRUMP: They don＊t. They don＊t. They don＊t. (Cross-talk.) TRUMP: How about a couple of infrastructure questions. Q Was it terrorism, that event? Was that terrorism? Q The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity -- TRUMP: Say it. What? Q The CEO of Walmart said you missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together. Did you? TRUMP: Not at all. I think the country -- look, you take a look. I've created over a million jobs since I'm President. The country is booming. The stock market is setting records. We have the highest employment numbers we've ever had in the history of our country. We're doing record business. We have the highest levels of enthusiasm. So the head of Walmart, who I know -- who's a very nice guy -- was making a political statement. I mean -- Q (Inaudible.) TRUMP: I'd do it the same way. And you know why? Because I want to make sure, when I make a statement, that the statement is correct. And there was no way -- there was no way of making a correct statement that early. I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters. Unlike a lot of reporters -- Q David Duke was there. TRUMP: I didn＊t know David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts. And the facts, as they started coming out, were very well stated. In fact, everybody said, ""His statement was beautiful. If he would have made it sooner, that would have been good."" I couldn＊t have made it sooner because I didn＊t know all of the facts. Frankly, people still don＊t know all of the facts. It was very important -- excuse me, excuse me -- it was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly. Because if I would have made a fast statement -- and the first statement was made without knowing much, other than what we were seeing. The second statement was made after, with knowledge, with great knowledge. There are still things -- excuse me -- there are still things that people don＊t know. I want to make a statement with knowledge. I wanted to know the facts. Q Two questions. Was this terrorism? And can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist, Stephen Bannon? TRUMP: Well, I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family, and this country. And that is -- you can call it terrorism. You can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as ""the fastest one to come up with a good verdict."" That's what I'd call it. Because there is a question: Is it murder? Is it terrorism? And then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer. And what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing. Q Can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon? Can you talk about that? TRUMP: Go ahead. Q I would echo Maggie's question. Steve Bannon has come under -- TRUMP: I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it. Q Can you tell us broadly what your -- do you still have confidence in Steve? TRUMP: Well, we'll see. Look, look -- I like Mr. Bannon. He's a friend of mine. But Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that. And I like him, he's a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that. He's a good person. He actually gets very unfair press in that regard. But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon. But he's a good person, and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly. Q Senator McCain has called on you to defend your National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, against these attacks. TRUMP: I＊ve already done that. I did it the last time. Q And he called on it again, linking -- TRUMP: Senator McCain? Q -- to the alt-right, and saying -- TRUMP: Senator McCain? Q Yes. TRUMP: Senator McCain? You mean the one who voted against Obamacare? Q And he said -- TRUMP: Who is -- you mean Senator McCain who voted against us getting good healthcare? Q Senator McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those who perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville. TRUMP: Well, I don＊t know. I can't tell you. I'm sure Senator McCain must know what he's talking about. But when you say the alt-right, define alt-right to me. You define it. Go ahead. Q Well, I'm saying, as Senator -- TRUMP: No, define it for me. Come on, let's go. Define it for me. Q Senator McCain defined them as the same group -- TRUMP: Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging at 'em -- excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? Let me ask you this: What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. As far as I'm concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day. Q (Inaudible) TRUMP: Wait a minute. I'm not finished. I'm not finished, fake news. That was a horrible day -- Q Sir, you're not putting these protestors on the same level as neo-Nazis -- Q Is the alt-left as bad as white supremacy? TRUMP: I will tell you something. I watched those very closely -- much more closely than you people watched it. And you have -- you had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now. You had a group -- you had a group on the other side that came charging in, without a permit, and they were very, very violent. Q (Inaudible) TRUMP: Go ahead. Q Do you think that what you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis? TRUMP: Those people -- all of those people --excuse me, I've condemned neo-Nazis. I've condemned many different groups. But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee. Q Should that statue be taken down? TRUMP: Excuse me. If you take a look at some of the groups, and you see -- and you'd know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases you're not -- but many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So this week it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop? But they were there to protest -- excuse me, if you take a look, the night before they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. Infrastructure question. Go ahead. Q Should the statues of Robert E. Lee stay up? TRUMP: I would say that's up to a local town, community, or the federal government, depending on where it is located. Q How concerned are you about race relations in America? And do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office? TRUMP: I think they've gotten better or the same. Look, they've been frayed for a long time. And you can ask President Obama about that, because he'd make speeches about it. But I believe that the fact that I brought in -- it will be soon -- millions of jobs -- you see where companies are moving back into our country -- I think that's going to have a tremendous, positive impact on race relations. We have companies coming back into our country. We have two car companies that just announced. We have Foxconn in Wisconsin just announced. We have many companies, I say, pouring back into the country. I think that's going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations. You know why? It's jobs. What people want now, they want jobs. They want great jobs with good pay, and when they have that, you watch how race relations will be. And I＊ll tell you, we＊re spending a lot of money on the inner cities. We＊re gonna fix- we＊re fixing the inner cities. We＊re doing far more than anybody has done with respect to the inner cities. It＊s a priority for me, and it＊s very important. Q Mr. President, are you putting what you＊re calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane? TRUMP: I＊m not putting anybody on a moral plane. What I＊m saying is this: You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs -- and it was vicious and it was horrible. And it was a horrible thing to watch. But there is another side. There was a group on this side. You can call them the left 每 you＊ve just called them the left -- that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that＊s the way it is. Q (Inaudible) both sides, sir. You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides. Are the -- TRUMP: Well I do think there＊s blame. Yes, I think there＊s blame on both sides. If you look at-- If you look at both sides -- I think there＊s blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it, and you don＊t have any doubt about it either. And if you reported it accurately, you would say. Q The neo-Nazis started this. They showed up in Charlottesville to protest -- TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. They didn＊t put themselves -- and you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. You had people in that group. Q (Inaudible.) TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. Q George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same. TRUMP: Well know, George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down -- Excuse me, are we going to take down- are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Q I do love Thomas Jefferson. TRUMP: Okay, good. Are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner. Now, are we going to take down his statue? So you know what, it＊s fine. You＊re changing history. You＊re changing culture. And you had people -- and I＊m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists -- because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. Okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people. But you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats. You had a lot of bad people in the other group. Q Who are the good people? Q Sir, I just didn＊t understand what you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly? I just don＊t understand what you were saying. TRUMP: No, no. There were people in that rally -- and I looked the night before -- if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. I＊m sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people -- neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest -- because you know, I don＊t know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn＊t have a permit. So I only tell you this: There are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country -- a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country. Does anybody have a final -- Q I have an infrastructure question. TRUMP: You have an infrastructure -- Q What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill? You didn＊t get healthcare -- TRUMP: Well, you know, I＊ll tell you. We came very close with healthcare. Unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute. You＊ll have to ask John McCain why he did that. But we came very close to healthcare. We will end up getting healthcare. But we＊ll get the infrastructure. And actually, infrastructure is something that I think we＊ll have bipartisan support on. I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure. Q Mr. President, have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car attack? TRUMP: No, I＊ll be reaching out. I＊ll be reaching out. Q When will you be reaching out? TRUMP: I was very -- I thought that the statement put out -- the mother＊s statement I thought was a beautiful statement. I will tell you, it was something that I really appreciated. I thought it was terrific. And, really, under the kind of stress that she＊s under and the heartache that she＊s under, I thought putting out that statement, to me, was really something. I won＊t forget it. Thank you, all, very much. Thank you. Thank you. [Trump walks away from the lectern.] Q Will you go to Charlottesville? Will you go to check out what happened? TRUMP: I own a house in Charlottesville. Does anyone know I own a house in Charlottesville? Q Where is it? TRUMP: Oh boy, it＊s going to be -- Q Where is it? TRUMP: It's in Charlottesville. You'll see. Q Is it a winery or something? TRUMP: It is the winery. I mean, I know a lot about Charlottesville. Charlottesville is a great place that's been very badly hurt over the last couple of days. Q (Inaudible.) TRUMP: I own, actually, one of the largest wineries in the United States. It's in Charlottesville. Q Do you believe your words are helping to heal this country right now? Q What do you think needs to be done to overcome the racial divides in this country? TRUMP: Well, I think jobs can have a big impact. I think if we continue to create jobs -- over a million, substantially more than a million. And you see just the other day, the car companies coming in with Foxconn. I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I＊m creating jobs, I think that＊s going to have a tremendous impact -- positive impact on race relations. Q Your remarks today, how do you think that will impact the racial, sort of conflict, today? TRUMP: The people are going to be working, they＊re going to be making a lot of money -- much more money than they ever thought possible. But that＊s going to happen. Q Your remarks today. TRUMP: And the other thing -- very important -- I believe wages will start going up. They haven＊t gone up for a long time. I believe wages now -- because the economy is doing so well with respect to employment and unemployment, I believe wages will start to go up. I think that will have a tremendously positive impact on race relations. END 4:21 P.M.

"Vice President Mike Pence declined Wednesday to defend President Trump＊s controversial comments casting ※blame on both sides§ of the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville over the weekend. ※What happened in Charlottesville was a tragedy,§ Pence said in Santiago, Chile. ※The president has been clear on that tragedy and so have I.§ Pence did not directly answer questions about whether he agrees with Trump＊s comments that there were ※very fine people on both sides§ of the clashes in Charlottesville between white supremacists and counter-protesters.     ※I spoke at length about this heartbreaking situation on Sunday night in Colombia,§ Pence said in the midst of his trip through South America. ※I stand with the president, and I stand by those words. In Cartagena, Colombia on Sunday Pence condemned white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. ※These dangerous fringe groups have no place in America public life or the public debate, and we condemn them in the strongest terms,§ Pence said Sunday after the violence in Virginia. On Wednesday, he also ignored questions about Trump＊s comments about the statues of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. The white supremacist rally was initially prompted by plans to remove a statue of Lee in Charlottesville. ""George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status?§ Trump asked reporters yesterday. ""Are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson?§ Speaking after a meeting with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, Pence acknowledged the memorial service for Heather Heyer -- the young woman killed Saturday by a car driven by a Nazi sympathizer that plowed into counter-protestors in Charlottesville. ※Today, while I am here in Chile, our hearts are in Charlottesville,§ he said. ※We've been praying for God＊s peace and comfort for her family and her friends and her loved ones.§ ※We're also praying that in America, that we will not allow the few to divide the many,§ he said.

"At Tuesday's combative press conference in Trump Tower, President Donald Trump questioned the removal of statues of Confederate leaders, but at the start of his presidential campaign, Trump publicly expressed his approval of South Carolina's decision to remove the Confederate battle flag from the State Capitol. ※I would take it down, yes,§ said Trump in June 2015 at his first news conference following the declaration of his presidential candidacy. ※I think they should put it in the museum... respect whatever it is you have to respect because it was a point in time.§ The long-running debate over whether the Confederate flag should be flown over the South Carolina State House arose again after nine people were fatally shot in the historically black Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in a racially charged killing.     Then-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who is now serving in Trump＊s Cabinet as the United States＊ ambassador to the United Nations, ultimately decided to order the removal of the flag on July 9, 2015. Trump argued Tuesday that taking down the statue of Robert E. Lee, a civil war general who fought to keep slavery intact, would be ※changing history.§ A protest of the monument's removal spurred the white nationalist rally that ultimately turned violent Saturday. ※You＊re changing culture,§ Trump said during the news conference at Trump Tower Tuesday. Asked whether statues of Lee should remain in place in the U.S., the president said the situation was one that should be handled on a case-by-case basis, depending on the location of the monument. ""I would say that's up to a local town, community, or the federal government, depending on where it is located,"" he said. Trump then characterized removing Confederate memorials as a slippery slope, equating Lee to American Founding Fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who both owned slaves. ※George Washington was a slave owner＃. So will George Washington now lose his status? ... Are we going to take down statues to George Washington?§ Trump wondered. ※How about Thomas Jefferson?§ Trump asked. ※... Because he was a major slave owner. Now, are we going to take down his statue?§ Trump later added, ※So, this week it＊s Robert E. Lee, I notice that Stonewall Jackson is coming down, I wonder is it George Washington next week? Is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You have to ask yourself, where does it stop?§																																																																																																																					"
"President Trump ripped open racial wounds, caused members of his own party to recoil and seemed to give cover to white extremists Tuesday when he doubled-down on his initial comments about the violence ""on many sides"" in Charlottesville, Virginia. By placing blame on both the white nationalists and counterprotesters, he once again isolated himself from his party and made clear he cannot stomach any insinuation that he made a mistake in his response to the violence. Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump and Vice President Mike Pence felt compelled to speak out after seeing pictures of white nationalists carrying torches and chanting slogans like ※Jews will not replace us.§ The president, by his own admission, was not convinced by what he saw. On Monday he read a statement condemning neo-Nazis, white supremacists and the KKK by name, but by Tuesday he felt it was important to give voice to the ※fine people§ in the crowds on both sides. The fact is many people protesting the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue over the weekend were self-proclaimed white nationalists and arrived with symbols of mass murder, racial violence and oppression in hand. Those who didn＊t stood next to those who did.       Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel broke with the president today, saying on ※Good Morning America§: ※I do think people may have showed up in Charlottesville thinking, 'Hey, this is going to be a discussion about whether we remove historic statues.' The second they saw Nazi flags, they should have turned tail.§ McDaniel added, ※We have no place in our party at all for KKK, anti-Semitism, racism, bigotry. It has no place in the Republican Party. There is no home here. We don't want your vote. We don't support you. We'll speak out against you.§ This is the kind of firm rebuke that the president has yet to deliver. Politicians tend to speak out either because they think it is right or it is in their own self-interest. While the president condemned neo-Nazis and the KKK, he stopped short of telling them he did not want their support. Instead, he echoed many of the lines used by white nationalists over the weekend. ""So this week it＊s Robert E. Lee, I noticed that Stonewall Jackson＊s coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after. You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?"" Trump told reporters Tuesday from Trump Tower. ""You＊re changing history, you＊re changing culture."" The president will continue to face questions about whether he wants and enjoys the support of white nationalists or believes he needs their help to win down the road. And despite McDaniel＊s comments today, Republicans will undoubtedly be asked whether the president has given implicit acceptance or encouragement of these groups and if they rode the coattails of that in the last election. White nationalists and organized white supremacy hate groups continue to be very specific about backing this president, and his past behavior suggests he often prioritizes loyalty to him above almost anything else. Perhaps that is in fact driving some of his decision making here. Either way, the last few days could make it even harder for him to work with congress this fall. Will he hold a grudge against those Republicans who said plainly that his words fell short? That said, how will voters react to the many Republicans yesterday who made a point of calling out racism, but skirted the president in their statements? The businessman president who ran on bringing his CEO sensibilities and partnerships to Washington is losing loyalty from corporate America fast. He repeatedly said yesterday that he will soothe race relations in America by bringing jobs and raising wages, another remark that will surely ring tone deaf to many Americans.

"After several business leaders announced their resignations from the White House's American Manufacturing Council in recent days, President Donald Trump announced he was ending the panel Wednesday, along with the separate Strategic and Policy Forum. ""Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both,"" wrote Trump on Twitter. ""Thank you all!""  Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!  Eight members of the American Manufacturing Council dropped from the panel following Trump's response to last weekend's violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. A ninth, Greg Hayes of United Technologies, announced his resignation just minutes after the president's tweet. On Saturday, Trump received widespread criticism over his perceived weak response to a white nationalist rally in the central Virginia city which resulted in the death of a counter-protester struck by a vehicle. The president repeated sentiments Tuesday that he first expressed over the weekend when he said at a Trump Tower press conference that there was ""blame"" ""on both sides"" of Saturday's protests.     The American Manufacturing Council was established in January and featured 28 members at its start. Tesla CEO Elon Musk left the group in June in response to Trump's decision to remove the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, the most recent resignation of a sitting CEO prior to that of Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of Merck who was the first to drop out this week. The Strategic and Policy Forum, an additional group of business people advising the president, was considering disbanding prior to Trump's announcement, according to a report by The New York Times. The newspaper reported that several members spoke via conference call Wednesday morning to discuss the panel's future, a conversation rendered moot by the president's tweet. In a joint statement, members of the Strategic and Policy Forum appeared to cast the decision to disband as a mutual one. ""As our members have expressed individually over the past several days, intolerance, racism and violence have absolutely no place in this country and are an affront to core American values,"" the statement reads in part. ""... We believe the debate over Forum participation has become a distraction from our well-intentioned and sincere desire to aid vital policy discussions on how to improve the lives of everyday Americans. As such, the President and we are disbanding the Forum."" Trump was defiant in the wake of the resignations from the manufacturing council Tuesday, writing on Twitter that ""for every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place,"" and labeling those who had departed -- numbering four at the time -- ""grandstanders.""  For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!  In addition to Frazier and Hayes, the leaders to announce their resignations from the manufacturing council this week prior to Trump's announcement were: Kevin Plank of Under Armour, Brian Krzanich of Intel, Scott Paul of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, Richard Trumka and Thea Lee of the AFL-CIO, Inge Thulin of 3M and Denise Morrison of the Campbell Soup Company.

"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made a ""very wise and well reasoned decision"" to delay any military action against the United States and back away from his threat to strike near the U.S. territory of Guam, President Donald Trump said today. ""The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!"" President Trump wrote on Twitter.  Kim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!  According to North Korean state news agency KCNA, Kim was briefed on his country's plan to launch a missile toward Guam, the Pacific island that is home to several U.S. military bases.     Kim appeared to put the threat on pause in the KCNA report. ""Dear Supreme Leader will watch such stupid American behavior for a bit longer,"" a KCNA statement read, according to a translation from South Korean news agency Yonhap. During Tuesday's State Department briefing, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said North Korea＊s simply saying it won't fire toward Guam would not be enough to bring the United States back to the negotiating table. ""They know what they need to do,"" she said. ""We would like to have talks with him when the time is right, when they show they're serious, serious about an effort to move to denuclearization. We have not seen that yet."" North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile last month 每 the second launch of an ICBM in its history 每 leading the United States to enforce new economic sanctions against Kim and his regime. Angered over the sanctions, North Korea said on Aug. 7 it would take a ※thousands-fold§ revenge against the United States. The following day, President Trump warned North Korea to stop threatening the United States or else ※they will be met with fire and fury.§ In response to Trump＊s comments, North Korea announced that it would launch four intermediate ballistic missiles near Guam by mid-August. Trump tweeted last Thursday that U.S. military solutions are ※locked and loaded§ and told reporters perhaps his ※fire and fury§ warning ※wasn＊t tough enough.§ ABC News' Erin Dooley contributed to this report.

"One of the FBI's top investigators, tapped by special counsel Robert Mueller just weeks ago to help lead the probe of Russian meddling in last year's presidential election, has left Mueller's team, sources tell ABC News. The recent departure of the FBI veteran, Peter Strzok, is the first known hitch in a secretive probe that, by all public accounts, is charging full steam ahead. Just last week, news surfaced that Mueller's team had executed a search warrant at the Virginia home of Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort. And the week before that, ABC News confirmed that Mueller is now using a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., to collect documents and other evidence.   It's unclear why Strzok stepped away from Mueller's team of nearly two dozen lawyers, investigators and administrative staffers. Strzok, who has spent much of his law enforcement career working counterintelligence cases and has been unanimously praised by government officials who spoke with ABC News, is now working for the FBI's human resources division. He is no stranger to complex and controversial investigations. As chief of the FBI's counterespionage section last year, he helped oversee the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server when she was the secretary of state, and he took part in the bureau's interview of her. Within weeks of the end of the Clinton probe, Strzok found his office facing a new challenge: investigating Russia's alleged efforts to influence last year's presidential election, including hacking of Democratic National Committee computers. A spokesman for the special counsel's office declined to comment.																																																																																																																					"
"Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush released a joint statement today in response to racial tensions sparked by the violence this weekend during protests over a Confederate monument in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism and hatred in all forms,"" the statement, released Wednesday, said. ""As we pray for Charlottesville, we are reminded of the fundamental truths recorded by that city's most prominent citizen in the Declaration of Independence: We are all created equal and endowed by our creator with unalienable rights,"" the statement continued. ""We know these truths to be everlasting because we have seen the decency and greatness of our country."" The Bushes are the only living former presidents who are Republicans.     Democratic former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama posted statements on Twitter on Saturday, Aug. 12, when much of the violence took place. Clinton tweeted first, writing, ""Even as we protect free speech and assembly, we must condemn hatred, violence and white supremacy. #Charlottesville.""  Even as we protect free speech and assembly, we must condemn hatred, violence and white supremacy. #Charlottesville  Obama shared a quote from Nelson Mandela over the course of three tweets, the first of which is now the most liked tweet in the history of Twitter. ""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite,"" the quote reads.

"Two congressmen are demanding answers from the government officials charged with oversight of U.S. Customs and Border Protection after an ABC News investigation that shed light on a tragic 2013 episode at the U.S.-Mexico border. Government surveillance video obtained by ABC News shows two Customs and Border Protection officers appeared to encourage 〞 or at least permit 〞 a 16-year-old Mexican high school student named Cruz Velazquez to drink from a bottle that tests later revealed contained concentrated liquid methamphetamine. He died shortly afterward from acute methamphetamine intoxication. In an Aug. 2 letter addressed to the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Rep. Juan Vargas, D-Calif., whose district includes the border crossing where the episode occurred, and Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., called the officers＊ actions ※appalling§ and advocated for legislation that would rein in the agency. ※This incident is incredibly troubling and could have been prevented,§ they wrote. ※It also emphasizes the need for CBP and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] body cameras, as well as proper officer vetting and training. The officer＊s actions toward this teenage boy are entirely deplorable and unprofessional.§ Vargas and Espaillat asked for a ※detailed response§ to 11 questions concerning the agency＊s policies and protocols for testing suspicious substances. ※As congressional representatives, it is our duty to inquire about this incident and ensure that the matter is properly addressed in order to avoid future atrocities,§ they wrote. ※It is paramount that federal agents securing our border are appropriately screened and trained to safely and appropriately handle situations such as this one.§ The full text of the letter can be read below. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment on the letter. Customs and Border Protection told ABC News that the agency ※will respond to the congressmen directly.§ In response to the initial investigation, Customs and Border Protection issued a statement saying, ※CBP takes all allegations of mistreatment seriously and does not tolerate actions that are not consistent with our core values of vigilance, service to country and integrity.§ The officers in question, however, were not disciplined for their actions, and both remain on the job. Calls for reform of the agency have gained urgency as Customs and Border Protection faces the prospect of another rapid expansion under the new administration. In a speech delivered to the Department of Homeland Security on Jan. 25, President Donald Trump issued two executive orders directing the department to hire an additional 10,000 ICE officers and 5,000 Border Patrol agents. In July the Department of Homeland Security＊s Office of the Inspector General issued a report highlighting ※significant challenges§ faced by the agency in following the president＊s mandate, finding that, based on current hiring statistics, the agency needed a pool of 750,000 applicants to hire 5,000 additional border agents and a pool of 501,750 applicants to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers. The need for the hiring surge is unclear, the report concluded, as ※neither CBP nor ICE could provide complete data to support the operational need or deployment strategies for the additional 15,000 additional agents and officers they were directed to hire,§ while critics say it could exacerbate the issues that have led to high levels of corruption in the workforce. James Tomsheck, a former head of internal affairs for Customs and Border Protection, told ABC News that previous expansions put stress on his office＊s ability to screen applicants and investigate misconduct and warned that Trump＊s latest push could create similar problems. ※If it occurs at a rate that exceeds that which is appropriate to properly vet and screen applicants, it is virtually certain to allow highly unsuitable persons to enter the agency who will perpetuate the problem of corruption, misconduct and excessive use of force,§ Tomsheck said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. There are two pieces of pending legislation 〞 one introduced in the Senate, another in the House 〞 seeking to increase oversight of the agency. Citing ※a spike in internal corruption cases§ after ※the agency＊s swift growth,§ Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the ranking member on the Senate Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration, introduced a bill with Sen.

"A North Carolina bill that could protect drivers who hit protesters may have hit a snag, following a highly-publicized incident involving an Ohio man who police say deliberately accelerated his car into a crowd of counterprotesters on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing an activist and injuring others. The bill, which was approved by the North Carolina House of Representatives in April by a 67-48 vote, would make drivers immune from civil liability for causing injuries to protesters who are blocking roadways if the driver is ※exercising due care"" in navigating. It does not protect drivers if the protesters have a permit to demonstrate in the roadway, or if the driver＊s actions resulting in injuries are ※willful or wanton.§ The bill still, however, has to clear the Senate Rules and Operations Committee before reaching the State Senate, and State Sen. Bill Rabon, the committee＊s chairman, indicated this week that it is unlikely to proceed. ※As far as I can recall, none of the House sponsors have asked for this bill to be heard in the Senate, and there are no plans to move it forward,§ Rabon, a Republican, told the paper through a spokesperson. ABC News reached out to Rabon for further comment but did not immediately receive a response.  Given today's actions in #Charlottesville, HB330 that allows NCians to drive through?protesters without being sued should die in committee.  The news was welcomed by Democrats like State Senator Mike Woodard, who told ABC News in a phone interview that it was ""poorly drafted"" and left people with a bad impression after the events that took place over the weekend. ""Certainly, now after [Charlottesville], this is not a time to be having that conversation,"" Woodard said about the bill.  How does #NCGA feel about protestors? HB330, just approved by committee, would protect drivers who injure protestors with their car #ncpol pic.twitter.com/3ZYgBhneb4  The news was also welcomed by rights groups, who argue that House Bill 330 is designed to discourage free speech. Sarah Gillooly, the policy director for the ACLU North Carolina, said to ABC News in response to a question about the bill's viability that ""we certainly hope it's dead."" ""The bill was intended to have a chilling effect on people that would discourage them from exercising their First Amendment right to protest,"" Gillooly said. ""It's specifically designed to keep people off the streets."" She alleged that the bill was not only a response to the larger-scale protests that followed President Trump's election, but also an attempt to stifle local uprisings, like the protests that took place in Charlotte after the police shooting death of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man. North Carolina State Representatives Justin Burr and Chris Millis, the two Republicans who introduced the bill, are still eager to see it passed. The reps released a joint statement about the bill, saying that the recent controversy over it was ""a gross mischaracterization."" ""It is intellectually dishonest and a gross mischaracterization to portray North Carolina House Bill 330 as a protection measure for the act of violence that occurred in Charlottesville this past weekend,"" the statement said. ""Any individual who committed a deliberate or willful act, such as what happened this weekend in Charlottesville, would face appropriately severe criminal and civil liabilities."" The statement rejects the ACLU's argument that the bill is an attempt to weaken free speech rights, saying that it ""[respects] the right to protest according to the 1st Amendment."" It went on, ""We denounce the violence, racism, and acts displayed in Charlottesville that run antithetical to American ideals of peaceful demonstration and the right to free speech. Our thoughts and prayers are with those killed and injured, their families, and our nation as we grieve the tragic events perpetuated by those that wish to divide us."" Legislators in Texas, Tennessee, Rhode Island, Florida and North Dakota have introduced similar bills to HB330 and, so far, those attempts have produced underwhelming results. Two different Florida bills died in committee, the North Dakota bill failed to clear the State House of Representatives, and the Rhode Island bill was placed on hold for further study. The Texas bill was referred to committee in March and its status is pending. The Tennessee bill died in committee, and was referred to the State Senate, where its status is also pending.

"Longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks will serve as interim White House communications director until a permanent replacement is found for the job, the White House announced today. ""Hope Hicks will work with White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and all of the communications team and serve as the Interim White House Communications Director,"" a White House official said in a statement. ""We will make an announcement on a permanent communications director at the appropriate time."" A senior administration official had confirmed to ABC News earlier in the day that Hicks, 28, will assume the role vacated most recently by Anthony Scaramucci, who served in the position for 11 days. In addition to Scaramucci's short tenure, the White House communications office has seen multiple shakeups in recent months, with White House press secretary Sean Spicer resigning from his position when Scaramucci was hired. Spicer had also been unofficially filling the role of communications director since the departure of former Communications Director Mike Dubke, who resigned from the role after a three-month stint. Hicks, one of the president's closest advisers, has served as director of strategic communications in the White House and was by Donald Trump's side throughout the 2016 presidential campaign as his spokeswoman.

"Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel says there's no place in her party for white supremacists and neo-Nazis following a weekend of deadly violence at a rally attended by hate groups in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""We don't want your vote, we don't support you, we'll speak out against you,"" McDaniel told ABC News' David Muir in an interview on ""Good Morning America"" today. McDaniel acknowledged that President Donald Trump may have been slow to single out the hate groups when denouncing them. Trump named the groups on Monday after initially making a controversial statement on Saturday that condemned ※violence on many sides"" in downtown Charlottesville, where white nationalists clashed with counter-protesters. McDaniel also admitted that the deadly violence was initiated by the white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and members of the Ku Klux Klan who participated in the rally.       A silver Dodge Challenger, allegedly driven by 20-year-old Ohio resident James Alex Fields Jr., barreled into a crowd of counter-protesters and residents during the rally on Saturday afternoon, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring many others. Following outrage over his initial comments on Saturday, Trump denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan during a statement at the White House on Monday. But the next day, the president told reporters at Trump Tower in New York City that the counter-protesters demonstrating against the rally in Charlottesville were also to blame for the violence, saying ""there are two sides to a story."" ""The president was saying that people brought violence from both sides,"" McDaniel said on ""GMA"" today. ""And violence isn＊t OK, but the blame lays squarely at the KKK, the white supremacists, the neo-Nazis who organized this rally, caused violence and are pushing hate across this country."" McDaniel added that the white nationalist rally was ""un-American"" and that Republicans and Democrats should not be divided over what happened in Charlottesville, but rather come together to condemn hatred, bigotry and all forms of violence. ""This is not a Republican or Democrat issue,"" she said. ""It's going to take bipartisanship to bring people together around unifying this country and the president has called for that."" ABC News' Kelly McCarthy contributed to this report.																																																																																																																					"
"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY        THE TAKE with ABC News' MaryAlice Parks The president's wife, daughter and own vice president saw pictures of white nationalists' carrying torches in a Southern street -- chanting slogans like ""Jews will not replace us"" -- and felt compelled to speak out. President Trump, by his own admission, was not convinced by what he saw. For the president there could have been ""fine people"" in the crowd, though they would have been walking alongside symbols of racist violence, mass murder and oppression. Politicians tend to speak either because they think it is right or because it is in their own self-interest. While the president condemned neo-Nazis and the KKK, he stopped short of telling them he did not want their support. The white nationalists continue to be very specific about backing this president. We have seen from his past behavior that President Trump can prioritize loyalty above almost anything else, and perhaps that is driving some of his decision-making here. Either he wants and enjoys the support of white nationalist groups or he does not. Or he thinks he needs their support to win. Republicans on the whole will continue to face questions about those possibilities, whether they rode the coattails of his implicit acceptance or encouragement of these groups, and whether any of that is excusable.

"After Wednesday's shooting, Congressman Gary Palmer said, ""our Republic is in danger"" and that we are ""fraying at the edges."" Congressman Rodney Davis said, ""the way we talk to each other has to change. The political hate has to end."" It's not the words we use, it's what's in our hearts. We are meaner than we used to be. According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of both parties see the other in ""very unfavorable"" terms, a view that has doubled since 1994. We used to think our opponents were just wrong. Now, a lot more of us think they are evil. Politics defines more of our lives, which means this is all more personally felt. The political system uses hate to motivate voters. No fundraising letter or ""get out the vote"" flier starts: ""Hey, the other guy has a point."" Instead, the other guy is ""corrupt,"" and ""heartless."" In debates -- in social, partisan and mainstream media -- if you are skilled at pointing out dark motives in your opponents, the market will reward you. We can stop applauding this, and we can stop taking the bait. We can start acting in the ways we praise after a tragedy: recognizing our common humanity, acting with restraint, assuming good motives. Your opponents have families just like you do, who would worry about them in a crisis. Their kids amaze and confuse them, just like yours do. Lumping people into groups steals the humanity we recognize in times of tragedy. Judging motives off the bat starts conversation in the gutter. This doesn't mean ending the battle of ideas. It means returning to ideas, and not being lazy and defining people by the left, or the right, or ""your ilk."" Let's hope lawmakers are successful toning down the hate. But we can do more than hope. We can act and we must, because we are all part of the problem.																																																																																																																					"
"More voters than ever are not satisfied with President Trump's job in office, according to new approval ratings released Wednesday. A poll from Quinnipiac University found that only a third of American voters, 33 percent, approve of his performance in office, while 61 percent disapprove of it. This marks his lowest approval and highest disapproval number since he was inaugurated, Quinnipiac said. His latest approval rating is down 7 percentage points from the 40 percent approval rating Mr. Trump received in a similar survey in late June. Majorities of voters said that Mr. Trump is not honest, doesn't have good leadership skills, isn't a strong person, isn't intelligent, doesn't share their values and doesn't care about average Americans. Voters gave Mr. Trump negative approval ratings for handling key issues like foreign policy, the economy, immigration,?health care?and terrorism. The White House is confirming and defending President Trump's involvement in drafting a statement about his son's June 2016 meeting with a Russia... More than half of voters also said that the president ""has attempted to derail or obstruct the investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election."" Nearly two-thirds said that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election. Thirty percent of voters said that the president did something illegal in dealing with Russia, with another 30 percent saying he did something unethical but not illegal and 32 percent saying he did nothing wrong. Gallup, meanwhile, said that the president's approval rating in their latest poll hit 36 percent, a new low, with 60 percent disapproving. The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 1,125 voters between July 27 and August 1 nationwide with a 3.4 percentage point margin of error. The Gallup poll surveyed 1,500 adults on August 1 with a 3 percentage point margin of error.

"By Anthony Salvanto, Kabir Khanna, Jen De Pinto, Fred Backus Six months in, President Donald Trump's strongest backers like seeing him fight his chosen opponents: they want the president to call out those he believes disloyal, do even more to make Democrats mad, fight with the mainstream media, and feel he's taking on ""people who deserve it."" But the combativeness they applaud seems precisely what most others dislike. And that -- along with declining personal evaluations -- is costing the president potential support, even as many give him credit for an improving economy, according to a new Nation Tracker poll released Sunday. The president's overall ratings on the metrics of being ""presidential"" and ""effective"" remain down, and today many of his softer and would-be supporters feel he creates unnecessary ""conflict and drama,"" and most of his detractors -- and most Americans overall -- describe what they see from the White House as ""chaos."" The nationwide trend in support, comparing today to the initial Nation Tracker study at the beginning of the president's term, is a slow drift in the direction of opposition. Resister ranks have increased over time (six points from the start of the administration) and the strongest supporter ranks have thinned slightly (down four points from the start.) The big gaps between the groups are defined by very different personal ratings of the president and how he's handling himself in office. And things could become even more intractable: those on the furthest ends -- the strongest backers and strongest opponents 每 are more likely to strongly believe their way of life is at stake. President Trump's most ardent backers -- who call themselves supporters, period, and whom we've labeled Believers since the start of this ongoing panel study -- remain connected and loyal to the president by what seems a deep cultural and personal link, feeling he ""fights for people"" like them and speaks in a way they can relate to. They're the only group, among the segments in this study, where a majority wants the president to do?more?tweeting. A majority of these Americans describe what they're seeing from the White House as ""great"" and overwhelmingly feel the country, and their culture, are safer now. Their loyalty -- which they say the president deserves -- is to Donald Trump over other political parties and labels like conservative or Republican. But this core base has shrunk a bit as it intensifies -- down now to 18 percent from the 22 percent where it started in February. They like him both personally and politically, but softer supporters do not. In a signal of how much culture and national issues may matter to the Believers even over their own finances, they are more likely to say the nation is safer and the borders are more secure than to say their own economic situation has improved under this president. Demographically, they are also much older than other support groups. Conditional supporters -- who back him but say he must deliver what they want -- are still with the president, but increasingly call him distracted, and much less likely to call him effective than they were this spring, and less likely than believers to think he's gotten things done so far, though most do. They're more apt than believers to say Mr. Trump is starting unnecessary conflict and drama. They want to see less fighting and ""taking on"" other groups, and more of Mr. Trump working across the aisle; more focus on policy items like infrastructure. Most of them do not think the ""swamp"" is being drained. What keeps them attached? They're attached to his policies -- which they like -- more so than to the president, personally. But despite the critiques they also say they remain?patient?-- in fact, patience is one thing that distinguishes ""conditionals"" from other people who don't want the fighting but who've now become curious opponents. And most are rooting for him to succeed. They give the president credit for the economy. The question for them, it seems, is whether they'll ultimately get all they want. The people who started in February as supporters, but have drifted away to become curious opponents today, say things have gone worse than expected so far. If you're keeping score, turnover in the Trump administration over the past six months has included the ousters of Michael Flynn, James Comey, Mi... Opponents who are potential supporters -- we've labeled them curious because they say they still might consider the president, but are not with him now -- say they are neither rooting for nor against him at this point. They disapprove of him personally, because they feel he isn't making their own prospects any better. They're more likely to describe themselves as growing impatient than being out of patience yet. Personal views of the president take a big downward turn as people go from Conditional supports to curious opponents. The curious cite Mr. Trump's own personal behavior and comments as the main reason they are against him, far ahead of not keeping his promises. For them his rating on being ""presidential"" has declined five points from May. Most don't think he's gotten any meaningful policy things done, and this dovetails with their description of him as distracted. Like both supporters and opponents of the president, they want to see him negotiate with Democrats more. The curious are more likely to call themselves independent than to align with either of the two major parties. Importantly, most also did not vote in the 2016 presidential election. As the ranks of the curious have declined during the course of the administration (one might now even label them skeptical) those who have left have become resisters, not supporters. Those who moved into the resister ranks since February describe what they see as ""frightening"" and ""chaos."" Back in February, they said they would decide whether or not to support the president in part by how he handled himself in office. Today, they voice a strong dislike of President Trump personally. Health care may have had some impact on all this. Those who disapproved of the president's handling of health care overwhelmingly felt he was not fighting for their economic interests, more generally. Finally, the ranks of his staunchest opponents -- who we call resisters in this study -- have grown, due in part to former supporters who describe themselves as out of patience, and those in this group overwhelmingly (three in four) call what they're seeing ""frightening"" -- a sentiment that may, in turn, be exactly what the core supporters want them to feel.? Most resisters 每 eight in ten - at least somewhat believe the fundamental matter of how the country's democracy works is at stake today, the highest of any group. They are also distinguished from curious by their desire for what will happen. Believing so much is at stake, nine in 10 resisters are hoping President Trump does?not?succeed, because they think the country will be better off if he didn't accomplish what he wants to. The main reason resisters say they are against Mr. Trump is that they feel he's harming the country and its democracy 每 more than two-thirds do - which is different from the curious, who point to Trump's personal behavior as the reason they oppose him. They don't see much outreach from the president. Nearly all of the resisters don't think the president speaks for them. And they don't see him as fighting for people like them. Two-thirds of them say the first six months of the Trump presidency is worse than they expected -- far higher than the less than half of the curious who say that. They see Mr. Trump as temperamental and even dangerous.																																																																																																																					"

"UNITED NATIONS -- Forget Davos. Forget Twitter and Facebook making news events go viral. The annual September gathering of world leaders in Manhattan's Turtle Bay, known as the United Nations General Assembly, or UNGA to insiders, has been grabbing worldwide headlines and stalling midtown traffic since then-Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev yanked off his shoe to pound a desk in protest in 1960. In an effort to bring order at the time, the Irish president of the General Assembly banged his gavel so hard it broke. Face the Nation brought viewers inside the Kremlin in Moscow on June 2, 1957 for an interview with the Soviet leader. Although a time limit of 15 minutes is allocated to each of the 193 nations' speakers and additional non-member entities and states, Cuba's President Fidel Castro gave the longest speech at 269 minutes, Libya's Col. Muammar Qaddafi gave the most rambling one at 96 minutes, Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez referenced the devil, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 2012 speech was illustrated with a cartoon bomb, and Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked a mass walkout of diplomats. The Economist found that during President Obama's years he gave the longest speeches at 38 minutes on average. These speeches have all used the UNGA stage to challenge the normally sleepy order of things at the U.N. Since 1945, hundreds of countries and thousands of diplomats and reporters from around the world gather to showboat and hobnob. Sometimes the buzz focuses as much on who's not coming as who will appear. Where key leaders rest their weary heads generates press as well. Last year, Mr. Obama dissed the traditional lodging for U.S. presidents, the Waldorf Astoria, because the Chinese had purchased the grande dame. Mr. Obama instead stayed two blocks away at the New York Palace Hotel, which is owned by South Korean company Lotte. The Waldorf had hosted all 13 U.S. presidents elected since its opening. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping chose the Waldorf although he is not attending this year. The Waldorf Towers ambassadorial residence, which had been home to the United States' U.N. ambassador since 1947, was only moved after the arrival of U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley this year. For his part, President Trump, whose longtime bedroom in Trump Tower is just three blocks from the Palace Hotel, reportedly is considering staying at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, over an hour's drive from U.N. headquarters. It raises a big question: Will foreign leaders have to make the drive for face time with the U.S. president? ""UNGA is the hottest ticket in diplomacy, and this year will be the first for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and President Donald Trump,"" Britain's Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told CBS News. ""Only the United Nations can bring together the international community to tackle the biggest global challenges in such a way."" The General Assembly, established by the Charter of the United Nations, takes a bit of a back seat to the all-powerful 15-member Security Council, composed of the five permanent post-World War II powers -- the U.S., Russia, China, the U.K. and France -- along with 10 members elected for two-year terms. Opening day kicks off with the General Debate on Tuesday, Sept. 19. The recently published preliminary list of speakers has scores of heads of state and heads of government. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is denominated a ""head of government"" in deference to Queen Elizabeth II, who remains the U.K.'s head of state. To help newcomers decode who's who, the U.N. Office of Protocol publishes a helpful list of titles and names of leaders and the members of the delegations. The U.N. has come a long way since the U.S., pre-revolutionary China, the now-collapsed Soviet Union and the United Kingdom gathered at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C., in 1944. One year later, 50 countries convened in San Francisco to draw up the U.N. charter in 1945. Needless to say, several parts of the world are in turmoil, and it may be that this year more than a few presidents, kings and sheikhs dare not leave home for fear of domestic unrest or even ouster. The list of speakers can change up until the day of the debate, but the first list has some headliners. Mr. Trump will speak on Sept. 19, sharing the early session with his new ami, the president of France, Emmanuel Macron. Both Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will attend as will Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. President Trump continued to defend his son Thursday in Paris when he was asked about Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer during the campai... The U.K.'s May holds a place on the agenda as does Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, but neither has confirmed whether they're attending, their countries' missions told CBS News. Heads of state and government are also attending from Brazil, Slovakia, Nigeria, Jordan, Colombia, Mali, Monaco, Qatar, Afghanistan, South Korea, Bolivia, Poland, Dominican Republic, Iraq, Burundi, South Sudan and more. (See the list here.) Venezuela's embattled President Nicolas Maduro is on the list, but sophisticated observers will be surprised if he leaves Caracas. Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was planning to attend, but he was just deposed, and India's popular Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not attending. An economic meltdown in Venezuela is at the heart of the political crisis there. An inflation rate of 800 percent has decimated savings, and some... Other no-shows are Russia's President Vladimir Putin, China's President Xi and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto is on the list but has canceled, Mexico's Ambassador to the U.N. Juan Jose Gomez Camacho told CBS News. And, as expected, the leaders of the outlier states of North Korea, Cuba and Syria will stay home. Brazil, as history has it, always speaks first. Stephen Schlesinger, a fellow at the Century Foundation who wrote ""Act of Creation: The Founding of the United Nations,"" recounted the story to CBS News: ""In the early years of the organization, Brazil was the first country willing to speak at the General Assembly meetings. So it became a tradition, but I attribute it to the fact that Franklin Delano Roosevelt wanted Brazil to be the sixth permanent member of the Security Council, but it did not work out, so this was Brazil's consolation prize."" Brazil's former President Dilma Rousseff became the first woman to open a General Debate since the United Nations was founded, but she also found her place in history as Brazil's first female president to be impeached. This year, embattled Michel Temer is slotted to speak, at least for now. Seating in the grand hall of the General Assembly is arranged by lottery, but in an odd coincidence this year, the North Korea delegation is sitting front and center (think orchestra seats) approximately 20 feet from the podium where Mr. Trump will address the world. ""I just hope the metal detectors can check for spitballs,"" a diplomat who preferred to remain anonymous offered wryly. ""The president's biggest challenge will be himself: He has looked boorish at other big multilateral gatherings, like the NATO summit and G-20 meetings, and the media pack will be hoping and praying that Trump will cause similar ructions at the U.N.,"" said Richard Gowan, a U.N. expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""He may not be able to hold back."" The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, discusses President Trump's face to face meeting with President Putin and North Korea's m... Schlesinger told CBS News, ""Trump's appearance at UNGA will be important for a number of reasons: First, he will surely use the podium to put forth his nationalist 'America First' credo with all of its implications for trade, immigration, reducing the U.S. foreign aid budget, perhaps reasserting his opposition to social issues like abortion. ""But then he will also take credit for increasing the U.S. defense budget and defeating terrorism and eliminating ISIS; second, he will then challenge the nations of the world to do their part in fighting the Islamic militants around the world."" Schlesinger believes that Mr. Trump will want to echo the words of his popular ambassador, Haley, who has focused on cutting back on U.S. contributions to the U.N., ""slicing $500 million from the peacekeeping budget, heralding reduced U.S. contributions to UNICEF, U.N. Women, the World Food Programme, the IAEA, endorsing withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and possibly ditching the U.S. role in the Human Rights Council."" In our series, Issues That Matter, we take a closer look at climate change. Former Vice President Al Gore has spent decades working on this globa... In various speeches, the White House has identified several priorities for this year's General Assembly, including North Korea's denuclearization, the Syria crisis, countering terrorism, worldwide famine, refugees and cost-cutting at the U.N. When Haley escorted Security Council ambassadors to the White House in April, Mr. Trump said, ""You just don't see the United Nations, like, solving conflicts. I think that's going to start happening now. I can see it. And the United Nations will get together and solve conflicts. It won't be two countries, it will be the United Nations mediating or arbitrating with those countries."" A spokesperson for the U.S. mission told CBS News, ""We're gearing up for a successful first UNGA for the Trump administration."" The incoming president of the General Assembly, Miroslav Lajcak of Slovakia, has created a theme for the session, titled ""Focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet,"" and identified peace-building, migration, climate change and human rights along with sustainable development in his statement of priorities given to U.N. nations during a retreat this past week. Stephane Dujarric, the spokesman for the secretary-general, told CBS News, ""This year's General Assembly will be a critical one since it is the first one for the secretary-general since he assumed office and we will see U.S. President Donald Trump and the recently elected French president, Emmanuel Macron, so that will make for critical discussions."" ""In a time when there are a number of conflicts and tensions in the world, the role of the United Nations as a convener, as a place for multi-dimensional diplomacy is greater now than it has ever been,"" Dujarric told CBS News. Gowan said, ""In theatrical terms, Trump has a problem in that a potentially bigger star, France's Emmanuel Macron, is speaking relatively soon after him. Macron will get a much more positive reception."" After all the speeches are given and the bilateral meetings and receptions are done, diplomats will be looking to see if Mr. Trump has made his mark on the world stage as a leader and whether the U.S. chooses diplomacy at a troubled time in the world. Schlesinger said that what will be interesting to watch is whether Mr. Trump will try to assert a claim to American leadership for the planet or will he pitch a template of U.S. withdrawal from the global community. ""I believe the upcoming U.N. General Assembly is an important opportunity for the U.S. to send the unambiguous message that it stays committed to world affairs and to the U.N.,"" France's U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told CBS News, ""and this is more important than ever as the world is confronted with an unprecedented accumulation of crises.""

A gallery of America's leaders on the golf course over the years Mr. Trump has also visited Camp David in Maryland once and taken seven trips to his club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, but that venue is closed for the season until fall. On a number of occasions this year, Mr. Trump -- who derided former President Barack Obama for playing golf -- has visited his golf clubs without confirming to the press whether or not he is golfing. So far, Mr. Trump has taken more vacation-like days away than Obama, but fewer than former President George W. Bush at this point in their tenure, according to statistics CBS News White House Correspondent Mark Knoller has been keeping. Bush was also criticized for taking ample vacations to his ranch in Crawford, Texas. As Mr. Trump leaves for vacation, he also leaves behind controversy in Washington, D.C.

"Actress Cynthia Nixon, best known for playing the serious-minded Miranda on HBO's ""Sex and the City,"" is one of a handful of progressives mulling a 2018 primary challenge against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the Wall Street Journal reports. Nixon, who has become an outspoken activist and supporter of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, is being courted to run by liberal groups. And although she has dismissed speculation about a political career in the past, she's now considering a run, according to the paper. ""She's an out-of-the-box candidate with progressive credentials who would excite people,"" Billy Easton, an activist allied with New York's powerful teachers' unions, told the Journal. Cuomo, who sports a massive $25 million campaign war chest, is expected to run for a third term in 2018. Although relatively popular statewide, he experienced a stronger than expected primary challenge from law professor Zephyr Teachout in 2014, and frequently spars with de Blasio, a fellow Democrat. The son of legendary New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is also thought to be a potential contender for the presidency in 2020 每 assuming, of course, he wins reelection. ""In the last few years there's been an earthquake in American politics, and Andrew Cuomo could well be surprised,"" Teachout told the Journal. One issue that could potentially dog Cuomo in a Democratic primary is the sorry state of the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), which operates New York City's subways and a number of commuter rail services. Frequent delays and disruptions have plagued the service, which is primarily overseen by Cuomo and serves millions of riders every day. Cuomo has also irked Democrats in the state legislature. The state's senate is under Republican control due to an alliance with a breakaway group of Democrats, much to the annoyance of progressives who say the governor has obstructed efforts to bring it under Democratic Party control. Cuomo has a good working relationship with Republicans in the senate, and in the past has equivocated on whether the chamber would be better off with Democrats in charge. However, he has also spearheaded an ambitious free-college program in New York, which he announced earlier this year alongside Vermont senator and progressive darling Bernie Sanders. Under the initiative, taxpayers will foot tuition costs at state schools for students coming from families that make less than $125,000 a year, so long as the students agree to stay in New York for several years after graduation.? Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner and retired state senator Terry Gipson are also mulling primary challenges to Cuomo, according to the Journal. ?

"Last Updated Aug 4, 2017 1:31 PM EDT Attorney General Jeff Sessions threatened to pursue and prosecute anyone who leaks sensitive government information, and consider subpoenaing members of the media who publish those leaks, in a briefing at the Justice Department Friday morning. The briefing about ongoing ongoing leak investigations Friday came a day after the Washington Post first published leaked leaked transcripts of President Trump's January phone calls with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Sessions condemned those leaks as dangerous to national security, and noted the number of unauthorized leaks has ""exploded"" under the Trump administration. Mr. Trump in recent days has called Sessions ""very weak"" on prosecuting leakers, in Twitter tirades. Leaked transcripts of two phone calls, one between President Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto and the other between Mr. Trump and A... ""We are taking a stand. This culture of leaking must stop,"" Sessions said in the briefing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. The Justice Department has more than tripled the number of active leak investigations compared to the number pending at the end of the Obama administration and the National Security Agency and U.S. Attorneys Offices have been directed to prioritize cases involving unauthorized disclosures, Sessions said. ""We will investigate and seek to bring criminals to justice,"" Sessions said. ""We will not allow rogue anonymous sources with security clearances to sell out our country any longer."" But leakers aren't the only ones who will come in the crosshairs of the federal government. Sessions also said the Justice Department is reviewing its policy related to subpoenaing the media when leaks are published. Members of the media, ""cannot place lives at risk with impunity,"" Sessions said. The Trump administration -- which regularly derides the ""fake news"" media -- has already suggested stepping up legal recourse against the media for publishing ""fake"" or leaked news. ""I have listened to career investigators and prosecutors about how to most successfully investigate and prosecute these matters,"" Sessions said. ""At their suggestion, one of the things we are doing is reviewing policies affecting media subpoenas. We respect the important role that the press plays and will give them respect, but it is not unlimited. They cannot place lives at risk with impunity. We must balance their role with protecting our national security and the lives of those who serve in our intelligence community, the armed forces, and all law abiding Americans."" But Sessions -- despite suggesting the Justice Department may pursue media outlets with legal action -- took no questions from the press after he had concluded his remarks, leaving frustrated reporters with unanswered questions.? Coats had similarly tough language for leakers and anyone else involved in the process. ""For those out there who may be listening or watching these announcements ... if you improperly disclose classified information, we will find you,"" Coats said. ""We will investigate you. We will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law, and you will not be happy with the result."" Here were the live updates from the 11 a.m. ET news conference: Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats had a clear message for any leakers. Coats even suggested some of the leaks had come from Congress. ""For those out there who may be listening or watching these announcements ... if you improperly disclose classified information, we will find you,"" Coats said. ""We will investigate you. We will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law, and you will not be happy with the result."" Sessions said the Justice Department respects the media, but that respect is not ""unlimited."" Sessions said the DOJ will pursue subpoenas for media outlets that publish leaked information.? ""I have listened to career investigators and prosecutors about how to most successfully investigate and prosecute these matters,"" Sessions said in his prepared remarks. ""At their suggestion, one of the things we are doing is reviewing policies affecting media subpoenas. We respect the important role that the press plays and will give them respect, but it is not unlimited. They cannot place lives at risk with impunity. We must balance their role with protecting our national security and the lives of those who serve in our intelligence community, the armed forces, and all law abiding Americans."" Sessions made it clear the DOJ will not tolerate leaking from within any part of government. ""This culture of leaking must stop,"" Sessions said.? Anyone who is considering leaking something should not, he said.? ""The Department of Justice is open for business."" Sessions began his press conference mentioning the leaked phone calls, describing how much that hurts the national security of the United States when the president cannot have sensitive conversations with foreign leaders without worrying about leaks.? ""No government can be effective when its leaders cannot discuss sensitive matters in confidence..."" Sessions said. Sessions claimed the number of leaks of classified information in the first six months of the Trump administration have ""exploded."" ""Simply put, these leaks hurt our country,"" Sessions said.? Sessions said the ""culture"" of leaking ""must stop."" ?																																																																																																																					"
"The White House on Thursday made clear that it would back the ""cleanest possible"" debt ceiling increase despite calls from conservatives to seek spending cuts in return. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said at a briefing Thursday that the Trump administration would not seek any spending cuts in a debate on increasing the debt ceiling, which is a demand members of the Tea Party and conservative Freedom Caucus in the House have been advocating. The debt ceiling increase, Mulvaney said, may need to be tied to a continuing resolution (CR) at the end of September to keep the government open and prevent a shutdown. Mulvaney previously seemed to be at odds with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on a clean debt ceiling increase. Congress will likely have to raise it by the end of September as government agencies and outside think-tanks have eyed the drop-dead deadline as the beginning to middle of October. The government has been relying on so-called extraordinary measures to continue borrowing and have sufficient cash to make its usual payments since mid-March when the suspension of the debt ceiling expired. Lawmakers last lifted the debt ceiling in October 2015, which was part of a bipartisan budget agreement that also lifted spending levels for two years for both defense and non-defense domestic programs. While Republicans have put up a fight over the debt ceiling in the past, they likely realized that they need Democratic votes to lift it in the Senate.? The Senate is expected to go on recess Thursday for the rest of August and the House left for its month-long break last Friday.?

"While introducing new legislation aimed at tightening up border security Thursday morning, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called President Trump ""an ally"" in fighting illegal immigration. ""We just happen to have, thank goodness, a president who believes that border security is important, and so we view him as an ally in this effort,"" Cornyn said at a news conference introducing the Building America's Trust Act. The bill aims to increase law enforcement resources and add ""infrastructure, like a wall system,"" along the southern border, according to Cornyn. ""This isn't a pretend border security bill, this is a tough border security and interior enforcement bill, and we intended it that way,"" Cornyn said. Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump endorsed a bill with a similar?objective. The RAISE Act, introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, and David Perdue, R-Georgia, aims to drastically reduce the number of immigrants entering the United States by establishing a merit-based points system for allowing immigrants into the country. ""We aren't just securing our borders for tomorrow, but we're looking ahead and locking in a framework that will last into the future,"" Cornyn said of the Building America's Trust Act. If passed, the bill would authorize $15 billion in funding to go toward border security efforts over the next four years. Cornyn would not confirm if funding for the infrastructure portion of the bill would fall under Mr. Trump's promises that ""Mexico will pay for the wall."" Mexico will pay for the wall! ""We are members of Congress, and we are used to Congress appropriating the money,"" Cornyn said. ""And we'll leave it to the president and his plan for how we recoup that at some point."" While increasing physical infrastructure along the southern border, the legislation also reinforces existing border security laws by requiring Department of Homeland Security officials to consult with local border authorities and ending catch and release through enacting ""Kate's Law."" In June, the House passed ""Kate's Law,"" which imposes tougher prison sentences on undocumented immigrants with ""a serious criminal record"" who have previously been deported and re-enter the United States. ""Today we're sending the message that we will defend our borders, we will enforce our immigration laws and we will deter illegal immigration,"" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, a co-sponsor of the bill. The bill also holds sanctuary cities ""accountable"" through its provisions, which allow the federal government to withhold funding and grants from local governments who fail to comply with illegal immigration enforcement. Sanctuary cities offer safe haven to undocumented immigrants who may otherwise be deported by federal immigration officials. ""My definition of a sanctuary city is a city that does not cooperate with federal law enforcement authorities,"" Cornyn said. In an effort to garner bipartisan support for the bill, co-sponsor Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, referenced the deaths resulting from illegal southern border crossing efforts. ""If you're against the wall, if you're in the group of people that think we need bridges not borders, think about the humanitarian crisis that will continue if we don't increase situational awareness and operational control down there,"" Tillis said.																																																																																																																					"
"The Department of Justice on Thursday announced that it would withhold federal funds aimed at reducing violent crime from cities if they don't work to cut down illegal immigration. The new steps are aimed at so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" which are cities with ordinances that try to shield illegal immigrants. ""The Department of Justice is committed to supporting our law enforcement at every level, and that's why we're asking 'sanctuary' jurisdictions to stop making their jobs harder. By taking simple, common-sense considerations into account, we are encouraging every jurisdiction in this country to cooperate with federal law enforcement,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. The department sent letters to four cities: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Baltimore, Maryland; San Bernardino, California; and Stockton, California that requested federal aid. The administration is asking them to comply with specific terms in order to qualify for the funding. The move comes on the heels of Sessions' announcement regarding a crackdown on sanctuary cities last month.?

"WASHINGTON?-- Lawmakers have scattered for their summer recess, leaving behind a slim record of achievements and a steaming President Donald Trump. The president is angry about what the Republican-led Congress couldn't do - repeal Obamacare - as well as one of the few things it did: approve a Russia sanctions bill he detests. So Republican senators leave Washington with simmering tensions between them and the White House now out in public for all to see. They'll face voters back home who have cause for frustration about an unproductive Congress led by a party given over to infighting. Lamenting poor relations with Russia, Trump sniped over Twitter on Thursday, ""You can thank Congress, the same people that can't even give us HCare!"" ""I was shocked by that,"" responded Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who is not one for criticizing Trump publicly. ""Relations with Russia are in a bad place, and it's entirely because of Vladimir Putin, it's not because of Congress."" Overall, as Republicans took stock of the past seven months of control of the House and Senate under the Trump administration, the mood was glum. The House began its summer recess last week, but as senators rushed for the exits Thursday they were still pointing to the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court as their signal success, even though that happened back in April. Last week's failure of their Obamacare repeal efforts after seven years of ardent campaign promises still stung. And Republicans have also failed to make much progress on other marquee agenda items, like a tax overhaul or an infrastructure bill, while falling behind on the annual spending bills needed to keep the lights on in government. A fight on that looms this fall or winter, along with the threat of a government shutdown if Trump presses for money for his border wall that Democrats are certain to reject. ""We've got to do better,"" said Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican. In a final burst of action Thursday, the Senate overwhelmingly approved a Food and Drug Administration funding bill, and agreed to more than 60 Trump administration nominees, more executive branch nominations in a single day than the Senate had approved all year to date. Republicans have bitterly blamed Democrats' foot-dragging on nominees for many of their problems, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky heralded Thursday's actions as ""an important step towards filling critical roles throughout the administration."" Indeed, GOP lawmakers have complained all year that they're not getting enough credit for the things they are doing, as opposed to criticism for what they are not. ""We have not done well on the big events,"" said Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. ""But the run of the mill, the bipartisan legislation, that never gets actual media attention, I think we've had a fairly robust six months."" Like other Republicans, Scott cited the GOP's success in overturning a series of Obama administration regulations, employing the little-used Congressional Review Act. Yet what lawmakers left undone promises to make for an ugly September on Capitol Hill. Two must-do items will dominate the agenda: increasing the government's debt limit to prevent a catastrophic default on U.S. obligations like interest payments and Social Security checks; and passing a temporary spending bill to keep government agencies up and running. The debt limit increase is particularly nettlesome and many Republicans in Congress simply can't bring themselves to vote for it. But with a Republican in the White House and the party controlling both the House and the Senate, it's the GOP's responsibility to deliver the votes. The White House and congressional Republicans are also promising action early this fall to change the loophole-choked tax code and lower rates for both corporations and individuals. After their meltdown on health care, Republicans are particularly determined to succeed with a tax overhaul, with some arguing that if they succeed in giving voters a tax break, the Obamacare repeal failure will be forgiven and forgotten. But core tax overhaul principles - such as whether the effort would add to the budget deficit - haven't been ironed out, much less the devilish details. And a wild card element is whether Trump will press to pay for the U.S.-Mexico border wall as part of the spending bill. That could spark a confrontation with Democrats, and even threaten a shutdown. Cooler heads may counsel the White House to put off that confrontation until later. Still, after the past rocky months, Republicans are hoping against hope that with all the work ahead, relations with the White House will improve. They're hanging on to one cause for optimism: the appointment of John Kelly as White House chief of staff, which several GOP senators said they hope will calm the chaos on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. ""I think how the president moves now into the next issues we deal with is really important,"" said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. ""And we're hopeful about the new staff structure and I think we're going to see things begin to happen in different ways.""

"WASHINGTON?-- Frustrated by his options, President Donald Trump is withholding approval of a long-delayed Afghanistan war strategy and even mulling a radical shakeup in his national security team as he searches for a ""game changer"" after 16 years of indecisive conflict. In a recent Situation Room meeting that turned explosive, Trump raised the idea of firing Army Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, according to two officials with knowledge of the discussion. And he suggested installing his national security adviser, Gen. H.R. McMaster, to oversee the mission, said the officials, who weren't authorized to talk publicly and requested anonymity. The drastic suggestions point to the desperation shared by many in Washington as military and other leaders look for a blueprint for ""winning"" the Afghan conflict. Trump has been frustrated by what he views as a stalemate. He wants a plan that will allow American forces to pull out once and for all. At a White House lunch with military brass last week, Trump publicly aired his misgivings, saying, ""I want to find out why we've been there for 17 years."" As part of our series, Issues That Matter, we take a look at America's longest war as we approach the 17th year of the conflict in Afghanistan. F... The Pentagon wants to send almost 4,000 more American forces to expand training of Afghan military forces and beef up U.S. counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida, a growing Islamic State affiliate and other extremist groups. But the troop deployment, which would augment an already existing U.S. force of at least 8,400 troops, has been held up amid broader strategy questions, including how to engage regional powers in an effort to stabilize the fractured nation. These powers include U.S. friends and foes, from Pakistan and India to China, Russia and Iran. Pentagon plans aren't calling for a radical departure from the limited approach endorsed by former President Barack Obama, and several officials have credited Trump with rightly asking tough questions, such as how the prescribed approach might lead to success. Trump hasn't welcomed the military's recommendations with ""high-five enthusiasm,"" a senior White House official said. Several meetings involving Trump's National Security Council have been tense as the president demanded answers from top advisers about why American forces needed to be in Afghanistan. Another U.S. official with knowledge of the conversation reported Trump being less interested in hearing about how to restore Afghanistan to long-term stability, and more concerned about dealing a swift and definitive blow to militant groups in the country. The White House has even offered its own, outside-the-box thinking. Officials said Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, have been pushing a plan to have contractors fight the war in Afghanistan?instead of U.S. troops. Blackwater Worldwide founder Erik Prince, the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was approached by Trump's top advisers to develop proposals to gradually swap out U.S. troops and put military contractors in their place, a military official said. The military has frowned on such proposals. It believes boosting troop levels will accelerate progress in training Afghan troops and its air force, and help counterterrorism teams pursue targets even more aggressively. They point to improvements among Afghan forces and in anti-corruption efforts. Military leaders - including McMaster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman - are all said to be on the same page, as is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Military officials also have defended Nicholson, saying any punishment of him would be unfair because he hasn't been given the forces he says he needs. His possible firing was first reported by NBC News. The White House, which declined multiple requests to comment, may shift itself on Afghanistan now that retired Marine Gen. John Kelly is Trump's new chief of staff. Kelly hasn't spoken about Afghanistan, however, since his appointment this week. Lawmakers are growing weary. In June, Mattis faced tough questions from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, who told him, ""It makes it hard for us to support you when we don't have a strategy."" Mattis conceded, ""We are not winning in Afghanistan right now"" and vowed to ""correct this as soon as possible."" Doing so requires the president on board. While Trump has been keen to give military officials carte blanche on troop levels and other military affairs, his approach to Afghanistan has grown increasingly assertive. In some ways, his scrutiny of military plans has evoked that of Obama, whom Trump derided as a candidate for not heeding his generals' advice. Republican lawmakers Thursday urged Trump to listen to his national security advisers on Afghanistan. ""Every soldier over there is an insurance policy against our homeland being attacked,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a leading hawk, told reporters. ""My biggest fear is that if you don't listen to the generals and you try to make this up as you go like Obama and Biden did, you're going to wind up losing Afghanistan like you did Iraq and the consequences to America are worse."" U.S. indecision is causing Afghanistan's neighbors to hedge their bets, Sen. Bob Corker, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, said. As long as they believe Washington is ""six months away from stepping out, six months away from giving up,"" they will continue to do so, Corker said.

"Last Updated Aug 4, 2017 6:16 AM EDT Democratic Sen. Al Franken's political career is no laughing matter. Still, his comic beginnings have impacted his job as U.S. senator in many ways. ? The comedian-turned-senator joined CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett and CBS News Political Director Steve Chaggaris on ""The Takeout"" podcast to talk about his new ironically named book,?Giant of the Senate. Franken recalled his harrowing entry into national politics in the 2008 race for a Minnesota seat in the U.S. Senate. His opponent, incumbent Sen. Norm Coleman, ""weaponized [his] humor,"" putting every joke he told through the ""de-humorizer,"" as Franken called it. Coleman ""stripped"" every bit of context and irony out of his jokes, Franken said, but in that race, the former ""Saturday Night Live"" star managed to eke out a hard-fought victory of merely 312 votes. Even though he won, the race caused him to re-examine his approach to politics. ""Basically because my career as a comedian and comedy writer had been used against me so effectively, I said, 'Well I have to not be funny for the first 20 years in the Senate,'"" Franken said over poached eggs and a coffee. ""It turned out, it only was six. And then I won re-election by a very comfortable margin,"" he said. ""So I let myself be a little funny."" Franken also addressed issues of the day with Garrett and Chaggaris, including Republicans' approach to health care overhaul. ""I don't think they counted on winning in the fall and＃ they just said, 'Okay, good, we'll have another four years to use [Obamacare] as a whipping post or whipping boy,"" Franken said. ""And uh oh, November 8th happens and now we've got to come up with something.'"" He explained why the issue of climate change has a particularly important place in his heart and how his family is a driving force in his attempts to bring it to the forefront of national political discourse. ""I have three grandchildren and, you know, in 50 years I don't want them saying to me, 'Grandpa, you were a United States Senator, you knew climate change was happening, why you didn't do anything?'"" he said with a pause.

"Last Updated Aug 4, 2017 7:15 AM EDT SYDNEY -- Australia's prime minister insisted on Friday that his relationship with President Donald Trump was ""warm,"" despite transcripts of a heated conversation in which the leaders sparred over a refugee deal. The January phone call between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was widely reported at the time. But the transcripts published Friday by The Washington Post offered new details into the conversation, which focused on an Obama-era refugee deal under which the United States will take up to 1,250 refugees that Australia houses in detention camps on the Pacific island nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea. According to the transcript, Mr. Trump told Turnbull the agreement was ""stupid,"" ''disgusting"" and ""horrible,"" adding: ""This deal will make me look terrible... I am going to get killed on this thing."" Leaked transcripts of two phone calls, one between President Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto and the other between Mr. Trump and A... The call came the same day Mr. Trump's administration?issued the first ban on travel?from heavily Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump -- fresh off a campaign that pledged to be tough on immigration -- feared taking in the refugees Australia had been?kept in detention centers in Pacific islands?would be a bad way to start out his presidency.? ""Malcom [sic], why is this so important?"" Mr. Trump asked his Australian counterpart. ""I do not understand. This is going to kill me. I am the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country. And now I am agreeing to take 2,000 people and I agree I can vet them, but that puts me in a bad position. It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week."" ""It was a courteous, frank conversation as President Trump said,"" Turnbull told reporters in the west Australian town of Broome when asked about the transcripts. ""We're both adults. ... I stand up for Australia's interests, he stands up for America's interests. We have a warm relationship."" Mr. Trump originally said reports characterizing the conversation as testy were ""fake news"" made up by the media, and insisted the call had been civil, and he repeated his assertion that the reports were ""fake news"" when he and Turnbull met in New York in May, to which Turnbull responded: ""Yes, that's exactly right."" But the transcript showed the exchange was indeed fraught, with Mr. Trump at one point saying his conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin had been nicer. ""That is enough, Malcolm. I have had it,"" Mr. Trump said, according to the transcript. ""I have been making these calls all day, and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call."" On Friday, Turnbull dodged a reporter's question over whether he regretted characterizing the earlier media reports about the conversation as fake. ""The discussion was a frank one, as the president said, between adults,"" Turnbull replied. ""We've both had plenty of experience in frank discussions."" Australia refuses to settle any refugees who come to its country by boat, in a bid to discourage the dangerous and often deadly ocean crossings. Instead, the country pays Nauru and Papua New Guinea to keep asylum seekers in camps, where they live in harsh conditions that have been condemned by rights groups. The Australian government has said it expects the first refugees to depart for the U.S. in October.

"The Secret Service has moved its command post out of Trump Tower in New York City after a lease dispute, the Secret Service confirmed to CBS News' Mark Knoller on Thursday. The command post had been operating one floor below President Trump's family's apartment. The Secret Service said the move will not affect security. The U.S. General Services Administration, which handles administrative work for the federal government, is trying to work out a lease deal for Trump Tower, Knoller reports.? The Secret Service traditionally protects a president's permanent home. While Mr. Trump moved to the White House in January, his wife, Melania, and 11-year-old son, Barron, stayed in Trump Tower until early June. Mr. Trump has not visited Trump Tower since taking office.? According to The Washington Post, which first reported the story, the command post has been operating out of a trailer on the sidewalk since early July. It's unclear what, exactly, is the lease dispute. The U.S. military is paying $130,000 a month to lease space in Trump Tower, The Wall Street Journal reported in July. That space is expected to be used as the White House military office.																																																																																																																					"

The West Virginia governor -- who seemingly took a shot at former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus by saying the country had a new chief of staff whose name people can pronounce in John Kelly -- sidelined the Russia story. ""Have we not heard enough about the Russians?"" Justice said. ""I mean, to our God in heaven above, think about it! The stock market's at 22,000. And this country has hope, and we're on our way."" Mr. Trump said the only reason Russia is a focus is because Democrats cannot accept his win. ""We didn't win because of Russia. We won because of you,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania? Are there any Russians here tonight?"" the president said. West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice speaks during a rally with President Trump, where he announced that he is changing parties in Huntington, West Virginia, on Thu., Aug. 3, 2017. Instead, Mr. Trump said prosecutors should be focused on finding Hillary Clinton's 33,000 missing emails. The president has sternly and publicly criticized his own Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, for not going after the former secretary of state, even though Mr. Trump after the election told the New York Times he didn't feel strongly about the issue and didn't want to pursue charges against his former competitor. The president also touted his administration's desire to invest an additional $1 trillion in the nation's infrastructure, and curb the number of legal immigrants allowed in the country. Mr. Trump said he wants to prohibit immigrants from going on welfare for five years, a line he gave at a previous rally in Iowa last month. But that's already a provision in current law, something the White House said the president knew after that rally. It's unclear why the president repeated the line. As trouble swirls at home, Mr. Trump has taken to the skies and to the stage to speak to his supporters, blasting the ""fake news"" media, disparaging the ""witch hunt"" Russia investigation and touting his purported successes so far. Thursday's rally marked his seventh since taking office in January. As the president faces blowback on Russia, the GOP's failure to pass health care legislation before the August recess, and even leaked calls in which Mr. Trump admitted to Mexico's president?that building a border wall was of secondary importance, he may need that support more than ever. At the rally, the president's daughter-in-law Lara Trump decired the ""crazy story about Russia."" ""It's so crazy, you have no idea,"" she said. The White House was forced to correct and clarify claims by President Trump about phone calls he said he received from the Boy Scouts and the pre... Mr. Trump visited West Virginia last week as well, when he touted his electoral college win and criticized his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, before the Boy Scouts of America at a national jamboree. The head of the Boy Scouts, Mike Surbaugh, issued a statement apologizing for the speech.? Mr. Trump fueled even more controversy by claiming the head of the Boy Scouts called him to say the speech was the greatest his organization had ever heard. Later, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders conceded Mr. Trump?only spoke to members of Boy Scout leadership in person after the speech.?

"WASHINGTON -- An empty lot in Jersey City, New Jersey is where the Kushner Companies plan to put two gleaming towers of rental apartments and retail space, a project called One Journal Square. But prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn now want to know more about the project's financing. According to the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Attorney's office has subpoenaed the company for information on its use of a program that allows foreigners, residency to get green cards in exchange for investing $500,000 or more in projects that create at least 10 jobs. They're called EB-5 visas. The future site of One Journal Square in Jersey City, New Jersey, under development by the Kushner Companies The Kushner Companies used EB-5 funding for two projects in the same city, the second carrying the president's name: Trump Bay Street. Nicole Meyer, sister to White House adviser Jared Kushner, was in China pitching wealthy investors to help finance a New Jersey real estate proje... Emily Wolf, general counsel for Kushner Companies, told CBS News the program ""is frequently used by many large developers to raise funds and help create jobs"" and they ""did nothing improper."" But in May, the company apologized after Jared Kushner's sister, Nicole Meyer, told potential Chinese investors that the Journal Square project was important to her entire family, and specifically mentioned her brother Jared, now a top aide to the president, raising questions of influence peddling. And there are questions about a Florida company the Kushners used to recruit Chinese investors called the U.S. Immigration Fund. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley is calling for a federal review of that company's arrangement with the Kushner Companies. The EB-5 visa lets wealthy foreigners obtain American visas in exchange for a $500,000 investment in the U.S., a program Jared Kushner's company ... Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop has his own concerns about the use of the visa program for the Trump Bay Street project. ""I think the goal of the EB-5 program is low-income investment in low-income areas. And I think that that obviously didn't serve that goal,"" Fulop said. Jared Kushner's trust still maintains an interest in the Trump Bay Street project, but his lawyers point out he has divested himself of his interest in the One Journal Square project and says he will recuse himself from any matters concerning the EB-5 visa program.

"Since being diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, has undergone three weeks of chemotherapy, among other treatments, and says that he is ""very optimistic"" about his recovery, according to an Arizona Republic/USA Today Facebook live chat. McCain said that his recovery process is going well and that he plans on returning to the Senate in September following the August recess. ""I have not felt anything except feeling good,"" McCain said. The Arizona senator surprised lawmakers when he returned to the Senate floor for a vote on a health care bill aimed at repealing Obamacare earlier this month, just days following his brain cancer diagnosis. McCain's appearance and his subsequent ""no"" vote were crucial to the bill's failure. ""They knew that I was going to vote 'no' so I had to meet with McConnell, I had to meet with a whole bunch of others,"" McCain said in the Facebook live chat. ""We went into the vice president's office because he wanted me to speak to the president, and I talked to the president."" Although there was much speculation on the direction of McCain's vote, the senator explained that he was certain of his vote to strike down the health care repeal legislation. ""Meanwhile the roll call is going on,"" McCain said. ""I came out, and made up my mind a long time before. That was a very interesting moment."" McCain also criticized President Trump's recent staffing changes, saying that ""he can't just keep firing everybody."" ""I try hard not to criticize what the president says,"" McCain explained. ""I try to criticize what he does, and there are some things he has done that I hardly approve of,"" he added. Due to the senator's open and clear criticism of the president, McCain and Mr. Trump have had a tumultuous relationship. ""I will do everything in my power to work with this president,"" McCain said. ""But there might come a time when I have to say 'I can't work with you.'""																																																																																																																					"
"President Trump vowed in a tweet last week to ban transgender people from serving in the military ""in any capacity,"" but a new poll from Quinnipiac University shows such a policy would be opposed by a wide majority of Americans. Sixty-eight percent of respondents in the survey released Thursday said transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military, while 27 percent disagreed. ""Voters say, 'Let them serve,'"" explained Tim Malloy, the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, in a release accompanying the survey. ""They put on uniforms and face the same risks as their brothers and sisters in arms for little reward other than protecting their country."" The latest CBS News/YouGov Nation Tracker poll, released last Sunday, contained similar findings: 61 percent said transgender people should be allowed to serve, while 39 percent disagreed. Capt. Tarrence Robertson of the Minnesota National Guard joins CBSN to react to President Trump's tweet on banning transgender people from servin... The president's tweet spawned a series of questions from the estimated thousands of transgender people currently serving in the armed forces and from the military leaders who would be tasked with implementing such a policy change. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, said the armed forces would make no changes to personnel policies until the Pentagon received further implementation guidance from the president. On the broader question of how accepting the U.S. is toward transgender people, only nine percent said the country is ""very"" accepting. Fifty-one percent said the U.S. is ""somewhat"" accepting, 27 percent said it's ""not so"" accepting, and 10 percent said it's not at all accepting. The poll also asked whether greater acceptance of transgender people in the U.S. would be a good thing or a bad thing. Forty-six percent said greater acceptance would be a good thing, while 14 percent said it would be a bad thing. Thirty-nine percent said it wouldn't make much difference. The Quinnipiac survey also quizzed voters on the Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare that came up short last week in the Senate. By a margin of 64 to 25 percent, voters said they oppose the GOP plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. By an even wider margin, 69 to 26 percent, voters said they oppose cuts to Medicaid 每 a key element of some GOP reform proposals. And on the general question of how Republicans are handling the issue, 80 percent registered disapproval, while only 15 percent said they approve. ""Nobody gets high marks on health care, but Republicans take a crushing blow,"" Malloy analyzed. ""The message: Start over and do it right."" The Quinnipiac poll surveyed 1,125 voters nationwide between July 27 and August 1, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percent.

"In a tweet Thursday morning, President Trump blamed the newly-signed Russia sanctions bill for the relationship between the United States and Russia being at an ""all-time & very dangerous low."" Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low. You can thank Congress, the same people that can't even give us HCare! Mr. Trump reluctantly signed a bill targeting Russia, Iran and North Korea Wednesday. Its passage expands sanctions against the Russian government and establishes that the president will need congressional approval before easing or lifting these sanctions. A portion of the bill also addresses Russian interference with U.S. cybersecurity. Mr. Trump added that ""You can thank Congress, the same people that can't even give us HCare!"" for the bill's approval. The Russia sanctions bill, called the ""Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,"" was overwhelmingly passed through both the House and the Senate last week with veto-proof majorities. Although the president signed the bill, he said he signed it just ""for the sake of national unity"" and said of the measure that ""the bill remains seriously flawed."" ""I favor tough measures to punish and deter bad behavior by the rogue regimes in Tehran and Pyongyang. I also support making clear that America will not tolerate interference in our democratic process, and that we will side with our allies and friends against Russian subversion and destabilization,"" the president's statement reads.

"Some lawmakers on Capitol Hill are outraged over the publication of transcripts of President Trump's calls with foreign leaders and are calling for the swift termination of whomever might be behind their release. On Thursday, The Washington Post published transcripts of two respective January phone calls President Trump had with?Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto?and?Australian Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull. Such transcripts are typically kept secret, and their disclosure is drawing fire from congressional Republicans. Senator Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, called the ""leaks"" of the transcript of the call between Mr. Trump and Pe?a Nieto a ""disservice to the president."" ""Can you imagine being President of the United States, having a conversation with a foreign leader. And that conversation being divulged to the media? It's just not fair to President Trump. The person who did this may think they have a noble outcome in mind, but that is just chaosm,"" Graham told CBS News on Thursday. Graham added that he hopes the administration finds out who the person was that gave the details of the calls to The Post and find out and ""gets punished."" Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee told CBS News that he was encouraged by Mr. Trump's choice in selecting Gen. Kelly as his Chief of staff, saying he hopes it will help ""fire every single person"" who may be leaking sensitive information from within the White House. ""If there is even a thought that somebody was involved, get rid of them! I mean it is unseemly what is happening at the White House right now. Or what has been happening. Again, it appears General Kelly is taking charge,"" said an impassioned Corker on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Corker went on to say that,?""These people should be fired!

"Last Updated Aug 3, 2017 7:53 PM EDT Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington, D.C., as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, a clear sign that the probe is ramping up. CBS News has learned that special counsel Robert Mueller is using a federal grand jury 每 in part to issue subpoenas to compel documents and information as part of his Russia investigation, reports CBS News' Andres Triay and Pat Milton.? The investigation includes Russian interference in the election, Russian hacking, Russian influence, and possible financial wrongdoing. This is according to individuals familiar with the matter. It is unclear whether a new separate grand jury has been impaneled by the special counsel. It is possible Mueller is using an existing grand jury. ? CBS News correspodent Jeff Pegues told ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Anthony Mason the investigation is ""intensifying"" because the special counsel is ""adding to his team."" ""We know investigators are trying to follow the money,"" Pegues said. ""But (they are) also investigating whether there were any improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives."" The Associated Press is reporting chief of staff John Kelly called Attorney General Jeff Sessions over the weekend to reassure him his job was sa... Grand juries give prosecutors the ability to put witnesses under oath if there is evidence of a crime. Mueller and his expanding team will also have the power to seek indictments and subpoena documents. A grand jury had been part of the FBI's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn and was impaneled in Virginia, the Journal reported. That probe has since been taken over by Mueller. It's unclear whether Mueller impaneled a new grand jury or is using an existing one.?The Wall Street Journal?reported Thursday that a grand jury was impaneled in Washington several weeks ago. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders responded to the Journal's report by saying in a statement that?former FBI Director James Comey?had ""said three times that the president is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that has changed."" ? ""This is yet a further sign that there is a long-term, large-scale series of prosecutions being contemplated and being pursued by the special counsel,"" Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, told the paper. ""If there was already a grand jury in Alexandria looking at Flynn, there would be no need to reinvent the wheel for the same guy. This suggests that the investigation is bigger and wider than Flynn, perhaps substantially so."" The existence of the grand jury does not mean that Mueller will necessarily bring charges, former federal prosecutor Thomas Zeno told the Journal, but it also shows he is ""very serious."" ""He wouldn't be doing this if it were winding down,"" Zeno said. President Trump has repeatedly called the investigation into Russian interference, and the alleged connections between his campaign and Russian figures, a ""witch hunt."" He has also suggested that he might attempt to fire Mueller, a former FBI director whose investigation falls under the purview of the Department of Justice. In response, Congress is currently considering bills that would make it harder for Trump to fire Mueller. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller special counsel in May, and Mueller was given a broad mandate to investigate and prosecute any potential crimes he uncovered. The appointment came after Mr. Trump fired then-FBI director James Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation, delegating oversight of the probe to Rosenstein. Ty Cobb, a member of Mr. Trump's legal team, said he was unaware of the existence of the grand jury until he was notified by the Journal, noting ""grand jury matters are typically kept secret."" ""The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly ... The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller,"" Cobb said.

"Congress will have to prove its mettle this fall. It has no choice. Republicans have little to show for their first seven months of controlling the White House and Capitol Hill. The Senate sent Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, and Congress passed bills bolstering veterans' health programs and financing the Food and Drug Administration. It approved another sanctioning Russia for its 2016 election meddling, which President Trump resentfully signed knowing Congress would lopsidedly override a veto. Lawmakers returning from recess after Labor Day will confront a pile of bills they must approve. They'll also face another stack of work they've promised to tackle and that GOP voters elected them to achieve. ...But have yet to prove they can deliver their promised agenda or accomplish the basics of governing. Congressional leaders recognize this risks blowback in next year's midterm elections. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told a displeased voter in Mukwonago, Wisconsin, last week, ""We've got to get it done."" September will give Republicans a chance to complete their responsibilities with minimal fuss. If they deliver a tax cut, GOP thinking goes, much will be forgiven. Two must-do items will dominate Congress' September agenda: increasing the government's debt limit to prevent a jarring federal default and passing a temporary spending bill to avert a government shutdown. Many Republicans can't bring themselves to back a debt limit boost. But they run the government, and it's their responsibility to deliver those votes. Democratic support will be required, and some hope they'll win concessions in exchange. A stopgap measure will be needed because the 12 annual spending bills are behind schedule. There's no agreement on their overall price tag, which will be in the $1 trillion-plus range. One wild card is whether Mr. Trump will press to fund the U.S.-Mexico border wall he's pledged. That could spark a nasty confrontation with Democrats. The White House and Republicans promise to revamp the loophole-choked tax code and lower rates for corporations and individuals. Along with repealing and replacing President Barack Obama's health care law, this is holy grail for the GOP. In a discussion with CBS News contributor and Republican strategist Frank Luntz, a bipartisan group of lawmakers said they see areas of agreement... But core principles remain unresolved, including whether the effort would further bloat the budget deficit. Crucial details must be settled, among them how far to lower rates and which tax credits and deductions would be erased. The last time those problems were reconciled and the tax code broadly reshaped was 1986. The GOP's signature disaster so far this year was the Senate's July rejection of attempts by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to eradicate Obama's health care law. Republican divisions proved fatal, and they're split over what comes next. Mr. Trump has goaded McConnell to keep trying. Senate leaders have shown little enthusiasm for charging back up that hill without the votes to pass something. In a series of tweets, President Trump threatened to end Obamacare payments and continued to push for a repeal of the health care law. He urged G... ""We've pivoted to tax reform and I think we've got to stay on that,"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said in a brief interview Friday. Health committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., says he'll work with the panel's top Democrat, Patty Murray of Washington state, to continue billions in payments to insurers for reducing out-of-pocket costs for low- and middle-income customers. In exchange, Alexander wants to relax coverage requirements that protect consumers under Obama's law. It's unclear the parties can reach compromise. The Senate aims to approve the annual defense policy bill in September. That's when Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., expects to return to Washington after starting brain cancer treatment. He and McConnell wanted to pass the bill last month, but Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., thwarted that plan. Paul wants votes on amendments on indefinite detention and war authorization. McCain has warned he'll use the bill to map a strategy for Afghanistan if Mr. Trump fails to develop a plan. The House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating whether Russia worked with Mr. Trump's presidential campaign to try helping him win the election. The FBI and Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller are also investigating. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denigrated the issue as ""fake news"" and a ""witch hunt."" Lawmakers from both parties seem determined to press on. Senators introduced bipartisan bills last week creating judicial review procedures that could shield Mueller from firing by Mr. Trump. Lawmakers hope to approve a bipartisan bill speeding federal approval of projects to export liquefied natural gas and boosting energy sources and efficiency. Republicans also want to roll back the Endangered Species Act, saying it hinders drilling and logging. Several programs expire Sept. 30, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, a Democratic favorite. Also facing expiration are federal flood insurance and programs run by the Federal Aviation Administration. Conservatives chaff at renewing flood insurance, which is $25 billion in debt. FAA renewal is stuck over a plan to transfer the agency's air traffic control system to a private nonprofit organization.

"Last Updated Aug 5, 2017 11:42 AM EDT President Trump is standing up for his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, calling him a ""good man"" amid calls for his ouster by conservatives. In a statement to CBS News on Friday, the president said, ""General McMaster and I are working very well together. He is a good man and very pro-Israel. I am grateful for the work he continues to do serving our country."" Mr. Trump first issued the statement to the?New York Times?in a story reporting that critics on the right were angered by McMaster's move to push out several conservative staff members on the national security team who had been brought on by Michael Flynn, McMaster's predecessor. Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the 31-year old senior director for intelligence programs at the National Security Council (NSC),?was ousted on Thursday. National security adviser H.R. McMaster listens during a daily briefing at the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House July 31, 2017 in Washington, D.C. ?? ""He has determined that, at this time, a different set of experiences is best-suited to carrying that work forward,"" a statement released by the White House said of Cohen-Watnick's release. ""General McMaster is confident that Ezra will make many further significant contributions to national security in another position in the administration."" Last week, McMaster also removed Middle East director Derek Harvey from his position at the NSC due to a ""difference in vision,"" according to a White House source. Harvey was also hired by Flynn, whose short-lived tenure as national security adviser came to an end in February.? McMaster has also drawn conservatives' ire by advising against pulling out of the nuclear agreement with Iran without a clear strategy in place for what comes next. The attacks directed at McMaster came from conservative news sites and grew on social media. The hashtag #FireMcMaster has been tweeted more than 50,000 times since Wednesday, the Times reported, including by accounts linked to Russian cyber operations. The Times also reported that advisers have floated the idea of Mr. Trump reassigning McMaster to take over as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and installing current CIA director Mike Pompeo as national security adviser.? Such a move would be yet another top-level staff change in Mr. Trump's seven months in office -- and would come shortly after the recent resignations and terminations in the White House communications department and the appointment of John Kelly as White House chief of staff.? In an interview with MSNBC's Hugh Hewitt on Saturday, McMaster applauded the addition of Kelly, saying the former four-start Marine general improves the ability of the West Wing staff ""to operate together as a team."" ""What we've been able to do is to evolve authorities back to where they belong. And instead of thinking about tactics, the next little move, we've been trying to view problem sets and opportunities through the lens of our vital national interests, establish goals. Imagine that. Establish goals for our foreign policy and national security strategies,"" said McMaster.?

For over a decade, the U.N. and the U.S. have tried and failed to halt the advancement of North Korea's nuclear weapons program through sanctions that have been skirted by many nations and without the full support of China, the North's principal trading partner. Reports that North Korea's latest missile test came dangerously close to an Air France jet are raising new concerns about the safety of passenger... The Security Council is set to vote on a U.S.-penned resolution on Saturday, with the goal of pressuring Pyongyang and its rogue leader Kim Jong Un from continuing to develop its intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear capability. The resolution, written with the input of U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley and experts at the State Department, is seen as a diplomatic coup because new punishing sanctions would not be possible without the support of China, which has been reluctant to add pressure on North Korea. The key issue going forward will be if these sanctions will be enforced and whether the sanctions will lead to the opening of negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to put his nuclear program under international supervision. The proposed new sanctions follow North Korea's first successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States on July 3 and July 27. The Security Council has already imposed six rounds of sanctions that have failed to halt North Korea's drive to improve its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons capabilities. The draft resolution condemns the launches ""in the strongest terms"" and reiterates previous calls for North Korea to suspend all ballistic missile launches and abandon its nuclear weapons and nuclear program ""in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner."" Michael Morell, former CIA acting and deputy director and CBS News senior national security contributor, joins ""CBS This Morning"" to discuss the ... The U.S. spent weeks following the initial ICBM launch negotiating the text with China, North Korea's neighbor and ally. The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, called it the ""most impactful and expansive set of sanctions to date"" and said the resolution is expected to be approved unanimously. Agreement on the draft to be put to a vote followed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's comments Wednesday reassuring North Korea that Washington isn't seeking regime change or an accelerated reunification of the Korean Peninsula -- comments welcomed by China's foreign minister. Tillerson also said the U.S. wants to talk eventually with North Korea, but doesn't think discussions would be productive if the North comes with the intention of maintaining its nuclear weapons. North Korea has repeatedly said it will never give up its nuclear arsenal, which it sees as a guarantee of its security. The draft resolution reiterates language in previous Security Council resolutions supporting a return to six-party talks with the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, expressing the Security Council's commitment ""to a peaceful, diplomatic, and political solution to the situation,"" and reiterating the importance of maintaining peace and stability in northeast Asia. It also expresses regret at North Korea's ""massive diversion of its scarce resources toward its development of nuclear weapons and a number of expensive ballistic missile programs"" noting U.N. findings that well over half the population lacks sufficient food and medical care and a quarter of the population suffers from chronic malnutrition. While the draft resolution would impose biting economic sanctions, the U.S. didn't get everything it wanted. In early July, Haley told the Security Council that if it was united, the international community could cut off major sources of hard currency to North Korea, restrict oil to its military and weapons programs, increase air and maritime restrictions and hold senior officials accountable. Oil was not included in the draft resolution and neither are new air restrictions. But the draft resolution would ban all exports of coal, iron, lead and seafood. At the United Nations, the U.S. raised the possibility of military force against North Korea. China and Russia announced that they oppose any use... According to the diplomat, coal has been North Korea's largest export, earning $1.2 billion last year which was then restricted by the Security Council to a maximum $400 million. This year, Pyongyang was estimated to earn $251 million from iron and iron ore exports, $113 million from lead and lead ore exports, and $295 million from seafood exports, the diplomat said. That total is over $1 billion. It's unclear exactly how much money North Korea earns from sending workers overseas but in 2015 the U.N. special investigator on human rights in North Korea, Marzuki Darusman, estimated it was earning between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion annually. Under the draft, countries would be unable to hire any new North Korean workers. The proposed resolution would also add nine North Koreans, mainly officials or representatives of companies and banks, to the U.N. sanctions blacklist, banning their travel and freezing their assets. It would also impose an asset freeze on two companies and two banks. The diplomat called the Foreign Trade Bank ""a very critical clearing house for foreign exchange."" The Mansudae Overseas Project Group of Companies, which was also added to the list, is described in the draft resolution as engaged in exporting workers for construction, including of monuments, in Africa and Southeast Asia. The draft resolution asks the Security Council committee monitoring sanctions against North Korea to ban the import of many more so-called ""dual-use items"" that have commercial use but can also be used in conventional weapons or biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. It would also give a green light for the committee to designate specific vessels that are breaking sanctions from entering ports all over the world, and to work with INTERPOL to enforce travel bans on North Koreans on the sanctions blacklist.

"WASHINGTON -- As President Trump inartfully acknowledged in his call with Mexico's president, New Hampshire is an epicenter of the opioid crisis. He campaigned on a series of policy prescriptions there. ""I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities,"" he said during the campaign. CBS News sat down last week with Richard Baum, acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Richard Baum ""I would give us, give us an A+,"" Baum said when asked to grade the administration's performance on the issue so far. When asked to assess progress on Mr. Trump's promises in the New Hampshire speech, his answers suggested the grade is more of an incomplete. ""We will stop the flow of illegal drugs into our country,"" Mr. Trump said in the speech. ""So having the men and women of Customs and Border Protection and DHS on our border working with infrastructure ＃ is progress and movement in the right direction,"" Baum said of progress on that promise. ""We will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders,"" Mr. Trump pledged. ""We are working closely with the Congress on legislation to have better and tighter controls,"" Baum said. ""I would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that, really, it's an antidote that treats overdoses,"" Mr. Trump promised. President Trump's commission to fight America's opioid epidemic issued a report on Monday recommending ways to combat the crisis. The commission,... ""Well, we in the administration have been advocating for access to Naloxone, Narcan,"" Baum replied. The president's budget asks for $10.7 billion for drug treatment, a $200 million increase. But it would cut $167 million from abuse prevention. And the Trump administration has tried to take credit for what's already in place. ""President Trump and Secretary Price put out $500 million for the 21st Century Cures Act,"" Baum said. When pressed, he acknowledged that money was from the Obama administration. Gary Mendell ""There's no question that candidate Trump was very vocal about attacking this issue. To date, the administration hasn't done anything,"" said Gary Mendell, an advocate who lost his son to the opioid epidemic. The president formed an opioid commission in March. This week, the commission called on Mr. Trump to declare a national emergency and ""act boldly to stop it."" CBS News pointed out to Baum that Mr. Trump had been in West Virginia and Ohio in recent weeks and did not mention the word ""opioid."" ""I'm meeting with people all through the administration at the highest level. And I can tell you ＃ I can tell you there's very strong commitment by the White＃ by the White House and by the president on this problem,"" Baum said in response. The president was in West Virginia again Thursday night and said there's ""a big problem"" there.? On Friday, the Drug Enforcement Agency proposed a 20 percent cut in some of the most commonly prescribed opioids, along the lines of a promise Mr. Trump made in that New Hampshire speech.

The Senate Press Gallery tweeted that the votes the upper chamber took Thursday afternoon were the last of the day and of the month. These were the last votes expected for the week and month in the #Senate. https://t.co/bimU859EWO An aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said leadership still needs to nail down some nominations, but they almost certainly likely to leave by the end of Thursday.

"Last Updated Aug 11, 2017 11:38 AM EDT A transcript obtained by the Washington Post?offered new insight into a January phone call between Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto and President Trump soon after inauguration. Beyond the president's requests that Pe?a Nieto stop publicly refusing to have Mexico pay for Mr. Trump's ""big, beautiful wall,"" the transcript also contains some inaccurate statements. Here's a look at a few of those president's statements: What Trump said: ""In the latest election, I won with a large percentage of Hispanic voters. I do not know if you heard, but with Cuba, I had 84 percent, with the Cuban-American vote. But overall generally, I had well over 30 percent and everyone was shocked to see this. I understand the community and they understand me, and I have a great respect for the Mexican people."" The verdict on this claim? False While Mr. Trump did perform somewhat well among Hispanic voters, compared to Republican nominees Mitt Romney in 2012 and Sen. John McCain in 2008, his reach wasn't ""well over 30 percent."" While Clinton ended up clinching the Latino vote,?CBS News' exit polling found that Mr. Trump secured 29 percent of the vote in 2016. CBS News' Anthony Salvanto later found that Hispanic turnout surged because there are more new Hispanic voters participating in the election process.? President Trump:?""We lost a lot of factories in Ohio and Michigan and I won these states 每 some of these states have not been won in 38 years by a Republican and I won them very easily."" The verdict on this claim? Somewhat true, somewhat false Breakdown of Ohio voters by sex, race Mr. Trump did in fact win in Ohio with 51.7 percent, with the help of white male voters (68 percent). His margin in Michigan was razor-thin -- just 0.2 percentage points -- winning 47.5 percent compared to Clinton's 47.3 percent. What Trump said: ""This is what I have been saying for a year and a half on the campaign trail. I have been telling this to every group of 50,000 people or 25,000 people 每 because no one got people in their rallies as big as I did."" The verdict on this claim? Mostly false Crowd size has been a data point Mr. Trump often brings up. While Mr. Trump's rallies over the course of the campaign were well-attended, but the largest turnout, The Post notes, would have been his Mobile, Alabama rally, attended by an estimated 30,000 supporters. This is comparable to former Democratic candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who also saw some high rally turnout. One in Portland attracted around 28,000 people, and another in Los Angeles garnered 27,500 supporters. What Trump said: ""They are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York. Up in New Hampshire 每 I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den -- is coming from the southern border. So we have a lot of problems with Mexico farther than the economic problem."" The verdict on this claim? Somewhat true, somewhat false Mr. Trump did in fact win the New Hampshire Republican Primary, with his closest rivals trailing nearly 20 points behind him, but it was Hillary Clinton who clinched the state in the presidential election. While close, it was Clinton who edged out ahead with 46.8 percent of the overall vote. When it comes to Mr. Trump's claims of the state being a ""drug-infested den"" due to the impact of the country's opioid ongoing crisis, Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan called his comments about New Hampshire ""disgusting."" .@realDonaldTrump's comments about New Hampshire are disgusting.

"Last Updated Aug 3, 2017 1:27 PM EDT President Trump's leaked January call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull reveals a brand-new president preoccupied with his image, angry over his predecessor's deal to take in refugees and impatient with a foreign ally.? The Washington Post obtained a transcript of a January 28 call Mr. Trump shared with Turnbull, only days after taking office, in which Mr. Trump feared he would look ""foolish"" and ""terrible"" for sticking with an agreement Turnbull and former President Barack Obama made to vet and take in hundreds of refugees Australia had rejected. The call came the same day Mr. Trump's administration issued the first ban on travel from heavily Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump -- fresh off a campaign that pledged to be tough on immigration -- feared taking in the refugees Australia had been kept in detention centers in Pacific islands would be a bad way to start out his presidency.? ""Malcom [sic], why is this so important?"" Mr. Trump asked his Australian counterpart. ""I do not understand. This is going to kill me. I am the world's greatest person that does not want to let people into the country. And now I am agreeing to take 2,000 people and I agree I can vet them, but that puts me in a bad position. It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week."" Turnbull explained that the refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia came to Australia by boat without going through the immigration process, meaning they were rejected and placed on Manus Island and Nauru. Obama had struck a deal with Australia to take up to about 1,300 of them.? ""Look, I do not know how you got them to sign a deal like this, but that is how they lost the election. They said I had no way to 270 and I got 306,"" Mr. Trump said, referencing his electoral college win. ""That is why they lost the election, because of stupid deals like this. You have brokered many a stupid deal in business and I respect you, but I guarantee that you broke many a stupid deal. This is a stupid deal. This deal will make me look terrible."" President Donald Trump told attendees at the annual National Prayer Breakfast not to worry about his important phone calls with foreign leaders. ... The president also complained that the U.S. is treated like a ""dumping ground"" for the rest of the world.? ""Give them to the United States,"" Mr. Trump said later. ""We are like a dumping ground for the rest of the world. I have been here for a period of time, I just want this to stop. I look so foolish doing this. It [sic] know it is good for you but it is bad for me. It is horrible for me. This is what I am trying to stop. I do not want to have more San Bernardino's or World Trade Centers. I could name 30 others, but I do not have enough time."" Mr. Trump continued that he did not want to take the ""bad"" refugees.? ""I hate taking these people,"" Mr. Trump continued. ""I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people."" Throughout the call, Mr. Turnbull assured Mr. Trump the U.S. would have full leverage to vet the ""economic refugees,"" and could allow as few of them into the U.S. as desired. But Mr. Trump wasn't satisfied.? ""I am going to get killed on this thing,"" he told Turnbull.? Turnbull said he wouldn't.? ""Yes, I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people,"" Mr. Trump continued. ""This is a killer."" Mr. Trump agreed to stick to the deal, but made it clear he wasn't happy about it. Mr. Trump said his calls with other foreign leaders -- including Russian President Vladimir Putin -- were more pleasant.? ""I have had it,"" Mr. Trump told Turnbull shortly before ending the call. ""I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.""																																																																																																																					"
"The previously unfireable Ezra Cohen-Watnick, President Donald Trump's controversial 31-year-old senior director for Intelligence programs at the National Security Council, was finally let go from the administration on Thursday.? National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, who unsuccessfully attempted to remove Cohen-Watnick earlier in the year from his post, has been the subject of rumors that he will be removed as National Security Advisor and into a new role in the White House. His academic and process-driven approach that has irked his detractors, particularly hard-line nationalists allied with White House strategist Steve Bannon.? But Cohen-Watnick's ousting, along with two other recent firings, indicates that McMaster has regained control of the office, at least for the time being.? ""He has determined that, at this time, a different set of experiences is best-suited to carrying that work forward,"" a statement released by the White House said of Cohen-Watnick's release. ""General McMaster is confident that Ezra will make many further significant contributions to national security in another position in the administration."" The mercurial Cohen-Watnick was the subject of fascination and scrutiny after Politico first reported that McMaster had attempted to fire him only to be blocked by the president himself at the recommendation of senior advisors Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon.? ""It's crazy that anyone except the National Security Advisor would have an interest in who runs the intel directorate at the NSC but it's clear that Ezra is seen by Bannon and Kushner as 'part of the team' that's loyal to them,"" a former NSC staffer told CBS News at the time.? The Defense Intelligence Agency alum then was soon after thrust into the limelight when the New York Times identified Cohen-Watnick as one of two people who provided House Intelligence chairman Devin Nunes with intel on the Obama administration's requests to unmask Trump campaign staffers in intelligence documents.? A Michael Flynn loyalist, Cohen-Watnick was brought in by Trump's first 〞 and short lived 〞 National Security Advisor at the beginning of the administration. He managed to maintain his position as intelligence director, a job responsible for turning a full range of classified information from various agencies into coherent decisions.? Cohen-Watnick's critics said that his inexperience was of particular concern 〞 ""I assume that McMaster wants to bring in someone with a significant greater degree of experience,"" a former NSC official told CBS 〞 and were also worried about politicizing his role.? Another former NSC Official said they had heard concerns from inside the council that Cohen-Watnick was ""deeply activist outside their lane."" Rich Higgins, the NSC's strategic planning directorate, was also fired last month, according to a report by The Atlantic. Higgins was dismissed for crafting a conspiratorial memo that argued Mr. Trump ?""is under sustained attack from subversive forces both within and outside the government who are deploying Maoist tactics to defeat President Trump's nationalist agenda."" Last week, McMaster also removed Middle East Director Derek Harvey from his position at the NSC due to a ""difference in vision,"" according to a White House source. Harvey was also appointed by Flynn.? A U.S. official told CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan that Harvey's departure was a ""score one for the normals,"" and that Harvey, described as an Iran-Hawk, was ""in over his head"" and had put forth proposals for Syria that didn't mesh with the president's vision.?

"President Trump's frustration with Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto's public denials that Mexico would pay for Mr. Trump's southern border wall was on display in a transcript of the leaders' January phone call, acquired and released by the Washington Post. ""You cannot say that to the press,"" Trump said repeatedly to Pe?a Nieto in response to his public outcries over refusing to fund the border wall, according to a transcript of the Jan. 27 call obtained by The Post. ""If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,"" Mr. Trump added.? The Post published the transcript of the call, which it said had been prepared by the White House but not released. The transcripts were reportedly based on records kept by White House notetakers who monitored Mr. Trump's phone calls. The transcript expands on previous reporting about the tense call?between the two back in January, as well as his past exchanges with Pe?a Nieto during the campaign trail. The president described his major campaign promise to build a ""big, beautiful wall"" as ""the least important thing we are talking about, but politically this might be the most important."" ""On the wall, you and I both have a political problem,"" Mr. Trump said. ""My people stand up and say, 'Mexico will pay for the wall,' and your people probably say something in a similar but slightly different language."" ""I have to have Mexico pay for the wall -- I have to,"" he pressed. ""I have been talking about it for a two-year period."" His reasoning for why Mexico should pay was that it had ""made a fortune out of the stupidity of U.S. trade representatives. They are beating us at trade and they are beating us at the border, and they are killing us with drugs."" While acknowledging that Pe?a Nieto was ""not involved with that,"" Mr. Trump said that nonetheless, all of the billions of dollars made through drug trafficking ""is bigger than the business of taking our factory jobs."" President Trump endorsed a Senate immigration bill that would slash legal immigration to the United States in half. The bill favors high-skilled,... During the call, the president placed much of the blame for America's drug crisis on Mexican drug lords who ""are sending drugs to Chicago, Los Angeles, and to New York."" ""We have a massive drug problem where kids are becoming addicted to drugs because the drugs are being sold for less money than candy,"" Mr. Trump said. He also claimed, ""I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den."" (In fact, Mr. Trump did not win New Hampshire in the presidential election, although he did win the New Hampshire GOP primary.) The president suggested that the Mexican military is ""afraid of"" the drug lords, ""but our military is not afraid of them,"" and he offered to send U.S. help to Mexico. Pe?a Nieto agreed that the two countries should work together but countered that drug trafficking in Mexico is ""largely supported by the illegal amounts of money and weapons coming from the United States."" Mr. Trump continued, pressing Pe?a Nieto to coordinate their messaging on the wall's funding, saying, ""[W]hat I would like to recommend is -- if we are going to have continued dialogue -- we will work out the wall,"" Mr. Trump told him. ""They are going to say, 'Who is going to pay for the wall, Mr. President?' to both of us, and we should both say, 'we will work it out.'"" The president tried to assure his Mexican counterpart that the funding ""will work out in the formula somehow. As opposed to you saying, 'We will not pay,' and me saying, 'We will not pay.'"" Ultimately Pe?a Nieto agreed that talking about the wall was counterproductive. ""Let us stop talking about who pays for the wall, talking about the wall in general, because I think there is a more creative way we can start looking for a solution,"" he told Mr. Trump. ""And it is the way we can remove the big block in our path."" The Mexican Foreign Ministry had no comment about the Post's report. The House has since given tentative approval?to a $1.6 billion down payment for Mr. Trump's long-promised wall. The wall money is attached to defense spending legislation that has passed in the House.

"After the unveiling of the Trump administration's latest agenda-setting direction on immigration reform, Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina says the country needs a ""hybrid"" policy that reflects America's economy and family needs instead. ""I want to make sure that folks have an opportunity to assimilate to what it means to be an American and so what we should look for are hybrids where we meet our economic needs and at the same time allow for family cohesion to be what it always has been, which is the anchor of the American society,"" Scott said on ""CBS This Morning"" Thursday. In 2015, about 25 million foreign-born workers were part of the U.S. labor force. What fields did they flock to? The RAISE act, which Mr. Trump threw his support behind?at a press event Wednesday with the bill's sponsors, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, and Sen. David Perdue, R-Georgia, would establish a ""points-based system for acquiring a green card,"" according to Mr. Trump. It would reduce the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country while also preventing immigrants from collecting welfare once they arrive in the United States. The bill aims to make the U.S. immigration system more competitive through rewarding immigrants who speak English, have financial stability and demonstrate useful skills, among other factors. It would also end ""chain migration"" in the green card application process by only extending to immediate family, such as minor children and spouses. Finally, the legislation would limit the number of refugees permitted to enter the country and eliminate the visa lottery, which makes 55,000 Permanent Resident cards available every year to immigrants from ""underrepresented countries,"" according to the Department of Labor. ""The problems within our legal immigration system isn't the number,"" Scott said. ""If there's needs for reforms, we should reform the systems that need to be reformed, but the reality of it is it has less to do with the number and more to do with reforms and in South Carolina there's a lot of jobs that go unfilled because we can't the workers to do those jobs."" While Scott called the use of a merit-based system of entry for immigrants a ""good idea"" successfully implemented by other countries like Canada and Australia, he said the crucial step is to help fill the ""largest holes in the our economy."" Scott said sectors like STEM (science, technology engineering and math) and agriculture are two areas where workers are desperately needed. Scott's comments come after his South Carolina Republican colleague, Sen. Lindsey Graham, said that if the RAISE proposal becomes law, it would be ""devastating to South Carolina's economy, which relies on the immigrant workforce."" Graham said it would cut the immigration population in half for those who work legally in areas like agriculture, tourism and service industries.? SC #1 industry is Ag. Tourism #2. If proposal were to become law... devastating to SC economy which relies on this immigrant workforce. 3 Scott says it's certainly possible to have both a merit-based program and one that allows for ""family cohesion"" to continue.? ""I'm a big proponent for us to sit down at the table, figure out which way is up, because right now we have a lot of issues we haven't figured that out on, and if we can figure that out, head in that direction. So for me, up is more workers who meet the high demands that we have within our economy. We need to match the folks coming into the country with the jobs that we need."" He added, however, that legal immigration has not been the main priority for lawmakers as of late.? ""There's nothing wrong with making sure that we create access for family members who are already here as long as we do it right, and the legal immigration system has not been the focus, nor has it been the problem for us for the last several years.""?

"Last Updated Aug 2, 2017 5:14 PM EDT Mexican President Enrique Pe?a Nieto is calling into question President Trump's most recent claims that the leader called him to praise his administration's work on the U.S.-Mexico border. ? As Mr. Trump welcomed his new chief of staff John Kelly to the Cabinet table?on Monday, Mr. Trump took time to applaud?the work Kelly had done during his time leading the Department of Homeland Security. ""At Homeland, what he has done has been nothing short of miraculous,"" Mr. Trump said of Kelly. He went on, saying, ""As you know, the border was a tremendous problem and they're close to 80 percent stoppage. And even the president of Mexico called me -- they said their southern border, very few people are coming because they know they're not going to get through our border, which is the ultimate compliment."" But Pe?a Nieto denies that ever happened. A statement released by the Mexican Foreign Ministry said Pe?a Nieto ""has not recently spoken to President Donald Trump over the telephone."" The statement went on to reference the only other time the?two met and conversed on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit. ""During the meeting the two heads of State held last July 7th in Hamburg, Germany, the topic of migration was a topic of conversation approached by both. President Pe?a Nieto shared that repatriations of Mexican nationals from the United States had fallen 31 percent between January and June 2017 in comparison to the same timeframe in 2016,"" the statement read.

"A federal appeals court in Washington has agreed to let a group of states get involved in a lawsuit over government payments to insurers as part of the Obama administration's health care law. It's an intervention House Republicans had opposed. House Republicans trying to thwart the Affordable Care Act sued the administration in federal court in 2014, arguing the law lacked specific language appropriating the ""cost-sharing"" subsidies. A district court judge agreed with House Republicans but the case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On Tuesday, the court allowed a group of state attorneys general to join in the case, in defense of the subsidies. In an order, the court says the states have ""demonstrated the appropriateness of their intervention.""

"Raised voices could be heard through the thick door to the Oval Office as John Kelly 〞 then secretary of Homeland Security 〞 offered some tough talk to President Donald Trump. Kelly, a whip-cracking retired general who was sworn in as White House chief of staff on Monday, had demanded to speak to the president alone after Mr. Trump complained loudly that the U.S. was admitting travelers from countries he viewed as high risk. Kelly first tried to explain to Mr. Trump that the admissions were standard 〞 some people had legitimate reasons to visit the country 〞 but the president insisted that it was making him look bad, according to an administration official familiar with the exchange about a month ago. Kelly then demanded that other advisers leave the room so he could speak to the president frankly. Mr. Trump refused at first, but agreed when Kelly insisted. It was an early indication that Kelly, a decorated retired Marine general who served three tours in Iraq, is not afraid to stand up to his commander-in-chief. Tapped to bring order to a chaotic West Wing, Kelly began to make his mark immediately Monday, ousting newly appointed communications director Anthony Scaramucci and revising a dysfunctional command structure that has bred warring factions. From now on, said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, all senior staffers 〞 including the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and chief strategist Steve Bannon 〞 will report to Kelly instead of the president. Sanders said Tuesday that Kelly had spent his first day on the job speaking with members of Congress, getting to know White House staffers and working to put new procedures in place. ""It definitely has the fingerprints of a new sheriff in town,"" said Blain Rethmeier, who guided Kelly through the Senate confirmation process for the Homeland Security post. Rethmeier said that what stood out about Kelly during the time they worked together was the way Kelly commanded respect from everyone he encountered 〞 and the way he respected others. Kelly drew praise from lawmakers of both parties Tuesday. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., expressed confidence that Kelly can help restore order, saying on NBC's ""Today"" show that ""the Marines have landed at the White House. They have a beachhead."" And Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois told CNN that Kelly ""is in a position where he can stabilize this White House, that's good for this country. The president has to be part of that."" Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser during the Trump presidential campaign, predicted on CNN that Kelly's next move will be to put people in place that will help the president. He suggested Kelly should convince ousted press secretary Sean Spicer to stay on, at least through the tax overhaul effort. Kelly fostered a reputation as an outspoken commander who didn't shy away from unpopular opinions during his military career. Rethmeier said that Kelly also respects authority deeply 〞 ""and that's something that Trump sort of smells out, if you respect him or not."" ""If he disagrees with you, he'll disagree respectfully,"" Rethmeier said. It was a point Kelly made clear during his confirmation hearing in January. ""I have never had a problem speaking truth to power, and I firmly believe that those in power deserve full candor and my honest assessment and recommendations. I also value people that work for me speaking truth to power,"" he said. In April, Kelly bluntly challenged members of Congress critical of the Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement to either change the laws or ""shut up."" But after being confirmed as part of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, Kelly also tried to moderate some of the president's hard-line positions, even as he publicly defended them. Kelly and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, another retired general, were also said to have been deeply frustrated with the rollout of Mr. Trump's refugee and immigration ban, and made clear to associates that they were not involved in drafting it or aware of its details around the time that Mr. Trump signed the original order. Both moved swiftly to address gaps in the measure, with Mattis asking that Iraqis who helped U.S. troops be exempt and Kelly clarifying that green-card holders would not be affected. Nonetheless, Kelly launched a particularly robust defense of the order to lawmakers and reporters, which was welcomed by the White House. Mattis and Kelly also agreed in the earliest weeks of Mr. Trump's presidency that one of them should remain in the United States at all times to keep tabs on the orders rapidly emerging from the White House, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The official insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the administration's internal dynamics. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn, said Monday that he discussed Kelly's appointment with Mr. Trump and hopes Kelly ""will do everything possible to bring the appropriate discipline and focus that needs to be at the White House there."" ""I hope that Gen. Kelly will absolutely, forcefully clean the place up,"" Corker said. ""And anybody who's been a violator, who's been a part of public backbiting, part of undermining, who's been part of feathering their own nest at other people's expense, I hope they'll all be gone."" David B. Cohen, a University of Akron political science professor writing a book on chiefs of staff, applauded Kelly for doing ""things that should have been done on Day One of Reince Priebus's tenure."" He said Scaramucci's removal sent a clear message ""that going off-script and being undisciplined"" would no longer be tolerated at the White House. But Cohen wondered how long Mr. Trump would go before undermining Kelly. ""President Trump is his own worst enemy,"" he said. ""He instinctively likes to be his own chief of staff and he's a pretty awful one."" Bill Galston, a former Clinton administration domestic policy adviser now at the Brookings Institution, said the ball is now in the president's court to help Kelly succeed. ""If the president is not prepared to accept an orderly policy process with all of the restraints on individual conduct and behavior, then the chief of staff will not have the power to implement policy,"" he said.

"As the Senate's August recess approaches, Democrats are looking ahead to the next policy item on their agenda 〞 trade.? On Wednesday morning, Senate Democrats will roll out their latest trade policy proposals. Among them are the creation of the American Jobs Security Council -- an entity that can veto proposed foreign purchases of U.S. companies -- along with an independent trade prosecutor to go after foreign countries so companies don't need to rely on the World Trade Organization, and principles for any renegotiation of the controversial North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trade is one piece of the Democrats' tagline heading into the 2018 midterms, which is, ""A Better Deal: Better Skills, Better Jobs, Better Wages."" Democrats argue better trade deals will raise incomes and create more well-paying jobs for low and middle-income Americans.? President Trump is promoting his plans to renegotiate trade deals and bring factory jobs to the United States. The president's trade policy inclu... The proposed American Jobs Security Council would closely examine foreign companies' plans to acquire U.S. companies, and have the authority to stop any purchases that would distort the market or lead to fewer U.S. jobs. The council would take a particular interest in any detrimental effects to economically distressed industries and regions.? The independent trade prosecutor would be tasked with revamping the trade enforcement system to evaluate petitions of alleged trade violations filed by unions, businesses and trade associations. It would coordinate with the Department of Labor, Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce, but operate with its own authority. Foreign nations found in violation of U.S. policies would face restrictions to U.S. market access or other punishments. Senate Democrats also argue that NAFTA, if it is renegotiated, should support more American jobs and higher wages, and protect workers' health and safety.? Other components of the Democrats' plan includes proposals that all taxpayer-funded public works and infrastructure projects strictly use U.S. companies for work, and that Congress pass laws punishing countries that manipulate their currency and penalize U.S. companies sending jobs and factories overseas through taxes.? Democrats have searched for an on-key economic message to rally around in 2018, the first election since President Trump took office.? But trade is one area in which Democrats and Mr. Trump might find some common ground. In the past, the president has urged a tougher stance on China for manipulating currency, and on companies that leave the U.S. for foreign soil. And one of the first things he did as president was to withdraw from the massive Trans Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade deal with 11 Pacific Rim countries. Mr. Trump has also said on several occasions that he wants to negotiate ""great"" new bilateral trade deals with other countries.

"Senate Republicans are giving up on their one-sided effort to repeal Obamacare for now, just days after their attempts to dismantle the 2010 health care law collapsed. Many have their eyes on the exit door for the August recess, which House members already left for last Friday. As for what's next on the agenda, many are angling to shift toward bipartisan health care discussions, as well as other priorities like tax reform. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, made no mention of health care in his floor speeches Monday or Tuesday, signaling that his party's energy should be focused on other items of their agenda. ""I think it's pretty obvious that our problem on health care was not the Democrats,"" McConnell told reporters Tuesday. ""We didn't have 50 Republicans."" Over the weekend, President Trump threatened to pull federal funding from the Affordable Care Act, which would cause health care premiums to incr... Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, turned toward the other side of the aisle on the Senate floor Tuesday to ""ask them what their suggestions are"" on health care. ""I think, frankly, bipartisan solutions tend to be more durable,"" he admitted, adding that Congress should focus on overhauling the tax code and repairing the nation's crumbling infrastructure. President Trump, however, has been urging Senate Republicans to keep moving forward on health care. He tweeted on Sunday, ""Don't give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option), get Cross State Lines & more."" He also threatened to end cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments that the government issues to insurance companies in order to lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Democrats quickly criticized the move. ""These payments are critical to keeping health care costs down and keeping the markets stable,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, on the Senate floor on Tuesday. ""Make no mistake: by refusing these payments, President Trump is sabotaging our health care system. He's actively trying to make it collapse, taking out his political loss on the American people."" Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions (HELP) Committee, said Tuesday that he has urged the president to continue CSR payments through September. The committee, he announced, will hold bipartisan hearings the week of September 4 on actions Congress should take to stabilize the strengthen the individual health insurance market. Some of the witnesses, he said, would include insurance commissioners, patients, insurance companies and governors. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Tuesday that Republicans should have held bipartisan hearings from the beginning and she issued a message for the administration on CSRs: ""It's absolutely essential that the cost-sharing reductions be continued and when I hear them described as an insurance company bailout, that is just not an accurate description. The reason that we have CSRs is to help low-income people who earn only between 100 and 250 percent of the poverty rate afford their out of pocket costs and that seems to be lost in the debate."" There's more chatter, meanwhile, about bipartisan health care fixes. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, said Monday, ""There are groups of us getting together on a bipartisan basis trying to forge a way forward. Nothing that will be done this week. But I think longer term. The immediate goal has to be stabilizing and supporting the exchanges so that the insurance continues to be available."" While the House passed a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in early May, a group of Democrats and Republicans in the House released a plan Monday to help stabilize the individual health insurance market. The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus said 43 members have signed onto the plan, which would aim to bring CSR payments under congressional oversight, create a stability fund to help states reduce premiums, adjust the employer mandate by exempting smaller firms, repeal the medical device tax and provide guidelines to states that want to enter into regional compacts or alter their exchanges. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, has developed a proposal with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, to repeal Obamacare's individual mandate and provide a flexible block grants to send money to states. Cassidy met at the White House Tuesday with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, and Republican governors from Wisconsin, Arizona, Mississippi and Arkansas. He said it can get traction if the Senate moves ""beyond partisan politics."" Other GOP senators, meanwhile, are frustrated that their party has hit a dead end. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, says he hopes the president makes some changes to the law unilaterally. ""So I'm hoping that President Trump will move forward with doing some of this by executive action,"" he said. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake believes the GOP is no longer conservative. In his new book, the Arizona senator writes: ""Never has a party so quickly... ""I don't think we should quit,"" said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota. ""We have to recognize that there are people out there who are seeing huge increases in their premiums and in some cases, they're not going to see a market at all. We can't simply give up. We have to find solutions."" While they lost their momentum, McConnell said Tuesday that Senate Republicans still have a legislative vehicle if they want to return to the health care law, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is still scoring proposals from Cassidy, Graham and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Even if Republicans wanted to revive their repeal effort again, they likely won't be able to do that for a while. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who helped kill their pursuit of a repeal last week, is back in Arizona to undergo chemotherapy and radiation for brain cancer. Without McCain's support, it would be very hard to pass any repeal bill due to the GOP's slim majority.? ""I'm not saying that we will return to it immediately because we've got a lot of other work to do,"" Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, said about repeal efforts. ""I think the sentiment among the Republican members of the Senate, the sentiment seems to be -- okay, we couldn't put it together, but we will circle back and try again."" As for tax reform, McConnell said that Republicans will take it up when lawmakers return to Washington after Labor Day. He said they'll have to use budget reconciliation to pass a bill, which would make the legislation subject to only a majority vote rather than a supermajority.? CBS News' John Nolen, Catherine Reynolds and Emily Tillett contributed to this report.

"The fight over the Affordable Care Act is far from over. The newest front is President Trump's threat to end what he calls ""bailouts for insurance companies.""? What Mr. Trump terms bailouts are called cost-sharing reduction payments (CSRs), or payments the federal government makes to insurers to compensate them for providing lower-deductible plans to low- and middle-income enrollees. The payments are no stranger to controversy, given they're currently the focus of a lawsuit after the GOP-led House challenged their legality.? If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon! If Mr. Trump does end those payments, it raises questions about how it will affect the health insurance market and individuals who get their coverage through it. The payments are slated to cost the government $7 billion this fiscal year and $10 billion in 2018, and withdrawing that support could have a ripple effect through the health care economy.? The bottom line, experts say, is the payments' elimination is likely to hurt consumers who buy their insurance through the ACA exchanges and throw the marketplace into greater turmoil.? ""Low-income people will not see an increase in premiums, but the middle class, who are not subsidized, will see the impacts directly,"" said Dr. Mario Molina, CEO of Molina Healthcare. ""Those who supported Trump, essentially, will get hurt."" While the CSRs aren't pocket change, taxpayers could end up footing an even bigger bill if the Trump administration shuts off the spigot, according to the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care issues.? That's because premiums would likely rise as insurers cope with the fallout from the decision, and that would result in the government paying more in subsidies to offset those higher premiums. Altogether, it could cost the federal government $31 billion more over a decade than if it continued with the payments, Kaiser found. ? Over the weekend, President Trump threatened to pull federal funding from the Affordable Care Act, which would cause health care premiums to incr... While premiums have increased considerably over the last year, what the Trump administration does next could have a large impact on pricing trends going forward.? ""It's important to lay out the consequences of not paying these payments, because they're not what the president thinks they are,"" said Andy Slavitt, former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. ""This is money that goes directly to low-income individuals. If you lay out the fact they're not paid, you'd like to think that would have an impact on the White House's thinking."" Cutting the CSRs could also ripple through the market if healthy consumers decide it's not worth the higher costs to stick with the ACA, said Linda Blumberg, senior fellow at the Urban Institute.? ""Many of these people leaving the nongroup market could also increase premiums for higher-income people who would remain in the market, since many of those enrolled with tax credits are healthy,"" said Blumberg. ""And if many of them leave the market, it means the average health care risk of those that remain would increase, as would their premiums."" ? On top of the impact on consumers, the health care industry would also face additional challenges, including an increase in uninsured patients and people seeking care through emergency rooms.? ""Most people don't like chaos in the system because it's harder to manage health care,"" said Ben Isgur, leader at the PwC Health Research Institute. ""From an industry point of view, no, there's not an upside"" to ending the CSRs.? In a series of tweets, President Trump threatened to end Obamacare payments and continued to push for a repeal of the health care law. He urged G... He added, ""For doctors and for health systems and hospitals, they want people who have insurance who can pay for their care and whom they can manage. If you are an insurance company, you generally want more customers, not less."" Whatever happens, the indecision in the marketplace isn't helping the health of the ACA, experts said. ""If the policymakers keep stringing this along and don't make a clear policy decision, 2018 marketplace premiums can be expected to increase markedly as an insurer defense mechanism, and choices may diminish if insurers exit,"" Blumberg noted.? Here are some of the ways a decision to end the CSRs could hit your wallet:? It could affect premiums for ACA plans.?Insurers would likely increase premiums to offset the loss of the CSR payments, with an estimated hike of about 20 percent, said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Foundation. But because lower-income consumers receive government subsidies to offset their premiums, the impact would be mainly felt by upper-income Americans who buy their plans through the marketplaces. ""It may become unaffordable for people who are paying their own way,"" PwC's Isgur said.? It could change deductibles for ACA plans.?Low- and middle-income consumers who benefit from the CSRs could face higher-deductible plans. For instance, the payments reduce a roughly $3,600 deductible for people who make less than 150 percent of the poverty level to $255, according to the Kaiser Foundation. Without the payments, more consumers will ask whether they can afford their plan's deductible, Isgur says.? More insurers could drop out of the ACA marketplaces.?That's a possibility, but insurers have until Sept. 27 to contract with the marketplaces, said the Kaiser Foundation's Pollitz. ""Insurers could say, 'We're out,'"" she said. ""If that happens, low-income people would be affected because if there are no plans, then you can't have any subsidies."" Workers with employer-based plans could see changes.?It's an indirect impact, but the destabilization of the ACA marketplace could make it more expensive for entrepreneurs to find health care. That could result in ""job lock,"" which is when workers decide against shifting jobs or starting their own businesses because they want to keep their current employer-based health care, Isgur said.? If Trump cuts the payments, how quickly could it affect insurance plans? Almost immediately, said Kaiser's Pollitz. The federal government makes the CSR payments at the end of each month, and it has already paid for July. That could end as soon as August, which would quickly ripple through the insurance market. ""If the administration were to cancel today, it's possible some insurers may try to exit the market before the end of the year,"" she said. ""People are nervous.""? -- With reporting by Emily Tillett ?																																																																																																																					"
"A U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn has subpoenaed the New York property development business owned by Jared Kushner's family, according to The Wall Street Journal. The firm, Kushner Companies, was subpoenaed in May over an investment-for-immigration program, according to the report, at at least one development in Jersey City, New Jersey. The development, it said, was partially financed by a federal visa program known as EB-5. The program allows entrepreneurs, their spouses and children under 21 to apply for a green card. Congress created the program in 1990 to ""stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign investors."" Lawmakers then created the Immigrant Investor Program in 1992, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. It says that it sets aside EB-5 visas for people who invest in commercial enterprises associated with regional centers approved by the government agency. As part of the subpoena, New York prosecutors requested documents and emails, the report said, but it isn't clear what potential violations are being investigated. ""Kushner Companies utilized the program, fully complied with its rules and regulations and did nothing improper. We are cooperating with legal requests for information,"" the company's general counsel, Emily Wolf, told the newspaper. The report says that the family company also used the EB-5 program for another Jersey City property as well, but it's unclear if the subpoena also applies to that one. Kushner's personal attorney said in a statement Wednesday that he had recused himself from ""matters concerning the EB-5 programs,"" the report said.

"A poem at the Statue of Liberty that is a national symbol for the country's embrace of immigrants became the topic of a rancorous exchange Wednesday at a White House news conference to announce President Donald Trump's push for immigration reform. Senior White House aide Stephen Miller told reporters the poem written by Emma Lazarus about the ""huddled masses"" is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. In 2015, about 25 million foreign-born workers were part of the U.S. labor force. What fields did they flock to? Miller said the statue is a ""symbol of American liberty lighting the world"" and suggested it had little to do with immigrants. Miller's comment prompted ridicule on social media and angry responses from immigrant rights advocates. Miller was responding to a question from CNN reporter Jim Acosta asking if the Trump administration's new merit-based green card proposal was keeping with U.S. tradition. The reporter read a line of the Lazarus sonnet, ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses."" ""The poem you were referring to was added later,"" Miller said. ""It's not actually part of the originally Statue of Liberty."" The National Park Service says Lazarus' sonnet depicts the statue ""as the 'Mother of Exiles:' a symbol of immigration and opportunity 〞 symbols associated with the Statue of Liberty today."" The statue was a gift from France commemorating its alliance with the United States during the American Revolution. Edouard de Laboulaye, a French political thinker and abolitionist, proposed the idea of the statue and made sure broken shackle and chain were at the right foot of the statue. Writers and authors later asked Emma Lazarus, a poet and descendant of Jewish immigrants, to write a sonnet to be sold at an auction to raise money for a pedestal to hold the Statue of Liberty. A controversial executive order from President Trump has critics noting that without immigrants, America wouldn＊t be the country it is She wrote ""The New Colossus"" on Nov. 2, 1883, inspired by the plight of immigrants and refugees and her own experiences. The poem appeared in Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and The New York Times. She died four years later and the poem eventually faded from public memory. In 1901, a Lazarus friend, Georgina Schuyler, found a book containing the poem and started an effort to resurrect the work. Her words were eventually inscribed on a plaque and placed on the statue's pedestal. The poem reads, ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."" The Statue of Liberty and nearby Ellis Island have since become welcoming symbols for immigrants and refugees coming to the United States. It draws thousands of visitors each day.																																																																																																																					"
"WASHINGTON -- Ousted White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci had high hopes for improved relationships with reporters, according to a memo posted online Wednesday. The memo list five priorities for the communications staff, including ""Improve the culture"" and ""Fill the content void."" Scaramucci has confirmed he wrote the memo. It was posted on Medium.com by right-wing media personality and Trump supporter Mike Cernovich. Scaramucci provided a copy to CBS News. In it, he writes, ""This is the key〞everything is possible with a good culture, nothing is possible without it."" One way to do that, he says, is to ""meet with media members ＃ where possible, on their home turf to build bridges and foster better working relationships. WH should leave old grudges behind, but never forget."" Scaramucci writes that President Trump ""can choose to fight with the media, but Comms can not,"" and he even suggests ""a constructive 'complaint box' for the media to make complaints."" Still, the memo points out, ""Comms is a Customer Service Operation - POTUS is the Number One Customer."" It says the office needs to ""humanize"" Trump and suggests ""a national online lottery to play a round of golf with him ... or a charity auction."" Scaramucci also calls for ""video content that constructively operates as 'The President Donald J. Trump' show."" Scaramucci envisions running the communications department ""like a news channel with producers, scripts, and narration"" that will be able to ""dictate the news of the day on most days."" After his appointment was announced, Scaramucci was very vocal about leaks coming out of the White House - even telling a New Yorker reporter he wanted to ""kill all the leakers."" His memo is a little more restrained. He writes: ""No more threats about leaking and internal game playing - anyone who takes actions that do not serve the President will be dismissed - period. We will eliminate the bad eggs and send a powerful message to the remaining staff that well-intentioned mistakes are acceptable, but misconduct is not."" The memo is dated July 30, just a day before Scaramucci was ousted by new chief of staff John Kelly. Scaramucci was named to the position on July 21.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 3, 2017 11:20 AM EDT Donald Trump once questioned the wisdom of taking vacations. ""What's the point?"" he asked. But now the president is getting ready to join the annual August exodus from this town he calls ""the swamp."" Trump is due to set out Friday on his first extended vacation from Washington since the inauguration 〞 a 17-day getaway to his private golf club in central New Jersey. The president's vacation could be driven, in part, by necessity. Everyone who works in the White House West Wing, including the Oval Office occupant himself, will be forced to clear out by week's end so that the government can replace the balky, 27-year-old heating and cooling system. But the White House hasn't been entertaining questions about the president's August plans. Asked whether Trump would be leaving Washington this month, given his recent warning that Congress should stick around until they vote on health care legislation, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday: ""We'll continue to keep you guys updated on his August schedule as those details are finalized."" Trump and his supporters like to tout his disdain for taking vacations, when the truth is he takes them constantly. ""Don't take vacations. What's the point? If you're not enjoying your work, you're in the wrong job,"" Trump wrote in his 2004 book, ""Trump: Think Like a Billionaire."" ""Don't take vacations. What's the point? If you're not enjoying your work, you're in the wrong job."" -- Think Like A Billionaire He told Larry King in an interview that year that ""most of the people I know that are successful really don't take vacations. Their business is their vacation. I rarely leave. You know that,"" Trump said. ""You and I are friends. How often do you see me going away?"" Actually, Trump gets out of town quite often. So far, he has spent 13 of his 28 weekends in office away from the White House, mostly at his properties in Palm Beach, Florida, or in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to an Associated Press count. The figures include a weekend during official travel overseas, and Father's Day weekend at Camp David, the government-owned presidential retreat in Maryland. Contrast Trump's own frequent getaways with his criticism, before and during last year's presidential campaign, of former President Barack Obama's vacations and frequent golf outings. ""@BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard. Nice work ethic,"" Trump tweeted in August 2011. Trump said last year that he wouldn't have time for golf if he became president. ""I'm going to be working for you, I'm not going to have time to go play golf,"" he told supporters in Virginia. But he plays golf whenever he's at his clubs; sometimes it's the full 18 holes, other times less than that. His staff rarely acknowledges that he plays, even when photos of him on the course pop up on social media. Presidents have been escaping Washington's summer heat and humidity ever since Thomas Jefferson looked out of the White House windows and watched as a white fog that was believed to be toxic rolled in. Harry Truman played poker on the porch in Key West, Florida. Ronald Reagan rode horses at his mountain ranch in California. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both spent August vacations on Martha's Vineyard, the tiny Massachusetts island that serves as a summer playground for the rich and famous. George W. Bush retreated to his secluded Crawford, Texas, ranch to clear brush and ride his mountain bike. Besides the replacement of the West Wing's heating and cooling system, repairs are also to be made to the steps on the South Portico, the side of the White House facing the National Mall. Cosmetic upgrades, including interior painting, replacing carpeting and curtains and fixing water leaks in the press office ceiling, are also on the maintenance list. Repairmen and others are expected to work around the clock during the coming weeks to complete all the upgrades by Aug. 21. Presidents travel with the equivalent of a mini-White House made up of advisers, other aides and security, and they must be prepared to deal with a crisis at all hours and from wherever they are. But chronic stress affects the body's ability to resist infection, maintain vital functions and avoid injuries, Susan Krauss Whitbourne, then a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote in a 2010 paper on the website of Psychology Today subtitled ""why presidents (and all of us) need vacations."" Stressed out people are more likely to get sick, have accidents, sleep poorly, be more irritable and less fun to be around. Whitebourne wrote that vacations break the ""stress cycle."" ""Perhaps it's good that someone as important as our president is showing that he believes it's beneficial to take a break from the office, get out and enjoy the outdoors in a little bit of a break in mindset and, we would hope, be able to go back to work refreshed and renewed and do a better job,"" Whitbourne, who currently teaches at the university's Boston campus, told the AP in a telephone interview. ""I think that's the theory of vacations.""																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 3, 2017 10:02 AM EDT President Donald Trump's endorsement of legislation to restrict and reshape legal immigration is based on some shaky assumptions, such as the idea that low-wage green-card holders are flooding in to take jobs from Americans. Mr. Trump swung behind a bill from Republican Sens. David Purdue of Georgia and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, calling it ""the most significant reform to our immigration system in half a century"" if made law. A look at statements about the bill Wednesday: TRUMP: ""The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on our taxpayers."" President Donald unveiled legislation that would place new limits on legal immigration and seek a system based on merit and job skills instead of family connections. THE FACTS: That doesn't reflect the weight of recent economic research. Many economists dispute a major study, cited by the White House, that claims low-skilled immigrants hurt wages. Harvard economist George Borjas said the arrival of thousands of Cuban refugees in Miami in 1980 led to lower wages for existing low-skilled workers, but red flags have been raised about his methods. Much of the recent research suggests that immigration has no significant effect on job growth for U.S.-born workers in the long-run. Most economists also say the benefits of immigration outweigh the costs 〞 a point made in a letter to congressional leaders in April that was signed by 1,470 economists, six of them Nobel laureates. Researchers have also found that in many states, the benefits of consumer spending by immigrants and taxes paid outweigh any government costs. In North Carolina, for every dollar spent on health care and education, the economy got $11 back from Hispanic residents in consumer spending and taxes paid 〞 a finding that includes immigrants in the country illegally, said James Johnson, a demographer at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. TRUMP: ""The RAISE Act prevents new migrants and new immigrants from collecting welfare, and protects U.S. workers from being displaced. And that's a very big thing. They're not going to come in and just immediately go and collect welfare. "" PERDUE: ""Over 50 percent of our households of legal immigrants today participate in our social welfare system."" THE FACTS: Over 50 percent is a stretch unless you define welfare in its broadest terms. About 58 percent of immigrant families with children have used ""any welfare,"" compared with 42 percent of U.S.-born families with children, according to the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. That includes even subsidized or free lunches offered generally in low-income schools, not specifically to people who have applied for assistance. As for the food-stamp program known as SNAP, 27 percent of children of immigrants have received such benefits, versus 25 percent of those with U.S.-born parents, according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis of the 2015 American Community Survey. The National Academies saw little difference between immigrant and non-immigrant families with children when it comes to cash welfare assistance. About 6 percent of families in both groups received such payments. TRUMP: ""For decades, the United States ... has operated a very low-skilled immigration system, issuing record numbers of green cards to low-wage immigrants."" THE FACTS: He misrepresented who many immigrants are. Immigrants are increasingly better educated than people born in the United States. This makes them more likely to earn decent incomes and less likely over time to rely on public assistance. The Pew Research Center said in 2015 that 41 percent of immigrants who had arrived in the past five years held a college degree, much higher than the 30 percent of non-immigrants in the United States. And 18 percent held an advanced degree, also much higher than the U.S. average. Here's the link to the Pew study:?http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/05/todays-newly-arrived-immigrants-are-the-best-educated-ever/ The median household income headed by someone with at least a college degree was $94,934 in 2015, well above the national median of $58,044, according to the Census Bureau. ?

"WASHINGTON -- Two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are moving to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller's job, putting forth legislation that aims to ensure the integrity of current and future independent investigations. Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware plan to introduce the legislation Thursday. The bill would allow any special counsel for the Department of Justice to challenge his or her removal in court, with a review by a three-judge panel within 14 days of the challenge. The bill would be retroactive to May 17, 2017 - the day Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties to Donald Trump's campaign. ""It is critical that special counsels have the independence and resources they need to lead investigations,"" Tillis said in a statement. ""A back-end judicial review process to prevent unmerited removals of special counsels not only helps to ensure their investigatory independence, but also reaffirms our nation's system of check and balances."" Mueller was appointed as special counsel following Mr. Trump's abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey. Mueller, who was Comey's predecessor as FBI director, has assembled a team of prosecutors and lawyers with experience in financial fraud, national security and organized crime to investigate contacts between Moscow and the Trump campaign. Members of Congress have a message for President Trump: Don't antagonize the special counsel or you could regret it. Nancy Cordes reports from th... Mr. Trump has been critical of Mueller since his appointment, and the president's legal team is looking into potential conflicts surrounding the team Mueller has hired, including the backgrounds of members and political contributions by some members to Hillary Clinton. He has also publicly warned Mueller that he would be out of bounds if he dug into the Trump family's finances. Mueller has strong support on Capitol Hill. Senators in both parties have expressed concerns that Trump may try to fire Mueller and have warned him not to do so. ""Ensuring that the special counsel cannot be removed improperly is critical to the integrity of his investigation,"" Coons said. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, another member of the Judiciary panel, said last week that he was working on a similar bill that would prevent the firing of a special counsel without judicial review. Graham said then that firing Mueller ""would precipitate a firestorm that would be unprecedented in proportions."" The Tillis and Coons bill would allow review after the special counsel had been dismissed. If the panel found there was no good cause for the counsel's removal, the person would be immediately reinstated. The legislation would also codify existing Justice Department regulations that a special counsel can only be removed for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest or other good cause, such as a violation of departmental policies. In addition, only the attorney general or the most senior Justice Department official in charge of the matter could fire the special counsel. In the case of the current investigation, Rosenstein is charged with Mueller's fate because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from all matters having to do with the Trump-Russia investigation.

"Perhaps the presidency, at least when it's in the hands of someone who does not know how to use it, is less important than we thought. Despite Republican control of both houses of Congress, it's inarguable that Donald Trump's presidency has so far been remarkably ineffective. With the failure of the Obamacare repeal, it's increasingly likely that he will end his first year in office without any real legislative accomplishments. Trump, for all his tough-guy, get-it-done rhetoric, appears more and more like a ceremonial head of state, albeit one without a highly attuned sense of ceremony. He talks big, makes sweeping promises. And yet it all seems to come to nothing. His contempt for behavioral norms notwithstanding, his is a presidency oddly marked by stasis. The White House is confirming and defending President Trump's involvement in drafting a statement about his son's June 2016 meeting with a Russia... The government, of course, still functions. The cabinet secretaries and the legislature do their jobs, more or less. The social security checks are still sent out. Our military, guided by H.R. McMaster and James Mattis, still conducts operations across the globe. The economy Trump inherited continues its impressive, if uneven, growth. Meanwhile, the president appears wholly consumed with the palace drama currently being staged in his White House, and the numerous investigations he cannot escape. His obsession with loyalty leaves him unable to staff his administration, with dozens of top jobs still vacant across the executive branch. Trump obviously makes news. He delights in symbolic populism and the rallies he still holds. His tweets still interrupt the cable news broadcasts he compulsively watches. Yet, as a practical matter, none of what he does has much real effect. The travel ban? Eviscerated by the courts. That transgender military ban no one asked for? It might never materialize. An infrastructure bill or tax reform? Maybe next year. In the past, when faced with hostile congresses, presidents like Richard Nixon and George H.W. Bush tried to make their big impact through foreign policy. That's where modern presidents have the most leeway, with Congress having outsourced many of its responsibilities in that area to the White House. But Bush and Nixon were Republicans facing down Democratic congresses, while Trump is a Republican dealing with a weak Democratic Party. And in a marked departure from what he campaigned on, Trump has fully embraced the GOP's agenda. When it came to an issue like health care, he made it clear he'd sign whatever his Republican colleagues gave him. Still no luck. Trump doesn't know how to work legislators, and doesn't seem interested in learning. Asked last week by the Wall Street Journal how he had tried to assist in the repeal of Obamacare, the man who ran as the world's best negotiator launched into a riff on how the Boy Scouts love him. When it comes to strong-arming Congress, Trump makes Barack Obama look like Lyndon Johnson. Amazingly, Trump even seems to have lost control of his own foreign policy. His central proposal on the subject during the 2016 campaign was a better relationship with Vladimir Putin's Russia. Yet seven months into his presidency, our relationship with Moscow is worse than at any time since the Cold War. On Wednesday, Trump meekly signed a sweeping sanctions bill, passed with a veto-proof majority, targeting Moscow. The bill also strips his ability to lift the sanctions without congressional approval. He complained about that provision, of course, in a statement accompanying his signature. The president has signed new sanctions against Russia for interfering in the 2016 presidential election. The bipartisan bill also impacts North K... With Trump, the buck always stops somewhere else. He could do better, he insists, but they won't let him. ""I built a truly great company worth many billions of dollars,"" his statement concludes, with a typically egocentric non-sequitur. ""That is a big part of the reason I was elected. As President, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress."" Trump cares about being liked. He cares about being respected. He cares about everyone knowing how much he is supposedly worth, and how he won the election against the odds, and how Russia had nothing to do with that outcome. But so far, he has shown no signs that he truly cares about governing the country. Of course, Trump or no Trump, the presidency is still important in terms of buoying national morale and serving as a unifying force in times of great distress. That remains an essential facet of the job. In some other Western democracies, like Great Britain or the Netherlands, this role is allotted to the otherwise powerless monarchs who serve as head of state. In America, however, the Constitution says our head of state is also our head of government. And it's the latter that Trump seems particularly uninterested in. Trump relishes the pomp and circumstance that comes with being a head of state; he wanted his inauguration to include a grand parade of military might, one of his many passing ideas that have been shot down by those who know better. He enjoys the meetings with foreign leaders at the White House. He likes calling them up, he told the Journal, and asking how many people live in their countries: ""[Y]ou call places like Malaysia, Indonesia, and you say, you know, how many people do you have? And it's pretty amazing how many people they have."" Under Trump, we have seen a great divergence between what personally interests the president and what is going on in the country he's been elected to lead. That could change; at this point in George W. Bush's presidency, it's worth remembering, we were only five or so weeks out from 9/11. Sparing such a catastrophe, Trump shows us that a president can choose to just glide along leave the important stuff to other people. He can, for the moment at least, indulge in not taking it seriously -- to function, in fact, as a ceremonial president. Perhaps he gets lucky. Perhaps the looming threats from abroad simmer out, the economy continues to hum along to a tune of benign indifference, and the Democrats remain too hapless to retake the government. All of that is possible. Then again, at some point, everyone's luck runs out.?																																																																																																																					"

"TRENTON, N.J. -- Gov. Chris Christie reminded people on Wednesday that he didn't dump nachos on a Chicago Cubs fan who heckled him. Speaking at an unrelated event in Trenton, the Republican governor said three days after he confronted a heckler at a Milwaukee Brewers-Cubs game that he won't quit attending baseball games. ""I didn't dump the nachos on him or anything, which was an option,"" Christie said. ""No, I'm not swearing off baseball games in any way."" Christie was carrying nachos when he was caught on video calling the fan, Brad Joseph, a ""big shot"" during Sunday's game. Christie said Joseph heckled him once and he confronted Joseph after a second jibe. ""I will take a certain amount of abuse,"" Christie said. ""You're a public official, you have to. But usually it's one. You get one shot to call me a name or curse me out."" A former high school classmate of Christie's who masterminded the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scheme in a political vendetta targeting a Christie foe says he wasn't so lucky. ""Wish all he dumped on me were some nachos,"" tweeted David Wildstein, a former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey official who contradicted Christie's account that he didn't know about the bridge plot until months afterward and was sentenced last month to three years of probation.

"NEW YORK -- New White House chief of staff John Kelly, in one of his first acts in his new post, called Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reassure him that his position was safe despite the recent onslaught of criticism he has taken from President Trump. Kelly called Sessions on Saturday to stress that the White House was supportive of his work and wanted him to continue his job, CBS News and AP can report. The people demanded anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about a private conversation. CBS News has confirmed the call occurred. Kelly, who was appointed to the post the day before, described the president as still miffed at Sessions but did not plan to fire him or hope he would resign. Mr. Trump has seethed at Sessions, his one-time close ally, since the attorney general recused himself from the probe into Russia's meddling into the 2016 election. The president viewed that decision as disloyal - the most grievous sin in Trump's orbit. That simmering anger burst to the surface last week. In an unprecedented display of a president publicly criticizing a sitting member of his own Cabinet, ?Mr. Trump unleashed repeated attacks via Twitter. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is facing continued criticism from the president and the DOJ is announcing crackdown on criminal leaks. CBS News j... He called Sessions ""beleaguered"" and ""very weak"" and belittled his decision not to investigate Hillary Clinton. He said he was ""disappointed"" in Sessions and suggested that, had he known he would recuse himself, he never would had offered him the attorney general post. And he dismissed the value in Sessions' early endorsement -- he was the first senator to back Mr. Trump -- while privately musing to aides about firing the attorney general. ""We will see what happens,"" Mr. Trump said of Sessions' future when asked at a news conference last week. ""Time will well. Time will tell."" Mr. Trump is known for openly considering staffing changes without following through. Likewise, Sessions' newfound job security could also be viewed as temporary and subject to the president's whims. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the conversation. The Department of Justice also did not immediately respond. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that ""the president has 100 percent confidence in all members of his Cabinet"" and dismissed talk that Sessions or other Cabinet members could be moved. President Trump ratcheted up attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday. He refused to say whether Sessions' job is safe. The president... Kelly, a retired general, was brought in from the Department of Homeland Secretary to restore some discipline and stability to a chaotic White House. The outreach to Sessions appears to have been a top priority in that effort. Despite Mr. Trump's continuing anger, his allies quickly recognized the danger in attacking Sessions. The longtime Alabama senator was the forefather of many of Mr. Trump's hardline immigration policies and remains very popular among the president's conservative base. Sessions and Kelly have also been allies and traveled together to the Mexican border in April to highlight immigration plans when the chief of staff was in his former post as head of homeland security. Moreover, many Republican senators and influential members of the conservative media rushed to the attorney general's defense when Mr. Trump went on the attack last week. They suggested that Sessions has been the most effective member of Mr. Trump's Cabinet delivering on campaign promises, while some White House aides feared that firing Sessions could spark a significant political backlash. Instead, the White House has recently embraced some of Sessions' directives. On Friday, Mr. Trump traveled to Long Island, New York, to tout his administration's efforts to combat the MS-13 gang at the same time Sessions was in El Salvador for events concerning the same violent cartel. Though Mr. Trump did not mention Sessions by name, the attorney general told The Associated Press that he hoped to remain in the post and would serve as long as Mr. Trump wanted him. And on Wednesday, senior White House aide Stephen Miller -- a former Sessions staffer who has written most of Mr. Trump's speeches on immigration -- delivered a full-throated case for slashing legal immigration. The proposal is unlikely to become law since it is opposed by several Republican senators, yet it is popular among much of the president's base.

"The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are ""very open"" to updating the president's war powers that have been in place and unchanged since after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, after a number of senators met with the two top Trump cabinet members on the topic Wednesday. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, said Tillerson and Mattis are open to eliminating the current Authorization of Use of Military Force (AUMF), if a replacement is ready. Congress passed the AUMF in 2001 to give the president broad authority to retaliate against anyone who contributed to the terrorist attacks, but the AUMF has continued to justify military intervention abroad for more than 15 years. ""I'm confident that they'll work with us,"" Corker said of Tillerson and Mattis. Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, and Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, are spearheading a bipartisan push to update the president's war powers and require congressional approval before the president can take military action. Kaine also told reporters after meeting with Tillerson and Mattis that the two seem open to changing the AUMF, not because they believe they need to legally to intervene abroad, but because they think it would be good to have Congress' support. Earlier Wednesday, the State Department issued a statement to Corker saying the current AUMF is sufficient. ""The United States has sufficient legal authority to prosecute the campaign against al-Qa'ida and associated forces, including against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS),"" the State Department said in a letter to Corker. ""This legal authority includes the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) which authorizes the use of military force against these groups.

Democrats in particular -- and some Republicans as well -- are arguing that Congress never intended the AUMF, passed in the urgent days after Sept. 11, 2001, to authorize the president's authority the way it is used today, and Congress should have approval before military intervention abroad. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, said he was in Congress when it passed the 2001 authorization, said it was never intended to be used to fight ISIS, and told reporters it's important for Congress to pass a different resolution on how to deal with ISIS so it isn't an ""open-ended"" issue. Sen. Tom Udall, D-New Mexico, took to Twitter to offer a similar sentiment. Never intended my 2001 vote authorizing use of military force to cover US military action in Syria in 2017. We need to debate a new #AUMF. https://t.co/P0Ni7aqlHz Rep.

"Sen. John McCain pronounced President Trump's objections to the sweeping sanctions measure he signed Thursday ""misplaced"" and said it was ""critical"" that Mr. Trump comply with and implement the act, as signed.

""The Framers of our Constitution made the Congress and the president coequal branches of government,"" McCain wrote. ""This bill has already proven the wisdom of that choice.""

This bill will prove the wisdom of that choice,"" that is, that Congress would come to regret the sanctions legislation.?

McCain also had an answer for that line. ""While the American people surely hope for better relations with Russia, what this legislation truly represents is their insistence that Vladimir Putin and his regime must pay a real price for attacking our democracy, violating human rights, occupying Crimea, and destabilizing Ukraine,"" McCain wrote. ""On this critical issue of national security policy, it was the Congress that acted in the spirit of national unity to carry out the will of the American people.""

"Last Updated Aug 2, 2017 7:02 PM EDT The calls of praise President Trump told the Wall Street Journal he received from the head of the Boy Scouts and from Mexico's president were actually in-person conversations at last month's G-20 summit in Germany and with individual Boy Scout leaders, incoming White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was forced to admit Wednesday. Mr. Trump said in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal that the head of the Boy Scouts had called him to say his recent speech was the ""greatest speech,"" and Mexico's president, Enrique Pe?a Nieto, called him and told him fewer people were crossing the border. Both the Boy Scouts of America and Mexico denied those claims. Sanders, asked about the disparate accounts in Wednesday's press briefing, said the president had the conversation with Pe?a Nieto at the G-20 in Hamburg, Germany, and the president's claims of a conversation with the head of the Boy Scouts were actually conversations he had with individual Boy Scout leadership members after his recent speech at their national jamboree in West Virginia. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaks during a briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wed., July 26, 2017. ""I wouldn't say it was a lie,"" Sanders said, asked if the president lied. The Mexican Foreign Ministry did say that Pe?a Nieto ""shared that repatriations of Mexican nationals from the United States had fallen 31 percent between January and June 2017 in comparison with the same timeframe in 2016."" Mr. Trump made the initial comment about alleged praise from the Boy Scouts after the Wall Street Journal mentioned the mixed reaction to his speech. The president defended his speech after Chief Scout Executive Michael Surbaugh issued a statement apologizing for the president's politically charged speech. Mr. Trump touched on several hot-button political topics, including criticizing former President Barack Obama, discussing congressional efforts to repeal Obamacare, and his electoral victory. ""We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program,"" Surbaugh's statement read. But the president's statements on Mexico and the Boy Scouts weren't the only things his administration had to defend from the podium at the briefing Wednesday. Sanders and Stephen Miller, senior adviser to the president for policy, went to bat for the president's support of legislation introduced earlier Wednesday to curb the number of legal immigrants admitted to the U.S. Miller said Mr. Trump is keeping a ""major promise to the American people"" to push for ""merit-based"" immigration reform. Immigrants, Miller said, should be able to support themselves financially and know English, among other requirements.

"Last Updated Aug 2, 2017 2:17 PM EDT In a Wednesday speech in the White House's Roosevelt Room, President Trump endorsed a bill which would reform immigration in the United States by creating a more competitive visa-approval system aimed at scaling back the number of immigrants entering the country. Mr. Trump described the bill as ""legislation that would represent the most significant reform to our immigration system in half a century."" The Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) bill, introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, and David Perdue, R-Georgia, establishes a ""points-based system for acquiring a green card,"" according to Mr. Trump, while also preventing immigrants from collecting welfare once they arrive in the United States.? ""The RAISE Act will reduce poverty, increase wages and save taxpayers billions and billions of dollars,"" Mr. Trump said. The bill aims to make the U.S. immigration system more competitive through rewarding immigrants who speak English, have financial stability and demonstrate useful skills, among other factors relevant to the merit-based system. It would also end chain migration in the green card application process by only extending to immediate family, such as minor children and spouses. Finally, the legislation would limit the number of refugees permitted to enter the country and eliminate the visa lottery, which makes 55,000 Permanent Resident cards available every year to immigrants from ""underrepresented countries,"" according to the Department of Labor. If the bill is passed, those seeking entry into the country may either apply for the narrow family-based immigration category, or may compete in the points-based application process. Ultimately, the bill would significantly reduce the number of immigrants, including refugees, entering the United States. ""This legislation demonstrates our passion for struggling American families,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that the change in immigration policy ""puts America first."" The president asserted that the current immigration system ""has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers,"" and that he hopes the proposed bill will protect U.S. workers from being displaced by reducing the number of unskilled immigrants coming to the United States.? ""The reforms in the RAISE Act will help ensure that newcomers to our wonderful country will be assimilated, will succeed and will achieve the American dream,"" Mr. Trump said. Perdue compared the bill's immigration plan to those in place in Australia and Canada, adding that the current immigration system in the United States prevents the country from being a successful economic power on the world stage.? ""What we're talking about today is very simple: it's measured, it's a rational approach to immigration that will allow us to finally fix, once and for all, this broken system in a strategic way that will reposition America as a global leader economically,"" Perdue said.? Cotton described the current system for those hoping to enter the United States as ""an obsolete disaster."" A statement released by Cotton's office explains that the legislation ""would spur economic growth and raise working Americans' wages by giving priority to the best-skilled immigrants from around the world and reducing overall immigration by half."" In a speech delivered by the president last week during a rally in Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Trump referenced the bill and his hopes to reform immigration. ""As we speak, we are working with two wonderful senators, Tom Cotton and David Purdue, to create a new immigration system for America,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Instead of today's low-skill system, just a terrible system where anybody comes in. People that have never worked, people that are criminals, anybody comes in. We want a merit-based system. One that protects workers our workers, our taxpayers, and one that protects our economy.""

"NEW YORK? -- Former FBI Director James Comey has a book deal. Flatiron Books told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Comey is writing a book about leadership and decision making that will draw upon his career in government. Comey will write about experiences that made him the FBI's best-known and most controversial FBI head in recent times, from his handling of the bureau's probe into Hillary Clinton's private email server to allegations of ties between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign.? Trump fired Comey in May and soon after told NBC News that he was angered by the FBI's investigation into ""this Russia thing with Trump and Russia,"" which he called a fake story. Comey has since testified before Congress that Trump asked him to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn and kept memos about his meetings with the president. According to Flatiron, Comey will cite ""examples from some of the highest-stakes situations in the past two decades of American government"" and ""share yet-unheard anecdotes from his long and distinguished career."" The book is currently untitled and scheduled for next spring. ""Throughout his career, James Comey has had to face one difficult decision after another as he has served the leaders of our country,"" Flatiron Publisher and President Bob Miller said in a statement. ""His book promises to take us inside those extraordinary moments in our history, showing us how these leaders have behaved under pressure. By doing so, Director Comey will give us unprecedented entry into the corridors of power, and a remarkable lesson in leadership itself."" Comey was represented by Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn of Javelin. Financial terms were not disclosed, but several publishers bid for the book and three officials with knowledge of the negotiations said the auction topped $2 million. The officials asked not to be identified because were not authorized to discuss the book. Comey was appointed as FBI director by President Barack Obama in 2013. On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed his successor, Christopher Wray, a former high-ranking official in President George W. Bush's Justice Department who oversaw investigations into corporate fraud.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 2, 2017 11:23 AM EDT President Trump has signed a sweeping sanctions measure that targets Russia, Iran and North Korea, the White House said in a statement Wednesday. The president's signature comes after some speculation that he could veto or not sign the legislation, which passed both chambers of Congress in overwhelming votes last week. Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials had signaled, however, that Mr. Trump planned to sign the bill into law. While he signed the bill, the president made clear in a statement Wednesday that he's signing the bill ""for the sake of national unity"" even though he isn't?satisfied with some of its provisions.? ""I favor tough measures to punish and deter bad behavior by the rogue regimes in Tehran and Pyongyang. I also support making clear that America will not tolerate interference in our democratic process, and that we will side with our allies and friends against Russian subversion and destabilization,"" he said.? He added, ""Still, the bill remains seriously flawed 每 particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch's authority to negotiate."" The bill maintains and expands sanctions against the Russian government. Most importantly, it will require congressional approval before the president can ease or lift sanctions on Russia. The measure also targets sanctions on Russian activities that undermine U.S. cybersecurity, sanctions on Russian crude oil projects and on certain transactions with foreign sanctions evaders and human rights abusers, among other things. A day after the Senate passed the new set of sanctions, Russia's Foreign Ministry last Friday announced countermeasures in which it set a Sept. 1 deadline for Washington to reduce the number of diplomatic staff in the country and ordered some U.S.-run facilities in Russia to close. In response to Russia's meddling in the 2016 election, Congress has imposed new sanctions on the country. CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer... Mr. Trump's signature is significant given that he spent time on the 2016 campaign trail promoting a platform that included a warming of relations with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. The two leaders met in person for the first time in early July at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. Mr. Trump later came under fire for a previously undisclosed conversation that he had with Putin at the time over dinner in which only a Russian interpreter was present. The measure also targets Iran's ballistic missile program, its support for terrorism and human rights violations, and yet it would still comply with the Iranian nuclear deal. Specifically, it imposes sanctions on any foreign person or foreign entity that does business with an entity already designated by the administration that has a connection to Iran's ballistic missile program. These sanctions, for example, could apply to any financial institution or any foreign company that provides key parts or components to Iran's missile program. As for North Korea, it enforces compliance with United Nations shipping sanctions against North Korea and it imposes new sanctions in response to human rights abuses by the North Korean government and its bellicose behavior abroad.? The bill came together?in July after a series of road bumps that lawmakers encountered over the last several months. ? This also comes a day after the Senate confirmed Christopher Wray to serve as FBI director, replacing James Comey, who Mr. Trump abruptly fired in early May. Special Counsel Bob Mueller then took over the federal investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election, which is still underway. The U.S. intelligence community concluded in a report in early January that Putin ordered a campaign involving covert intelligence operations and overt propaganda to undermine faith in the U.S. election, disparage Hillary Clinton and help Mr. Trump's election chances. CBS News' Jillian Hughes contributed to this report.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 2, 2017 3:51 PM EDT The Boy Scouts are disputing President Trump's claim that he was told his speech last week at their national jamboree event was the ""the greatest speech ever made to them."" In an interview with The Wall Street Journal after the event last week, the president claimed that he received a call from the head of the Boy Scouts praising his speech. This came after Mr. Trump appeared to get annoyed that a reporter said that there was ""mixed"" reaction to his speech. ""There was no mix there. That was a standing ovation from the time I walked out to the time I left, and for five minutes after I had already gone. There was no mix,"" Trump said, according to a transcript obtained by Politico. ""And I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful. So there was -- there was no mix,"" Mr. Trump added. President Trump waves after speaking to Boy Scouts during the National Boy Scout Jamboree at Summit Bechtel National Scout Reserve in Glen Jean, West Virginia, on July 24, 2017. But the Boy Scouts said Wednesday that they aren't aware of a call being placed to the White House by national leadership, saying that a statement from the organization's chief scout executive last week speaks for itself. ""I want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree,"" Michael Surbaugh said in the statement last Thursday. ""That was never our intent. The invitation for the sitting U.S. President to visit the National Jamboree is a long-standing tradition that has been extended to the leader of our nation that has had a Jamboree during his term since 1937. It is in no way an endorsement of any person, party or policies."" The speech from the president was highly political, with comments, for example, calling on Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, boasting of states where he beat Hillary Clinton, and blasting the ""fake media."" ?

"Sean Spicer still plans to leave the White House by the end of the month, according to Reuters. A senior official confirmed that the former press secretary is still leaving at the end of August, the report said. This comes after Anthony Scaramucci was fired Monday as the new communications director, just 10 days after he was hired for the job. The decision to hire Scaramucci last month led to Spicer announcing that he would resign from his position. Scaramucci later announced that Sarah Huckabee Sanders would take on the role of press secretary. There was some speculation that Spicer would stick around after all once Scaramucci was removed. As the news began circulating Monday afternoon, Spicer came out of his office where he had huddled with various people. He happily asked, looking at a dozen or so reporters in the hallway, if there was a surprise party. These moves were a part of a staff shake-up that resulted in the replacement of Reince Priebus as chief of staff last Friday by?retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly. Kelly had been serving as Homeland Security secretary.?																																																																																																																					"
"While President Trump has made clear to the world that his administration will not support the Paris climate agreement, former Vice President Al Gore says he still has hope as a surge of activism has sprung up in reaction to Mr. Trump's policies. These images paint a startling picture of the environmental changes afoot across the globe as temperatures rise ""Even though President Trump announced he was going to pull out of the Paris agreement, the very next day the world doubled down on their commitment,"" said Gore on ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday. Gore applauded the work of state governors and local mayors who are committed to combatting the effects of climate change, saying, ""It now looks as if the U.S. has an excellent chance to meet our commitments under the agreement, regardless of President Trump."" He said, however, even with the commitment of world leaders across the globe, ""it's still not enough,"" but the support ""lays a strong foundation on which to build stronger action."" ""The world would benefit from U.S. leadership, but Tump is on other side of that,"" added Gore. It's been over a decade since Gore's film, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" was released, highlighting the imminent impacts of climate change, and now, Gore says, extreme weather conditions linked to these changes have become ""way more serious and common."" Gore's new film, ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power"", which serves as a follow-up to the 2006 release, highlights the continuing efforts to combat the effects of climate change across the country.

He added, ""If they can put out some false doubt, a lot of people will go, 'Oh, OK, we don't have to worry about this now' 〞 but we do, because it's here now.""

But Gore says that the recent uptick in support from a majority of Americans to find new ways to prevent the effects of climate change offers hope for the future.

"WASHINGTON 〞 Republican senators are bucking President Donald Trump's calls to revive the health care debate. And Trump just ousted his only top White House aide with deep links to the Republican Party. But the president and his party won't be calling it quits any time soon. They remain tightly linked by a force more powerful than politics or personal ties: cash. Trump's fundraising prowess is the engine of the Republican National Committee and a lifeline for every Republican planning to rely on the party for financial help during next year's congressional races. Leaning heavily on Trump's appeal among small donors, the party has raised $75 million in the first six months of the year, more than double what the Democratic National Committee had raised by the same point in President Barack Obama's first year. ""The president is somebody who absolutely is an asset when it comes to fundraising,"" RNC chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said. Trump resonates with a base of Republicans who have been more willing this year than ever before to chip in. The party says it collected more cash online in the first six months of the year than in all of 2016. In late June, Trump played star and host of a fundraiser for his re-election campaign and the RNC. The event at the Trump International Hotel, just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, raised $10 million to be divided between Trump and the party, the kind of bounty usually reserved for the final months before an election. The fundraising numbers help explain why more Republicans 〞 particularly those facing re-election next year 〞 aren't openly distancing themselves from a president whose approval rating hovers below 40 percent and whose White House has been wracked by public back-biting and legislative stumbles. And while Trump hasn't hesitated to call out Republicans who defy him, he's largely come to appreciate the permanence the RNC offers a White House that has had to quickly staff up from nothing 〞 a task that hasn't always gone smoothly. Trump's dismissal last week of chief of staff Reince Priebus prompted a rush of concern from Republican lawmakers who'd gotten to know Priebus during his nearly six years as party chairman. Some wondered if Trump was losing his only link to the Republican Party. Yet the well-funded RNC has been reformatted for the Trump era. ""The president likes the fact that the party is structured to help his agenda, and there's not a question that this RNC is 100 percent loyal to him,"" said Brian Ballard, one of the party's lead fundraisers. ""It's not like the RNC he inherited as the party's nominee; it's his now."" Party employees have led communication at key points of the investigations into whether the Trump campaign had anything to do with Russian interference in the presidential election. And the RNC, realizing how important television is to this particular White House, has added employees to help book Trump proponents on cable shows. There are awkward GOP moments, to be sure. Just this week, Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, in his new book, called out Trump for his ""seeming affection for strongmen and authoritarians."" Trump over the weekend on Twitter ridiculed Senate Republicans for not passing a health care bill, saying Democrats were laughing at them and they ""look like fools."" McDaniel said the president has ""every right"" to engage with Republicans however he sees fit. ""The American people put him in office to accomplish his agenda,"" she said. She's backed him up on Twitter: ""I run into people every day who are hurting across the country under Obamacare,"" she wrote recently. ""Giving up is not an option."" Priebus and others at the RNC were squeamish about their presidential nominee at various points during the 2016 campaign, but few if any detractors remain at its headquarters on Capitol Hill, where the hallways are lined with portraits of Trump and blown-up snapshots of him. The RNC voted McDaniel in as party chair on Trump's recommendation. As the Michigan GOP head, she'd been a staunch Trump supporter even as her uncle, 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, expressed his own reservations about Trump during the campaign. Trump also tapped Bob Paduchik, his campaign's Ohio director, to serve as a deputy to McDaniel. The two remain close, and Paduchik traveled with Trump last month for a rally in Youngstown. Trump's family, including son Donald Trump Jr. and daughter-in-law Lara Trump, Eric Trump's wife, are involved in the RNC's strategy and fundraising and have grown close to McDaniel. Longtime Trump friend Steve Wynn, a fellow billionaire businessman, is the party's chief fundraiser, and the president's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is among the RNC's principal fundraisers. His campaign's trusted data and digital director, Brad Parscale, joined the board of Data Trust, the party's data vendor, which keeps its voter files up to date. Trump heaped praise on the RNC's leadership team during the June fundraiser, calling them stars and winners. Bill Stepien, the White House's political director, said relations between the party and the president are as good now as they were in the mid-2000s, when he worked at the RNC while George W. Bush was president. Stepien said the White House and the party have ""a strong relationship"" and that Trump's aides view the RNC as an ""essential component"" of his success.

"CARACAS, Venezuela -- The White House is condemning what it calls ""the Maduro dictatorship"" over the arrests of two top opposition leaders in Venezuela before dawn Tuesday.

In a statement, the White House calls them political prisoners and says they are ""being held illegally by the regime"" led by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The statement adds: ""The United States holds Maduro - who publicly announced just hours earlier that he would move against his political opposition -- personally responsible for the health and safety of Mr. Lopez, Mr. Ledezma, and any others seized.""

"WASHINGTON?-- The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Christopher Wray, President Donald Trump's choice to replace James Comey as head of the FBI. The Senate overwhelmingly approved Wray 92-5, concluding an afternoon of debate over his nomination that was as uneventful as Comey's departure was chaotic. Wray is a former high-ranking official in President George W. Bush's Justice Department who oversaw investigations into corporate fraud. The 50-year-old Wray will inherit the FBI at a particularly challenging time given Trump's firing of Comey, who was admired within the bureau. Wray won unanimous support from the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, with Republicans and Democrats praising his promise never to let politics get in the way of the bureau's mission. ""Beyond credentials, I believe Mr. Wray has the right view of the job,"" said Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. FBI director nominee Christopher Wray prepares to testify during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 12, 2017 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Wray replaces Comey, who was abruptly fired by Trump in May amid an investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump's campaign. The Judiciary panel is also investigating Russian interference. At his confirmation hearing, Wray told senators he ""sure as heck"" would not offer a pledge of loyalty to the president. Asserting his independence, he said, ""My loyalty is to the Constitution and the rule of law. Those have been my guideposts throughout my career, and I will continue to adhere to them no matter the test."" Democrats said Wray has the qualifications and independence to lead the bureau. The top Democrat on the panel, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, said Wray ""has the strength and fortitude to stand up and do what it is right when tested."" She added: ""We need leaders with steel spines, not weak knees, and I am hopeful that Mr. Wray will be just such a leader."" Wray has worked on white-collar crime and regulatory cases as a partner at the King & Spalding law firm. From May 2001 to May 2005, he held various high-ranking positions in the Justice Department, rising to the head of the criminal division in September 2003. He also served as principal associate deputy attorney general. He was a federal prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Georgia from May 1997 to May 2001. Wray had represented New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Aug 1, 2017 4:19 PM EDT Following a report that President Trump dictated a statement?to his son Donald Trump Jr. regarding his meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that Mr. Trump only ""weighed in"" and ""offered suggestions"" on Trump Jr.'s statement. ""He certainly didn't dictate,"" Sanders said at a White House press briefing Tuesday afternoon. ""But you know he -- like I said he weighed in, offered suggestion, like any father would do."" The Washington Post first reported that Mr. Trump allegedly dictated his son's message about his 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Trump Jr.'s statement claims that the main topic of discussion in the meeting ""was not a campaign issue,"" but was rather about the adoption of Russian children. Sanders insisted that the initial statement Trump Jr. issued was true. The statement, allegedly dictated by Mr. Trump, reads as follows: It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand. Sanders added that the discussion in the meeting itself was ""of no consequence."" She asserted that the meeting was ""disclosed to the proper parties"" after its occurrence and that ""there was no follow-up."" Later, Sanders said that any media coverage regarding the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election was part of ""a phony scandal based on anonymous sources."" ""The Democrats want to continue to use this as a PR stunt and are doing everything they can to keep this story alive and in the papers every single day,"" Sanders said. ""The only thing I see [as] misleading, is a year's worth of stories that have been fueling a false narrative about this Russia collusion,"" she later added. Last month, the president's attorney, Jay Sekulow, denied that Mr. Trump had anything to do with it. ""This was Donald Trump Jr. and his lawyers,"" Sekulow said on ""CBS This Morning"" in July.

"WASHINGTON 〞 Who do you trust to know what's best for air travelers? Members of Congress or the hero of the Miracle on the Hudson, retired Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger? Proponents of privatizing air traffic control, a top priority of President Donald Trump, face fierce resistance from some Republicans, many Democrats and various advocacy groups. The opponents have a forceful voice: Sullenberger, the pilot who managed to land an airliner in the Hudson River without the loss of a single life after the plane lost thrust in both engines. Sullenberger said he considers the legislative proposals an attempt to boost the bottom lines of the airlines at the expense of the public. He's speaking out, knowing that the actions he and his crew took that January day in 2009 have given them a bully pulpit with the American public. ""They trust us,"" said Sullenberger, most recently portrayed on film by actor Tom Hanks. ""They know we're experts at what we're talking about."" ※Face the Nation§ takes a look back at one of the happier news stories of recent years. Privatization, plus another proposal that would make it easier for co-pilots to get academic credit for certification, have drawn opposition and stalled efforts to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, a must-do for Congress by Sept. 30. The Republicans opposed to privatization recognize they have a flying ace to make their case. ""No man was better when it came to safety standards. And then he demonstrated it that day, that he knew what he was talking about,"" said Rep. Steve Russell (R-Okla.). ""I think we need to take pause, and take a step back, and listen."" Supporters of privatizing air traffic control operations still have more convincing to do to secure a vote in the House. GOP leaders have delayed a vote until after the August recess.? But privatization already has some powerful backers, who argue that Washington budget dysfunction and the FAA's ineffective contract management have hindered the agency's efforts to keep pace with technology. Major projects consistently exceed cost estimates and fall behind schedule, including a critical move to satellite-based navigation and digital communications, which will reduce airport delays. They want an entity that operates more like a business. ""We cannot let a broken government structure and old-fashion Washington bureaucracy drag down a proud American tradition,"" said Rep. Bill Shuster, R.-Pennsylvana, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the bill's primary sponsor. The new, non-profit would be run by a 13-member board of directors representing the numerous stakeholders invested in the nation's skies. Meanwhile, the FAA would continue to serve as a safety regulator. Many foreign countries have gone the privatization route, including Canada, Germany and Great Britain. Sullenberger stresses that the nation is experiencing a golden age in flight safety with no fatal commercial airline crashes in more than eight years. ""The FAA is not broken,"" said Sullenberger, who added, ""What this proposal does is take an extreme solution to a non-problem."" Sullenberger argues that privatization would allow a corporate monopoly heavily influenced by the major airlines to manage the nation's skies. It would make key investment decisions that could put profits over safety and reduce access for the general aviation community, which includes company jets, recreational pilots and agriculture sprayers. ""It gives the keys of the kingdom to the four largest airlines,"" Sullenberger said. ""I can guarantee you the four largest airlines don't always have the interests of the traveling public in mind."" Exhibit A, he said, is the shrinking seat sizes that airlines are incorporating in their planes. Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger is best known for successfully landing an airbus A320 in New York's Hudson River. CBSN sat down with the vet... Still, unions representing commercial airline pilots and air traffic control workers have endorsed privatization. Patricia Gilbert, executive vice president at the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the lack of a stable and predictable funding from Congress has contributed to antiquated air towers and equipment, and a shortage of air traffic control workers. ""All of those things need a focus,"" Gilbert said. ""And we're not seeing that."" Backers also say the board is too diversified for any one aspect of the aviation community to dominate it. A Senate bill reauthorizing aviation programs ignores the privatization issue. Democratic lawmakers called it a non-starter, and some Republican lawmakers from rural states are also wary. But the bill seeks changes in the training requirements for co-pilots. Supporters see it as a way to ease a pilot shortage faced by smaller, regional airlines. But Senate Minority Leader Charles?Schumer, D.-New York, has threatened to block the entire FAA bill if the provision is included. After the nation's last fatal commercial airline crash in February 2009, Congress required that any pilot operating as a first officer, or co-pilot, with an air carrier would need a minimum of 1,500 hours of flight experience. The prior threshold had been what Sullenberger calls an ""insanely low"" minimum of 250 hours."" The bill would expand the type of training that could be credited toward the 1,500 hours. Sullenberger said he feared that people watching videos in hotel ballrooms would be able to count that experience. He contends that the worst-run regional airlines are having the biggest trouble recruiting pilots. He said the nation shouldn't lower its standards to address their concerns. ""If we were having a problem attracting primary care physicians, would we suggest the solution was to reduce medical school a year or two?"" he asked.

The Wall Street Journal first reported Rosenberg's memo to DEA staffers. Mr. Trump had doled out some arrest advice for police officers at a speech on Friday in Long Island.

Like when you guys put someone in the car and you're protecting their head [with your hand], ... like don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody ... I said, 'you can take the hand away.'"" It was a comment White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed. ""I believe he was making a joke at the time,"" she told a reporter who asked about the comments. But Rosenberg, who is a close friend of fired FBI Director James Comey, did not take the president's comments lightly. While he said in his memo that he didn't believe DEA agents would mistreat defendants, he nonetheless wished to reaffirm ""the operating principles to which we, as law enforcement professionals, adhere."" And, he said he was writing ""because we have an obligation to speak out when something is wrong.? That's what law enforcement officers do.? That's what you do.? We fix stuff.? At least, we try,"" he wrote. He went on to urge staff to live up to the agency's core values, including rule of law, respect, integrity, and accountability, among other traits. ""This is how we conduct ourselves,"" he directed. ""This is how we treat those whom we encounter in our work: victims, witnesses, subjects, and defendants. This is who we are.""																																																																																																																					"

"Jared Kushner offered some insight Monday into his approach to dealing with the Middle East peace process, according to audio obtained by WIRED magazine. The president's son-in-law was speaking to congressional interns as part of an off-the-record summer lecture series. Interns were warned by an official not to record the session, but the magazine obtained a recording of his comments, which lasted for just under an hour. The report said while the audio didn't catch the entire question, it appeared to be focused on Kushner's effort to facilitate peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, as he has been tasked to do by the president. ""So first of all, this is one of the ones I was asked to take on, and I did with this something that I do with every problem set you get. Which is you try to study the historical context to understand how something got to where it is, who was successful, and who wasn't successful,"" he said. From his research, Kushner said he determined that ""not a whole lot"" has been accomplished over the last 40 to 50 years. ""I have tried to look at why people haven't been successful in the negotiations, so I looked and studied all the different negotiations. I spoke to a lot of people who have have been part of them, and I think the reason why is that this is a very emotionally charged situation,"" he said.? The president's son-in-law and top adviser suggested that history did not have enough to offer in terms of coming up with an approach to Middle East peace. ""You know everyone finds an issue, that, 'You have to understand what they did then,' and 'You have to understand that they did this.' But how does that help us get peace? Let's not focus on that,"" Kushner told the interns. ""We don't want a history lesson. We've read enough books. Let's focus on how do you come up with a conclusion to the situation."" He spoke about some of the latest tensions in the region and noted that they're working ""quietly"" with both sides to try and come up with a solution to their issues. ""So, what do we offer that's unique? I don't know＃ I'm sure everyone that's tried this has been unique in some ways, but again we're trying to follow very logically. We're thinking about what the right end state is. And we're trying to work with the parties very quietly to see if there's a solution. And there may be no solution, but it's one of the problem sets that the president asked us to focus on. So we're going to focus on it and try to come to the right conclusion in the near future,"" he said.?

"Last Updated Aug 1, 2017 1:41 PM EDT ATLANTA 〞 The Trump administration's tough talk on crime and the treatment of suspects has left black police officers worried that efforts to repair the fraught relationship between police and minority communities could be derailed. A major black law enforcement group heard from Attorney General Jeff Sessions?Tuesday afternoon, just days after President Donald Trump said police shouldn't be ""nice"" to suspects by shielding their heads as they are lowered, handcuffed, into police cars. The comment, now described by the White House as a joke, angered some cops who said it only served to dial back progress they'd made with the people they serve. ""You, more than perhaps any other law enforcement organization, represent crucial ambassadors to some of the communities that trust law enforcement the least,"" Sessions told the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE). ? Black police officers talk of straddling two worlds: the communities where they live, and the police departments where they work. They take seriously their oath to uphold the law and to go after criminals, but they also worry about their own friends, relatives and neighbors who fear the police. ""We live in some of the same communities that are affected by this disparate treatment. We go to church in those neighborhoods. We go to the barbershops. Certain things people don't realize: It's really hard being black and being a police officer when these things happen,"" said Clarence E. Cox III, former chief of Clayton County Schools in Georgia and incoming president of NOBLE. Sessions has questioned the far-reaching federal civil rights investigations that were a cornerstone of the Obama administration's efforts to overhaul troubled police departments, often after high-profile police deadly encounters with black men inflamed tensions and reignited debates over police-community relations. ""As everyone here knows, too often you not only don't get the credit you deserve, but are now in harm's way more than ever, and often get the blame you don't deserve,"" Sessions said. ""In fact, violence against police officers is on the rise around the country."" Sessions has so far been silent on the president's remarks, and the Justice Department did not immediately say whether he would mention them during the speech. Sessions has said aggressive federal intervention in local law enforcement can malign entire agencies and make officers less effective on the streets, but he has promised to prosecute individual officers who break the law. Still, he believes low officer morale can contribute to spikes in violence. Civil rights advocates 〞 and black police officers 〞 are closely watching his efforts to reshape the department. Some of his most sweeping changes have come in the area of policing. Sessions has been traveling the country touting his tough-on-crime agenda. He believes rising violence and the nation's opioid epidemic necessitate a return to tougher tactics, vowing to make fighting ordinary street crime a top priority for a Justice Department. ""We have to send a clear message that drugs are destroying lives,"" he said. ""And most importantly, we've got to restore the understanding that heading down the path of drugs is a dead end. It is destructive. Families, careers, college educations are all forfeited when people play around with drugs."" Perry Tarrant, the assistant chief of the Seattle Police Department and the current president of NOBLE, expressed concern about Sessions' pledge to dial back civil rights investigations. He notes that the Seattle department is under a settlement agreement 〞 just shy of a consent decree 〞 related to use-of-force complaints. While there are effective interim steps that can help address bad departments, he said, ""at the end of the day if you have systemic issues in any organization, the Department of Justice has an obligation to intervene."" Tarrant blanched when he heard the president's remarks, worried it would encourage bad cops and taint the entire profession at a time when police are trying to instill trust among those they serve. ""We are professionals. We are not thugs,"" he said. ""If there's any deviation from that, there's certainly cause for concern and to suggest that we treat people less than nice and it results in any kind of injury, we're talking about a crime."" President Trump took his campaign against gang warfare to Brentwood, New York, a community that has seen a staggering amount of violence. Mr. Tru... Mr. Trump's remarks came last Friday before law enforcement officers in Suffolk County, New York, during a visit to highlight his administration's efforts to crack down on a street gang known as MS-13. He appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are placed in patrol cars. ""Don't be too nice,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I said, 'You could take the hand away, OK,'"" he said. His remarks were later denounced by the Suffolk County Police Department, which issued a statement afterward that it has strict rules and procedures about how prisoners should be handled and ""we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners."" For officers in the field, Sessions' suggestion that he will no longer pursue court-enforceable improvement plans for police departments and Mr. Trump's remarks were a double whammy, complicating efforts to improve relations with minority communities already suspicious of police, said Eddie Hawkins, a school resource officer in Ohio and president of the Sentinel Police Association, a group of black police officers in Cincinnati. ""This is like a marriage and this marriage is getting rougher and rougher,"" he said.

"Last Updated Aug 1, 2017 8:28 PM EDT NEW YORK 〞 An investigator who worked on the Seth Rich case claims Fox News fabricated quotes implicating the murdered Democratic National Committee staffer in the WikiLeaks scandal and that President Donald Trump pressured Fox to publish the story. The investigator who looked into Rich's July 2016 murder for the family, Rod Wheeler, sued Fox for defamation on Tuesday. Wheeler's suit alleges that Fox News defamed him by manufacturing two false quotations and attributing them to him, thus damaging his reputation by blaming him as the deceptive story fell apart.? Wheeler, an African American, is also currently suing the network for racial discrimination. Wheeler, a Fox contributor, said the network made up the quotes attributed to him, saying there was contact between Rich and WikiLeaks, and that someone 〞 possibly Democrats or Hillary Clinton's campaign 〞 was blocking the murder investigation. Rich was killed in what Washington police believe was a botched robbery. Wheeler alleges that the story about Rich's death was orchestrated by Ed Butowsky, a Dallas based wealth management consultant and FNC commentator who hired him for the Rich family. Most of official Washington believes that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails. But some supporters of President... The lawsuit said Mr. Trump pushed to get the story out. There was no immediate response from the White House. It also alleges that Sean Spicer met at the White House with Wheeler and Butowsky to review the Rich story a month before Fox News ran the Rich piece, according to the court documents.? Also according to the lawsuit, 36 hours before the story appeared, Butowsky allegedly texted Wheeler ""Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately Its now all up to you. But don't feel the pressure."" Acknowledging that he met with Butowski and Wheeler in April, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer denied any White House involvement in the story.? ""Ed is longtime supporter of the president's agenda who often appears in the media,"" Spicer said. ""He asked for a 10 minute meeting, with no specified topic, to catch up and said he would be bringing along a contributor to Fox News. As Ed himself has noted, he has never met the President and the White House had nothing to do with his story."" Following news of the suit, the Rich family spokesperson Brad Bauman released a statement. ""While we can't speak to the evidence that you now have, we are hopeful that this brings an end to what has been the most emotionally difficult time in our lives and an end to conspiracy theories surrounding our beloved Seth,"" Bauman said. President of Fox News Jay Wallace issued a statement responding to the lawsuit. ""The accusation that FoxNews.com published Malia Zimmerman's story to help detract from coverage of the Russia collusion issue is completely erroneous,"" Wallace said. ""The retraction of this story is still being investigated internally and we have no evidence that Rod Wheeler was misquoted by Zimmerman. Additionally, FOX News vehemently denies the race discrimination claims in the lawsuit 〞 the dispute between Zimmerman and Rod Wheeler has nothing to do with race.""

"MOSCOW -- U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday that President Donald Trump would soon sign into law a new package of sanctions against Russia, as he reaffirmed the Trump administration's backing of eastern European allies in the face of Vladimir Putin's ""destabilizing activity."" The Senate voted last week to approve the new financial sanctions against Moscow. The legislation bars Mr. Trump from easing or waiving the penalties on Russia unless Congress agrees. Russia has decided that 755 U.S. Embassy personnel in Russia have to go. About 100 of them are diplomats who will return to the U.S. The U.S. is ... Pence, who is visiting the former Soviet republic of Georgia, where he met U.S. and Georgian troops taking part in a joint military exercise named ""Noble Partner,"" said the Trump administration ""had concerns"" about the bill when it was drafted in the Senate, but that Mr. Trump would sign it soon. Russia on Friday ordered the U.S. Embassy and three U.S. consulates in Russia to drastically cut its personnel there. President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday it would mean 755 staffers will have to be dismissed. During his visit to the far eastern flank of Europe, Pence has strongly pledged America's commitment to protecting NATO allies against attacks, including the Baltic states, which have anxiously watched a growing Russian military presence in the region. ""Under President Donald Trump, the United States stands firmly behind our Article 5 pledge of mutual defense -- an attack on one of us is an attack on us all,"" Pence told reporters Monday, after meeting with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the Estonian capital of Tallinn. Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. has been drawing down its military presence in Europe. But at the main docks in Bremerhaven in northern G... On Tuesday, Pence vowed the Trump administration would continue pushing for Georgia to be admitted as a new member of NATO. Georgia and Russia fought a war nine years ago over the border region of South Ossetia. Russia continues to keep troops in that region, along with the nearby breakaway region of Abkhazia. The U.S. and its European allies have never recognized Russian control over those parcels of land in the Caucus Mountains, along Russia's southern border. ""American first does not mean America only,"" Pence told U.S. and Georgian troops gathered at the airport Tuesday in Tblisi. ""We are here to tell our friends in Georgia, we are with you. We stand with you and will stand with you as you pursue membership in NATO."" Pence directly addressed the Russian troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, saying the ""U.S. strongly condemns Russian occupation of Georgian soil."" He said Mr. Trump called on Russia to cease all ""destabilizing activity"" in the region, and added that the president would sign the bill to codify new U.S. sanctions against Russia ""very soon."" The vice president said the U.S. was still hoping for ""better days and better relations with Russia,"" but that a ""better relationship with Russia will require Russia to end the actions that caused the sanctions in the first place, and not before.""

"Last Updated Aug 1, 2017 1:59 PM EDT A U.K.-based email prankster tricked several White House officials into thinking he was other officials in emails, according to CNN. The prankster used a technique that resembles?spear-phishing in which hackers pretend to be someone else. Anthony Scaramucci, who was ousted as communications director Monday and Tom Bossert, Homeland Security adviser, fell for the prank. On Saturday, the prankster emailed Scaramucci pretending to be Reince Priebus, who had announced a day earlier that he had resigned. ""I had promised myself I would leave my hands mud free,"" wrote the fake Priebus, according to CNN, ""but after reading your tweet today which stated how; 'soon we will learn who in the media who has class, and who hasn't', has pushed me to this. That tweet was breathtakingly hypocritical, even for you. At no stage have you acted in a way that's even remotely classy, yet you believe that's the standard by which everyone should behave towards you? General Kelly will do a fine job. I'll even admit he will do a better job than me. But the way in which that transition has come about has been diabolical. And hurtful. I don't expect a reply."" Scaramucci appeared to really think it was Priebus though. He said, ""You know what you did. We all do. Even today. But rest assured we were prepared. A Man would apologize."" Homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Tom Bossert speaks about the malware known as WannaCry during a White House press briefing on May 15, 2017. In another exchange, the prankster pretended to be Ambassador to Russia-designate Jon Huntsman Jr. in which he asked whose head ""should roll first."" Scaramucci responded, ""Both of them,"" which appeared to refer to Priebus and White House strategist Steve Bannon, the report said. In an exchange with Bossert, the prankster pretended to be the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. ""Tom, we are arranging a bit of a soir谷e towards the end of August,"" the fake Kushner wrote to Bossert by email, the report said. ""It would be great if you could make it, I promise food of at least comparible (sic) quality to that which we ate in Iraq. Should be a great evening."" Bossert wrote back, ""Thanks, Jared.

"The federal government will exhaust its so-called extraordinary measures and hit the debt ceiling in ""early-to-mid October,"" the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected in a report released Thursday. Without an increase in the debt limit, CBO said the Treasury can use extraordinary measures ""to continue borrowing and have sufficient cash to make its usual payments"" until that October deadline. The government has been relying on the extraordinary measures since mid-March when the suspension of the debt ceiling expired. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin called on Congress in May to raise the debt limit before lawmakers leave for the summer in August and specified that it should be a ""clean"" increase -- a demand that the conservative Freedom Caucus has rejected. Congress was able to wait until October in 2015, the last debt ceiling deadline, to raise it. It was part of a bipartisan budget agreement that also lifted spending levels for two years that applied to defense and non-defense domestic programs. Budget experts expect the GOP-controlled Congress to produce a similar agreement this fall since Republicans need Democratic votes in the Senate to pass spending bills whose limits will stem from a budget agreement.?

"Incoming White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Trump's administration will work to implement his new ban on transgender people in the military lawfully, but she did not supply details on if, how or when transgender service members will have to leave their posts.? Sanders told reporters at a White House press briefing on Wednesday that the White House and Department of Defense would work out the details after Mr. Trump surprised the political and even military worlds with the major policy shift, announced in tweets. The new ban leaves many questions unanswered, including what happens to current transgender troops; will they have to self-report their status and leave the military?? Sanders also offered no timeline for implementing the policy.? It's unclear how much the White House consulted --?or if it consulted?-- lawyers or the broader military community before Mr. Trump announced the ban. The Pentagon has referred all questions back to the White House. Sanders repeatedly insisted that the president made the ""difficult"" decision after speaking with his national security team, and that he did so in the interest of ""military readiness."" ""The decision is based on a military decision,"" Sanders said. ""It's not meant to be anything more than that.""?

Former Defense secretary Ash Carter ended the ban on transgender people serving openly in the military last year, but permitted a one-year review process for the Pentagon to figure out how to accept new recruits.?

"Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said it is ""laughable"" to suggest he threatened Alaska's U.S. senators over a vote by one of them involving health care. Zinke said Sunday in Nevada that he often speaks with Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and they get along well. ""Ah, you know, the moon has been characterized as other things, too,"" Zinke said when asked by reporters about the calls and their characterization as threatening. ""So, I think it's laughable."" The Alaska Dispatch News reported last week that Zinke called Murkowski and Sullivan and said Murkowski's vote against proceeding to debate on legislation to overhaul the federal health care law put Alaska's future with the administration in jeopardy. Vice President Mike Pence broke a tie to advance the measure, but Murkowski helped sink GOP efforts to overhaul the law later in the week. Sullivan told the newspaper that Zinke's call sent a ""troubling message."" ""I'm not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop,"" Sullivan said to the newspaper. ""I tried to push back on behalf of all Alaskans,"" Sullivan said. ""We're facing some difficult times and there's a lot of enthusiasm for the policies that Secretary Zinke and the president have been talking about with regard to our economy. But the message was pretty clear.""? Murkowski proceeded to tell CBS News' Nancy Cordes that Mr. Trump was ""not pleased"" with her ""no"" vote. ""I did have a conversation with the secretary, and he told me what I already knew, which was that the president wasn't pleased with the vote that I had taken, and I knew that,"" Murkowski told Cordes.? Murkowski told Cordes, ""The reality is that it was a difficult conversation,"" but she didn't think that the idea of a threat was an ""appropriate"" characterization. She added that she and Zinke, a former Montana congressman, have a ""cordial, respectful and friendly relationship. I don't think that will change one bit."" Murkowski chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which has say over Interior business and nominations. She also leads an Appropriations subcommittee with authority over the Interior Department budget. Murkowski and Sullivan have supported repealing and replacing the health care law passed under former President Barack Obama, though Murkowski took issue with the way in which the Senate has been attempting to do that. Alaska Gov. Bill Walker also took issue with the process. Murkowski repeatedly said she favored a more deliberate approach and a bipartisan effort.

"Last Updated Aug 1, 2017 8:07 AM EDT A conservative House Republican is calling on special counsel Robert Mueller to resign. He is citing what he says is a conflict of interest because of Mueller's ""close friendship"" with fired FBI Director James Comey. The argument from Arizona Rep. Trent Franks, a member of the Judiciary Committee, echoes that of President Donald Trump in an effort to question Mueller's credentials for the job. ?Mueller, appointed after Trump abruptly fired Comey, is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible ties to Trump's campaign. Franks said in a statement that Mueller ""must resign to maintain the integrity of the investigation into alleged Russian ties."" ""No one knows Mr. Mueller's true intentions, but neither can anyone dispute that he now clearly appears to be a partisan arbiter of justice. Accordingly, the law is also explicitly clear: he must step down based on this conflict of interest,"" said Franks. Franks alleges that members of Mueller's team on the probe had donated to the Clinton campaign, saying, ""These obviously deliberate partisan hirings do not help convey impartiality."" He added, ""Until Mueller resigns, he will be in clear violation of the law, a reality that fundamentally undermines his role as Special Counsel and attending ability to execute the law.""

"President Donald Trump's threat to stop billions of dollars in government payments to insurers and force the collapse of ""Obamacare"" could put the government in a tricky legal situation. Legal experts say he'd be handing insurers a solid court case, while undermining his own leverage to compel Democrats to negotiate, especially if premiums jump by 20 percent as expected after such a move. ""Trump thinks he's holding all the cards. But Democrats know what's in his hand, and he's got a pair of twos,"" said University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley. Democrats ""aren't about to agree to dismantle the Affordable Care Act just because Trump makes a reckless bet."" For months, the president has been threatening to stop payments that reimburse insurers for providing required financial assistance to low-income consumers, reducing their copays and deductibles. Administration officials say the decision could come any day. The ""cost-sharing"" subsidies are under a legal cloud because of a dispute over whether the Obama health care law properly approved the payments. Other parts of the health care law, however, clearly direct the government to reimburse insurers. With the issue unresolved, the Trump administration has been paying insurers each month, as the Obama administration had done previously. Trump returned to the question last week after the GOP drive to repeal the health care law fell apart in the Senate, tweeting, ""As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!"" He elaborated in another tweet, ""If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies...will end very soon!"" It's not accurate to call the cost-sharing subsidies a bailout, said Tim Jost, a professor emeritus at Washington and Lee University School of Law in Virginia. ""They are no more a bailout than payments made by the government to a private company for building a bomber,"" he said. That's at the root of the Trump administration's potential legal problem if the president makes good on this threat. The health law clearly requires insurers to help low-income consumers with their copays and deductibles. Nearly 3 in 5 HealthCare.gov customers qualify for the assistance, which can reduce a deductible of $3,500 to several hundred dollars. The cost to the government is about $7 billion a year. The law also specifies that government ""shall make periodic and timely payments"" to reimburse insurers for the cost-sharing assistance that they provide. Nonetheless, the payments remain under a cloud because of a disagreement over whether they were properly approved in the language of the health law, by providing an ""appropriation."" The Constitution says the government shall not spend money without a congressional appropriation. Think of an appropriation as an electronic instruction to your bank to pay a recurring monthly bill. You fully intend to pay, and the money you've budgeted is in your account. But the payment will not go out unless you specifically direct your bank to send it. House Republicans trying to thwart the ACA sued the Obama administration in federal district court in Washington, arguing that the law lacked specific language appropriating the cost-sharing subsidies. The district court judge agreed with House Republicans, and now the case is on hold before the U.S. appeals court in Washington. A group of state attorneys general are asking the appeals court to join in the case, in defense of the subsidies. Both Bagley and Jost have followed the matter closely, and they disagree on whether the health law properly approved the payments to insurers. Bagley says it did not; while Jost says it did. However, the two experts agree that insurers would have a solid lawsuit against the administration if Trump stops the payments. Insurers could sue in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which hears claims for money against the government. ""The ACA promised to make these payments 〞 that could not be clearer 〞 and Congress has done nothing to limit that promise,"" said Bagley. ""I think there would very likely be litigation if the Trump administration tries to cut off the payments,"" said Jost. Another way to resolve it: Congress could appropriate the money, even if temporarily, for a couple of years. ""Simply letting Obamacare collapse will cause even more pain,"" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said recently. If the president makes good on his threat, experts estimate that premiums for a standard ""silver"" plan would increase by about 19 percent. Insurers could recover the cost-sharing money by raising premiums, since those are also subsidized by the ACA, and there's no question about their appropriation. But millions of people who buy individual health care policies without any financial assistance from the government would face prohibitive cost increases. And more insurers might decide to leave already shaky markets. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra says Trump's tweets will bolster arguments from him and his counterparts in other states to intervene in the case. ""We need somebody who will stand up in court and defend the subsidies against the erratic nature of President Trump,"" said Becerra.

"Last Updated Aug 1, 2017 4:43 PM EDT With John Kelly now serving as White House chief of staff, President Trump is hoping that the retired Marine Corps general brings some order and discipline to his West Wing. A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle Kelly appeared to already hit the ground running by asking Mr. Trump on Monday to remove Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director. A statement from press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that, ""Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team."" The White House had been embroiled in internal warfare for months, which culminated with a series of staff changes over the last week and a half. First, Scaramucci was picked to be communications director?on July 21, then Sean Spicer resigned as press secretary and then Reince Priebus announced Friday that he had resigned as chief of staff, largely considered the most critical advisory role in the White House. On Monday, Scaramucci himself was shown the door.? Priebus, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, had become an afterthought in a White House run by a slew of strong personalities and his power was steadily in decline, CBS News' Major Garrett reports. On Friday evening, the president announced on Twitter that he had named Kelly, who up until now ran the Department of Homeland Security, to replace Priebus. Kelly?was formally sworn into the position on Monday morning. Every White House has treated the chief of staff role differently, but the person is generally supposed to be a gateway to the president. It's unclear how much control Priebus really had over other advisers to Mr. Trump. The White House chief of staff position is not subject to confirmation, but it is one of Washington's most powerful positions. For his best-selli... ""Almost everything went wrong,"" said Chris Whipple, author of ""The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency"" on ""CBS This Morning"" on Saturday. ""Donald Trump did not understand, as all of his predecessors eventually find out, that you cannot govern without empowering a White House chief of staff as first among equals to execute your agenda and to tell you what you don't want to hear."" In a primetime interview Friday with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Priebus said, ""I think General Kelly, given the tools, making sure that he is the chief of staff and he's in charge, he's in charge of hiring, firing, everyone reports to General Kelly -- I think it's a good formula. That's how he will be successful."" The White House confirmed that reporting structure on Monday.? ""All staff will report to [Kelly],"" Sanders told reporters at the daily briefing. ""The president has given full authority to Gen. Kelly.""? Steve Bannon, the White House's chief strategist, was originally viewed as an ""equal partner"" with Priebus, and it's unclear if that situation has changed with Kelly in charge. Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and adviser to the president, posted a photo on Instagram Monday, noting that she looks forward to serving ""alongside"" Kelly. Looking forward to serving alongside John Kelly as we work for the American people. General Kelly is a true American hero, and his leadership and love of country are second to none. A post shared by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Jul 31, 2017 at 7:42am PDT Kellyanny Conway, counselor to the president, was asked in an interview on Fox News Friday whether everyone will still have the same access to Mr. Trump or if they will go through Kelly. ""Well that's just a pecking order question,"" she said. ""I think it's beside the point and here's why: We all serve the President and this country. And in doing so, the president and his new chief of staff will decide what the right organizational structure and protocols are."" The disorganization that has consumed the first six months of the Trump administration is reminiscent of Gerald Ford's White House, said Whipple, who said senior aides at the time would often come and out from the Oval Office and no one was empowered as ""first among equals."" ""It was a disaster and that's very much like the Trump model that we're seeing now,"" he said. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that he reports to the chief of staff. ""I answer to the chief of staff. And I will continue to do that. The Office of Management and Budget actually reports directly to the chief of staff,"" he said. ""Obviously, we answer to the president, as everybody does in the West Wing. But, as far as I know, my reporting doesn't change, nor do I have any reason for it to change."" Every administration has grappled with how to organize the hierarchy in staff at the White House. President Nixon, for example, first named H.R. Haldeman as his chief of staff, who played a strong role in the White House and controlled access to the Oval Office. ""Every president needs a son of a b****, and I'm Nixon's,"" Haldeman once said. President Reagan, meanwhile, delegated power among three people who became known as the Troika: James Baker as chief of staff, Michael Deaver as deputy chief of staff and Edwin Meese as counselor to the president, according to CQ Press Guide to The Presidency and the Executive Branch by Michael Nelson. ""Meese served as Reagan's political conscience, keeping him true to his conservative policy goals in domestic policy. Baker focused on legislative issues and foreign policy, and Deaver managed the day-to-day operations of the White House,"" Nelson wrote in his book. President Clinton, meanwhile, had a much more nonhierarchical system with a weak chief of staff at first, Nelson wrote, with his wife, Hillary, as the de facto chief of staff. Then a year and a half into his first term, Clinton tapped Leon Panetta to serve in that role, who Whipple told CBS was one of the two best chiefs of staff in history. Kelly, for his part, spent most of his career in the military, serving most recently as commander of U.S. Southern Command in the Obama administration. While his military discipline could come in handy, he doesn't have the same kind of relationships Priebus had to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, which could make achieving the president's agenda even more challenging. In order to be successful, Whipple said he wonders if Kelly set any ground rules when taking the jobs. ""I'm curious about whether he set any conditions because if he didn't then he's really in trouble and so is the Trump White House,"" he said. CBS News' Jillian Hughes, Mark Knoller and Major Garrett contributed to this report.

"WASHINGTON -- President Trump's drug commission has called on him to declare a national emergency to deal with the country's opioid drug epidemic. The commission sent an initial report to the president Monday saying the approximately 142 deaths each day from drug overdoses mean the death toll is ""equal to September 11th every three weeks."" Overdoses are now the leading cause of death of Americans under the age of 50, and these drugs are the biggest culprits The report is ""meant to give the president some immediate steps that he can take to try to make sure that we stop the death that is happening across the country,"" said Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was appointed by Mr. Trump to lead the group. The White House said it will ""immediately begin reviewing its recommendations."" Besides declaring a state of emergency, the recommendations include: - Addressing regulations, including enforcing requirements that health plans provide the same level of services for those with physical health issues as those with mental health and substance abuse issues. - Equipping all law enforcement officers with the overdose reversal drug naloxone. - Providing money for federal agencies to develop sensors that can detect the synthetic opioid fentanyl, which has led to an increase in overdose deaths. - Increasing use of medications approved for treating opioid addiction in prisons. - Requiring doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners in federally qualified health centers to get waivers to prescribe buprenorphine, a medication for opioid addiction. - Achieving data sharing among state prescription drug monitoring programs by July 1, 2018. Christie made fighting drug addiction a cornerstone of his failed 2016 presidential campaign and has dedicated his last year in office to the issue. Many of the recommendations mirror efforts that he has undertaken in New Jersey. Monday's report came a couple of weeks after a group of U.S. Senate Democrats wrote to the acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy urging him to ""consider important initiatives that could help deliver faster relief to millions of Americans."" The signees urged the Trump administration to do more to combat the opioid epidemic, including implementing recommendations put forward by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in a November 2016 report. The group criticized an administration budget proposal that would cut nearly $400 million in funding for drug and mental health programs and the Department of Justice's escalating focus on treating drug addiction as a criminal justice issue.

"President Trump allegedly dictated his son Donald Trump Jr.'s initial statement about his 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Washington Post reported Monday. As he flew home from a summit of world leaders in Germany, Mr. Trump dictated a statement to be released by his son in response to a pending New York Times story about the meeting, according to the Post. The statement claimed that the topic of the meeting was primarily about the adoption of Russian children, which ""wasn't a campaign issue"" at the time. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow denied the Post's account and attacked it. ""Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent,"" he told CBS News Chief White House correspondent Major Garrett in a statement. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, however, told reporters that the president had ""weighed in, as any father would, based on the limited information he had."" She also said that the president ""certainly didn't dictate,"" but ""offered suggestion, like any father would do."" On July 8, the New York Times first reported that?Trump Jr. arranged to meet with?Veselnitskaya?during the presidential campaign, two weeks after his father clinched the Republican nomination. Their meeting was to take place on June 9, 2016 at Trump Tower. Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner also attended the meeting.? The initial statement released by Trump Jr. and reportedly dictated by his father, read as follows: It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up. I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand. However, Trump Jr. was forced to revise his statement over the course of the next few days, as it became apparent that his claims about the meeting were misleading. Ultimately, he admitted that he agreed to attend the meeting with Veselnitskaya because he thought she had damaging information about his father's campaign opponent, Hillary Clinton.? The Times also reported on July 11 that the president had signed off on his son's statement. This was reporting that was also denied by Sekulow in an an interview with ABC News. He told ABC that the president had not signed off on anything and that he had been returning from the G-20 summit. Sekulow speculated that Trump Jr. had released the statement in consultation with his own lawyers. Sekulow flatly denied that Mr. Trump had any involvement in his son's statement. ""[T]he fact is the President wasn't involved,"" he told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. As the Post pointed out, it's not illegal to mislead journalists, but the president's involvement could attract more attention from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating any ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.? CBS News has attempted to contact Trump Jr.'s attorney for reaction to this story. CBS News' Katiana Krawchenko contributed to this story.																																																																																																																					"
"TRENTON, N.J. -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's trip with his family to a public beach shuttered during a government shutdown drew online mockery and international headlines. Now, it's led to a proposed law to stop it from happening again. The Democrat-led Assembly passed a measure Monday that would force the governor's beach house to close during a shutdown, while a second measure they approved would keep state parks open. Those bills still need to be debated in the state Senate and would then need approval from the Republican governor. Christie previously pledged to sign a measure the Legislature passed Monday that would pay state workers who were furloughed during the three-day shutdown this month. His spokesman declined to comment on the other measures, referring to office policy not to comment on pending legislation. While Christie made viral headlines Monday over an argument with a Chicago Cubs fan while holding nachos in Milwaukee on Sunday, the Assembly brought the focus back on Christie's last incident. ""If a beach is closed because of a state shutdown, it ought to be closed to everybody,"" said Assemblyman John Wisniewski, a Democrat who proposed the measure to close the beach house during shutdowns. ""Having it open to the governor and his guests while it's closed to all the other New Jersey residents who are paying for them to be there isn't right and it isn't fair."" In June, Wisniewski told CBS New York that in a time when the state is being asked to ""do more with less,"" the governor's beach house is a ""sign of excess."" ""This would be a way for the state to earn money. It would be a way for the public at large to have an opportunity to see it,"" he added. ""And it would end what seems to be a very bad precedent -- the governor having his own private beach giveaway."" Christie had told reporters earlier that week that he planned to go to the beach house at Island State Park with his family during the Fourth of July weekend. An NJ Advance Media photographer in an airplane got the shot of him lounging on a chair in shorts, sandals and a Mets T-shirt and hat. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was seen over the weekend enjoying time on a beach he closed because of the state's failure to pass a budget. Chri... That inspired Wisniewski and other Democratic lawmakers to try to put a stop to it from happening again, including the measure to prevent the state from shutting down public parks during government shutdowns. ""Most camping trips or outdoor plans are made weeks or months in advance. It is unfair, and unreasonable to hold residents' holiday plans hostage over the Governor's and the legislature's inability to meet the budget deadline,"" Democratic Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle said. Christie defended his visit to the shore while the public was denied access, saying earlier this month that he had previously announced his plans to vacation at the state-owned governor's beach house and that the media had simply ""caught a politician keeping his word.""

"Last Updated Jul 31, 2017 7:39 PM EDT WASHINGTON --?Gen. John Kelly reported for duty Monday as the new White House chief of staff -- and left no doubt that he is in command. His first order of business was giving Anthony Scaramucci his discharge papers, just 10 days after he was named communications director, and three days after Scaramucci won a power struggle with Reince Priebus -- forcing his ouster as chief of staff. So far in the Trump presidency, there have been nearly half as many firings at the White House as in an average season of ""The Apprentice."" Scaramucci is the seventh senior White House official to be ousted. ""I love the president. I love the team. I'm a super optimistic guy,"" Scaramucci said on his first day on the job as White House communications director. Five days later, his tone had changed -- dramatically. In a profanity-laced interview with The New Yorker, he attacked Priebus, using a vulgar word to call him a ""paranoid schizophrenic."" Those comments have now come back to haunt him. ""The president thought Anthony's comments were inappropriate for a person in that position,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday. General John Kelly has sworn in as White House chief of staff Monday after a tumultuous week for the Trump administration. The Washington Post's ... Scaramucci was fired by the president at the urging of Kelly, a four-star Marine Corps general who was brought in to instill discipline to a White House suffering from months of chaos and internal warfare. Kelly, who served as secretary of Homeland Security, is a favorite of the president and was effusively praised by him in a Cabinet meeting Monday. ""I predict Gen. Kelly will go down -- in terms of the position as chief of staff -- one of the great ever,"" said Mr. Trump, who insisted on Twitter Monday that there was no White House chaos. Up to this point, there have been at least three competing power centers at the White House. One led by Priebus, another by chief strategist Steve Bannon, and a third that included the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his wife, Ivanka Trump. All of them reported independently to the president. It's a management style Mr. Trump has used for decades, and long-time aides have insisted he will never change. New White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, flanked by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, speaks at the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, on July 21, 2017. But at least for now, the plan is to try a military-style chain of command to bring structure and discipline to a White House that previously had neither. ""Gen. Kelly has the full authority to operate within the White House, and all staff will report to him,"" Sanders said Monday. Scaramucci was in the Oval Office Monday morning for Gen. Kelly's swearing in. But a short time later, he was gone. Late Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted: ""A great day at the White House.""

"ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A former U.S. diplomat who worked at the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was found liable for the second time Monday for enslaving and sexually trafficking a woman who worked as a housekeeper. The Washington Post reported a jury in Alexandria, Virginia, agreed that Linda Howard and late husband Russell Howard forced an Ethiopian maid into sexual slavery in 2008. Linda Howard, who left the State Department in 2013, was ordered to pay $3 million in damages to the woman, who lives in Virginia. Howard's husband died in 2012. Linda Howard denied the allegations and argued the woman couldn't sue for civil damages under a human trafficking law that didn't pass until 2008. According to a court document, the woman began working for the Howards in 2007. She alleged she was raped twice daily by Russell Howard and that Linda Howard also joined in the sexual abuse. Five years ago the couple was found liable in the same court for trafficking another Ethiopian housekeeper in 2008. They were ordered to pay her $3.3 million. However, the couple had already fled from Arlington, Virginia, to Australia. They contested the judgment there, settling in 2015.																																																																																																																					"
"BERATZHAUSEN, Germany -- The subject line read: ""Announcing a personal change."" The U.S. Army soldier took a deep breath before hitting the button that sent the email to more than 200 fellow troops. ""All considered, I am, and have been, traversing what is essentially a personal matter, but is something I must address publicly,""?the email?stated. ""I am transgender."" The April 13 email officially ended the secret that burned inside Capt. Jennifer Sims, who was known as Jonathan Sims. But the feeling of relief swiftly turned to unease last week after President Donald Trump tweeted that transgender troops were no longer welcome. After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...... ....Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming..... ""I read the tweet while I was at work and you know it was devastating because I still have work to do and here I am reading basically what sounds like the president of the United States -- who is the commander in chief, he is the ultimate boss of the military -- telling me and anybody else that is transgender that we are fired,"" Sims said. Pentagon officials say the policy allowing transgender troops will remain unchanged without official White House guidance. But for Sims, the uncertainty has been upsetting. ""So in the initial moments after the tweet, I saw myself forced into the state that I was in before I started transitioning -- a state of depression, exhaustion and inability to enjoy things,"" said Sims, 28, who spoke to The Associated Press on her own behalf and not on that of the Army. The reversal of the Obama administration policy that allows transgender people to serve openly and receive military medical coverage for transitioning from one gender to another also could affect her physically. Sims has been on hormone therapy by her military doctor since November. If she interrupts the treatment, her body will revert to being male. ""It would be very difficult to have to go through that,"" said Sims, who is based at Hohenfels, a U.S. Army garrison in the German state of Bavaria. Growing up in Minnesota and Florida, Sims, a high school football player, never felt comfortable being male. The son and grandson of military veterans quietly came to terms with identifying as a woman a year after joining the Army R.O.T.C., but outwardly kept it a secret ""because I wanted to continue serving,"" Sims said. Sims stopped socializing, feeling drained over worries about being masculine enough, and instead focused on work, serving in Afghanistan, Indonesia and Germany. Her sister, Natasha Sims, 24, said she saw ""emptiness"" in her eyes. After the Defense Department announced in 2015 that it was considering allowing transgender troops to serve openly, Sims told Natasha and their parents. When the policy became official in June 2016, Sims said ""it was the best day of my life really."" Sims made an appointment with the behavioral health office, was given a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and started hormone therapy. Five months later, she decided to shed her secret, first telling her closest colleagues, Capt. Brandon Shorter and another infantry officer. They were at a loss for words. After Shorter got home, he texted Sims about how that was brave. ""Infantry officers are best described as brutish. So Capt. Sims pulled me and another brute aside face to face. That took a lot of courage and that's the first thing that went through my mind, mixed in with surprise,"" Shorter said. Sims then announced the ""personal change"" to more than 200 other troops. It was not an emotional email. The seasoned military officer wrote how a lifetime of discomfort had peaked three years ago. Sims then outlined the steps she would take to fully transition to a woman. ""Officially in DEERS, my gender will remain male until my medical transition is complete, which means I will still comport to male standards and use male facilities,"" she wrote, referring to the acronym for the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, a kind of HR database for U.S. military personnel. ""While it is my preference for people to refer to me with female pronouns, if you are uncomfortable with this, there is no requirement to do so, I only respectfully request you refer to me by my proper name, Captain Sims,"" the email stated. Sims wrote that she will be more productive not having to ""live two personas."" The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff says transgender people can continue serving for now in the United States military. President Trump pro... Five soldiers sent emails back with words of encouragement. Most didn't respond. For a few days, there were murmurs of ""hey did you see the email?"" Some said they would not use the feminine pronoun until Sims' Army paperwork made it official. The force had just undergone training explaining what was expected in regards to transgender soldiers. Sims is the first transgender person Shorter has known. The unit is basically full of ""young men wanting to chew on nails and prove how tough they are,"" Shorter said. Only about eight women are among the 500 soldiers in the battalion. Shorter had a lot of questions ""being naturally curious and wanting to be a good friend because we didn't really have a personal relationship. He's, excuse me, she's -- see I still slip up sometimes -- a single captain. I'm married with two daughters. Our lives are different."" Shorter, 32, of Alanson, Michigan, describes himself as conservative. He said he struggles with his beliefs about what's appropriate. An assistant operations officer for the battalion, Shorter is concerned about how Sims cannot deploy while undergoing medical procedures. But Shorter, speaking on his own behalf and not that of the Army, said he would be ""incredibly disappointed"" if Sims, the best signal officer he has seen, were kicked out. After Trump's tweet, a few soldiers, including Shorter, asked Sims how she was doing. She didn't know what to say. Her pills will run out in three months. Doctors recommend 12 months of hormone therapy before surgery. The cost of her surgery can run close to $50,000, which Sims was expecting the military would help cover. ""I had waited so long just to be able to tell the world this is who I am,"" Sims said.

"STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. -- There's no bigger monument to the Confederacy than a towering sculpture carved into the side of Stone Mountain, outside Atlanta. The carving of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson is larger than Mount Rushmore. Edward Williams has lived near it for almost 20 years. When he looks at the sculpture, he says he fells that ""the war continues."" The massive sculpture on Stone Mountain Though no battles were fought there, it's a tourist attraction that even includes a laser light show. But the mountain is also considered the symbolic birthplace of the modern Ku Klux Klan, which had gathered there since 1915. In 2015, white supremacists rallied there and clashed with counter-protesters. It's why Williams and others have now started petitions to remove or alter the monument. Edward Williams ""These images are individuals that lost a war, that wanted to maintain slavery, that wanted to maintain a way of life that excluded my people and other minorities,"" Williams said. But it's a complicated issue. One unlikely voice for moving past the monuments debate is civil rights icon and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. ""I think it's too costly to re-fight the Civil War. We have paid too great a price in trying to bring people together,"" Young said. But in Tampa, Florida Thursday, opponents of a statue of a rebel soldier said they quickly raised the $70,000 needed to remove it. Across the country, more than 100 schools and nearly 500 roads and highways bear the names of Confederates. In total, there is an estimated 1,500 symbols to the Confederacy. In Birmingham, Alabama, workers raised a plywood wall around the city's Confederate memorial. The city's mayor, William Bell, said the monuments ... Jack Christensen, a great-great-grandson of one of them -- Gen. Stonewall Jackson -- spoke to CBS News by phone. ""We are ashamed of the monument but not Stonewall Jackson himself. We are ashamed because it is an image of white supremacy that many people interpret,"" he said. Some groups are planning peaceful protest on the lawn in front of the carving. A self-proclaimed KKK member made a request for a permit too: To burn a cross on top of the mountain. It was denied.																																																																																																																					"
"NEW YORK --?Tennessee?Sen. Bob Corker unleashed a harsh critique?of President Trump on Thursday in reaction to the president's comments?blaming ""both sides""?for weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.? During a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, an apparent attendee allegedly plowed a car into a group of counter-protesters, killing?one woman. Corker, the powerful chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said, in part, ""the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrates in order to be successful."" Corker later said Mr. Trump ""has also recently not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation. Prominent Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee is calling for ""radical changes"" at the White House and calling into question President Trump's... As CBS News chief Washington correspondent and ""Face the Nation"" moderator John Dickerson explained on Thursday's ""CBS Evening News,"" the criticism is notable because Corker is ""not one of the usual suspects who's always criticizing the president. He's been golfing with the president."" ""But in this instance, he says if the president doesn't solve his problems, our nation is going to go through great peril. So where this is coming from is extraordinary and the critique he's making is a thorough one. It's not just something he tossed off,"" Dickerson said to CBS News' Anthony Mason. Corker also called upon Mr. Trump to ""move beyond himself."" Dickerson says that points to a central critique of Mr. Trump that has persisted since the presidential campaign: ""That his impulsiveness that made him so popular among his base is incompatible with the office he holds."" ""So when [Corker] talks about the lack of discipline, the lack of stability, those are central, elemental characteristics the president has to have. And Sen. Corker is saying that they are not there in the president now,"" Dickerson said. John Dickerson Despite the recent staff shakeups at the White House, Dickerson says, the criticism is aimed at only the president, and ""there is no amount of staff you can ring around a president to fix"" the problems as Sen. Corker has identified. ""He calls on the president to have some self-reflection, so if you're in the White House you have to hope the president is listening,"" Dickerson said.

""In addition, the president's Advisory Council on Infrastructure, which was still being formed, will not move forward.""

The change in plans comes after Mr. Trump and his cabinet members laid out their plan for infrastructure reform, which cuts back on the approval process so the federal government and companies can move forward with projects more quickly. Mr. Trump signed an executive order to that effect on Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York City. But infrastructure reform was drowned out by comments Mr. Trump made to reporters after announcing those plans. Mr. Trump said there were ""very fine people"" among the white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville, and ""both sides"" were responsible for the violence, sparking intense criticism even from top members of his own party. In the wake of those comments, multiple members of the president's business advisory councils made their exit, and the president agreed to?disband those councils entirely. Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!																																																																																																																					"
"The American Cancer Society and Cleveland Clinic announced Thursday they will not hold fundraisers at Mar-a-Lago scheduled for 2018 after Mr. Trump's response to the violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The American Cancer Society and the Cleveland Clinic research hospital have held charity events at Mr. Trump's Florida club for years. Neither specifically mentioned the president's controversial remarks in statements, but the American Cancer Society said it must consider its ""values"" and ""commitment to diversity."" Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove was a member on the White House's strategic and policy forum, one of the two business advisory groups that?disbanded on Wednesday.? ""When we chose to hold our 2018 event and related dinner at Mar-a-Lago, we selected the venue based on a variety of factors, including costs and venue requirements,"" a statement from the American Cancer Society reads. ""Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community.? It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations. With our volunteer leaders, we are exploring other opportunities and potential venues. The generous support of community volunteers and donors are critical to our life-saving mission. Only by coming together will we solve our society's most difficult challenges, including reducing the pain and suffering from cancer."" The Cleveland Clinic offered little explanation for its venue change, but said it reached the decision not to hold a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago in 2018 after ""careful consideration.""

"Last Updated Aug 2, 2017 9:52 AM EDT The Trump administration plans to use resources from the Justice Department civil rights division to investigate and sue universities over affirmative action admissions policies that may put white applicants at a disadvantage, the New York Times reported Tuesday. The DOJ division is looking for lawyers to work on a new project investigating and potentially litigating cases ""related to intentional race-based discrimination in college and university admissions,"" according to an internal document obtained by the Times. It appears the project will be run by political appointees rather than career civil servants, the Times also surmised from its reading of the internal announcement. Both opponents and supporters of the project agreed that it targets admission programs that give racially disadvantaged minorities like black and Latino students preference over others with higher test scores, according to the Times.? White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders condemned the leak of the document Wednesday. ""The New York Times article is based entirely on uncorroborated inferences from a leaked internal personnel posting in violation of Department of Justice policy,"" she said. ""And while the White House does not confirm or deny the existence of potential investigations, the Department of Justice will always review credible allegations of discrimination on the basis of any race.""? In 2016, the Supreme Court upheld the right of colleges and universities to use diversity in their admissions criteria. ""Considerable deference is owed to a university in defining those intangible characteristics, like student body diversity, that are central to its identity and educational mission,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the court's majority opinion, which also cautioned that universities should continue to scrutinize the fairness of race-conscious admissions programs.

"Last Updated Aug 17, 2017 1:44 PM EDT Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is calling on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to join Democrats in supporting legislation to remove all Confederate statues from the U.S. Capitol in the wake of the deadly events in Charlottesville, Virginia.? ""The halls of Congress are the very heart of our democracy,"" the California Democrat said in a Thursday statement. ""The statues in the Capitol should embody our highest ideals as Americans, expressing who we are and who we aspire to be as a nation."" ""The Confederate statues in the halls of Congress have always been reprehensible,"" Pelosi added. ""If Republicans are serious about rejecting white supremacy, I call upon Speaker Ryan to join Democrats to remove the Confederate statues from the Capitol immediately."" The Charlottesville rally was formed to protest the removal of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a public park, before the rally turned violent and resulted in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer when a driver plowed through a sea of counter-protesters. The events in Charlottesville have sparked some local, state and national politicians to call for the removal of Confederate memorials. Pelosi did not remove the Confederate symbols when she was speaker from 2007 to 2011. When she was speaker, she said, Democrats did relocate a statue of Lee ""out of a place of honor"" in National Statutory Hall. Rosa Parks now has that place.? ""There is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the Confederacy in the hallowed halls of the United States Capitol or in places of honor across the country,"" Pelosi said.? Although President Trump compared taking down statues of Confederate generals to taking down monuments of some of the country's Founding Fathers,... But states decide what statutes they want to send to the Capitol to honor notable people in their history. For Congress to have a say in the matter, Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, said he will introduce legislation to remove Confederate statutes from Capitol grounds.? Doug Andres, spokesman for Ryan, indicated Ryan will leave this issue to the states. ""These are decisions for those states to make,"" Andres told CBS News.? President Trump on Twitter early Thursday morning decried the removal of ""beautiful"" statues and monuments that depict ""history and culture."" Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... ...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also... ...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! The?president on Tuesday said he feared the removal of Confederate statutes might lead to the removal of other statues, like those of former presidents Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. ""Not all those people [at the rally] were white supremacists. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue Robert E. Lee,"" Mr. Trump said in remarks to the press at Trump Tower in New York City on Tuesday.? ""So, excuse me, when you take a look of some of the groups and you see, and you'd know if if you were honest reporters and many of you are not, many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee,"" the president continued.? ""So this week it's Robert E. Lee, I notice Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder is it George Washington next week and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You really do have to wonder, where does it stop?""

"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner's synagogue condemned President Trump's remarks Tuesday afternoon that ?""both sides"" are to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia that stemmed from a white supremacist rally.? ""While we always avoid politics, we are deeply troubled by the moral equivalency and equivocation President Trump has offered in his response to this act of violence,"" reads the Facebook post from the Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, Kushner and Trump's Modern Orthodox synagogue in Manhattan. The message, which was posted on Wednesday, says that the president's ""frightening message and fallout...have consumed"" the synagogue's community. ""We are appalled by this resurgence of bigotry and antisemitism, and the renewed vigor of the neo-Nazis, KKK and alt-right,"" the post states. Trump, who converted to Judaism prior to marrying Kushner, has yet to publically denounce her father's comments outside of two tweets she posted Sunday: 1:2 There should be no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis. 2:2 We must all come together as Americans -- and be one country UNITED. #Charlottesville The congregation's rabbi emeritus, Haskel Lookstein, declined to comment on whether he had discussed Mr. Trump's comments with his daughter or son-in-law in an interview with The Washington Post Wednesday evening. ""I respect their privacy very, very much,"" Lookstein said. ""I don't want to intrude on it."" ""My colleagues and I felt we had to make a statement that we felt was important for the congregation. And that's it,"" he added. ""It was very important to respond to the needs of my community."" The Charlottesville violence left one 32-year-old woman dead and injured 19 other individuals after a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters at the rally.? Mr. Trump was criticized for his initial response to the events as he did not specifically call out the white supremacists responsible for disturbing the peace. His remarks that followed Tuesday, in which he placed equal blame for the violence on both hate groups at the rally as well as what Mr. Trump labeled the ""alt-left"" counter-protesters, shocked both political and religious leaders alike. The Republican Jewish Coalition also spoke out against Mr. Trump's equivocation. ""We join with our political and religious brethren in calling upon President Trump to provide greater moral clarity in rejecting racism, bigotry, and antisemitism,"" the group said in a tweet.

"Last Updated Aug 17, 2017 4:04 PM EDT As the White House grapples with the political fallout from President Trump's remarks Tuesday that there were ""very fine people"" at the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, the president's embattled chief strategist said he hopes Democrats continue to highlight racial issues.? Bannon, the former Breitbart executive who has in the past?bragged about his connections?to the ""alt-right,""?told the New York Times he wants more statutes to be torn down because he thinks it will hurt Democrats. Mr. Trump, in his remarks Tuesday blaming ""both sides"" for the violence in Charlottesville, also defended those who want to keep statutes memorializing the Confederacy. The Charlottesville event was originally billed as a protest against the removal of a statute of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a public park.? ""President Trump, by asking, 'Where does this all end' 〞 Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln 〞 connects with the American people about their history, culture and traditions,"" Bannon told the New York Times in an interview published Wednesday.? ""The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it's all racist,"" Mr. Bannon added. ""Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can't get enough of it."" The New York Times published Bannon's remarks the same day the American Prospect published a conversation with Bannon in which he said, ""we can crush the Democrats"" by focusing on ""economic nationalism."" The White House claims Bannon believed the conversation was off the record.? ""The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em,"" Bannon told the American Prospect's Robert Kuttner. ""I want them to talk about racism every day.

""Well we'll see 每 look like, I like Mr. Bannon, he's a friend of mine, but Mr. Bannon came on very late, you know that,""?Mr. Trump said?on Tuesday. ""I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that, and I like him, he is a good man, he is not a racist, I can tell you that.

"Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican, met Wednesday with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in London. Assange's WikiLeaks, which published hacked Democratic National Committee emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, is believed to have obtained the emails from Russian intelligence, according to U.S. intelligence agencies. Assange, who has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 in an effort to avoid extradition to Sweden on sexual assault charges, has disputed this. ""He reaffirmed his aggressive denial that the Russians had anything to do with the hacking of the DNC during the election,"" Rohrabacher told the Orange County Register. ""He has given us a lot of information. He said there's more to come. We don't have the entire picture yet."" Assange ""emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved in the hacking or disclosure of those emails,"" according to a statement from Rohrabacher's office.? Rohrabacher, a former Reagan White House communications aide, is an outspoken defender of Russian President Vladimir Putin and one of the Democrats' top targets for the 2018 midterm elections. He is a fervent supporter of President Trump, who has also cast doubt on whether Russia was involved in the 2016 election meddling. Speaking of the information he says he obtained from Assange, Rohrabacher told the Register it would have ""an earth-shattering political impact. It wouldn't be so important if Democrats hadn't focused so inordinately on the Russians. Democrats are creating a total upheaval over this."" ""I have some information to give the president before I give information to anyone else,"" he added.?

"WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Thursday said he was sad to see U.S. history being ""ripped apart"" with the removal of Confederate monuments and statues, which he called ""beautiful."" Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments. You..... ...can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish! Also... ...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced! At his press conference at Trump Tower on Tuesday, the president said that it was up to ""a local town, community or the federal government"" when asked whether the statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia should stay up. He then began equating Confederate statues to those of the nation's Founding Fathers. ""Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down 〞 excuse me 〞 are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him. Good,"" he said. ""Are we going to take down the statue? Cause he was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue?"" Cities and states accelerated their plans to remove Confederate monuments from public property Tuesday as the violence over a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, moved leaders across the country to plan to wipe away much of the remaining Old South imagery. Only two statues were taken down immediately, in Gainesville, Florida, where the Daughters of the Confederacy removed a statue of a Confederate soldier known as ""Ole Joe,"" and in Durham, North Carolina, where protesters used a rope to pull down a Confederate monument dedicated in 1924. But the anti-Confederate momentum seemed to ensure that other memorials would come down soon. Many local and state governments announced that they would remove statues and other imagery from public land, or consider doing so, in the aftermath of Saturday's white nationalist rally that killed one person and injured dozens more. The changes were publicized as Mr. Trump defended Confederate statues in wide-ranging remarks. ""This week it's Robert E. Lee. I notice that Stonewall Jackson's coming down,"" Mr. Trump said during a visit to Trump Tower in New York. ""I wonder, is it George Washington next week, and is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?"" Asked specifically whether Charlottesville's Lee statue should come down, he said: ""I would say that's up to a local town, community or the federal government, depending on where it is located."" All around the country, Republican and Democratic officials at the state and local levels moved swiftly to begin a process to remove the statues. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said he would ask the Legislature to reverse a 2015 law signed by his Republican predecessor, Pat McCrory, that prevents the removal or relocation of monuments, and to defeat a measure giving immunity to motorists who strike protesters. He also planned to ask state officials to determine the cost of moving Confederate statues and to give him options of where they could go. ""Our Civil War history is important, but it belongs in textbooks and museums?- not a place of allegiance on our Capitol grounds,"" Cooper said in a statement. In Maryland, GOP Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday he would push to remove the statue of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, author of the infamous Dred Scott ruling in 1857 affirming slavery, from state land. ""While we cannot hide from our history, nor should we, the time has come to make clear the difference between properly acknowledging our past and glorifying the darkest chapters of our history,"" said Hogan, who before had resisted calls to move the statue. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings announced plans Tuesday to ask his city council to appoint a task force to study the fate of the city's Confederate statues. Rawlings said he personally finds the monuments to be ""dangerous totems,"" but a task force would ensure a productive conversation. Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, called on state officials Monday to remove a bust of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate cavalry general and an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan, from the Tennessee Capitol. Protesters earlier draped a black jacket over the head of the bust while cheering, ""Tear it down!"" Similar plans were being made in Baltimore and San Antonio, as well as Lexington, Kentucky; Memphis, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; and elsewhere. In Durham, Sheriff Mike Andrews said protesters who toppled a nearly century-old Confederate statue in front of a North Carolina government building would face felony charges. The Confederate Soldiers Monument, dedicated in 1924, stood in front of an old courthouse that how houses local government offices. The crumpled and dented bronze figure has been taken to a warehouse for storage. Deputies later arrested Takiyah Thompson, who identified herself Tuesday as the woman who tied the rope that was used to tear it down. She said her actions were justified because Confederate statues represent white supremacy. A law professor and director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University in San Antonio called removal a ""slippery slope,"" saying judging historical figures through a modern lens can be difficult. ""A healthy democracy and people within that democracy should be able to say, 'This is our history.' And history is made up of actions of human beings, and human beings aren't perfect,"" said Jeffrey F. Addicott, who stressed he was speaking for himself and not the law school. Statues, he added, can be moved, but he's opposed to them being ""put in a warehouse never to be seen again because then you're kind of erasing or rewriting history."" The Sons of Confederate Veterans condemned attempts to take down Confederate statues around the country. ""These statues were erected over 100 year ago to honor the history of the United States,"" added Thomas V. Strain Jr., the group's commander in chief. ""They're just as important to the entire history of the U.S. as the monuments erected to our forefathers."" Strain, who said his group did not participate in Charlottesville, condemned the Klan, white nationalist groups, neo-Nazis and other extremists. ""It's painful to watch for lack of better words,"" he said. ""It was our family that fought, and it was our families that died, and now we have these knuckleheads hijacking the flag for their own purposes."" But city and state officials said Charlottesville convinced them it's time to move on from having Confederate imagery in prominent public places. In Lexington, Kentucky, Mayor Jim Gray moved up his announcement by a day in reaction to the Charlottesville bloodshed. Memorials to John C. Breckinridge and John Hunt Morgan are perched outside a former courthouse that was the site of slave auctions before the Civil War. ""This is the right time,"" Gray said Monday. ""We accelerated that because of the events in Charlottesville, but I knew that it was the right thing to do.""

"The man leading President Trump's legal team forwarded an email to conservative government officials and journalists that praised Confederate General Robert R. Lee and was written by someone who runs several websites alleging conspiracy theories, according to The New York Times. John Dowd, one of the president's attorneys, forwarded an email with the subject line, ""The Information that Validates President Trump on Charlottesville"" whose substance was reminiscent of secessionist Civil War propaganda, the report said. ""Lee is no different than [George] Washington,"" the email says. ""Both owned slaves. Both rebelled against the ruling government. Both men's battle tactics are still taught at West Point. Both saved America. Both were great men, great Americans and great commanders...You cannot be against General Lee and be for General Washington, there literally is no difference between the two men."" Dowd forwarded the email, which was written by Jerome Almon, who runs websites promoting conspiracy theories, including one about the FBI having been infiltrated by Islamic terrorists, the report said. Dowd forwarded it to more than two dozen people, the report said, including journalists at The Washington Times, Fox News, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security and The Wall Street Editorial page. Dowd apparently appeared angry that the Times obtained a copy of the email. ""You're sticking your nose in my personal email?"" he told The Times in a brief telephone interview, according to the report. ""People send me things. I forward them."" The report said that he then hung up. Almon told the Times that he sent the email to Dowd to follow up on a phone call with Dowd from last week in which he said he called to offer damaging information about former FBI Director James Comey, the report said.

"Last Updated Aug 15, 2017 2:17 AM EDT ""CBSN: On Assignment""?airs Mondays at 10 p.m. ET/PT on CBS and on our streaming network, CBSN. Explore more on this topic in our ""Behind the Lens"" report. With the rise of prenatal screening tests across Europe and the United States, the number of babies born with Down syndrome has significantly decreased, but few countries have come as close to eradicating Down syndrome births as Iceland. Since prenatal screening tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, the vast majority of women -- close to 100 percent -- who received a positive test for Down syndrome terminated their pregnancy. While the tests are optional, the government states that all expectant mothers must be informed about availability of screening tests, which reveal the likelihood of a child being born with Down syndrome. Around 80 to 85 percent of pregnant women choose to take the prenatal screening test, according to Landspitali University Hospital in Reykjavik. ""CBSN: On Assignment"" headed to Iceland with CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano to investigate what's factoring into the high termination rates. Using an ultrasound, blood test and the mother's age, the test, called the Combination Test, determines whether the fetus will have a chromosome abnormality, ?the most common of which results in Down syndrome. Children born with this genetic disorder have distinctive facial issues and a range of developmental issues. Many people born with Down syndrome can live full, healthy lives, with an average lifespan of around 60 years. Other countries aren't lagging too far behind in Down syndrome termination rates. According to the most recent data available, the United States has an estimated?termination rate for Down syndrome of 67 percent (1995-2011); in France it's 77 percent (2015); and Denmark, 98 percent (2015). The law in Iceland permits abortion after 16 weeks if the fetus has a deformity -- and Down syndrome is included in this category. The laboratory at Landspitali University Hospital, the country's? main medical center, where the majority of Icelandic women's prenatal blood tests are processed. With a population of around 330,000, Iceland has on average just one or two children born with Down syndrome per year, sometimes after their parents received inaccurate test results. (In the U.S., according to the National Down Syndrome Society, about 6,000 babies with Down syndrome are born each year.) ""Babies with Down syndrome are still being born in Iceland,"" said Hulda Hjartardottir, head of the Prenatal Diagnosis Unit at Landspitali University Hospital, where around 70 percent of Icelandic children are born. ""Some of them were low risk in our screening test, so we didn't find them in our screening."" When Thordis Ingadottir was pregnant with her third child at the age of 40, she took the screening test. The results showed her chances of having a child with Down syndrome were very slim, odds of 1 in 1,600. However, the screening test is only 85 percent accurate. That year, 2009, three babies were born with Down syndrome in Iceland, including Ingadottir's daughter Agusta, who is now 7. Agusta, age 7. On average, Iceland has two people with Down syndrome born each year. According to Ingadottir, three babies born with Down syndrome is ""quite more than usual. Normally there are two, in the last few years."" Since the birth of her daughter, Ingadottir has become an activist for the rights of people with Down syndrome. As Agusta grows up, ""I will hope that she will be fully integrated on her own terms in this society. That's my dream,"" Ingadottir said. ""Isn't that the basic needs of life? What kind of society do you want to live in?"" Geneticist Kari Stefansson is the founder of deCODE Genetics, a company that has studied nearly the entire Icelandic population's genomes. He has a unique perspective on the advancement of medical technology. ""My understanding is that we have basically eradicated, almost, Down syndrome from our society -- that there is hardly ever a child with Down syndrome in Iceland anymore,"" he said. Quijano asked Stefansson, ""What does the 100 percent termination rate, you think, reflect about Icelandic society?"" ""It reflects a relatively heavy-handed genetic counseling,"" he said. ""And I don't think that heavy-handed genetic counseling is desirable. ＃ You're having impact on decisions that are not medical, in a way."" Stefansson noted, ""I don't think there's anything wrong with aspiring to have healthy children, but how far we should go in seeking those goals is a fairly complicated decision."" According to Hjartardottir, ""We try to do as neutral counseling as possible, but some people would say that just offering the test is pointing you towards a certain direction."" Indeed, more than 4 out of 5 pregnant women in Iceland opt for the prenatal screening test. Iceland's widespread use of genetic testing means people can ""pick and choose"" which children to bring into the world. These prenatal screenings,... For expectant mother Bergthori Einarsdottir, who chose to have the test, knowing that most women did so helped steer her decision. ""It was not pressure, ?but they told me that most women did it,"" she said. ""It did affect me maybe a little bit."" Over at Landspitali University Hospital, Helga Sol Olafsdottir counsels women who have a pregnancy with a chromosomal abnormality. They speak to her when deciding whether to continue or end their pregnancies. Olafsdottir tells women who are wrestling with the decision or feelings of guilt: ""This is your life 〞 you have the right to choose how your life will look like."" She showed Quijano a prayer card inscribed with the date and tiny footprints of a fetus that was terminated. Quijano noted, ""In America, I think some people would be confused about people calling this 'our child,' saying a prayer or saying goodbye or having a priest come in -- because to them abortion is murder."" Olafsdottir responded, ""We don't look at abortion as a murder. We look at it as a thing that we ended. We ended a possible life that may have had a huge complication... preventing suffering for the child and for the family. And I think that is more right than seeing it as a murder -- that's so black and white. Life isn't black and white. Life is grey.""																																																																																																																					"

Thirteen people were killed and 100 were injured in what authorities called a terror attack. Late Thursday, Spanish police have said they killed several people south of Barcelona in Cambrils, according to AP. Authorities say this was a second alleged terror attempt. Fifteen of the victims were seriously injured, another 23 were moderately wounded and 42 others were being treated for slight injuries. They are all being cared for at various hospitals.

However, at least three German citizens were among those who died, according to a report by broadcaster ZDF which cited security sources. According to Puigdemont, two suspects have been arrested in connection with the attack. Police say one suspect is a Spanish national from Melilla and the other is Moroccan. Neither of the suspects drove the van. Police said the driver is still on the run. According to police, the van attack is ""connected"" to an explosion that occurred Wednesday night in a town south of the city in which one person died and injured several more. ISIS has claimed responsibility for Thursday's deadly terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain. Former homeland security adviser and CBS News senior ...

Then police arrived and pushed everyone a full block away. Even people leaning out of doors were being told to go back inside, he said. Fleming said regular police had their guns drawn and riot police were at the end of his block, which was now deserted. ""It's just kind of a tense situation,"" Fleming said. ""Clearly people were scared."" Carol Augustin, a manager at La Palau Moja -- an 18th-century place on Las Ramblas that houses government offices and a tourism information center -- said the van passed right in front of the building.

The royal palace's statement, which was posted on Twitter, said that ""All of Spain is Barcelona. Las Ramblas will once again be for all."" Other world leaders -- including British Prime Minister Theresa May, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and French President Emmanuel Macron -- have condemned the attack. Vatican spokesperson Greg Burke says Pope Francis is praying for the victims and expressing his closeness to their families. ?The Argentine pope was ""greatly worried"" about the attack and is following developments closely. The Vatican has greatly increased security for Francis' public events to prevent similar truck assaults on crowds that throng to his weekly audiences and Sunday blessings in St. Peter's Square. Cars, trucks and vans have been the weapon of choice in multiple extremist attacks in Europe in the last year. The most deadly was the driver of a tractor-trailer who targeted Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice in July 2016, killing 86 people. In December 2016, 12 people died after a driver used a hijacked trick to drive into a Christmas market in Berlin. There have been multiple attacks this year in London, where a man in a rented SUV plowed into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing four people before he ran onto the grounds of Parliament and stabbed an unarmed police officer to death in March. Four other men drove onto the sidewalk of London Bridge, unleashing a rampage with knives that killed eight people in June. Another man also drove into pedestrians leaving a London mosque later in June.																																																																																																																					"

"Last Updated Aug 18, 2017 5:33 AM EDT BARCELONA, Spain -- Police fatally shot five people wearing fake bomb belts who staged a car attack in a seaside resort in Spain's Catalonia region on Friday, just hours after a van plowed into pedestrians on a busy Barcelona promenade, killing at least 13 people and injuring over 100 others. Authorities said the back-to-back vehicle attacks -- as well as an explosion earlier this week elsewhere in Catalonia -- were connected and the work of a large terrorist group. Three people were arrested, but the driver of the van used in the Barcelona attack remained at large and the manhunt intensified for the perpetrators of the latest European rampage claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The Reuters news agency reports, citing an unnamed judicial source, authorities investigating both attacks believe there may have been a cell of eight people involved, and that the group planned to use butane gas canisters. Authorities were still reeling from Thursday's Barcelona attack when police in the popular seaside town of Cambrils, about 130 kilometers, nearly 80 miles, to the south, fatally shot five people near the town's boardwalk who had plowed into a group of tourists and locals with their blue Audi 3. Six people, including a police officer, were injured, though it wasn't clear how badly. Police in Spain say they have shot and killed four people south of Barcelona while carrying out an operation in response to a terrorist attack on... Catalonia's interior minister, Joaquim Forn, told Onda Cero radio that the five suspects killed in a subsequent shootout with police were wearing fake bomb belts. ""They were fakes, but very well made, and it wasn't until the bomb squad carried out the controlled explosion of one that they could determine they were fakes,"" he said. The Audi and a damaged police car were towed from the scene Friday. The Cambrils attack came hours after a white van veered onto Barcelona's picturesque Las Ramblas promenade and mowed down pedestrians, zig-zagging down the strip packed with locals and tourists from around the world. Forn, told local radio RAC1 the Cambrils attack ""follows the same trail. There is a connection."" He told Onda Cero that the Cambrils and Barcelona attacks were being investigated together, as well as a Wednesday night explosion in the town of Alcanar in which one person was killed. ""We are not talking about a group of one or two people, but rather a numerous group,"" he said. He added that the Alcanar explosion had been caused by butane tanks stored in a house, and that firefighters and police responding to the blast had been injured. Multiple people were killed after a van plowed into a crowd in Barcelona, Spain. Since 2014, 14 attacks have been carried out where vehicles were... The Barcelona attack at the peak of Spain's tourist season left victims sprawled across the street, spattered with blood and writhing in pain from broken limbs. Others were ushered inside shops by officers with their guns drawn or fled in panic, screaming and carrying young children in their arms. ""It was clearly a terror attack, intended to kill as many people as possible,"" Josep Lluis Trapero, a senior police official for Spain's Catalonia region told reporters late Thursday. ISIS claimed responsibility, saying in a statement on its Aamaq news agency that the attack was carried out by ""soldiers of the Islamic State"" in response to the extremist group's calls for followers to target countries participating in the coalition trying to drive it from Syria and Iraq. Cambrils Mayor Cami Mendoza said the town had taken precautions after the Barcelona attack, but that the suspects had centered their assault early Friday on the narrow path to Cambrils' boardwalk, which is usually packed with locals and tourists late into the evening. ""We were on a terrace, like many others,"" said bystander Jose Antonio Saez. ""We heard the crash and intense gun shots, then the dead bodies on the floor, shot by the police. They had what looked like explosive belts on."" Others described scenes of panic, and found safety inside bars and restaurants until police had secured the area. Local resident Markel Artabe said he was heading to the seafront to get an ice cream when he heard the shots. ""We began to run. We saw one person lying on the pavement with a shot in his head then 20-30 meters further on we saw two more people, who must have been terrorists as they had explosive belts around them. We were worried so we hid."" A third Barcelona suspect was arrested Friday in the northern town of Ripoll, where one of the two detained on Thursday had also been nabbed. The third arrest was made in Alcanar, where the gas explosion in a house was being investigated. ""There could be more people in Ripoll connected to the group,"" Forn told TV3 television, adding that police were focusing their investigation on identifying the five dead in Cambrils as well as the driver of the Barcelona van. Police said the two suspects arrested Thursday were a Spanish national from Melilla, a Spanish-run Mediterranean seafront enclave in North Africa, and the other a Moroccan. Spanish public broadcaster RTVE and other news outlets named one of the detained as Driss Oukabir, a French citizen of Moroccan origin. RTVE reported said Oukabir went to police in Ripoll to report that his identity documents had been stolen. Various Spanish media said the IDs with his name were found in the attack van and that he claimed his brother might have stolen them. Media outlets ran photographs of Oukabir they said police had issued to identify one of the suspects. The regional police told The Associated Press that they had not distributed the photograph. They refused to say if he was one of the two detained. The driver, however, remained at large. ""We don't know if the driver is still in Barcelona or not, or what direction he fled in,"" Forn, the Catalan interior minister, told SER Radio. ""We had local police on the scene, but we were unable to shoot him, as the Ramblas were packed with people."" Citizens from at least 24 countries were among those killed and injured in Barcelona, the Catalan regional government said. French officials said 26 French nationals were among those hurt, with at least 11 seriously injured. Australia said one of its citizens was unaccounted for.? The grandfather of a 7-year-old Australian boy, Julian Cadman, said his grandson went missing after becoming separated from his mother, who was wounded in the Las Ramblas attack. ""We have found Jom (my daughter in law) and she is serious but stable condition in hospital,"" the boy's grandfather, Tony Cadman, wrote on Facebook. ""Julian is 7 years old and was out with Jom when they were separated, due to the recent terrorist activity. Please share if you have family or friends in Barcelona."" Julian Cadman One of the dead was Belgian, and Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told reporters: ""We are concerned for one Australian who remains unaccounted for."" Two with slight injuries were Taiwanese. A Greek woman and a Hong Kong resident were also hurt. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the killings a ""savage terrorist attack"" and said Spaniards ""are not just united in mourning, but especially in the firm determination to beat those who want to rob us of our values and our way of life."" After the afternoon attack, Las Ramblas went into lockdown. Swarms of officers brandishing handguns and automatic weapons launched a manhunt in the downtown district, ordering stores and cafes and public transport to shut down. By Friday morning, the promenade had reopened to the public, and neighbors and tourist were allowed past police lines to go back to their homes and hotels. The city center remained under heavy surveillance. At noon Friday, a minute of silence honoring the victims was to be observed at the Plaza Catalunya, near the top of the Ramblas where the van attack started. Rajoy declared three days of national mourning. Similar vehicle attacks have been carried out at tourist sites in France, Germany, Sweden and Britain. ""London, Brussels, Paris and some other European cities have had the same experience. It's been Barcelona's turn today,"" said Carles Puigdemont, president of Catalonia's government. The bloodshed was Spain's deadliest attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 192 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. In the years since, Spanish authorities have arrested nearly 200 jihadists. The only deadly attacks were bombings claimed by the Basque separatist group ETA that killed five people over the past decade but it declared a cease-fire in 2011. ""Unfortunately, Spaniards know the absurd and irrational pain that terrorism causes. We have received blows like this in recent years, but we also that terrorists can be beaten,"" Rajoy said.

"Two Russian cosmonauts floated outside the International Space Station Thursday, tossed five small science and technology satellites overboard and spent the rest of the excursion servicing external experiments and carrying out routine but time-consuming inspections and maintenance. The work took longer than expected and Russian flight controllers extended the spacewalk beyond the planned six-hour mark to give the cosmonauts time to finish as many of their tasks as possible before calling it a day. Finally, at 6:10 p.m. EDT (GMT-4), Expedition 52 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Sergey Ryazanskiy, back inside the Pirs airlock compartment, closed the hatch to officially end a seven-hour 34-minute spacewalk, the first in more than a year by Russian cosmonauts. Mission managers said the spacewalkers accomplished all of their planned tasks except for one -- the installation of one handrail -- and that no specific problem put them behind schedule. Rather, the spacewalkers took their time and rested periodically at the insistence of Russian flight controllers. ""Everything is good, so we're insisting on your rest,"" a controller called up from Moscow in translated remarks. ""You should rest, guys."" A few moments later: ""Is it enough for you to have a rest? How is the atmosphere inside your suits?"" ""Well, if we could have some music, maybe, and girls to make massages it would of course be even better, but everything is fine,"" Ryazanskiy replied. ""It's the request of the medical team. They are worrying about your health."" ""When we are back on the ground we'll discuss it,"" Ryazanskiy said. ""Of course, Sergey, we will be looking forward to your landing and this conversation,"" the flight controller replied. ""So I would (not) like to bother you any more, please have a good rest."" The spacewalk got underway at 10:36 a.m. It was the ninth EVA overall for Yurchikhin and the fourth for Ryazanskiy. Yurchikhin wore an upgraded Orlan MKS spacesuit with an improved temperature control system, a larger feed water bag, a new carbon dioxide measuring unit, improved biomedical sensors and an upgraded LCD display panel. The MKS suits will enable cosmonauts to carry out longer spacewalks than are possible with the standard MK-series like the one Ryazanskiy used. After exiting the Pirs module, the cosmonauts retrieved a materials science sample pallet just outside the hatch before manually launching the five satellites one at a time, careful to aim then down and behind the station to prevent any future close encounters. The first to be launched, known at ""Tomsk,"" is an 11-pound satellite built with a 3D printer to help engineers how such materials respond to the space environment. It also carries amateur radio gear. Another satellite will test systems needed by small ""nanosats,"" two others will test networking and small-scale navigation technology and a fifth will serve as a passive target to help calibrate ground tracking systems. It also will help researchers study the density of the upper atmosphere as they monitor its eventual fall back to Earth in several months After releasing the satellites, Yurchikhin and Ryazanskiy took photos of another experiment panel and an antenna boom before installing handrails and struts to help future spacewalkers move about the Russian segment of the space station. They also installed 10 temperature sensors on the Poisk module and serviced another external experiment before returning to Pirs and ending the spacewalk. But it was slow going throughout the day. ""That is just a really interesting day because whenever we need something it is in a completely different location than we think, and if we're moving somewhere, we're moving in the wrong direction,"" one spacewalker complained. ""Just jinxed."" They insisted they could install the final handrail, but flight controllers told them to head back to Pirs. This was the 202nd spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998, the seventh so far this year and the first of 2017 by Russian cosmonauts. Total station spacewalk time now stands at 1,258 hours and 15 minutes, or 52.4 days. Yurchikhin has now logged 59 hours and 28 minutes of spacewalk time during nine EVAs, moving him up to fourth on the list of most experienced spacewalkers, just behind crewmate Peggy Whitson. She has 60 hours and 21 minutes of spacewalk time during 10 excursions. Ryazanskiy's mark stands at 27 hours and 39 minutes outside the station during his four excursions.

"Maine Gov. Paul LePage said Thursday that he condemns ""both sides"" of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend and suggested that taking down Confederate statues is the equivalent of taking down a 9/11 memorial. ""I condemn both sides. I think they're disgusting -- both sides. They went there with the intent of inciting violence,"" the Republican said in a radio interview on WGAN, a local station. ""There's no place for either of these groups in this country."" LePage said that people calling for the elimination of Confederate monuments and statues are ""trying to erase history."" ""How can future generations learn if we're going to erase history?"" he said. ""Whether we like it or not, this is what our history is. To me, it's like going to New York City right now and taking down the monument of those who perished in 9/11. It will come to that."" LePage said that he receives letters every day saying he supports the KKK, but he said, ""I have been against the KKK before you knew they existed."" He added that he didn't find out about the terror attack and violence in Charlottesville last weekend until Tuesday because he said, ""I don't watch TV and I don't read newspapers."" President Trump, meanwhile, has been criticized for defending?Charlottesville rally attendees during a press conference at Trump Tower on Tuesday in which he reiterated his comment from Saturday that there was blame ""on both sides.""

"Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee, announced Thursday that he plans to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump. Cohen cited potential obstruction of justice and violations of the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause as the reasons for impeachment while also addressing his own strong moral opposition to the president's words and actions relating to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend. After comments on #Charlottesville , I'll be introducing Articles of #Impeachment against #Trump. No good Nazis or Klansmen! #ImpeachTrump pic.twitter.com/x6pWL35evL ""In response to the horrific events in Charlottesville, I believe the President should be impeached and removed from office,"" Cohen said in a statement released by his office. ""Instead of unequivocally condemning hateful actions by neo-Nazis, white nationalists and Klansmen following a national tragedy, the President said 'there were very fine people on both sides.' There are no good Nazis. There are no good Klansmen."" The congressman's call to remove Mr. Trump from office comes after the president blamed the Charlottesville disruption on ""both sides""-- both the white supremacists leading the ""Unite the Right"" rally, and their counter-protesters, who Mr. Trump labeled the ""alt-left."" ""Well, I do think there's blame,"" Trump said in a press conference from Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday. ""Yes, I think there is blame on both sides. You look at both sides. I think there is blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it. And you don't have doubt about it either. And if you reported it accurately, you would say. Cohen also serves as a Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. A move to impeach Mr. Trump from the White House will likely not pick up speed in a Republican-controlled Congress. ""As a Jew and as an American and as a representative of an African American district, I am revolted by the fact that the President of the United States couldn't stand up and unequivocally condemn Nazis who want to kill Jews and whose predecessors murdered 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, and could not unequivocally condemn Klansmen whose organization is dedicated to terrorizing African Americans,"" Cohen's statement reads. Cohen is not the first of his colleagues to call for Mr. Trump's impeachment. In July, Rep. Brad Sherman, D-California, and Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, co-sponsored an article of impeachment. Sherman filed the article one day after the president's eldest son Donald Trump Jr. acknowledged that he met with a Kremlin-connected lawyer during the campaign. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, and Paul Manafort, a former Trump campaign manager, were also present at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. The lawyer promised potentially damaging information on the Trump campaign's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.

"Last Updated Aug 17, 2017 8:40 PM EDT President Trump tweeted Thursday that his followers should ""study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,"" apparently referencing a debunked claim relating to Gen. John ""Black Jack"" Pershing. Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years! The claim states that during the Moro Rebellion, which occurred in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War, Pershing used bullets dipped in pig's blood to kill groups of Muslim insurgents because, in the Islamic faith, ingesting pork is a sin. There is no evidence that this ever happened. While on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump made multiple references to Pershing's supposed military tactic. ""They had tremendous Muslim terrorism-tremendous at 1918. So what's changing?"" Mr. Trump asked in late February during the 2016 presidential primaries. ""And you had General Pershing, he was a tough tough cookie and they caught 50 terrorists. Many many people were being killed. Very similar to what's happening today."" ""So General Pershing, they caught 50 terrorists,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And they have a thing about pigs blood and pigs. And what they did is they cut open two pigs and they dumped the bullets into the pigs and they took the bullets and they stood the 50 men up and they shot each man. Shot each man with a bullet that was covered with pig's blood. But they didn't' shoot the 50th person. They gave him his bullet and said 'You go back and take this bullet back.'"" The president's tweet appears to reference this fictional event, claiming that ""There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!"" as a result of the tactic. Historians say the story Trump told is not true. ""This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,"" Texas A&M University historian Brian McAllister Linn, author of ""Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940,"" told?Politifact.

"In a press conference Thursday alongside their Japanese counterparts, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson parted ways with White House strategist Steve Bannon on North Korea. In an interview published Wednesday in the American Prospect, Bannon said that there is no realistic military option for dealing with North Korea. But Tillerson and Mattis insisted that was not the case. ""Obviously any diplomatic effort in any situation where you have this level of threat that we are confronted with, a threat of proportions that none of us like to contemplate, has to be backed by a strong military consequence if North Korea choses wrongly,"" Tillerson said. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said there is no military option when it comes to the growing nuclear threat from North Korea. South Ko... Mattis also referred to ""strong military consequences,"" coordinated with allies, if further hostile actions are taken by Pyongyang. These comments are in keeping with Mr. Trump's assertions that further North Korean provocations would be met with ""fire and fury."" ""Our approach has been endorsed by the president. It is reviewed with him periodically, in terms of the status of how the approach is working,"" Tillerson said of the U.S. campaign to pressure North Korea. When asked about Bannon's comments specifically, Tillerson said he had read the interview but that he did not ""really have a comment."" In that interview, Bannon also expressed his belief that China must be punished for its trading practices as part of what he called an ""economic war"" against Beijing. Tillerson and Mattis, meanwhile, indicated that they were considering a range of options for working with China on North Korea, and that a trade battle not on the top of their agenda.? Susan Thornton, the State Department's top Asia diplomat, recently described the Chinese as ""helpful and instrumental"" in drafting the U.N. sanctions against the regime. In the interview with the American Prospect, Bannon said that he was attempting to get Thornton removed from the State Department. ""The Secretary asked Susan Thornton to lead in a very important role and he continues to rely on her to lead the State Department's diplomacy in Asia,"" wrote a State Department official in response to Bannon's comments. Tillerson pointedly shook Thornton's hand in front of cameras on Thursday morning. ? ""We will remain vigilant against the North Korean threats,"" Tillerson said Thursday. Mattis took that a step further. ""Together, we will deter and if necessary defeat any threat. Any initiation of hostility will be met with an effective and overwhelming response,"" he said, speaking of the U.S. and Japan. The Japanese Foreign Minister said that the security environment in the peninsula is becoming ""increasingly severe,"" while Mattis said that the meeting Thursday produced ""highly useful"" results including deepening U.S.-Japanese military commitments. They two countries will also cooperate in the realms of cyber space, ballistic missile defense and maritime security, they said. Earlier this week, Tillerson and Mattis wrote an op-ed outlining a diplomatic solution, driven by a ""peaceful pressure campaign,"" as their preferred option for dealing with North Korea. They cited other countries and international bodies such as China and the UN that the U.S. sees as crucial partners in this campaign.? The op-ed also reinstated their rejection of a proposal that would have the U.S. stop their joint military exercises with South Korea and not deploy the Thaad missile defense system in return for North Korea halting their nuclear program. ""Installing Thaad launchers on the Korean Peninsula and conducting joint military exercises are defensive preparations against the acute threat of military actions directed against the U.S., our allies and other nations. China's demand for the U.S. and South Korea not to deploy Thaad is unrealistic,"" they wrote. If North Korea launches an attack on American territory it could ""escalate into a war very quickly"" Mattis has said. He also said that if the North does pursue military action, ""it's game on"", adding, ""we'll take it out,"" suggesting that the U.S. would attempt to shoot down any missiles aimed at?either Guam or the U.S.?mainland. Tillerson reassured Americans last week that there is no immediate threat from North Korea and they should ""sleep well at night.""

"JERUSALEM?-- Israel's prime minister faced growing calls on Thursday to denounce President Donald Trump's response to the racially charged violence and anti-Semitic displays in Charlottesville, Virginia, even at the risk of angering the American leader. Benjamin Netanyahu has remained largely silent during the unfolding crisis in Virginia. While issuing a terse condemnation of neo-Nazis and racists, he has said nothing about Trump's apparent defense of the actions of white supremacists during last weekend's deadly violence. The muted response has upset a growing number of Israelis, who believe that Netanyahu has a special role to play on behalf of Jews overseas. Some have warned that it could cause further damage to an already strained relationship with American Jews. ""We must set a clear boundary against anti-Semitism and protect the Jewish people wherever they may be. There are no gray areas when it comes to these issues, and this doesn't jeopardize our relationship with the U.S. or with any other partners around the world,"" Stav Shaffir, an opposition lawmaker, wrote in the liberal daily Haaretz. She said Netanyahu has lost ""any semblance of a moral compass."" The White House is scrambling to contain the fallout after President Trump blamed ""both sides"" for last weekend's violence in Charlottesville, Vi... Netanyahu views himself as the leader of the global Jewry, and he has rarely been shy about speaking out against anti-Semitism. He frequently paints Arab and Iranian foes in Nazi terms, and made a high-profile solidarity visit to Paris' Jewish community after a deadly attack on a kosher supermarket in 2015. But in today's increasingly polarized global stage, Netanyahu has become more selective in his overseas battles. Last month, for instance, he instructed the Israeli Foreign Ministry to drop its criticism of a Hungarian government campaign against Jewish billionaire George Soros, despite its anti-Semitic overtones. The Hungarian-American billionaire, himself a Holocaust survivor, has supported a number of liberal causes in Israel critical of Netanyahu. At the same time, the Israeli leader has befriended Hungary's leader, Viktor Orban, who takes a strong line against Muslim migrants. Likewise, Netanyahu has so far been willing to overlook Trump's handling of the Charlottesville crisis. Trump has acknowledged there were some ""very bad people"" at Saturday's rally, where a woman was killed when a car slammed into a crowd of counter-protesters. But he also said there were ""very fine people"" on both sides. The president's equation of extremist hate groups and left-wing demonstrators brought condemnation from across the American political spectrum. In Israel, most major newspapers condemned Trump's comments on Wednesday. ""Shame,"" read the headline in the mass daily ""Yediot Ahronot."" The lone exception: Israel Hayom, a free daily owned by Sheldon Adelson, a supporter of Trump and Netanyahu, buried Trump's troubles in a brief article on page 24. Though Netanyahu is ordinarily quick to rail against anti-Semitism, he waited three days to react to the violence in Charlottesville with a relatively tepid statement on Twitter. ""Outraged by expressions of anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism and racism. Everyone should oppose this hatred,"" he tweeted, avoiding any mention of the president or Charlottesville. Netanyahu's spokesman, David Keyes, said there were no plans to comment further, saying the statement was ""unequivocal."" ""I think he made his view on the repugnancy of any neo-Nazism abundantly clear,"" Keyes said. But he could soon find himself under further pressure to take a tougher stand. On Thursday, Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben-Dahan, a member of the governing coalition, said Israel ""must not stammer or hesitate in the face of anti-Semitism."" ""Apparently some don't want to enrage Trump,"" he said in criticism of Netanyahu. After clashing with President Barack Obama for eight years, Netanyahu welcomed Trump's election, and he has worked to cultivate a strong relationship with the White House. ""He does not want to alienate Trump,"" said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israeli relations at Israel's Bar-Ilan University. But in the process, Gilboa said, Netanyahu is pushing American Jews further away. ""I think it is a shame that the prime minister himself did not criticize Trump's moral equivalence speech because Israel claims to be the protector of Jewish communities everywhere,"" Gilboa said. Trump's response to the events in Charlottesville has begun to attract concern in Israel, even among politicians who admire him. Immediately after Saturday's march, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, leader of the nationalist Jewish Home party, said the waving of Nazi flags and symbols was not only offensive to American Jews, but also disrespected the memory of American soldiers who died fighting the Nazis during World War II. ""The leaders of the U.S. must condemn and denounce the displays of anti-Semitism seen over the past few days,"" Bennett said. Opposition politicians have been more strident and open in their criticism of Trump. ""There aren't two sides. When neo-Nazis march in Charlottesville and scream slogans against Jews and in support white supremacy, the condemnation has to be unambiguous,"" said Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition Yesh Atid party. Netanyahu's Facebook and Twitter feeds bore no mention of Charlottesville amid the slew of photos of the prime minister and his wife arm-in-arm on their vacation on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Netanyahu's son Yair, however, who has a close relationship with his father, caused a public outcry when he appeared to parrot Trump's sentiments. He wrote a Facebook post on Wednesday saying the ""neo nazis scums in Virginia"" are a dying breed, but left-wing anti-fascist and Black Lives Matter groups, who he said hate Israel ""just as much,"" are ""getting stronger and stronger and becoming super dominant in American universities and public life."" American Jewish leaders have expressed deep disappointment with Trump. But if Netanyahu continues to remain quiet, that disappointment could quickly spread to him as well. Leaders of liberal Jewish groups, who represent the majority of American Jews, are already at odds with the Israeli government over issues such as egalitarian prayer and recognition of religious conversions. Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the liberal Union for Reform Judaism, the largest American synagogue movement, said the prime minister ""did harm to the cause of Israel and the cause of the Jewish people by having such a delayed reaction."" ""It was quite distressing,"" he added.																																																																																																																					"

Speaking to reporters after a rotary club speech in Chattanooga, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said ""radical changes"" must take place in regards to Mr. Trump.

"It took President Trump＊s defense of a neo-Nazi rally for many Republicans in Congress to publicly distance themselves from the White House, after months of brushing off his impolitic behavior and tweets. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said white supremacist bigotry is ※counter to all this country stands for.§ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, ※There are no good neo-Nazis,§ an apparent reference to Trump＊s claim that there were some ※very fine people§ among the torch-carrying white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., last week. Rank-and-file Republicans churned out statements backing away from Trump, and outspoken voices in the party began wondering aloud Wednesday whether Republicans still carry the mantle of the party of Abraham Lincoln. ※We can＊t claim to be the party of Lincoln if we equivocate in condemning white supremacy,§ tweeted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). After Trump＊s remarks drew a thank-you tweet from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) sounded off. ※Many Republicans do not agree with and will fight back against the idea that the party of Lincoln has a welcome mat out for the David Dukes of the world,§ Graham said. But the GOP-led Congress isn＊t expected to respond with much more than impassioned statements and social media posts. Though Democrats and others quickly urged Republicans to follow up their words with actions 〞 ranging from a resolution stating that Congress does not embrace white nationalism to a more wholehearted censure of the president 〞 such moves seem unlikely. Few Republican lawmakers stand willing to criticize Trump by name for his insistence that the white nationalists rallying in Charlottesville and the counter-protesters opposed to racism were equally to blame for the violence that erupted. Most tried to stick to their schedules during the August break, visiting constituents and job centers back home. But after struggling for months to figure out how best to handle Trump, many are finding it harder to just ignore him. ※A line＊s been crossed, and no one wants to be seen as supporting white nationalists＊ vision of America,§ said Pearson Cross, an associate political science professor at University of Louisiana at Lafayette. ※On the other hand, they＊re caught in a bit of a bind because it＊s their president that＊s putting them in this position,§ Cross added. Trump remains popular in many states and congressional districts that elected Republicans to the majority in Congress, despite his sagging approval rating nationwide. Lawmakers remain reluctant to put themselves crosswise with the voters many will need in next year＊s midterm election. Moreover, Republicans in Congress have hitched Trump＊s popularity 〞 which stems in part from his disruptive and racially tinged tone 〞 to their legislative agenda. It was a decision cast last year when GOP lawmakers rallied around Trump as their nominee for president. ※As long as Trump remains popular with their primary voters, I don＊t see things changing,§ said Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee and GOP leadership in Congress. He did not support Trump＊s presidential bid. For a party that has labored to expand its base of white voters into the growing electorate of Latino and other minority groups, many saw an irreparable turning point. Here's who quit two of Trump's business advisory councils and when ? ※After that Trump press conference, I don't know how I can tell any minority why they should vote Republican,§ Heye wrote on Twitter. Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the highest-ranking Jewish Republican before he was kicked out of office by a tea party challenger, acknowledged an irreconcilable split. ""I think that the party is President Trump's party now,§ Cantor told the Washington Examiner. Republicans have stood by Trump before 〞 when he said some Mexican immigrants were rapists, bragged about grabbing women＊s body parts and strove to end the FBI probe into Russian interference into last year＊s presidential election. Even McConnell, who has recently been the target of Trump＊s Twitter scorn over the collapse of the GOP healthcare bill, failed to call out the president by name Wednesday. And he issued a statement only after a Trump-backed candidate won a runoff spot in Alabama＊s primary election for senator Tuesday. But the public backlash to Trump 〞 from the former Bush presidents, celebrities, sports stars and everyday Americans 〞 may eventually force Congress to do more. Lawmakers could be confronted by protesters at town hall meetings urging Congress to reassert itself as a check on the executive branch. As the majority in Congress, Republicans could be pressured to hold public hearings on the far-right groups, renounce their personal support for Trump or even call on the president to resign, activists said. ※There＊s an imperative right now in the country to make clear Trump is not speaking for the country when he defended Nazis and supremacists,§ said Jesse Ferguson, a former top aide to Democrat Hillary Clinton. ※The only way to do that is to have the co-equal branch of government say it.§ Others, though, see Trump＊s brush with supremacists as the not wholly unexpected coda to the Republican Party＊s long courtship of white voters. As Democrats during the civil rights era started becoming a party increasingly made up of minorities, Republicans courted white voters, often through messages with racist leanings. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort used a Nixonian-like Southern strategy to appeal to white voters when he worked on Ronald Reagan＊s presidential campaign. Many of the same voters were drawn to Trump, citing his willingness to be politically incorrect. Racial resentment, as tabulated by the nonpartisan American National Election Studies, was one of the strongest predictors of voter preference for Trump, noted Matt Barreto, a professor at UCLA. ※I feel like we waltz past this all the time,§ said University of Louisiana＊s Cross. ※Explicit embrace of the white nationalist or racist ideology is not something the Republican Party is comfortable with. ※On the other hand, finding ways to appeal to those people who may have racist views, and may vote, has been an art long practiced by Republicans.§ President Donald Trump says the groups protesting against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, were ""also very violent.""

(August 16, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) The nation＊s top military officers issued public statements condemning racial bigotry and extremism, a rare foray into domestic politics that indicated deep unease Wednesday in the Pentagon with President Trump's views on race and underscored his growing isolation. The social media posts from the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff 〞 the commanders of the Navy, Marine Corps, Army and Air Force 〞 came amid a torrent of criticism of Trump as business executives abandoned his advisory councils, Republican elected officials distanced themselves from him and previously friendly foreign leaders criticized his comments suggesting an equivalence between neo-Nazi groups and their opponents. In a further sign of an administration in crisis, Vice President Mike Pence announced he was cutting short a visit to South America to return to Washington a day early for meetings with Trump. But it was the statements from the country＊s top uniformed military leaders that broke most dramatically with precedent. Each used his official Twitter account to denounce the far-right protesters behind Saturday's deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. 〞 and not those who had confronted them. They did not mention their commander in chief by name. But three of the four posts appeared after Trump sparked a bipartisan furor Tuesday by repeatedly blaming ""both sides"" for the clashes that followed a march by neo-Nazis, white supremacists and their allies, ending with the death of a counter-protester. ※The Army doesn't tolerate racism, extremism, or hatred in our ranks,§ Gen. Mark Milley, chief of staff of the Army, tweeted Wednesday. ※It's against our Values and everything we've stood for since 1775.§ Similar implied denunciations of Trump＊s stand poured in from former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, Republican leaders in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), as well as several major allies in Europe. British Prime Minister Theresa May, one of the few European leaders who has been openly friendly with Trump, condemned the president＊s comments. ※I see no equivalence between those who propound fascist views and those who oppose them, and I think it is important for all those in positions of responsibility to condemn far-right views whenever we hear them,§ May said in Portsmouth, England. The last two Republican presidents signed a joint statement Wednesday declaring that ※America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism and hatred in all forms.§ Like the military chiefs, the Bushes didn＊t name Trump, but their statement broke with the usual practice of former presidents refraining from even indirect criticism of the sitting chief executive. The rebukes underscored how Trump＊s response has isolated him more than perhaps any incident since the ※Access Hollywood§ tape was leaked a month before the 2016 election. On it, Trump was heard crudely boasting a decade ago of his ability to get away with groping women. ※There＊s a truism in ... politics: Just stay away from anything remotely involving Nazis,§ commented Michael Steele, who headed the Republican National Committee from 2009 to 2011, the first African American to hold the post. Trump strained that tradition during last year＊s campaign, appearing to embrace far-right groups who backed him. But as he seeks support in his latest self-created crisis, he is finding fewer safe harbors. Business and labor leaders, whose support Trump craves most, have quit his side to protest his equating neo-Nazis to leftist activist groups, and his claim that ※some very fine people§ took part in the white supremacy rally. After the chief executives of 3M and Campbell Soup bailed Wednesday from a White House advisory council on manufacturing 〞 the seventh and eighth members to quit 〞 Trump disbanded the group, along with a second panel devoted to general economic policy advice. At a news conference in Chile, Pence conspicuously declined to say whether he agreed with Trump that there were good people among the white supremacists who marched. ※What happened in Charlottesville was a tragedy, and the president has been clear on this tragedy, and so have I,§ Pence said. Even before the Charlottesville violence, Trump＊s support had slid in public opinion polls, and he has increased his appeals to his core supporters, holding reelection rallies far earlier in his term than his predecessors. His 2020 campaign announced Wednesday that he will address a rally in Phoenix next week, his first visit to the West since the election. To help him weather the latest crisis, he will rely on a 28-year-old aide, Hope Hicks, whom he appointed as interim communications director on Wednesday. Depending on how one counts, Hicks, who was one of Trump＊s first hires in his presidential campaign, is the fourth or fifth communications director in the Trump White House. Hicks will replace Anthony Scaramucci, who was ousted so quickly 〞 after 10 tumultuous days 〞 that he was never formally sworn in. Trump tends to ignore communications advice and Tuesday＊s impromptu news conference in New York was a prime example. His comments reportedly stunned his senior staff, who only expected him to deliver a statement on infrastructure, not take questions on Charlottesville. The Twitter posts from the military chiefs that followed suggest mounting discomfort at the Pentagon. The service chiefs support Trump's proposals for a military build-up but have yet to implement his unexpected call on Twitter last month to block transgender troops from serving in the armed forces. Since then, the Pentagon has stated that transgender people can serve openly until the White House issues new guidance through proper channels on how to carry out a ban, including whether to discharge transgender troops already in uniform. Pentagon leaders were blindsided by Trump＊s tweet that the military would ※not allow or accept§ transgender troops to serve. They also were caught off guard by his warning that he would unleash ※fire and fury§ if North Korea continued to threaten the United States, as well as his startling claims of a ※possible military option§ for the political turmoil in Venezuela. The Twitter messages from the Pentagon chiefs had a special resonance because several of the individuals who played prominent roles in the far-right rally Saturday, or the deadly violence that followed, had served in uniform. James Alex Fields, the alleged Nazi sympathizer accused of killing a woman and wounding more than a dozen others by ramming his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, spent four months in the Army in 2015 but failed out of basic training. In addition, a former Marine staff sergeant who served combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, Dillon Ulysses Hopper, was identified as the leader of Vanguard America, a group that helped organize the ※Unite the Right§ rally. According to Hopper's service records, he was in the Marine Corps from July 2006 until January this year, serving as a recruiter for part of that time. Participation in supremacist or extremist organizations is a violation of Defense Department orders and leads to mandatory dismissal. Marine Commandant Gen. Robert B. Neller tweeted Tuesday that there is ""no place for racial hatred or extremism in the Marine Corps."" Adm. John Richardson, the Chief of Naval Operations, started the trend on Saturday when he posted a statement on Twitter and Facebook that called the events in Charlottesville ""shameful"" and ""unacceptable."" ""The Navy will forever stand against intolerance and hatred"" he said. ""We want our Navy to be the safest possible place 〞 a team as strong and tough as we can be, saving violence only for our enemies."" Gen. David L. Goldfein, chief of staff of the Air Force, tweeted Wednesday that he stood ※together with my fellow service chiefs in saying that we＊re always stronger together.§ Separately, the military moved to disavow some of the white nationalists who were photographed wearing military-affiliated clothing during the clashes. The 82nd Airborne Division, whose paratroopers jumped into Europe to defeat the Nazis in World War II, took to Twitter on Monday to disavow a man photographed giving a Ku Klux Klan salute while wearing a hat with the division's insignia. ""Respectfully, anyone who thinks this man represents our culture and values has never worn the maroon beret... and never will,"" the 82nd Airborne tweeted.

"It was 1934 and fascism was on the march not only in Europe but in America. People who admired Adolf Hitler, who had taken power in Germany, formed Nazi organizations in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, represented by lawyers who were Jewish, faced an existential question: Should the freedoms it stood for since its founding in 1920 apply even to racist groups that would like nothing more than to strip them away? Ultimately, after much internal dissent, the ACLU decided: Yes, the principles were what mattered most. The ACLU would stand up for the free-speech rights of Nazis. ※We do not choose our clients,§ the ACLU＊s board of directors wrote in an October 1934 pamphlet called ※Shall We Defend Free Speech for Nazis In America?§ ※Lawless authorities denying their rights choose them for us. To those who support suppressing propaganda they hate, we ask 〞 where do you draw the line?§ Once again, the ACLU is wrestling with how to respond to a far-right movement in the U.S. whose rising visibility is prompting concerns from elected officials and activists. In response to the deadly violence at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend, the ACLU＊s three California affiliates released a statement Wednesday declaring that ※white supremacist violence is not free speech.§ The national organization said Thursday that it would not represent white supremacist groups that want to demonstrate with guns. That stance is a new interpretation of the ACLU＊s official position that reasonable gun regulation does not violate the 2nd Amendment. Officials in Charlottesville had initially denied organizers of the ※Unite the Right§ rally a permit to hold the event at the site of a Robert E. Lee statue. But the ACLU filed a lawsuit defending protesters＊ rights to gather there. The rally ended with one woman killed and dozens of people injured as neo-Nazis and other far-right groups that had come armed with shields, helmets and even guns clashed violently with counter-protesters. Now, with more far-right events scheduled in California, the state＊s ACLU affiliates are warning that there are limits to what they will defend. ※We review each request for help on a case-by-case basis, but take the clear position that the 1st Amendment does not protect people who incite or engage in violence,§ said the statement, which was signed by the executive directors of the ACLU affiliates of Southern California, Northern California, and of San Diego and Imperial Counties. ※If white supremacists march into our towns armed to the teeth and with the intent to harm people, they are not engaging in activity protected by the United States Constitution,§ the statement continued. ※The 1st Amendment should never be used as a shield or sword to justify violence.§ That statement drew some criticism from former ACLU board member Samuel Walker, a history professor at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, who supports the ACLU＊s historical stance on far-right groups. He called the remarks ※irresponsible.§ ※How is the 1st Amendment being a shield for violence?§ he said. ※They need to be clear on that, and this statement is not clear.§ Ahilan Arulanantham, the legal director of the ACLU of Southern California, said it was not the organization＊s perspective on civil liberties that had changed, but the nature of the far-right groups themselves 〞 a willingness to come to events ready for violence. ※The factual context here is shifting, given the extent to which the particular marches we＊re seeing in this historical moment are armed,§ Arulanantham said. For decades, the ACLU has defended the speech rights of far-right groups like neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan on the principle that if those groups＊ rights are not upheld, the government will try to restrict the free-speech rights of other groups as well. Most famously, the ACLU successfully defended the rights of neo-Nazis to march in the Chicago suburb of Skokie, Ill., in 1978, which was home to many Holocaust survivors. But the ACLU＊s stance was costly. The group＊s membership and donations 〞 which had soared during the Nixon administration 〞 declined sharply after the Skokie case, with thousands of supporters abandoning the group. A left-wing civil liberties counterpart, the National Lawyers Guild, accused the ACLU of ""poisonous evenhandedness.§ The group has seen its membership and its donations soar under the Trump administration as left-leaning Americans embrace the organization as a bulwark against the administration. But some emerging factions of the left do not share the ACLU＊s values on free speech and assembly. Surveys have shown that young people are more likely than older Americans to support a government ban on hate speech, which is constitutionally protected. Leftists who call themselves ※anti-facists§ and in many cases endorse illegal violence, viewing it as a morally just tactic to prevent neo-Nazis from gathering publicly, have also seen their numbers grow since Trump＊s election, which was supported by far-right groups. The ACLU＊s decision this month to file a 1st Amendment lawsuit on behalf of right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos 〞 whose rhetoric about immigrants and minorities has made him a target of violent protests 〞 prompted a high-profile ACLU attorney to publicly object. ※Though his ability to speak is protected by the 1st Amendment, I don't believe in protecting principle for the sake of principle in all cases,§ wrote Chase Strangio, who stressed he was speaking in a private capacity. ※His actions have consequences for people that I care about and for me."" The outcry from the ACLU＊s California affiliates prompted the group＊s national leader, Anthony D. Romero, to respond with a statement of his own. ※We agree with every word in the statement from our colleagues in California,§ Romero said. ※The 1st Amendment absolutely does not protect white supremacists seeking to incite or engage in violence. We condemn the views of white supremacists, and fight against them every day.§ But, Romero added: ※At the same time, we believe that even odious hate speech, with which we vehemently disagree, garners the protection of the 1st Amendment when expressed non-violently. We make decisions on whom we'll represent and in what context on a case-by-case basis. The horrible events in Charlottesville last weekend will certainly inform those decisions going forward.§ Corporate America?has had enough of President Trump's response to Charlottesville.

"Republicans in Congress have tried to stick with President Trump in hopes that despite politically damaging outbursts from the White House, his pen would ultimately be able to sign their legislative agenda into law. But in the aftermath of Trump＊s controversial response to the neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Va., that promise seems ever more distant. Congressional Republicans are now coming to grips with the reality that they are increasingly on their own, unable to rely on the president to helm their party, but without having powerful enough congressional leaders to bring bickering factions together. That has dimmed prospects of passing big-ticket items such as tax reform, an infrastructure package or a new healthcare law. At best, when lawmakers return to work next month, they hope to agree to keep the government funded past the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 and not provoke a financial crisis with a prolonged standoff over raising the limit on federal debt, which the government will hit sometime in early October. ""The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,§ Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told reporters Thursday after a meeting at the Chattanooga Rotary Club. ※I do think there need to be some radical changes,"" Corker said. ※We need for him to be successful.§ The latest Trump outbursts solidified the gloomy assessment from many Republicans. ※It codified it: This administration has no hope of accomplishing any major policy goals,§ said longtime Republican strategist Rick Tyler, a former top advisor to Newt Gingrich and to Sen. Ted Cruz＊s presidential bid. ※We don＊t have to wonder about it. It＊s like driving your car past empty 〞 the motor＊s going to stop, and it＊s not going to go forward anymore,§ Tyler said. ※These are the laws of physics, and legislation＊s very much the same."" Trump has emerged less a partner to the Republican majority in Congress than an unpredictable bystander, welcoming lawmakers to lunch one day, bashing them on Twitter the next. Several senators got the latest taste of that Thursday, when Trump swiftly turned on them after they critiqued his response to the neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va. Trump attacked both Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on Twitter Thursday morning 〞 assigning a derisive nickname, ※Flake Jeff Flake,§ to the Arizonan and praising one of the candidates lining up to run against him, Kelli Ward, a former state senator who last month predicted that John McCain, the state＊s senior senator who is being treated for cancer, would die soon and said that she should be appointed to replace him. The praise for Ward marked an extremely rare presidential intervention into a primary against an incumbent of his own party 〞 a move almost certain to increase tensions. Graham＊s response was swift. ※You are now receiving praise from some of the most racist and hate-filled individuals and groups in our country,§ Graham tweeted, referring to the congratulatory messages Trump received from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. ※For the sake of our Nation 〞 as our President 〞 please fix this. History is watching us all.§ Rank-and-file Republicans, and other party leaders, are less likely to be as sharply critical. Many remain hopeful Trump 〞 or his legislative team members, who are close to Vice President Mike Pence 〞 can still help push parts of their agenda to passage. But the payoff Republicans counted on when they backed Trump for president 〞 large-scale legislative victories with GOP control of the House, Senate and the White House 〞 has not happened. Trump has blamed Congress. He said the collapse last month of Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act was the fault of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Senate Republicans. He lashed out several times at McCain for his no vote. But Republican lawmakers and their staffs say the president＊s own performance was lacking. Trump＊s shifting views on the legislation and his unwillingness or inability to convince lawmakers 〞 and the public 〞 to rally around a preferred option was as much, if not more, to blame, they say. A similar dynamic is unfolding on a tax overhaul bill. Republicans in the House and Senate are struggling to draft legislation that can meet the demands of both conservative and centrist Republicans. Trump has said taxes are a top priority, but has made no effort so far to sell the public on a proposal. On Wednesday, he was supposed to tout his infrastructure plans, but instead, blotted out any discussion of that topic by his defense of the marchers in Charlottesville, who, he said, included many ※very fine people.§ On Thursday, the White House said that plans to form a White House advisory council on infrastructure were being shelved. Presidents and congressional leaders always have some tensions. But the current rift is extreme. To make things harder for Republicans, McConnell and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) have not shown they are able to muscle through their priorities as effectively as the Democratic leaders, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco and Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, did during the opening period of the Obama administration. Trump＊s 30% approval rating isn＊t helping either. It leaves the president without the political capital he needs to move Congress to action. ※When the country＊s on board, the Congress moves. That＊s the way it works. It＊s not a mystery,§ said Tyler. Despite their unhappiness, however, the Republican Congress is unlikely to take the sort of action against Trump that Democrats and outside groups on the left are demanding, such as a resolution to censure the president for his statements. ※There＊s an imperative right now in the country to make clear Trump is not speaking for the country when he defended Nazis and supremacists,§ said Jesse Ferguson, a former top aide to Democrat Hillary Clinton. ※The only way to do that is to have the co-equal branch of government say it.§ But even with Trump＊s sagging approval nationwide, the president remains popular in many states and congressional districts that elected Republicans to Congress. Lawmakers remain reluctant to put themselves crosswise with voters many will need in next year＊s midterm elections. Moreover, Republicans in Congress know that for better or worse, their political fates are hitched to Trump＊s popularity, which stems in part from his disruptive and racially tinged tone. That hitch was fixed in place last year when GOP lawmakers rallied around Trump as their nominee for president. Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee and GOP leadership in Congress who opposed Trump for president, said that dynamic isn＊t likely to go away. ※As long as Trump remains popular with their primary voters,§ he said, ※I don＊t see things changing.§ President Donald Trump says the groups protesting against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, were ""also very violent.""

"President Trump, increasingly isolated, appears caught in a cycle of anger and provocation as he pushes wider the nation＊s longstanding racial and cultural divide to solidify his dwindling base of populist political support. The latest examples came Thursday: Trump further inflamed the incendiary debate over the nation＊s Confederate memorials, saying American culture was ※being ripped apart§ by their removal; lashed out at some perceived Senate enemies; and repeated a religiously offensive myth about an American general using bullets bathed in pigs＊ blood to kill Muslim terrorists. His fusillade came throughout the day on Twitter even as critics, including in Trump＊s party, implored him to instead try to unite the nation. As the restive president ostensibly vacationed at his golf club in New Jersey, his unnerved aides were left to deal with the fallout from his tweets and verbal blasts in the days since Saturday, when white separatists provoked deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va. For Trump, the challenge of governing has grown ever more daunting since he took office in January without the usual bounce of popularity for a new president. As his support has declined, he has relied more on his most ardent supporters, who generally are white, older, nonurban and deeply conservative. Yet by his efforts to please the hard-right activists, the president is pushing mainstream supporters further away. Polls show his job approval rating below 40%, sometimes dipping into the low 30s, and they suggest his core support 〞 the people who say they will never abandon him 〞 amounts to about 1 in 4 Americans. It was 1934 and fascism was on the march not only in Europe but in America. People who admired Adolf Hitler, who had taken power in Germany, formed Nazi organizations in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, represented by lawyers who were Jewish, faced an existential question:... It was 1934 and fascism was on the march not only in Europe but in America. People who admired Adolf Hitler, who had taken power in Germany, formed Nazi organizations in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union, represented by lawyers who were Jewish, faced an existential question:... That base, together with some more moderate voters who hoped Trump would use his impulsiveness and business instincts to shake up Washington, allowed him to eke out a narrow electoral college victory against an unpopular Hillary Clinton. But governing has been a struggle, diminishing Trump＊s leverage over congressional Republicans the more they fear his unpopularity will imperil their majorities. Trump struck back hard with his Twitter finger Thursday from early morning on, all but endorsing the Republican opponent of Jeff Flake, a GOP senator from Arizona who has criticized him, and assailing local efforts to remove monuments to Confederate heroes. After news broke of a terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain, the president repeated a dubious myth he previously invoked on the campaign trail, to much criticism, about a general who used bullets coated in pigs＊ blood to execute insurgents in the Philippines in the early 20th century?; to followers of Islam, pigs are impure. ※Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught,§ Trump tweeted. ※There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!§ Trump＊s quick condemnation of the Barcelona carnage as a terrorist attack, and his suggestion that Muslims were at fault, came before Spanish authorities had released conclusive information. As such, Trump＊s rapid response contrasted with his slowness in calling out the white supremacists in Charlottesville 〞 blame he rescinded on Tuesday, when he said ※both sides§ were culpable for violence there 〞 and contradicted his claim in that instance that he only comments on such incidents after all the facts are known. Trump still has not called the fatal attack in Charlottesville, in which a car driven by an alleged white supremacist plowed into a crowd, an act of terrorism. His tweets extolling Confederate memorials on Thursday drew an explicit link to the threats many of his far-right followers see to the nation＊s cultural identity. Separately, his polarizing advisor, Stephen K. Bannon, egged on the escalating culture wars in rare public comments. As Trump plans for a rally Tuesday in Arizona, the mayor of Phoenix has asked him to stay away in the interests of public safety, a perhaps unprecedented request to a sitting president. The state is home to Flake, who has written a book critical of Trump, as well as fellow GOP Sen. John McCain, whom Trump also mocked this week, reigniting their long-running feud. The president tweeted praise for Republican Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator who plans to challenge Flake next year 〞 after recently suggesting that McCain step down given his cancer diagnosis so the governor could appoint her in his place. Trump has suggested he might pardon controversial former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a vocal campaign supporter. Arpaio was recently convicted of ignoring a judge＊s order to halt his practice of racial profiling as part of immigration enforcement efforts when he was sheriff in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. While Trump＊s public approval has hovered near 40%, some of that support is soft. Republican pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, looking at a range of recent polls, estimated his hardcore backing at about 1 in 4 Americans. In a recent poll by CNN, for example, 24% of respondents said they trusted all or most of what they hear from the White House. A poll by ABC and the Washington Post found 24% saying Trump acts in a presidential manner. In a poll earlier this week from Monmouth University, 24% of respondents said they supported Trump and couldn＊t think of anything he could do that would change their minds. A poll by Marist College for National Public Radio and PBS, released Thursday, found that 27% approved of Trump＊s response to the violence in Charlottesville. The same poll found that 20% of those surveyed said they ※strongly approve§ of the job he is doing as president. Republicans in Congress have tried to stick with President Trump in hopes that despite politically damaging outbursts from the White House, his pen would ultimately be able to sign their legislative agenda into law. But in the aftermath of Trump＊s controversial response to the neo-Nazi rally in... Republicans in Congress have tried to stick with President Trump in hopes that despite politically damaging outbursts from the White House, his pen would ultimately be able to sign their legislative agenda into law. But in the aftermath of Trump＊s controversial response to the neo-Nazi rally in... Trump excited that base on Tuesday when he defended the monuments during a chaotic news conference, saying the memorials＊ future should be left to localities. But by redoubling his opposition to their removal on Thursday, the president is certain to roil the local debates. ※Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,§ Trump tweeted. ※You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson - who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!§ he added. Trump's equation of Lee and Jackson, who took up arms for the South＊s secession, with founders George Washington and Thomas Jefferson echoed one of the major arguments that defenders of the Confederate monuments make. Monuments to leaders of the Confederacy were erected across the South, and in some other parts of the country, mostly starting in the early 20th century as whites fought to restrict black citizens＊ freedoms. To African Americans and many white Southerners, the statues have long been a symbol of racial oppression. In recent years, the movement to take them down, and in some cases to put them in museums, has gained momentum. The argument for the monuments may be a better one for Trump than his emphasis in his other comments Tuesday defending the armed white supremacists in Charlottesville as no more to blame for the violence than those who marched against them. This week＊s Marist Poll said that 62% of Americans would like to keep such symbols. It＊s uncertain whether Trump＊s association with the issue now will drag that support down given his personal unpopularity. Bannon, who has pushed Trump to embrace cultural fights since joining his campaign last year, says it＊s a winning argument, especially if the debate draws the left away from offering an economic message. ※The race-identity politics of the left wants to say it＊s all racist,§ Bannon told the New York Times, speaking of the furor over the monuments. ※Just give me more. Tear down more statues. Say the revolution is coming. I can＊t get enough of it.§ Bannon gave several rare interviews in recent days as his own job appears tenuous; Trump refused to rule out firing him earlier in the week. In the most startling exchange, in the liberal publication American Prospect, Bannon derided many on the far right who protested in Charlottesville as losers, ※a fringe element§ and ※a collection of clowns,§ even as he welcomed their cultural warfare. But the interview also provided further evidence of the rifts in the White House that have added to Trump＊s governing challenges. Bannon spoke openly about dispatching rivals in the administration, including in the Defense and State departments, who oppose his drive to confront China on trade. ※They＊re wetting themselves,§ he added. He flatly contradicted Trump's strategy of tough talk in the face of North Korea's nuclear threat: ※There＊s no military solution, forget it.§ And he cast Gary Cohn, Trump＊s top economic advisor, along with ※Goldman Sachs lobbying,§ as forces aligned against his economic agenda. The comments forced the White House and State Department to issue separate statements reinforcing that Cohn and and Susan Thornton, an Asia policy official also singled out by Bannon, were both still in their jobs.

"A series tracking five scientists who are running for office.  They have built careers isolating cells, designing integrated circuits and mastering computer languages. Now they are knocking on doors, being interviewed on TV and asking perfect strangers to give them money. Across the country, scientists 〞 card-carrying members of an elite that prizes expertise 〞 are exiting their ivory towers to enter the political fray.?There＊s the cancer researcher from Mississippi, the integrated circuit designer from New York, the physician from Utah and the stem cell biologist from Southern California, among dozens?of others. It＊s a move that appears to defy the first principle of their profession: logic. Unlike a law degree, a Ph.D. does not provide a well-worn path to politics. And while 79% of Americans believe that science has made life easier, their esteem for the scientific enterprise has been on a steady decline, according to the Pew Research Center. But even amidst signs that science is losing its power to persuade, a new crop of office-seekers is anything but discouraged. In districts blue and red, working scientists are putting two hypotheses to the test. First: Their facility with facts and data will make them better policymakers than the politicians currently in office. Second: Their profession＊s reputation for pragmatism and problem-solving will mobilize and unify voters around them. ※Our skill set works: We analyze complex information and make it understandable to people,§ said Dr. Kathie Allen, a family physician who is running for the Utah congressional seat soon to be vacated?by Republican firebrand Jason E. Chaffetz. ※People are really tired of falsehoods,§ she added. With careers grounded in facts and evidence, she said, scientists offer a compelling alternative for voters fed up with career politicians. Our skill set works: We analyze complex information and make it understandable to people. That may sound like the wishful thinking of a political newbie, but some longtime campaign strategists agree. Joe Trippi, who has worked with Ted Kennedy, John Edwards, Jerry Brown and Howard Dean, said scientists were?a double threat in the current political moment. For voters dismayed by the Trump administration＊s attacks on climate science and proposals to slash federal funding for biomedical research, a scientist-turned-office-seeker offers a direct antidote to the status quo. And for voters craving an alternative to politics as usual, these unconventional candidates feed into a compelling ※insurgent§ narrative. If you＊re a scientist, ※your background is perfect for the time we＊re in,§ Trippi said. The ranks of scientists, engineers and medical professionals in Congress has grown from 24 two decades ago to 33 today. But those members are still dwarfed by?people with backgrounds in law or business, who fill roughly three-quarters of the 535 seats in the House and Senate, according to the Congressional Research Service. There＊s no official tally of how many scientists have run for office. But anecdotal evidence for a surge in candidates is widespread. Rush Holt, a plasma physicist who served eight terms in the U.S. House of Representatives before retiring in 2014, has seen it firsthand.?People who were once wary of political participation have been pushed off the sidelines and into the public square by a sense that ※science is too relevant and important to be downgraded or ignored,§ he said. Over the years, Holt has counseled a thin trickle of scientists pondering a run for public office. Now, he said, it＊s a stampede. ※I＊m getting more interest 〞 by far 〞 than I＊ve gotten in previous election cycles,§ said Holt, who is now president of the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science. He calls it ※a remarkable moment.§? Like Allen and Holt, many of the scientists eyeing a run for office are Democrats, keen to challenge a president who has questioned the value of vaccines and dismissed global warming as a Chinese hoax.?Whether they come from chemistry labs or radio astronomy observatories, they can channel the frustration and anger that prompted more than 1 million people to March for Science this spring. But they＊re quick to point out they＊re not ideologues. Is there a better way to create policy? You take large amounts of information and distill it, and come up with a conclusion. It has nothing to do with partisanship. ※Is there a better way to create policy?§ asked Patricia Zornio, a biomedical researcher at Stanford University who is contemplating a 2020 challenge to Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican. ※You take large amounts of information and distill it, and come up with a conclusion. It has nothing to do with partisanship.§ If that faith in science sounds like it could easily veer toward sanctimonious bromides, the would-be candidates have been warned. ※We are so naive as scientists,§ said South Miami Mayor Philip Stoddard, who also happens to be an expert on the evolution of animal communication on the faculty of Florida International University. ※We think the truth carries and that science always matters.§ The corrective, he told a group of prospective candidates recently, is to find a ※coach that knows more about the business than you do.§ Since shortly after the inauguration of President Trump, training sessions and webinars have cropped up to coach Democratic office-seekers with a scientific bent. Among the most visible have been sessions organized by 314 Action (314 refers to the value of pi). So far, the group has had inquiries from roughly 6,000 scientists and science advocates, from all 50 states. Close to 100 of them gathered in Washington, D.C., two days before the March for Science for the biggest training event to date. There, would-be candidates learned how to craft a message (※make science local§), recruit and organize an army of volunteers (※present it as an opportunity§)?and canvas voters (※bring dog biscuits!§). They learned what to wear, how to sit for a TV interview, and how to hit up potential donors. Among the scientist dos: Introduce yourself as a ※different kind of politician.§ Mine data to find and target your district＊s voters. Change things up if your message isn＊t working. (※You＊re an experimentalist!§ Stoddard?reminded them.) Scientist don＊ts included reading your curriculum vitae, using PowerPoint slides?and appending footnotes to position papers. (※Footnotes!§ cried political communications specialist Chris Jahnke, who has coached Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama. ※God bless you, please don＊t!§) Do scientists have an advantage in the current political environment, with the Democratic Party awash in volunteers eager to run against the GOP? ※Absolutely,§ Democratic campaign strategist Martha McKenna?told a 314 Action session. Voters think ※politicians talk and nothing gets done,§ she said. ※As scientists, you find solutions.§ We＊re not full of crap.... ?If we were a pack of liars, the jig would be up. It＊s a message that resonates with Patrick Madden, a professor of computer science at Binghamton University in New York. In May, he announced a bid to challenge Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.) in New York＊s 22nd?Congressional District. Madden holds up his cellphone, a device more powerful than the computer that sent men to the moon. His work on integrated circuits has helped make such devices faster, better and more fun to own. ※We＊re not full of crap,§ he said. ※Things like this got better because we make stuff that＊s real. If we were a pack of liars, the jig would be up.§ Madden calls himself ※a firm believer in the scientific method, the engineering mind-set.§ ※These principles of being honest, being truthful and looking for solutions: it＊s a radical idea,§ he said. ※But I think we ought to try it.§ Few people understand the challenges scientists face when they run for office as well as Shaughnessy Naughton. She has done it herself not once but twice. In 2014 and again in 2016,?Naughton campaigned?for a congressional seat in eastern Pennsylvania,?touting her experience?as a researcher who helped develop drugs for?breast cancer?and infectious diseases. Although she had to set that career aside to help out her family＊s struggling publishing business, she continued to make the case that her scientific background would be an asset in Washington. Neither of Naughton＊s campaigns got very far; she lost both times in the Democratic primary. But she found that scientists rallied behind her candidacy. So she switched gears and?founded 314 Action?to help elect candidates with backgrounds in science, engineering, technology and math. The Times caught up with Naughton during a recent visit to Orange County to talk about the growing interest in mixing science with politics. What is the 314 Action＊s mission? To elect more people with scientific and technical backgrounds to public office at all levels of government. Why is that important? Right now there really is a dearth of people with scientific and technical backgrounds at all levels of government. We see that reflected in priorities in legislation and the failure to act on climate change. That would change if we had more technically minded people in office. Read more This is what now passes for a typical day in the life of Randy Wadkins, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Ole Miss: In his biochem lab, he was overseeing work to boost the anti-tumor action of a class of cancer drugs called camptothecins. In his office, he was preparing a paper for publication in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. And, as a declared candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, he was getting ready for an evening chat with the Democratic Executive Committee of Alcorn County in northeastern Mississippi. For Wadkins, the idea of running for office first took hold during the bruising presidential campaign. First, he had grown uneasy with what he viewed as a drumbeat of anti-scientific rhetoric from candidate Donald Trump. After the election, Wadkins was appalled that President-elect Trump questioned the value and safety of vaccines, which Wadkins calls ※the peak of biomedical knowledge.§ Then in March, the Trump administration unveiled a 2018 federal budget proposal that sought to slash federal funding for research on biomedicine, climate and the environment. That, Wadkins said, ※was the final straw.§ The Trump funding plan ※would essentially destroy science and engineering as we know it,§ he said. But that wasn＊t all. With cuts to education, small business development and Meals on Wheels, the spending blueprint ※would completely tank the Mississippi economy.§ Wadkins waited on the sidelines for someone to step forward and challenge Republican Rep. Trent Kelly, who won Mississippi＊s 1st District seat in a 2015 special election. As it became clear no one would, the career scientist took stock of his assets. Mississippi born and bred, he had spent his youth helping in his dad＊s grocery store and fishing with stink-bait (※They smell it and they come-a-swimmin＊,§ he said), attributes that prove he＊s anything but a carpet-bagger. As a tenured scientist with a record of solving complex problems, he had the brainpower to tackle the job. By focusing on cancer research, he had demonstrated a commitment to improving people＊s lives. Plus, he had just spent a year immersing himself in healthcare policy as a science and?technology congressional fellow in the Washington office of Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.). Finally, Wadkins decided he was angry enough to put his academic career on hold and make a go of public office. On April 18, at a town meeting in Oxford, Miss., Wadkins joined a group of some 200 citizens awaiting an appearance by Rep. Kelly. After it became apparent that the congressman was a no-show, Wadkins seized the opportunity to announce that he was making a bid for the seat. ※It＊s a very strange thing to utter the words, ＆I＊m running for Congress,＊§ Wadkins said. ※If you pause and think about it, it＊s a very terrifying thing. But I think about what Bruce Springsteen said when he was asked how he put himself out there every night. He said, ＆Your desperation has to be greater than your fear.＊ And that＊s where I am: My desperation is greater than my fear.§ Raised in conservative, rural New Hampshire, Patricia Zornio was the first in her family to study for an advanced degree, pursuing clinical neuropsychology and exploring novel therapeutics for severe mental illness. Now, she＊s a researcher and project manager at Stanford University, where she has become an expert on rare and undiagnosed diseases. But politics have always tugged at her. With the same methodical approach she used to build a career as a translational scientist, Zornio is laying the groundwork for a Senate run in 2020. The seat she is eyeing now belongs to Sen. Cory Gardner, a first-term Republican from Colorado. Though Zornio works for Stanford, she is a resident of Boulder, and she has spent the past year crisscrossing Colorado?to participate in town halls and speak to any group that invites her. Zornio hasn＊t begun raising money or building a campaign organization. For now, she＊s testing the waters, to see ※if people are interested in potentially voting for a progressive female scientist from a rural background.§ So far, she thinks, the signs are good. ※I haven＊t had any trouble filling a room,§ said Zornio, who goes by Trish. Zornio＊s science, as well as her politics, is a departure from that of the family she grew up in: All, she thinks, voted for Donald Trump in November＊s election. Zornio said her father＊s initial reaction to her plans 〞 stony silence 〞 has just begun to yield to acceptance. In the view of family members, ※science has taken things,§ such as pulp and paper mills, which they believe were driven out of business by environmental regulation. They do not seem to grasp science＊s connection to lucrative high-tech jobs, clean water and good medical care, she said. But that experience has helped prepare her to talk about science and its role in making policy as she travels across Colorado collecting names of would-be donors and campaign volunteers. ※You＊ve got to humanize it,§ she said. ※My father and I are still learning how to talk politics.§? Colorado is a state that voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in each of the last three elections; Hillary Clinton＊s margin of victory was close to 5 percentage points. But it is still considered a purple state with strong conservative pockets. In recent years, out-of-state money has played a prominent role in bankrolling conservative politicians. To challenge Gardner, Zornio would probably have to raise funds and woo supporters from across the country. A classical pianist who identifies herself as an ※official band geek,§ Zornio helps organizes jazz, classical and musical theater performances all over Colorado. That experience is probably good practice for a political run, she said. Already, a planned musical event in Boulder in late June is looking more and more like a protest, she added. On the issues, Zornio brings a background in healthcare and environmental sustainability to a run against Gardner. Over the next few years, she plans to ground herself in finance and economic issues in the same way she has always built expertise: as if she＊s getting a Ph.D. Zornio, who is single, said she has worked her ※whole life to get to Stanford,§ and she＊s keenly aware that a political campaign would mean giving up a flourishing career in science. But her career has also connected her to lots of patients facing death, and they have taught her an important lesson: ※People really tend to regret the things they didn＊t try.§ Phil Janowicz might have been your favorite chemistry teacher in college. His youthful enthusiasm, sense of humor and willingness to chat are all as clear as the safety glasses on his nose. But this former Cal State Fullerton chemistry professor is now looking to form a different kind of bond 〞 with the Orange County voters he hopes to represent in Washington, D.C. The 33-year-old Janowicz is going after a big target: Republican Congressman Ed Royce of Fullerton, who was first elected to represent California＊s 39th District in 1992 and is chairman?of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Janowicz, a Democrat, announced his candidacy in April at an amphitheater in the heart the university＊s campus. His chemistry background (and love of puns) are evident in his campaign slogan: ※Solutions for Congress.§ It was something he?had been mulling for a long time, and the turning point came on Nov. 8, 2016. Janowicz and his wife were watching the election returns together. Angela Janowicz, an English teacher, was wearing her ※Nasty woman§ T-shirt, and the two were geared up for a Hillary Clinton victory. But as it became clear that Donald Trump had won, Angela turned to Phil and told him he should go for it. ※Be the change you want to see in the world,§ she said. ※It＊ll be our next adventure.§ To ready himself for a run, Janowicz reluctantly left his tenured teaching position at Cal State Fullerton. Jumping in head first?was the only proper way to take on a challenge like this, he said. ※There were so many things I wanted to do to help in this community,§ he said. ※Teaching chemistry only went so far.§ But Janowicz said he would?continue to think like a scientist 〞 a habit that will protect him from succumbing to ideological rigidity. ※My mind can be changed by data,§ he said. ※Science will work, whether we believe in it or not.§ Minutes after he declared his candidacy, the National Republican Congressional Committee issued a statement that mocked his academic background: ※Liberal professor Janowicz may hypothesize he has a snowball＊s chance challenging Royce, but in the real world, he＊ll find Royce＊s support runs deep and wide in Orange County.§ Janowicz, who studied cognitive psychology at MIT before earning a doctorate?in chemistry at University of Illinois, was quick to pick up on the Republican committee's?code for ※elitist.§ He had his comeback ready. ※There＊s nothing wrong with being a professor,§ Janowicz said. ※It＊s teaching the next generation how to be good, functioning members of society and get good jobs to support their families.§ By early June, Janowicz had hired a campaign manager, a communications consultant, a fundraising specialist and a firm to keep his electoral paperwork in order. Janowicz has been critical of Royce＊s positions on healthcare, education and the environment. He says at least 1 in 5?students in the Cal State system struggles with food or shelter insecurity, and many are afraid their parents could be apprehended by immigration officials if they show up for graduation. ※I＊m so inspired that they＊re working so hard,§ he said. ※We need a system that works as hard for them.§ With his chunky black-framed glasses, close-cropped hair and graying beard, Binghamton University computer scientist Patrick Madden gives off a Jeff Goldblum vibe. He designs mobile apps for fun, and teaches a graduate seminar in computer science theory. ※I love my job, the students I teach,§ Madden said. ※I＊ve got a pretty good life.§ All was going well, he said, until the election of Donald Trump. That event has pushed him off the sidelines and into politics. In May, he announced his bid to challenge Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney, a freshman who swept into office on Trump＊s coattails. Rep. Tenney＊s seat is one of 59 the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has targeted for turnover in 2018. And it＊s one of 10 Republican House seats to which the National Republican Congressional Committee has announced it will devote additional fundraising and organizational assistance. In short, it＊s a battleground seat. Madden said he＊s never considered himself ※hyperpartisan,§ but as the details of the Trump administration＊s policy agenda emerged, he decided he could not ※sit and watch while we spiral down the drain.§ Madden expected his wife, Laura Lee Intscher, to try to talk him out of running. Instead, she told him he ※absolutely had to do it.§ His daughters, ages 14 and 17, are less enthusiastic, but have grudgingly climbed on board. ※They understand that sometimes you have to do the right thing, and that＊s not the same as the easy thing,§ Madden said. At the same time, he hopes he can shield his girls from the spotlight: He doesn＊t want his choice to make their lives ※excessively weird.§ Madden has had some early success raising campaign funds on the Crowdpac website and attracting the notice of political professionals. National media strategist Joe Trippi has signed on to help his campaign, and he＊s hired a finance director, a team to pull together mailers and campaign literature, and a company to oversee his paperwork and payroll. Madden is a believer in the ※engineering mind-set§ that dissects the problems, assesses the options and works toward a solution. He compares that with the training lawyers bring to public office: ※to argue a position.§ This contrast, he said, sets him up as the kind of get-it-done candidate voters want in New York＊s upstate 22nd?District, which lies between Albany and Syracuse. ※I＊ve never met a lawyer who said, ＆Hey, you made a good point, I＊m going to change my mind.＊ It＊s just not what they＊re trained to do,§ Madden said. ※I have been wrong before and it＊s not about me winning and someone else losing. It＊s about getting to the right answer.§ There are other ways Madden thinks his science and engineering experience has equipped him well for public office. ※I＊m sure the first attack will be that I＊m a liberal professor who does nothing,§ he said. ※But I＊ll have plenty of people from the chip industry who will vouch for me that I solve problems. It＊s not hot air. This is my community: We look at real-world problems and come up with solutions. Then, they get manufactured and sold.§ One possible indication Madden is being taken seriously as a candidate? In recent days, he＊s gotten a spate of warnings that someone is trying to crack his password. Perhaps Moscow is already on to him. Family physician Kathie Allen was laying careful plans for a run against U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz when the Utah Republican announced in late April he would retire from Congress in 2018. Since then, Allen, a Democrat, has had to put her campaign into warp drive. The district, which includes Provo and Orem, is ※deep red,§ she said 〞 one of the most conservative in the nation. But as a family physician, she thinks voters will trust her, especially as she denounces the GOP＊s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. ※I have 30 years of demonstrating actions to improve people＊s quality of life,§ Allen said. There are other ways her medical background may translate into success in the political arena, she believes. Primary care physicians ※develop a keen sense of compassion,§ she said. ""We stop judging and we just try to find solutions. We don＊t know how much is genetic, or environmental. You just deal with it and don＊t blame the patient, because he＊s sick.§ Indeed, her campaign slogan touts her medical background: ※Strong Medicine for the 3rd Congressional District.§ Although this is Allen＊s first time as a candidate, it＊s not her first foray into politics. Before enrolling at Loma Linda Medical School in 1980, she served as a congressional aide to Rep. Shirley Pettis (R-Calif.). Then she worked as a housing and community development coordinator in San Bernardino County. The campaign is time-consuming, but Allen still sees patients two days a week. Building a political operation from the ground up 〞 and on such short notice 〞 while caring for patients ※is like an internship in medicine,§ she said: It＊s both exhausting and exhilarating. At her side, and behind the wheel on most whistle stops, is her husband,?Craig Fineshriber, a retired percussionist for the Utah Symphony. Once Chaffetz announced his intention to quit Congress, Fineshriber told Allen, ※Let＊s do this thing.§ Since then, he＊s been an advisor, chauffeur and right-hand man for the campaign, said Allen＊s campaign manager, Emily Bingham. In April, she joined in the March for Science in Washington. She said she is perplexed by what she sees as the Trump administration＊s hostility to science 〞 and to facts. ※This is an administration that would never put a man on the moon or cure diseases. They just reject data,§ Allen said. ※At the March for Science, we were all scratching our heads and thinking, how do they think America ever got to be the power it is, esteemed by the world?"" An internationally known stem cell scientist and entrepreneur will join the ranks of candidates trying to unseat Republican incumbents in contested House races next year when he announces Thursday his challenge of 18-term Rep.?Dana Rohrabacher. Hans Keirstead, a 50-year-old Democrat from Laguna Beach, said Wednesday that he will run in the 48th Congressional District,?one of more than half a dozen in California?that have been targeted by?Democrats?seeking to harness sentiment against?President Trump?in their fight for a House majority. Keirstead＊s candidacy has been sought by some national Democratic figures, who see his science and business background as a good fit for the district. It runs along the Orange County coastline from Laguna Beach to Seal Beach, and includes some nearby inland cities.

""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda will be talking with high school students in the San Fernando?Valley Thursday, a day after the hit Broadway musical opened at Hollywood's Pantages Theatre. The appearance?alongside Rep. Tony C芍rdenas (D-Los Angeles) is being billed as a ""town hall"" on civic engagement and Miranda is expected to take questions from the students. About 1,000 high schoolers from across C芍rdenas' 29th Congressional District have been invited to participate, according to the congressman's spokeswoman. His staff has asked The Times not to?disclose the exact location of the event until shortly before it begins due to concerns that hundreds of screaming fans might descend on the school. So why, exactly, did Miranda decide to visit C芍rdenas' district? Cardenas' spokeswoman said the congressman met up with Miranda's father, Luis Miranda, a political consultant, after months of hearing from mutual friends that they should meet. They talked over coffee about the need to promote and empower Latino youth to engage them in the political process. ""From the congressman's perspective, so many young Latinos just don't have faith in themselves and the confidence to get involved, so it was something that they're both very passionate about,"" said spokeswoman?Francesca Amodeo.

Orange County GOP Rep.?Dana Rohrabacher confirmed that he met Wednesday?with WikiLeaks?founder Julian Assange, who is still living in asylum at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London.? In a statement, Rohrabacher's?office said the?Australian fugitive ""emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved"" in the theft of?Democratic National Committee emails during the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails, which were published by WikiLeaks, put?Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on the defensive. The conversation between Rohrabacher and Assange, which was first reported by the Daily Caller,?""ranged over many topics,"" according to the?statement. The statement didn't reveal much more, but said ""the congressman plans to divulge more of what he found directly to President Trump."" Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have agreed Russia was involved in the theft of Democratic Party emails and tried to influence the 2016 election to benefit Trump. The Justice Department, along with multiple?House and Senate committees, are investigating potential ties between Trump's campaign and election meddling. Rohrabacher, who has long been criticized for his fondness for?Russia, believes he is the only congressman who has?visited Assange. Rohrabacher's name has repeatedly come up in discussions of the investigation into Russian interference. His spokesman did not respond to requests for additional comment, including questions about how the trip was funded and whether the White House was aware of the trip.? Assange has been hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy since 2012 to avoid sexual assault allegations against him in Sweden. That investigation was?dropped?this year, but British authorities have said he could still be arrested for jumping bail if he leaves the embassy. In April, CIA Director Mike Pompeo?dismissed Assange as a ""narcissist"" and called WikiLeaks a ""non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia."" House Speaker Paul Ryan has criticized Assange as a ""sycophant for Russia."" Trump himself has expressed an affinity for Assange in the past, tweeting praise for the fugitive. The Washington Post reported in April that federal prosecutors were weighing whether to bring charges against members of WikiLeaks, in part over information leaked by Chelsea Manning, the U.S. soldier convicted of handing over diplomatic cables to the organization. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is demanding that Rohrabacher?resign from his seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Democrats and Republicans alike agree that Julian Assange is a threat to America's national security and has aligned with the Kremlin to undermine our elections,"" said DCCC spokesman Drew Godinich, who called Rohrabacher's?behavior ""completely shocking."" Rohrabacher is one of the top Republican incumbents?California Democrats are hoping to topple in 2018. He has already attracted nine challengers, most of them Democrats, including real estate broker Harley Rouda, who released a campaign ad criticizing the 15-term Republican for his repeated defense of Russia. Rohrabacher, who once worked for the Orange County Register,?told The Hill?that he also planned to convey a request from Assange to Trump?for a WikiLeaks?seat inside the White House press room. ※Julian passionately argued the case that WikiLeaks was vital to informing the public about controversial though necessary issues,"" he told The Hill. ""As a former newsman myself, I can't see a reason why they shouldn't be granted news status for official press conferences.""

"So this is making America great again? We＊re losing respect around the world. The president is striking out in Congress. And he seems incapable of leading a nation that he increasingly is tearing apart. He＊s a president who can＊t even manage a simple, believable denunciation of racism and bigotry. He equates people protesting against racism and bigotry with the racists and bigots themselves. And President Trump thinks California ※is out of control?§ That＊s what he told Fox News earlier this year. When it comes to racism and bigotry, California admittedly can＊t be too smug. The state ranks No. 1 in the nation for hate groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. There are 79 active here. There＊s also our shameful history, although we＊ve mostly owned up to past sins and steadily become more tolerant. California rejected slavery from the start, but committed genocide against Native Americans. In the 1850s, the state government paid bounties for their body parts 〞 25 cents per scalp, up to $5 for a whole head. In his 1851 State of the State message to the Legislature, Gov. John McDougall declared a ※war of extermination§ against California Indians. In 1769, there were 300,000 here. By 1900, their numbers had fallen to only 17,000. For many decades, California discriminated horribly against Asians. Japanese immigrants were barred from owning property. The Chinese couldn＊t legally migrate here at all. In more modern times, Californians voted overwhelmingly half a century ago to continue racial discrimination in the sale and rental of housing. Ronald Reagan strongly supported the discrimination while being elected governor in 1966. The state and U.S. Supreme Courts ruled the discrimination unconstitutional. In 1994, Californians voted in a near landslide to deny public services, including education, to immigrants here illegally. That meant kids would be kicked out of school. Proponents insisted that was aimed at illegal immigration, not Latinos. Whatever, courts ruled it unconstitutional. Confederate names have no place on California schools>> In contrast, Gov. Jerry Brown and the Legislature recently extended Medi-Cal healthcare for the poor to undocumented children. Two years ago, the issue of racial hatred resurfaced when a young white supremacist who was obsessed with the Confederate battle flag gunned down nine African Americans in a black Charleston, S.C., church. That started a serious movement in the South to ban Confederate flags from public buildings and tear down old monuments to Dixie war heroes, including Gen. Robert E. Lee. In all, about 70 monuments have been destroyed or moved, but more than 700 remain. It was the planned removal of a Robert E. Lee statue by the city of Charlottesville, Va., that white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan were protesting when they clashed with counter-demonstrators last Saturday. Three people died and 35 were injured. Californians looked around two years ago and found a couple of schools in Long Beach and San Diego named after Lee. The schools since have changed their names under pressure. California confronts its Confederate past as monuments are abruptly removed>> Elsewhere in California, there were five markers erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy as part of the so-called Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway System, named after the Confederate president. A Stockton street was named for Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson. And Ft. Bragg on the north coast was named for Braxton Bragg, who commanded a U.S. Army outpost there, then defected to the Confederacy and became a high-ranking general. So what＊s wrong with all that? Really little, if you can dismiss the ugly fact that the battle flags and warrior monuments have become idols worshiped by white supremacists and the KKK. Nazi swastikas and Confederate flags have become matching parts of many racist uniforms. Updates from Sacramento ? For many of us, the Confederate flag has always been a symbol of slavery, treason and racism. The Civil War was started by the South to protect slavery, pure and simple. Yes, it was about states＊ rights 〞 the states＊ rights to keep black people in bondage and enhance the wealth of plantation owners. Confederate flag represents South no more than Mexico's represents California>> I say this as a native Californian whose parents came here from the South, descending from many generations of Southerners. My great-great-grandfather Skelton, a Tennessee tobacco and hog farmer who never owned slaves, died fighting for the Confederacy. You can spare me any nostalgic fairy tales of Southern charm, magnolias and the Antebellum era. It may have been a grand way of life, but only for wealthy white folk. In 2015, state Sen. Steve Glazer (D-Orinda) pushed a bill through the Legislature to prohibit calling any California public school, building, park or road anything Confederate. The legislation stated that certain groups use Confederate symbols ※to demean and offend whole segments of our society while sowing racial divisions.§ Enshrining the names of Confederate leaders, it said, ※is antithetical to California＊s mission of racial equality.§ Brown vetoed the bill, contending that naming things should be the prerogative of local governments. ※I＊m for local control, too,§ Glazer says. ※But we＊ve given them decades to change their names. Isn＊t that enough? But some did come around.§ ※Those symbols, those flags,§ he adds, ※do belong in our history books 〞 just not in a place of honor.§ Trump seems utterly confused about all this, unable to distinguish the moral right from wrong.

"I had no idea how difficult it would be to breast-feed my newborn son. As a first-time mom, nursing was so hard I started taking notes on my iPhone for a story I wanted to write about how none of the products marketed to make the practice easier were actually practical. It would be a screed on the pumping industrial complex, surely designed by people who had never needed to nourish a baby. I would call it ※Stop crying over spilled milk,§ and it would help the moms like me and the babies like my son who shed a lot of tears before getting it right. It was probably the hormones that had me so riled up over ill-fitting nipple shields and pumps with stupid designs, because I let the idea go as time passed and nursing Maxwell became second nature. The ※breast is best§ message has returned after formula-filled decades of the not-so-distant past. Breast milk helps build crucial antibodies. Babies are less likely to face obesity, diabetes or other problems. Moms will lose the pregnancy weight easier. In the lead-up to Maxwell＊s birth, I learned all of that. I was on board, and my goal was to get to six months of exclusively breast-feeding, even though I would be going back to work after four. What they didn＊t tell me was that I would be starving. All the time. I ate Pop-Tarts at 3 a.m. just to feel like I wasn＊t going to pass out. They didn＊t tell me that sometimes it＊s a team effort. My endlessly patient husband, Patrick, with the latch assist. Nurses in the hospital assessing my milk production. Lactation consultants describing the various holds and pillows, none of which felt quite right. Friends, and even my mother-in-law, got up close and personal with my nipples. They didn＊t tell me that you are better off remaining topless during the hardest part. (You try entertaining visitors without a shirt on.) Anything that touched my body hurt. They told me after six weeks it would be a breeze. It was more than two months before the pain eased. And then nursing was fine. Wonderful, even. Knowing my son was healthy and growing thanks to me was a new sort of fulfillment. It was the whole storing extra breast milk so I could go back to work thing that was most difficult. Most of my pumping was in the dark of night, after Maxwell had fallen back asleep. Headphones and Netflix became my best friends as I endured the unpleasant, sometimes hour-long process. We carefully saved every fraction of an ounce we could. The occasional spill had me back in tears. In the heat of it all, I invented things in my mind like a baby＊s mouth-shaped pump so it would feel less like you were hooked up to farm-grade milking machinery, a straw-shaped device to capture those drops that just won＊t come out of the tube and mix-and-match parts for the women like me whose full breasts were lopsided because my son favored one over the other. More health headlines ? Pumping at work sucks, pardon the pun. I＊m actually very lucky 〞 many of my female colleagues not so many years ago were stuck pumping in bathrooms, or attempting to find privacy. As an editor, I am mostly in the office, not out reporting stories, which presents a new set of challenges. There＊s a private nursing room with a fridge I can use, and women who have come before me have posted pictures of their adorable little ones on a bulletin board. When I first got back to work, I configured my office to drop the blinds and open a curtain so no one could see in when I pumped twice a day. I needed a sign, so I printed an apology under a photo of a baby bottle. (My mom demanded I redo it: ※Why are you ＆sorry＊?§ The new sign just asks people to find me via Slack or email because I am unavailable.) I blocked off two 45-minute increments on my calendar to protect pumping time. That became unrealistic pretty quickly, so I＊m down to once in the early afternoon. Looking at photos and videos of Maxwell while pumping helps, but I never get as much milk as I know is in there because I＊m juggling editing duties and conference calls, and it＊s hard not to be distracted by the fact the newsroom is right out there, just a few feet from my closed door. In typical journalist morbid humor, I frequently envision a massive earthquake striking just as I've got 2 ounces hanging from the bottle attached to my breast. I play out the scenario in my mind. Would I detach, put my shirt back on and run out? Duck and cover and hope for the best? Most importantly, would I take the time to save the milk? Who am I kidding? Of course I would. Every drop matters. I＊ve realized recently there＊s no real guidebook for what happens next. Some moms are only able to keep it up a few weeks. Others have so much milk they are giving it to a donor bank for preemies. I have friends who nursed their children into their toddler years. (Melinda Gates recently penned a thought-provoking piece on this topic.) I wanted to get to six months, and now I＊ve stretched past seven. We tried organic formula a few times to supplement. My kid didn＊t poop for a week. The pediatrician said that＊s common. Back to the boob. A few months ago, the power went out in our condo complex as we were about to head out of town for a long weekend. All I could think about was how devastated I＊d be if I lost my frozen supply of pumped milk, nicely lined out and labeled by date for use when I returned to work. I have been back since May, and we are down to a scant five 5-ounce bags left in our freezer. I just can＊t pump as much from the office as Maxwell drinks during the day when I＊m gone. I＊m not great at math, but I realize my son＊s days of breast milk bottles are numbered. I suppose my body will naturally change and my son will adjust to formula during the day. I haven＊t found the right book to help me with that transition, so I＊m pretty sure, like breast-feeding to begin with, our family will figure it out together.

"Dreaming of a state-run single-payer healthcare system? Want universal healthcare for all Americans? Supporter say Medicare for all is the answer. Dreaming of a state-run single-payer healthcare system? Want universal healthcare for all Americans? Supporter say Medicare for all is the answer. Dreaming of a state-run single-payer healthcare system? Wake up and enter the real world. Want universal healthcare for all Americans? Medicare for all is the solution. Not this year or next, but possibly in the future 〞 when Democrats recapture the presidency and Congress. That＊s the clear-eyed, pragmatic fight to engage in, and one advocated by U.S. Rep. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), a longtime healthcare warrior. ※Medicare is far, far more efficient than private insurance companies,§ he said. ※Using the tax system to collect money for healthcare delivery is extremely efficient. No profits. No commissions. No advertising.§ Garamendi, 72, earned his healthcare credentials decades ago. He has been fighting for universal coverage since Jerry Brown was governor the first time. The congressman, whose mostly rural district covers the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and spreads into eight counties, was first elected to the state Assembly in 1974. Later, he moved to the state Senate, where he headed the Health and Welfare Committee. Garamendi became California＊s first elected state insurance commissioner and won legislative passage of a bill to create a commission that would have devised a universal healthcare system. But Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed the measure. Garamendi＊s reform plan, however, became the model for President Clinton＊s ill-fated healthcare proposal in 1993. In 1994, Garamendi ran for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, advocating a top-to-bottom healthcare overhaul. He lost to then-state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, Jerry＊s sister. After a stint as Clinton＊s deputy Interior secretary, Garamendi again was elected insurance commissioner, later became lieutenant governor and left for Congress in 2009. So Garamendi has paid his healthcare and political dues. A dawn-to-midnight workaholic who grew up on a cattle ranch in the Sierra gold country, he has won and lost but always spoken his mind. And he believes California has virtually no chance of going it alone on a single-payer system with the state handling everyone＊s healthcare coverage. ※It would be very difficult, particularly given the present federal government,§ he told me. That＊s an understatement. It would require permission by the Republican-controlled Congress and President Trump for California to use federal Medicare and Medi-Cal money to finance its own healthcare system. That＊s not possible. Plus, let＊s face it, there are about 6 million California seniors on Medicare. They＊re frequent voters. Think they＊re going to trust Sacramento to take over their Medicare coverage? Think again. Dr. Steve Tarzynski, president of the California Physicians Alliance, agrees. ※The reality is that at the moment, a single-payer bill cannot pass§ the Legislature, he wrote in a recent Times opinion piece. ※Fighting for one in the immediate term is a waste of time.§ Maybe in the future, he continued. But for now ※millions of California voters with relatively good insurance coverage and those on Medicare are fearful of a radical change in their protections.§ The state Senate blindly passed an exorbitantly expensive 〞 $400 billion a year 〞 single-payer bill June 1. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) wisely quashed it, calling the measure ※woefully incomplete.§ Now bellicose single-payer bullies are threatening to recall him. Brown already had dismissed the measure. ※Where do you get the extra money?§ the governor asked. ※I don＊t even get it.§ Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who is running for governor, called the bill ※snake oil.§ Single-payer pushers in Sacramento 〞 the California Nurses Assn. 〞 tried to sell their skimpy proposal as Medicare for all. But in reality it was just the opposite. It would have wiped out Medicare in California, grabbed the federal money and forced seniors into the new state program. Updates from Sacramento ? Garamendi wrote an op-ed piece for the Sacramento Bee advocating an eventual Medicare-for-all program nationally. It would be ※by far the simplest solution§ to achieving universal coverage, he said. ※Medicare is one of our most trusted and popular government programs,§ he asserted. ※For more than 50 years, Americans have trusted Medicare to provide care to the elderly and disabled, funded by the payroll taxes of American workers＃. Medicare spending rises at a much slower rate than private insurance＃. It could be modified and expanded to cover more people＃. ※It is an idea whose time is coming.§ It＊s coming, but it＊s not here yet 〞 not with Trump and the GOP controlling Washington. Unlike single-payer, Medicare for all would allow beneficiaries to buy supplemental private insurance, as many seniors do now. Garamendi told me he wouldn＊t attempt to increase current benefits. Nor would he try to cover immigrants here illegally. Those would be poison pills politically. For people fearful of government-run healthcare 〞 the old ※socialized medicine§ bugaboo 〞 Garamendi notes that much of America already is covered by government insurance. There are more than 46 million seniors and 9 million disabled on Medicare. About 75 million are enrolled in Medicaid for the poor, called Medi-Cal in California. Roughly 22 million federal, state and local government employees benefit from government-funded healthcare. So do 1.3 million military personnel. That totals almost half the population. In California, the main focus should be on pressuring Congress to retain and patch up the Affordable Care Act, which has reduced the number of uninsured in this state from roughly 7 million to less than 3 million. The GOP＊s repeal threat has been beaten back, but it isn＊t dead. The governor and Legislature can keep making incremental healthcare improvements in California by continuing to restore Medi-Cal benefits that were severely cut during the recession. But forget about single-payer. Awaken from the midsummer night＊s dream, truly a nightmare.

"Perhaps the biggest takeaway from President Trump＊s unproven allegations about the security of elections is that he＊s managed to blur the difference between voting records and the act of voting. Or put another way, it＊s a distraction from resolving the challenges in keeping voter registration data accurate and up to date. Trump awkwardly waded into the topic last fall when he insisted millions of fraudulent votes had been cast in California and two other states. No evidence of widespread chicanery existed then, nor has any been brought forward since. At times, it seemed the president was wrongly conflating fraud with a 2012 nonpartisan study that warned of problems with some states＊ voter registration lists. Fast forward to last week, when a conservative legal organization insisted that 11 California counties have more registered voters than voting-age citizens. The group refused to share its methodology, and partly based its conclusions on the counties＊ lists of ※inactive§ voters 〞 people who haven＊t cast ballots in the past two statewide elections. Even the best registration list lives in a state of flux. Voters die. They enter prison on a felony conviction and forfeit their right to vote. They move and don＊t notify elections officials. ""Things change every day, and our voter file is constantly fluid,§ said Gail Pellerin, registrar of voters in Santa Cruz County. ※It's real people.§ Political Road Map: Here's why California counties can ignore a half-dozen election laws ? Keeping California＊s lists accurate became easier with the launch of a long-awaited statewide voter database last year. Now, changes are quickly seen in all 58 counties and data imported from state agencies 〞 including the DMV and prisons 〞 helps more easily flag problems. Some believe California might also rethink its refusal to join states sharing voter information through a nonprofit called the Election Registration Information Center. Created five years ago, it＊s helped 20 states and the District of Columbia catch more than 6.5 million voters who changed addresses, plus 194,000 voters who died. California opted not to join the center, citing questions about its privacy rules and the cost of paying membership dues. But the state＊s new database could make the multistate consortium a valuable tool. ※We＊re now in a much better place to entertain that,§ Secretary of State Alex Padilla said last week. Change might also be useful when it comes to paid voter registration drives. Tens of thousands of Californians are signed up by for-profit companies hired by political parties. Critics argue that the efforts often produce flawed or false registrations. After all, vendors get paid by the number of voter cards they turn in. Consistency is an issue, too, when it comes to purging names off voter registration lists. County registrars have wide discretion, and some worry about striking too many names and denying people a legal right to vote. But should there be a single, statewide standard for these lists of ※inactive§ voters? ※It might help take the guesswork out of it,§ said Kim Alexander, president of the nonpartisan California Voter Foundation. Of course, any new mandate would require the state to ※pony up and pay the money,§ she said 〞 something that＊s long been a problem with elections operations in California. In short, California＊s voter lists are undoubtedly better than they used to be. And that＊s good, because they＊re going to get tested in 2018. The state＊s new automated voter registration process begins at DMV offices in April, and could sizably boost voter rolls. Next year will see the first statewide use, too, of the law allowing voter registration on election day. And it＊s the first election in which some counties will opt to close polling places in favor of absentee ballots. Knowing who＊s eligible to vote is important. While many elections officials think Trump＊s unfounded fraud accusations will erode the public＊s faith in voting, the best antidote might be a fresh look at the lists of those signed up to cast ballots in the first place.

The Monmouth poll was slightly more favorable to Trump than most recent surveys. The poll found 49% of those surveyed disapproving of Trump's job performance and 41% approving. That was about the same as a Monmouth poll taken in July. On average, recent surveys have shown Trump's approval slipping during the last month. Averages of recent, nonpartisan public polls show about 57% of Americans disapproving of Trump's job performance and 38% approving. The most recent Gallup survey, one of the least favorable for Trump, had 61% disapproval and 34% approval.

"President Donald Trump says the groups protesting against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, were ""also very violent."" President Donald Trump says the groups protesting against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, were ""also very violent."" President Trump on Tuesday forcefully blamed counter-protesters as well as white supremacist groups for the weekend＊s deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., abandoning his scripted condemnation just a day earlier of the neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan and other racist groups widely seen as responsible. Trump reverted instead to his initial stance, which he articulated just after a woman died on Saturday when a car allegedly driven by a white supremacist sped through counter-protesters and pedestrians. In that first reaction, he faulted ※many sides§ for the violence 〞 igniting two days of bipartisan criticism that Trump sought to answer with Monday＊s unequivocal denunciation of white supremacists. On Tuesday, the president called his Saturday response ※a fine statement.§ In a combative and caustic exchange with reporters at Trump Tower, the president described what he saw televised from Charlottesville: ※You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. ※And nobody wants to say that,§ he continued, ※but I＊ll say it right now.§ Trump also expressed common cause with Confederate sympathizers and others working in a number of Southern communities to preserve monuments to Confederate heroes, as many locales act to take them down as a gesture of racial healing. It was a plan in Charlottesville to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that brought the white supremacists there from all over the nation for the rally on Saturday. The clashes that broke out over the weekend at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., have become a new touchstone in the nation＊s long-running debate over racism, free speech and violence. One woman was killed and many more injured when a car, allegedly driven by a rally participant,... The clashes that broke out over the weekend at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., have become a new touchstone in the nation＊s long-running debate over racism, free speech and violence. One woman was killed and many more injured when a car, allegedly driven by a rally participant,... ※This week it＊s Robert E. Lee. I noticed Stonewall Jackson is coming down,§ Trump said, alluding to another Confederate general. ※I wonder 〞 is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You really have to ask yourself, where does it stop?§ His statements brought a ※thank you§ from former Klan leader David Duke, but once again provoked widespread opposition, including among many Republicans who expressed anguish at Trump＊s rhetoric. The remarks amounted to another surreal moment in a presidency that has been full of them, in this case driving a new wedge into the nation＊s racial divide. Trump, standing in the gilded lobby of Trump Tower in New York for the first time since his inauguration, beside two Cabinet secretaries and two economic advisors there to discuss infrastructure, grew defensive and angry when reporters asked him repeatedly about his initial failure, for two days, to unequivocally condemn the white supremacists. He defended himself for the delay 〞 ※I didn＊t wait long; I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct§ 〞 yet he in effect disavowed the Monday statement denouncing the white supremacists in Charlottesville that he＊d made after presumably getting ※the facts,§ as he put it. Then he reached into his suit coat, brandished a copy of his prepared remarks from Saturday, and approvingly read the most pertinent line: ""We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence."" But Trump omitted the next phrase 〞 ""on many sides, on many sides"" 〞 that he had ad-libbed on Saturday, and which provoked the firestorm of criticism. The president then explicitly and aggressively made the case for why the anti-racism counter-protesters were as much as fault as the armed white militias 〞 a contention at odds with local police accounts. ※What about the alt-left that came charging at the 〞 as you say 〞 the alt-right?§ Trump challenged the reporters. ※Do they have any semblance of guilt? ※What about the fact they came charging 〞 that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do,§ he said of the counter-protesters. From there, the exchange became chaotic, as Trump sparred with reporters about the clash and the state of racial relations. He addressed reporters as ※fake news§ and repeatedly called them dishonest, in a performance that was at turns abrasive, defensive and cutting. Intermittently, he remembered what he had initially intended to talk about. ※How about a couple of infrastructure questions?§ Nearby, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, the retired general newly brought in to enforce discipline in the White House, clasped his hands and looked at the floor. Trump even suggested some added culpability on the side of the counter-protesters, noting that the white supremacists had permits to demonstrate. At one point the president echoed the sentiments of the white nationalists in his political coalition who often express fears of a lost heritage and traditions, as symbolized by moves against Confederate monuments.. ※Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington lose his status?§ he said. ※What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? Do you like him?§ he asked, adding, ※You＊re changing history. You＊re changing culture.§ Trump condemned the alleged white supremacist in Charlottesville who was charged with murder for driving into a crowd of counter-protesters on Saturday and killing a woman, Heather Heyer, and injuring others. But he declined to label it specifically as an act of terrorism. ※The driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and his country,§ Trump said. ※You can call it terrorism, you can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want.§ Duke, the former Imperial Wizard of the KKK, wrote on Twitter: ※Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists.§ Democrats and many Republicans renewed their criticisms. ""What he did today again goes back on what he said yesterday and that＊s unacceptable,§ tweeted Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado. ※The President was wrong to do that."" Other Republicans, including Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida and Dean Heller of Nevada, simply retweeted their weekend comments distancing themselves from Trump＊s equivocal Saturday statement. Sen. Christopher S. Murphy?, a Connecticut Democrat, may have had the most visceral reaction, tweeting that he read Trump's remarks after stopping on the side of the road. ""I nearly threw up,"" he wrote. ""An American President offering a defense of white supremacists. My god.§ Trump, asked about race relations during his presidency, said, ※I think they've gotten better or the same,§ adding, ※Look, they've been frayed for a long time. And you can ask President Obama about that, because he'd make speeches about it.§ Jobs will unite the country, he said, promising to bring more of them, ※great jobs, with good pay.§ Trump had seemed eager to move past the controversy over his leadership amid the violence, but even before Tuesday＊s diatribe, he could not let his grievances go. Up early as usual, the president retweeted a cartoon depicting a ※Trump train§ mowing down a CNN reporter, a particularly ill-timed gesture after the chilling images from the fatal car attack in Charlottesville. The posting was quickly deleted along with one other. A White House aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the retweets were ""inadvertently posted§ but did not say who removed them. The deletions were a rare move for a White House that is loath to admit error. At the same time, the since-deleted postings seemed part of a pattern in which Trump lately has said or done things to appeal to his most ardent supporters on the right, as if to signal solidarity with them especially after his Monday criticism of the white hate groups. Subsequently there were his tweets and remarks lambasting the media, and in particular CNN. He told Fox News that he was considering a pardon for Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona county sheriff and Trump campaign supporter who was recently convicted of defying a judge＊s order to stop racial profiling of Latinos when he was sheriff. Trump tweeted Fox＊s report, and that tweet remained on his feed. And Trump did not back down from his much-criticized attack a day earlier, on Twitter, against the African American chief executive of Merck & Co., Kenneth C. Frazier, who left the president＊s advisory council on manufacturing in protest of Trump＊s initial failure Saturday to specifically blame the hate groups for the violence in Charlottesville. On Tuesday, after two more corporate chief executives resigned from his council, the president lashed out at the group on Twitter for their ※grandstanding.§ But if Trump＊s tweet was meant to intimidate other would-be defectors, it seemed to backfire. After he sent it, another member of the council, Scott Paul, president of the trade group Alliance for American Manufacturing, withdrew. Wal-Mart＊s chief executive, Doug McMillon, did not resign his position on a different advisory panel, but said in a statement that Trump on Saturday had ※missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists.§ Javier Palomarez, president and chief executive of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, who serves on Trump＊s National Diversity Coalition, denounced the president＊s handling of the Charlottesville violence and called for the ouster of Stephen K. Bannon, the White House strategist who served as a conduit to white nationalists when he was head of Breitbart News. They're leaving out of embarrassment because they make their products outside [the United States], and I've been lecturing them,§ Trump said Tuesday. His remarks to reporters prompted a fifth defection from the manufacturing council, Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. ※President Trump＊s remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the KKK and neo-Nazis,§ the union said in a statement. ※We must resign on behalf of America＊s working people, who reject all notions of legitimacy of these bigoted groups.§ President Donald Trump says the groups protesting against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, were ""also very violent.""

"During the presidential campaign, about the only common ground between billionaire conservative Charles Koch and Republican nominee Donald Trump was a colorful disregard for each other. (Aug. 14, 2017)?(Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) During the presidential campaign, about the only common ground between billionaire conservative Charles Koch and Republican nominee Donald Trump was a colorful disregard for each other. (Aug. 14, 2017)?(Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) During the presidential campaign, about the only common ground between billionaire conservative Charles Koch and Republican nominee Donald Trump was a colorful disregard for each other. Koch complained the choice between Trump and Hillary Clinton was like opting for cancer or a heart attack. And Trump bashed big-money donors, deriding his Republican rivals as ※puppets§ who went knocking on Koch＊s door for backing. Not surprisingly, the Koch network largely sat out the 2016 presidential election and, Trump went on to win without them. Normally such a high-profile snub would carry a steep political price, shutting doors to the new administration. But in recent months, Koch＊s sprawling network of conservative advocacy groups has exerted surprising influence in the Trump administration, scoring some early accomplishments and pushing its priorities to the top of the White House agenda. It started with the quick rollback of a dozen Obama-era environmental and labor regulations 〞 a to-do list orchestrated by Koch-backed groups even before Trump was sworn into office. By spring, the Koch-backed Concerned Veterans for America was instrumental in passage of the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, a long-fought Koch effort to make it easier to fire employees at the beleaguered Veterans Affairs department, providing a blueprint for how to make an end-run around civil service protections that could be replicated across other federal departments. In July, the Kochs celebrated the official demise of the border-adjustment tax, a tax-reform proposal backed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan that was bitterly opposed by many business groups, including the brothers. GOP congressional leaders and the White House announced that idea would not be part of the upcoming tax-reform package. MORE COVERAGE OF CONGRESS ? The network＊s job has been made easier by the administration＊s hiring of Koch-affiliated alumni to key positions at the White House to help shape policy for a president who arrived without his own deeply staffed bench. ※The vacuum in Trump not having his own network is filled by people who＊ve been cultivated for years by the Koch network,§ said Richard L. Hasen, a professor at the UC Irvine law school and an expert in campaign finance. Also helpful is a Republican-led Congress made up of many lawmakers who depend on the network＊s backing for reelection, and fear being attacked if they stray from the libertarian, small-government orthodoxy. Even without being active in the presidential race, the network spent $750 million during the 2016 election cycle, including $250 million on campaign ads, voter engagement and other efforts to advocate for issues and shape public opinion. The early results show that Koch donors have remained a powerful force in politics despite not spending on Trump＊s presidential campaign. As the 81-year-old Koch welcomed hundreds of wealthy donors to the network＊s annual seminar in Colorado Springs, Colo., this summer, he marveled at how far the group has come in the decade-plus since its founding. ※When I look at where we are, at the size and effectiveness of this network, I＊m blown away,§ Koch said as guests and lawmakers mingled at the posh Broadmoor resort. ※We are more optimistic now about what we can accomplish than we＊ve ever been.§ To be sure, the failure of Congress to pass healthcare legislation stands as a glaring setback for the Koch network, which first made a splash on the national political stage during the 2009 fight to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. And many of their individual donors are so frustrated by the fumble after having spent millions to sweep Republicans to the House majority in 2010 and the Senate in 2014 that they are withholding campaign cash for the upcoming midterms until Republican lawmakers deliver. But 200 days into the new administration, Charles and his brother, David 〞 who are tied at No. 8 on the Forbes list of the world＊s wealthiest individuals 〞 appear as influential as ever. MORE COVERAGE OF POLITICS AND THE WHITE HOUSE ? On Saturday, the network will welcome Vice President Mike Pence, a longtime ally, to deliver the keynote address at its annual activist summit in Richmond, Va. Pence met privately with the Koch team at the Colorado event. Democrats have been furious, reviving the specter of what they call the ※Kochtopus,§ with its sprawling reach into almost every aspect of federal government policy and its secret donors whose millions of dollars keep lawmakers in line. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned congressional Republicans not to cater to wealthy donors＊ priorities during the upcoming tax debate this fall. ※Don＊t give breaks to the top 1% 〞 everyone knows they don＊t need it,§ Schumer railed on the Senate floor. ※Have the courage to break free from the Koch brothers and the special interests.§ Koch supporters relish such criticism. ※We enjoy getting attacked by the angry left,§ said Texas donor Doug Deason, who was among those attending the network＊s summer seminar. ※It means we＊re getting something accomplished.§ The coming battle over tax reform may prove the biggest test of the Kochs＊ influence, but their early defeat of the border-adjustment tax provided momentum. Trump spoke favorably of Ryan＊s idea at an annual GOP retreat in January, viewing it as an extension of his own campaign promise of slapping tariffs on overseas goods as a way to promote domestic production. But opponents argued it would increase prices for American consumers. Some Koch-owned companies in its conglomerate of oil, gas and other industries also would face higher taxes. The network started attacking the GOP plan, running ads against specific House Republicans and criticizing the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, who spearheaded Ryan＊s tax overhaul effort. After months of intense campaigning by the Koch network 〞 10,000 phone calls to lawmaker offices and $2 million spent on tax-reform ads and advocacy overall 〞 the proposal was shelved. Last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was featured at a Koch-backed event in Washington with Marc Short, the White House legislative director, about the administration＊s tax plan moving forward. Short is a former aide to Pence and one-time president of Freedom Partners, a Koch-aligned group. Through its vast array of think tanks, conservative groups and political operations, the network stitches together organizations around the Kochs＊ libertarian-leaning small-government pursuits, funded by donations from more than 700 members who pay $100,000 annual dues to attend the summits. As donors enjoyed drinks last June on a cool Colorado evening 〞 first-time givers were marked with a silver star on their name tags 〞 Koch brought his team to the stage to talk about their accomplishments. The group announced it intends to spend nearly $400 million for campaign ads and other efforts to advocate for issues and shape the public debate running up to the 2018 midterm election, an operation that at times can overshadow the work of the political parties. ※I think we＊re really going to start doing some good, where we see it every day now,§ Koch told those gathered under the evening sun.

"Here's our look at the Trump administration and the rest of Washington: After two days of bipartisan criticism for his failure to single out white supremacists, President Trump on Monday made his most explicit comments denouncing the hate groups responsible for ""this weekend's racist violence."" ""Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists,"" he said flatly, reading from a teleprompter. ""To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend＊s racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered,"" Trump added. First, however, he spoke glowingly about the economy. The hastily arranged statement, from the?Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, will be one of his most scrutinized. It came after two days of widespread denunciations?that Trump had failed to single out white supremacists for fueling the fatal weekend in Charlottesville, Va. Trump's initial comments instead faulted?""this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides."" Before the latest statement, Trump earlier Monday on Twitter criticized the African American chief executive of Merck, who resigned from a White House manufacturing council on Monday in protest of Trump's failure to explicitly condemn the racists in Charlottesville.																																																																																																																					"
"At least three people were killed and 35 injured after a violence-filled Saturday in Charlottesville, Va., where white nationalists had gathered for one of their largest rallies in at least a decade, only to see their event end in chaos and national controversy. Bloody street brawls broke out between dozens of anti-racism activists and far-right attendees, many of whom carried shields, weapons and Nazi and Confederate battle flags. One woman was killed when a driver plowed a sports car into a crowd of protesters; he was arrested and charged with murder and other crimes. Two troopers died when a Virginia State Police helicopter crashed near the city after monitoring the chaos. By the end of the day, top political officials around the nation, both Republicans and Democrats, were nearly unanimous in denouncing racism and the violence that stemmed from the rally, which was called off before it could even begin. But in a television statement that drew criticism from many of his fellow Republicans, as well as from Democrats, President Trump blamed the violence ※on many sides, on many sides.§ As he did repeatedly during his presidential campaign, Trump avoided direct criticism of the nation＊s burgeoning white nationalist movement, whose leaders have openly and repeatedly embraced Trump＊s presidency. His position drew widespread rebukes. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, one of Trump＊s rivals from last year＊s race, for example, said it would be ※very important§ for the country to hear Trump ※describe events in Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by white supremacists."" Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe was far blunter. ※I have a message to all the white supremacists and the Nazis who came into Charlottesville today,§ McAuliffe said in a Saturday evening news conference. ※Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth. Shame on you.§ McAuliffe added, ※You came here today to hurt people, and you did hurt people.§ Saturday＊s violence involved political forces that have been building on the left and the right for years, as anti-racism activists and white-power advocates have battled each other 〞 on the Internet and increasingly in the streets 〞 over the meaning of the nation＊s traumatic racial history and its course for the future. The original reason for Saturday＊s ※Unite the Right§ rally was a battle over Charlottesville＊s ordered removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. The statue is one of many Confederate symbols loathed by anti-racism advocates but embraced by many white Southerners, who see them as part of their heritage, as well as by white nationalists, who believe in a separate nation for white people. As the date drew nearer in recent weeks, the event became a kind of Woodstock for the far-right. White nationalists and neo-Nazis made plans to travel from around the nation to attend and see movement luminaries such as Richard Spencer, who were proud supporters of the president＊s candidacy in 2016 in large part due to his immigration agenda. The night before the main demonstration, scores of white nationalists drew condemnation as they marched through the empty University of Virginia campus bearing tiki torches and chanting, ※Blood and soil!§ 〞 an old Nazi slogan 〞 ※You will not replace us!§ and ※White lives matter!§ They outnumbered, surrounded and scuffled with a small group of anti-racist demonstrators who had come to protest them. Saturday was a different story. Before the ※Unite the Right§ rally could even begin, neo-Nazis, white nationalists and other far-right figures began brawling with large numbers of opposing protesters. White nationalists in helmets, who were holding plastic shields, and anti-racism protesters, carrying red banners, could be seen skirmishing with each other on a city street, with someone spraying what appeared to be a crowd-control substance at the counter-protesters. Virginia state police said pepper spray was being released by crowd members. The violence led officials to declare a state of emergency and shut down the event. Angered, far-right leaders fled the area. Some anti-racism activists burned Confederate flags that they captured from their adversaries. ※Up until now, I＊ve never had a feeling that my own government is cracking down on me,§ a shirtless and damp-looking Spencer said in a livestream video after he escaped the scene, saying that anti-racists had attacked him with pepper spray and that he was kicked by police officers holding shields. In a tweet to his allies, Spencer added: ※My recommendation: Disperse. Get out of Charlottesville city limits.§ Protesters were jubilant, waving flags calling for solidarity and chanting anti-racist slogans such as ※Black lives matter!§ One man dressed in a clown suit with rainbow-colored suspenders held aloft a poster that read, simply, ※SHAME.§ Soon after, the driver of a gray sports car with Ohio plates drove toward a crowd of protesters and then accelerated suddenly, plowing into at least a dozen people, sending bodies, shoes and personal belongings flying through the air. Victims cried out in pain while onlookers howled in shock and ran from the scene, yelling for medical help. ※Oh my God,§ someone screamed. ※He mowed down everybody.§ Within seconds, the sports car, its front bumper dragging on the ground, reversed course and sped backwards up the street, disappearing around a corner at the next block as a bystander yelled, ※Get off the street! Get off the street!§ At least one person was killed after a car sped into a crowd of people who were protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday. At least one person was killed after a car sped into a crowd of people who were protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday. A 32-year-old woman who was in the crosswalk was killed, police said. She has not been identified while officials work to notify her family. The Democratic Socialists of America said two of their members were among the wounded. When police showed up after several minutes, they were met with angry cries from some in the crowd who felt the response was too slow. ※Where were you?§ one of the protesters demanded. ※Where the [expletive] were you?§ The driver, identified by officials as James Alex Fields Jr., 20, was detained shortly after and charged Saturday night with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death. Officials have not given a motive or released a political affiliation, but on Saturday night announced that federal authorities had launched a civil rights investigation into the incident. Shortly after, two state troopers died when a State Police helicopter crashed in the woods outside Charlottesville. The wreckage was fully engulfed in flames, according to images from local media. The victims were identified as the pilot, Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Va.; and Berke M.M. Bates, 40, of Quinton, Va. Officials do not suspect foul play. ※Our state police and law enforcement family at-large are mourning this tragic outcome to an already challenging day,§ the State Police superintendent, Col. W. Steven Flaherty, said in a statement. In televised remarks, Trump remarked on the ※terrible events§ and condemned ※in the strongest possible terms, this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides, on many sides.§ He added: ※No matter our color, creed, religion or political party, we are all Americans first. We love our country, we love our God, we love our flag, we＊re proud of our country, we＊re proud of who we are, so we＊re going to get this situation straightened out in Charlottesville, and we want to study it, and we want to see what we＊re doing wrong as a country.§ As more reports about the day＊s casualties came in, Trump tweeted: ※Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!§ Leaders from all over the country chimed in with denunciations. §Our hearts are with today＊s victims,§ House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a tweet. ※White supremacy is a scourge. This hate and its terrorism must be confronted and defeated.§ §White supremacists aren＊t patriots, they＊re traitors,§ tweeted U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) ※Americans must unite against hatred & bigotry.§ ※The white nationalist demonstration in #Charlottesville is a reprehensible display of racism and hatred that has no place in our society,§ tweeted Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But Trump＊s remarks 〞 especially his blame for the violence on ※many sides§ 〞 drew particular criticism. ※The violence, chaos, and apparent loss of life in Charlottesville is not the fault of ＆many sides,＊§ tweeted Virginia Atty. Gen. Mark Herring, a Democrat. ※It is racists and white supremacists.§ ※Mr. President 〞 we must call evil by its name,§ tweeted Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). ※These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.§ As events unfolded in the morning, rally organizer Jason Kessler blamed the chaos on the city＊s recent attempts to restrict the rally＊s location, disrupting organizers＊ plans. ※There are so many people that have come in, that have been Maced in the eyes, like half of our speakers have been Maced,§ Kessler said in a livestream video. ※There＊s not a ＃ single Charlottesville police officer out there protecting our guys.§ Later in the evening, Kessler disavowed the driver who ran over protesters but laid the responsibility for harm on the city. ※Charlottesville has blood on its hands, OK?§ Kessler said. ※We have been organizing this event for two months and we had a security plan in place to protect people.＃ The police stood down and refused to separate the counter-demonstrators, and now people are dead.§ The event also had drawn a range of counter-protesters, including anti-fascists and interfaith clergy. Many protesters drove in from other towns in Virginia and from other states to join the counter-protest, including Mark Tinkleman, who came from Philadelphia with 10 other members of the protest group Refuse Fascism. ※We tried to march to make it clear that we＊re not going to be intimidated,§ Tinkleman said. ※This is what Trump is doing to the country 〞 all these fascists coming together, white supremacists, the Klan, neo-Nazis. We can＊t ignore that.§ Not all of the encounters between the far-right and the anti-racism protesters were violent, said Jen Siomacco, a 31-year-old Charlottesville resident who came out to protest the white nationalists. Personally, she didn＊t see ※a whole lot of confrontation and aggressive violence,§ though there were a ※good number of small scuffles§ where some punches were thrown. ※But they were broken up by police,§ she said. Many residents stayed home instead of going out, and area businesses, disturbed by the rally plans, shut down for the day. Some reportedly put a sign on their windows: ※If equality & diversity aren＊t for you, then neither are we.§ By 6:30 p.m., the streets where the clashes had occurred were largely deserted, except for large numbers of police and a few residents from houses nearby, who emerged to survey the scene and walk their dogs. Fearing more violence, the City Council issued an emergency ordinance to give the police chief power to issue a curfew or restrict people＊s ability to gather or drive outside. At the First United Methodist Church, a few blocks from where the car crashed into protesters, volunteers had opened the church to those seeking shelter, including witnesses to the attack who were still shaken. ※It was the most brutal scene I＊ve ever seen,§ said Izaac Rodriguez, 22, whose friend, Justice, was struck in the leg by the car. Jennifer Rolf-Maloney, 24, of Virginia Beach, decided to make the two-hour drive to join the counter-protest. She was inspired by history. ※Back in World War II, the Nazis came to power because people turned a blind eye,§ she said. ※This is home-grown terrorism.§ Corporate America?has had enough of President Trump's response to Charlottesville.

Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez said Thursday she will seek?to replace Chad Mayes?as Assembly Republican leader when the Legislature returns from summer recess Monday. Melendez said Mayes' vote for extending the state's cap-and-trade program, which requires companies to buy permits to pollute, allowed the Democrats?to win approval of a bad program that will lead to higher fuel and energy prices for Californians. ""I am ready and willing to be the type of leader you have been asking for, one?who has principles,"" Melendez said to applause at a meeting of the Riverside County Republican Party. ""When the Assembly returns Monday, I will be throwing my name in the hat to run for Republican leader."" Mayes, who is from?Yucca Valley, has said his vote showed bipartisan cooperation to solve a problem.? Melendez, a resident of Lake Elsinore, said Republicans hurt their party in joining Democrats to vote for measures that raise costs for business and consumers. ""Republicans do not have to vote like Democrats to save the Republican Party,"" Melendez said. Assemblyman Jay Obernolte?(R-Big Bear Lake) has also expressed interest in replacing Mayes should he decide to step down. Rep. Darrell Issa?(R-Vista) called Thursday for a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the impact of white supremacist groups on civil rights. The move comes as party leaders are fretting over the political fallout from President Trump＊s response to the violence spawned by white supremacists and neo-Nazis last weekend in Charlottesville, Va. ※As the nation grieves and heals from the scenes of this past weekend, we have a duty to more fully understand what led to these terrible events and the persistence of these hateful, extremist ideologies,§ Issa said in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). Trump condemned the neo-Nazis and white supremacists whose protests against Charlottesville＊s removal of a Confederate monument turned violent. But earlier this week the president reversed course in his remarks on the violence, saying some ※very fine people§ marched alongside the extremists, and casting some blame on counter-protesters. On Thursday, Trump lamented the growing calls to take down Confederate monuments. Issa, who narrowly won reelection last year, is one of California＊s most vulnerable Republican incumbents in next year＊s House elections. He has been trying to broaden his appeal among moderates in his coastal district, which straddles northern San Diego and southern Orange counties. On Thursday, he bemoaned the ※despicable display of bigotry and evil§ by a ※repulsive hate group,§ saying a hearing should be held next month. ※While Congress cannot legislate respect, decency, or acceptance of others,§ he said, ※we have an obligation to use our platform to lead our country forward on these matters.§ It's not easy to get an auditorium full of hundreds of teenagers screaming with excitement on their first week back to school. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning creator of ""Hamilton"" did just that Thursday, as he spoke to nearly 1,000 students in Rep. Tony Cardenas' San Fernando Valley district. In a roughly 30-minute question-and-answer session at Panorama High School, Miranda flowed seamlessly between English and Spanish, speaking about his earliest memories with his abuelita and telling the young crowd, ""Mi tiempo es tuya"" -- ""My time is yours.""? He also described history as ""a canvas."" ""It's for you to tell the stories we haven't heard yet. And to lift those voices, those often marginalized voices, up, and I can't wait to see what you create,"" Miranda told the crowd of mostly high schoolers, many of them Latino. He took turns answering lighthearted questions about his first job (working for $4.25 an hour at a Manhattan McDonald's) and the one food he'd choose to eat for the rest of his life (a type of Puerto Rican lasagna). But he also offered some tidbits of advice for the youngsters, telling them to ""surround yourself and fill yourself up with the thing you're chasing.""? Responding to a question about being successful as a Latino, Miranda said,?""You'll face struggle. You will face people telling you you've got to look a certain way, you will face people telling you that you have to tell a specific story."" He added, ""You could write a bad version of someone else's story but only you can tell your story."" Cardenas set up the event, billed as a ""town hall"" focused on civic engagement, after meeting Miranda's father, political consultant Luis Miranda, and chatting with him over coffee about the need to expose Latino youth to role models who?look like them. The elder Miranda brought his son onboard and was in the audience, along with Miranda's mother, Dr. Luz Towns-Miranda, at the event on Thursday.? Cardenas' 29th Congressional District is nearly 70% Latino and almost 45% of residents were born outside the United States. ""It's about talking to 1,000 children, who many of them are scared,"" Cardenas told reporters afterward. ""It's important for us to understand that examples like Lin-Manuel Miranda ... we don't have to be angry voices."" Miranda also addressed questions about the current political climate and the recent violence?in Charlottesville, Va. ""As scary and tragic as the events of last week were, the outpouring of pushback has been heartening,"" Miranda said. ""If you're a kid and you're scared in this country, there's a lot of adults who are working really hard and have your back."" In a three-minute video released on ATTN's Facebook page, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger criticizes President Trump's response to the recent violence in Charlottesville, Va. ""The only way to beat the loud,?angry voices of hate is to meet them with louder, more reasonable voices. That includes you President Trump,""?he said. ""You have a moral responsibility to send an unequivocal message that you won't stand for hate and racism.§ Schwarzenegger, who has had a longstanding feud with Trump, advises the president in his video?that he should outright ""reject the support of white supremacists"" before turning his?attention to neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and?neo-Confederates. ""Your heroes are losers. You are supporting a lost cause,"" he said. ""Let's terminate hate."" In the aftermath of the Charlottesville violence, Schwarzenegger donated $100,000 to a?Los Angeles-based anti-hate group, and encouraged others to act in similar charitable ways.? Retired Army Sgt.?Daniel Casara, who initially stepped up to challenge embattled Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine), on Thursday joined other Republicans seeking to oust Democratic Rep. Scott Peters from his?52nd?Congressional District seat. ""Washington needs more patriots and less politicians,"" Casara?said in a statement. ""Voters demand a representative who understand the needs of a strong national defense and will support the men and women who provide it."" The Purple Heart medal recipient and 43-year-old motivational speaker originally launched a bid?against Hunter, a six-term Republican under investigation by the FBI over alleged misuse of campaign funds.?Hunter has at least one other Republican challenger. Peters is one of the?California Democrats that Republicans hope?to defeat?in 2018.?Casara joins Republican candidates Omar Qudrat, an attorney;?and?James Veltmeyer, a physician, in the race for the seat. Marc Troast, Casara's campaign manager, said Casara respects Hunter, a fellow military serviceman.? ""But there are some issues in his home district [Casara] wants to help solve,§ Troast said.?That?was the main reason for the switch, he said. A new ballot initiative was submitted to state officials Thursday advocating for a federal constitutional convention that could lead to California's independence. The measure, similar to one already in circulation that is pushing for California's secession?from the union, would?require the state Legislature to ask Congress to establish a new constitutional convention. ""We believe that justice for all requires constant vigilance and a thorough examination of laws and governmental actions that disproportionately impact diverse segments of society,"" the initiative states.?""These beliefs depend on resolutely defending these Californian values, which support every individual's hopes and dreams for the future."" The initiative has been submitted to Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra for an official title and summary, a necessary step before supporters can collect signatures to put the measure on the 2018 ballot. Once that happens, backers would have to gather nearly 600,000 signatures in 180 days.? This is the third official effort this year to try to make California an independent state, a push?known informally as ""Calexit.""?Supporters of another measure, which?would direct California's governor to negotiate more autonomy from the federal government, already have?been cleared to collect?signatures. A more aggressive measure to ask for independence immediately has been abandoned.? The group behind this most recent measure?calls itself?California Constitutional Convention Initiative Team. One of its backers is Marcus Ruiz Evans, who has been involved in California secessionist causes since 2012 and calls himself the founder of the Calexit movement. The state campaign watchdog agency voted Thursday to lift limits on contributions from elected officials to candidates facing recalls, boosting Sen. Josh Newman＊s effort to fend off a campaign to remove him from office for voting for a gas-tax increase. The 3-1 vote by the state Fair Political Practices Commission rejects an initial opinion by its attorneys that supported past advice letters declaring that legislators can give no more than $4,400 to colleagues fighting recalls. The Democratic Senate Caucus, of which Newman, a Fullerton lawmaker, is a member,?requested the change. Approved after tense exchanges between commissioners, the new opinion?takes effect immediately, and some predict a flood of new contributions to Newman from other legislators, even though elections officials are still counting signatures to see if a recall qualifies for the ballot. Commissioner Allison Hayward said the limit on the contributions is not supported by regulations?and is unfair because there is no limit on contributions to campaigns to recall officials. ※What we＊ve got right now is a situation where there is a restriction on one side of an essentially bilateral battle ... that doesn＊t apply to the other side,§ Hayward said. ※It＊s pretty clear to me that, at least at the U.S. Supreme Court, such imbalances just can＊t be tolerated.§ Chairwoman Jodi Remke cast the only vote against the change, noting the position that the contributions should be limited?has been held by the panel since 2002 based on staff interpretations of the law. She said she was?concerned about the timing as?the Democratic senator faces a recall. ※I will be issuing a dissenting opinion,§ Remke told the panel. ※I believe this is the wrong time and wrong venue for us to reverse a longstanding commission interpretation of a statute.§ Remke disputed that the rule creates unfairness in the election, noting elected officials can already contribute unlimited amounts to fight a recall, as long as it does not go to a committee controlled by the candidate under threat. The quick action on the Democrats' request has drawn criticism from the California Republican Party, which has also complained that Commissioner Brian Hatch did not publicly disclose a meeting and text message exchange he had with Richard Rios, an attorney for the Democrats. Commissioner Maria Audero disputed that the change was mishandled, or that it should be delayed because there is a pending recall. ※We answer to the people who come before us and ask us to do something. We don＊t control when they come before us,§ Audero said. ※Our duty is to respond.?Our duty is not to fabricate some nefarious intent to a reason why something is before us.§ Audero said the criticism that the decision is political because the supporters were all appointed by Democrats is ※comical§ because Audero and Hayward are Republicans. Far-right blogger and provocateur Chuck C. Johnson said?on Thursday that he helped arrange a highly unusual meeting between Orange County GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher and?WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange this week. Rohrabacher?said in a statement that?he plans to bring information to President Trump from the three-hour meeting, which took place Wednesday?in London at the Ecuadorian Embassy, where Assange?has been living in asylum since 2012. He would not detail that information to The Times, but in an interview Thursday morning with the Daily Caller, Rohrabacher was more explicit, saying he and Assange talked about ※what might be necessary to get him out§?and suggested they discussed a?presidential pardon in exchange for?information on the theft of emails?from the Democratic National Committee, which were published by WikiLeaks before the 2016 presidential election. ※He has information that will be of dramatic importance to the United States and the people of our country as well as to our government,§ Rohrabacher told the Daily Caller. ※Thus if he comes up with that, you know he＊s going to expect something in return. He can＊t even leave the embassy to get out to Washington to talk to anybody if he doesn＊t have a pardon.§ Johnson, who is known for being?banned from Twitter?after he asked users for help ※taking out§?a civil rights activist,?said that he and Assange attorney Jennifer Robinson also?were in the meeting. Johnson wrote in an email to The Times?that the meeting was the result of a ※desire?for ongoing communications§?from both Rohrabacher and Assange.?Rohrabacher spokesman Ken Grubbs said the congressman alerted the White House about his planned trip to visit Assange. The White House has not confirmed whether it was aware of the meeting ahead of time. Rohrabacher＊s?office said that during the meeting, Assange?repeated his claims that the Russian government was not involved in the theft of Democratic?emails. The release of the emails put Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on the defensive and are among the incidents that led to investigations by the Justice Department and multiple House and Senate committees into potential ties between President Trump＊s campaign and election meddling. Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies think Russia was involved in the theft of the emails. In a statement, DNC spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said, ※We＊ll take the word of the U.S. intelligence community over Julian Assange and Putin＊s favorite Congressman.§?? Assange, who has been criticized by many U.S. officials for WikiLeaks＊?alleged?ties to Russia, remains in asylum at least in part because British authorities have threatened?him with arrest for jumping bail after Sweden made sexual assault allegations against him. Those allegations since have been dropped, but?Assange, who is Australian,?also could face?legal problems in the U.S. The?Washington Post reported in April?that federal prosecutors were weighing whether to bring charges against members of WikiLeaks, in part over information leaked by Chelsea Manning, the U.S. soldier convicted of handing over diplomatic cables to the organization. Rohrabacher, who has?long been criticized for his fondness for?Russia, believes he is the only congressman who has?visited Assange. Shortly after the trip was revealed, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called for Rohrabacher to step down from his post on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he chairs a subcommittee on Eurasian affairs. Grubbs called the Democratic committee＊s call ※absurdly but predictably partisan.§? Grubbs also said Rohrabacher?paid for the trip to London 〞?which he took?while?many of his House colleagues are working and holding town hall meetings in their districts 〞?with personal funds. With Gov. Jerry Brown and lawmakers debating billions in new spending for a variety of projects?on the 2018 ballot, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) said low-income housing will be the highest priority. Brown is supporting bonds on the 2018 ballot that would finance new homes for low-income residents and those that would improve water and parks infrastructure. But the dollar amounts for each measure haven't been settled.? ""We＊re going to negotiate for as high as we possibly can on housing,"" Rendon?said Thursday in a conference call with the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board.?""We think it＊s a more critical need."" The housing proposal now pending in the Legislature calls for a $3-billion bond, but State Treasurer John Chiang joined Rendon?on the conference call to argue for one as high as $9 billion. While a larger bond would lead to the construction of more homes, the state would still?fall far short of the new home building needed?to combat its housing affordability crisis. Last month, Brown, Rendon and Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le車n agreed to a housing bond and other legislation designed to ease housing problems.?Rendon sounded less confident about the passage of another part of the housing package: a proposal to charge $75 on mortgage refinances and other real estate transactions. The fee would raise about $250 million a year and go toward building low-income housing. That legislation, Senate Bill 2 by Sen. Toni Atkins (D-San Diego),?requires two-thirds supermajority?votes?in both houses of the Legislature. Both moderate and liberal Democrats in the Assembly have raised red flags about increasing?fees on homeowners. Rendon?said it was difficult to predict how the vote would pan out. ""A two-thirds?vote is obviously always a very big lift,"" he said.?""In general, the members know that housing is a basic human need."" Following a flood of reports by?female entrepreneurs?detailing lewd remarks and unwanted sexual advances by male investors, a California lawmaker wants state law to explicitly prohibit such harassment.? State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) announced Thursday she was introducing a measure to amend California's Unruh Civil Right Act to expressly forbid sexual harassment between investors and entrepreneurs.? Jackson said she believes such behavior already is barred under existing law under a blanket prohibition in the Unruh Act, which outlaws discrimination based on sex, gender, ethnicity and other categories.?But, she noted, the act also specifically names certain business relationships as being protected from such harassment.?By naming the relationship between investors and start-up founders, she hopes that will provide additional clarity for women who have been harassed. ""Because there hasn't been that clarity, I think women have been reluctant to step forward,"" Jackson said in a call with reporters. ""By including this specifically, it reaffirms and will hopefully provide the kind of incentive for women who have been victimized by this behavior to step forward?because?it will be specifically identified?in the law."" The proposal was prompted by a spate of reports from female tech entrepreneurs, who went public with stories of being asked on dates and experiencing?unwanted physical contact when dealing with male venture capitalists, whose investments are crucial to getting fledgling start-ups off the ground. ""Their stories have peeled back a shroud of?secrecy and exposed behaviors that are simply not acceptable in any industry,"" Jackson said. The disclosures have prompted a round of self-reflection in the tech industry, with some venture capitalists issuing public mea culpas, and others promising a crackdown on predatory behavior. Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, said Silicon Valley ""understands it has to change,"" but self-policing measures such as decency pledges ""really won't cut it."" ""The women that we talk to are tired of being treated by venture capitalists?as sexual opportunities instead of investment opportunities,"" Farrell said. Jackson plans to insert her measure into an existing bill, SB 224, in a process known as a ""gut-and-amend."" But with the Legislature slated to end its work for the year in less than a month, she said her bill will not be taken up until next January, when the new legislative year begins.  California corrections officials have failed to ensure prison staff?members properly evaluate, treat?and monitor inmates at risk of taking their own lives, according to a scathing state audit released Thursday. The California State Auditor?report, requested by a joint legislative audit committee,?found state prisons?failed to follow their own suicide prevention and response policies, while?their average suicide rate was?substantially higher than the average of U.S. state prisons 〞 22?per 100,000?inmates versus 15.66 per 100,000 inmates. The state auditor's office reviewed 40?files on prisoners who committed or attempted suicide at four state prisons. Thirty-six inmates required suicide-risk evaluations, but mental health staff?failed to complete at least one?required risk evaluation for 10?prisoners?and completed inadequate risk evaluations?for 26?others. Prison staff members were said to have left some sections of these evaluations blank. They often didn't appropriately justify determinations of suicide risk, or failed to develop adequate plans for treatment, the report said. Court-appointed mental health experts had alerted corrections officials to the problems?for the past several years, it?found. Out of 25 inmates requiring treatment plans,?prison staff members did not develop adequate approaches to care?for 23 and failed to create any plans for?two, the audit found. Staff at all four prisons insufficiently monitored?inmates at risk of suicide, failing to check in on them at the required 15-minute?intervals, auditors found. The rates of women who have committed suicide in California state prisons soared, according to the report. From?2014 through?2016, women comprised about 4%?of the?total inmate population but?accounted for roughly 11% of its inmate suicides. Almost all occurred at the California Institute for Women in San Bernardino. Although drug involvement and domestic violence were among?factors that could have contributed to the higher rate of female inmate suicides, state auditors said, state prisons had not made sure staff were trained on suicide prevention and?response. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provides mental healthcare to roughly 123,000 men and 5,800 women incarcerated at its facilities.? State auditors recommended that the state Legislature require corrections officials to properly train staff and continue to develop their?oversight processes, including audits of prisons＊ risk evaluations and treatment?plans. The department should be required to report its progress each year, the report said. Corrections officials said no suicides had been reported at the California Institute for Women this year, where new programs to help suicide prevention offer brief, discreet counseling services. In a statement, state corrections?secretary Scott Kernan said the department ""has made a great deal of progress implementing policies, training, and support for suicide prevention practices statewide, and acknowledges there is further progress to make.""  When lawmakers return next week from their summer recess, one of the big items on their to-do list is approving billions in new spending to put on the 2018 ballot. Gov. Jerry Brown and top legislative leaders have agreed to support bonds to finance the construction of new homes for low-income residents and improvements to water and parks infrastructure. But exactly how much money and what projects would receive the funding remain undecided and subject to furious debate over the next month.? Read more The newest Democrat to announce a challenge against Republican incumbent Jeff Denham?of Turlock is also one of the youngest congressional candidates in the state. Mateo Morelos Bedolla, 24, of Tracy?isn't even old enough?to be in Congress. If he manages to pull ahead in the crowded June primary in his long-shot bid to unseat the four-term congressman., he'll?meet the constitutionally required age of 25 before the November 2018 general?election. ""I feel that I'm uniquely qualified based on the work that I've done,"" said Bedolla, who left his job as a congressional aide for Rep. Jerry McNerney (D-Stockton) earlier this year. Prior to working for McNerney, Bedolla?said he worked in construction to help put himself through college.? In a statement announcing his run, Bedolla said he supports a Medicare-for-all model for healthcare and ""debt-free education,"" but said in an interview that he doesn't want to be labeled a ""Berniecrat,"" a name used by some candidates who support an agenda promoted by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders,?the former Democratic presidential candidate. ""I'm trying to address basic issues that would apply to everybody,"" said Bedolla, who said?he voted for Sanders in last year's presidential primary. Bedolla?formed a campaign committee in May and reported raising $114 in the second quarter of 2017. He joins at least seven other candidates who are hoping to unseat Denham. ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda will be talking with high school students in the San Fernando?Valley Thursday, a day after the hit Broadway musical opened at Hollywood's Pantages Theatre. The appearance?alongside Rep. Tony C芍rdenas (D-Los Angeles) is being billed as a ""town hall"" on civic engagement and Miranda is expected to take questions from the students. About 1,000 high schoolers from across C芍rdenas' 29th Congressional District have been invited to participate, according to the congressman's spokeswoman. His staff has asked The Times not to?disclose the exact location of the event until shortly before it begins due to concerns that hundreds of screaming fans might descend on the school. So why, exactly, did Miranda decide to visit C芍rdenas' district? Cardenas' spokeswoman said the congressman met up with Miranda's father, Luis Miranda, a political consultant, after months of hearing from mutual friends that they should meet. They talked over coffee about the need to promote and empower Latino youth to engage them in the political process. ""From the congressman's perspective, so many young Latinos just don't have faith in themselves and the confidence to get involved, so it was something that they're both very passionate about,"" said spokeswoman?Francesca Amodeo. Cardenas then floated an idea to the senior Miranda:?Students in his heavily Latino district don't often get to meet Latino ""superstars"" in person, and a visit from the ""Hamilton"" star would be inspiring. Lin-Manuel Miranda was immediately interested and found a time to make it work while he was in California for the musical's opening, Amodeo said. The ""Hamilton"" creator has been making a series of appearances as the musical makes its debut in L.A.?〞?he?gave a mini-concert on the sidewalk outside the Pantages on Wednesday. Today's event is expected to begin around 1 p.m.?Follow me on Twitter for the latest. Orange County GOP Rep.?Dana Rohrabacher confirmed that he met Wednesday?with WikiLeaks?founder Julian Assange, who is still living in asylum at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London.? In a statement, Rohrabacher's?office said the?Australian fugitive ""emphatically stated that the Russians were not involved"" in the theft of?Democratic National Committee emails during the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails, which were published by WikiLeaks, put?Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on the defensive. The conversation between Rohrabacher and Assange, which was first reported by the Daily Caller,?""ranged over many topics,"" according to the?statement. The statement didn't reveal much more, but said ""the congressman plans to divulge more of what he found directly to President Trump."" Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies have agreed Russia was involved in the theft of Democratic Party emails and tried to influence the 2016 election to benefit Trump. The Justice Department, along with multiple?House and Senate committees, are investigating potential ties between Trump's campaign and election meddling. Rohrabacher, who has long been criticized for his fondness for?Russia, believes he is the only congressman who has?visited Assange. Rohrabacher's name has repeatedly come up in discussions of the investigation into Russian interference. His spokesman did not respond to requests for additional comment, including questions about how the trip was funded and whether the White House was aware of the trip.? Assange has been hiding out in the Ecuadorean Embassy since 2012 to avoid sexual assault allegations against him in Sweden. That investigation was?dropped?this year, but British authorities have said he could still be arrested for jumping bail if he leaves the embassy. In April, CIA Director Mike Pompeo?dismissed Assange as a ""narcissist"" and called WikiLeaks a ""non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia."" House Speaker Paul Ryan has criticized Assange as a ""sycophant for Russia."" Trump himself has expressed an affinity for Assange in the past, tweeting praise for the fugitive. The Washington Post reported in April that federal prosecutors were weighing whether to bring charges against members of WikiLeaks, in part over information leaked by Chelsea Manning, the U.S. soldier convicted of handing over diplomatic cables to the organization. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is demanding that Rohrabacher?resign from his seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""Democrats and Republicans alike agree that Julian Assange is a threat to America's national security and has aligned with the Kremlin to undermine our elections,"" said DCCC spokesman Drew Godinich, who called Rohrabacher's?behavior ""completely shocking."" Rohrabacher is one of the top Republican incumbents?California Democrats are hoping to topple in 2018. He has already attracted nine challengers, most of them Democrats, including real estate broker Harley Rouda, who released a campaign ad criticizing the 15-term Republican for his repeated defense of Russia. Rohrabacher, who once worked for the Orange County Register,?told The Hill?that he also planned to convey a request from Assange to Trump?for a WikiLeaks?seat inside the White House press room. ※Julian passionately argued the case that WikiLeaks was vital to informing the public about controversial though necessary issues,"" he told The Hill. ""As a former newsman myself, I can't see a reason why they shouldn't be granted news status for official press conferences."" Hoping up to conjure up the same momentum that led to a 1986 tax overhaul under President Reagan, Republican leaders on the House Ways and Means Committee traveled to the Reagan Ranch on Wednesday to pitch an?equally ambitious tax plan. They were thousands of miles from Washington, but the congressmen couldn't?avoid commenting on President Trump's remarks about the deadly violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend. They were peppered with questions from reporters about the incident, and asked if they remained confident in the Republican president. One congressman said Trump's latest controversy was distracting for the Republican agenda, including tax reform. But House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas said he believes the tax overhaul will stay on track, despite the distractions in the White House. The 1986 legislation was a bipartisan effort hammered out by Reagan and a Senate controlled by Republicans and a House controlled by the Democrats. After Reagan took office in 1981, he won a 25% cut in personal income taxes and big tax breaks for businesses. The cuts were a catalyst for the tax reform package that passed five years later. The proposals outlined Wednesday, however, are purely a Republican effort, with negotiations between Trump and GOP leaders in the House and Senate.? Brady promised to invite Democrats to the table, saying they have lots of good ideas?and have just as much interest in creating jobs and keeping U.S. companies from moving overseas. But there is little evidence of bipartisan cooperation?on the tax plan thus far in Washington. ※Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, if you＊re serious "

"bout delivering to pro-growth tax reform to the American people this year	 we＊re serious about working with you	§ Brady said. Brady was joined by three other GOP committee members at Reagan＊s rustic former home	 known as Rancho del Cielo and the Western White House	 nestled in the Santa Ynez Mountains just north of Santa Barbara. Their speeches	 delivered not far from the stone front porch the former president built himself	 were thin on specifics and thick?with praise about Reagan＊s years as America＊s 40th president. The staging of the news conference was planned to mimic the scene when Reagan signed legislation enacting the tax cuts in 1981	 which he did at a table in front of the ranch home. The congressmen on Wednesday stood behind a replica of the table used by Reagan	 complete with a stack of papers resembling a tax bill piled on top.? ※The Reagan reforms were all about the American people	 about workers and middle-class families and Main Street businesses. It was focused on fairness. Closing special interest loopholes	§ Brady said. ※I think President Reagan would be pretty disappointed with the tax code we have today. Fairness has been replaced with favoritism for Washington special interests.§ Brady indicated that the tax overhaul	 which has yet to materialize in an actual bill	 would ※continue to reward homeownership	§ a?possible indication that some form of the mortgage tax deduction would remain in place. He also said there is support to reduce?taxes even if it means a short-term increase in the national deficit	 as long as the cuts stoke the U.S. economy and job creation. Brady condemned those behind the deadly mayhem in Charlottesville last weekend	 but did not address Trump＊s comments suggesting an equivalence between those protesting the white supremacists and the white supremacists?responsible for the violence. He said he doubts that this and other?controversies?surrounding the Trump administration will derail efforts to pass the tax overhaul this year. But Ways and Means Committee member Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) was more pointed in his words about?the president. He said that it＊s crucial for Trump to lead the effort?to overhaul the tax system	 and that it and other policy work in Washington is endangered by his actions. ※It＊s horrific to put those protesting hate and those promoting hate on the same level	§ Curbelo said. ※Yes	 it＊s an unneeded distraction＃. I hope he＊ll stop. I＊m not counting on it.§ Ross Johnson	 a former Republican legislative leader from Orange County who later served as chairman of the state ethics panel	 died Wednesday in Sacramento after a fight with cancer. He was 77. California Republican Party Chairman Jim Brulte said Johnson was a ※principled conservative and a man of great integrity	§ who also served as one of Brulte＊s mentors when he was elected to the Assembly. ※While Ross had the courage of his convictions	 he was always willing to listen to opposing points of view	§ Brulte said in a statement. ※He never took political disagreements personally; and was admired	 respected	 and loved by his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Our prayers are with his wife Diane and his children as they grieve their loss.§ Johnson represented Orange County in the California Legislature for 26 years	 first in the state Assembly from 1978 to 1995 and then in the state Senate from 1995 to 2004	 while living in Irvine. He was the first person to serve as a party leader in both the California Senate and Assembly	 and authored legislation to improve campaign finance limits and disclosure. A member of the State Bar of California	 he also authored a ballot measure in 1988 that put new limits on campaign contributions. Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called Johnson ※a great advocate of political reform in California politics§ when he appointed him in 2007 to be?chairman of the state Fair Political Practices Commission	 which oversees ethics and campaign finance laws. Johnson oversaw the adoption of policies to make political finances?more transparent before he resigned in 2010 for health reasons. He?said at the time that he saw his job as ※working to help ensure fair elections.§ Susie Swatt	 a former legislative aide to Johnson	 said he was ※extremely principled	§ and worked hard to improve his district	 with accomplishments including the creation of the Chino Hills State Park. Johnson	 who moved to Sacramento after leaving office	 is survived by his wife	 Diane	 daughters Susan and Molly	 and seven grandchildren. On Wednesday morning	 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) had hoped to focus on Los Angeles County's transportation needs as it prepares for the 2028 Olympics. So in?a discussion?that included Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles) and L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti	 Pelosi and local leaders gathered at Union Station to discuss?the need for federal money?to complete major road	 highway	 bridge?and transit projects	 and highlighted the fact that Trump has not unveiled his promised $1-trillion infrastructure investment plan.? But afterward	"" Pelosi?was pressed by reporters mainly to respond to the president's assertion that """"""""there is blame on both sides"""""""" for the weekend?violence that erupted during white nationalist protests in Charlottesville""	"" Va. """"""""I was hoping we could focus first of all on infrastructure?because that＊s what we＊re here to talk about""	"" the San Francisco resident said. """"""""We haven't seen an [infrastructure] initiative yet. We even thought we might see one yesterday""	 but we didn't	 she continued	"" referring to Trump's?own planned remarks?on infrastructure?that veered off course Tuesday when?he?repeated explosive comments about?the violent protests in Virginia.? """"""""What we saw yesterday was the president clearly demonstrating that he doesn't know right from wrong""	 true from false	 American patriotism from white nationalism	"" Pelosi said. """"""""Very sad for our country."""""""" However""	 she added that she has not promoted the idea of impeaching Trump	"" and that not knowing right from wrong """"""""is not necessarily grounds for impeachment."""""""" Some?Democratic representatives have called for impeachment""	 and on Tuesday night	 Pelosi's fellow Bay Area representative	 Jackie Speier	"" called for Trump to be removed under the 25th Amendment.? """"""""If he crosses the line in terms of obeying the law""	 then we'll see	 Pelosi said.

Those issues resonate?in this swath of inland California	 a place still limping out of the recession where voters often complain of being ignored by Sacramento politicians except at election time. Newsom?ditched?his microphone in favor of pacing up and down the aisles inside Tuolumne Hall in downtown Fresno. He took questions from the about 200 people for close to 90 minutes. Near the opening of the event	 Newsom addressed?the weekend＊s deadly violence in Charlottesville	 Va.	 and President Trump＊s comments blaming?counter-protesters as well as white supremacist groups for the mayhem. ※That kind of bigotry	 that kind of hatred	 people that stoke that kind of fear 〞 these aren＊t dog whistles. These are racial provocateurs	§ Newsom told the crowd	 eliciting applause. ※They have no place in America	 let alone in this state.§ Newsom?also fielded questions focused on proposals to strengthen the state＊s water supply and healthcare system. In?both cases	 Newsom＊s responses fell short of solid commitments. The lieutenant governor said he was a strong backer of the $7.5-billion water bond approved by voters in 2014	 including $2.7 billion for water storage. But he did not say for certain that he would support the proposed Temperance Flat Dam on the San Joaquin River	 which would directly affect Central Valley farmers	 or the proposal for the Sites Reservoir?in the Sacramento Valley. Newsom reminded the audience that the dams aren't exactly popular in the Bay Area and that other options such as underground storage may also be viable. Still	?he assured the audience that he doesn't oppose the dam projects and indicated he would support the reservoirs if approved. On healthcare	 Newsom touted the fact that	 as mayor of San Francisco	 he helped establish a?citywide universal healthcare program that predated President Obama＊s Affordable Care Act. ※I do believe in Medicare for all. I do believe that it＊s inevitable in this country	§ Newsom said. ※Eventually we＊ll have some courage federally and we＊ll get there. The question is how can we complement that debate here in California.§ Newsom said he was committed to continuing the debate over whether California can launch its own single-payer healthcare system	 proposed in a bill shelved in the state Legislature this year. But he cautioned that it＊s a difficult issue to tackle given the enormous cost and complexities involved. ※I＊d be lying to you if I [told you I] had a detailed plan	§ Newsom said. Sally Garcia	73	 a retired secretary from Clovis	 said she came to Tuesday's event?with her husband	 Jess	 so that they would start educating themselves about the candidates running for governor.

The move comes as party leaders are fretting over the political fallout from President Trump＊s response to the violence spawned by white supremacists and neo-Nazis last weekend in Charlottesville, Va. ※As the nation grieves and heals from the scenes of this past weekend, we have a duty to more fully understand what led to these terrible events and the persistence of these hateful, extremist ideologies,§ Issa said in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). Trump condemned the neo-Nazis and white supremacists whose protests against Charlottesville＊s removal of a Confederate monument turned violent. But earlier this week the president reversed course in his remarks on the violence, saying some ※very fine people§ marched alongside the extremists, and casting some blame on counter-protesters.

It's not easy to get an auditorium full of hundreds of teenagers screaming with excitement on their first week back to school. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the Tony Award- and Pulitzer Prize-winning creator of ""Hamilton"" did just that Thursday, as he spoke to nearly 1,000 students in Rep. Tony Cardenas' San Fernando Valley district. In a roughly 30-minute question-and-answer session at Panorama High School, Miranda flowed seamlessly between English and Spanish, speaking about his earliest memories with his abuelita and telling the young crowd, ""Mi tiempo es tuya"" -- ""My time is yours.""? He also described history as ""a canvas."" ""It's for you to tell the stories we haven't heard yet. And to lift those voices, those often marginalized voices, up, and I can't wait to see what you create,"" Miranda told the crowd of mostly high schoolers, many of them Latino. He took turns answering lighthearted questions about his first job (working for $4.25 an hour at a Manhattan McDonald's) and the one food he'd choose to eat for the rest of his life (a type of Puerto Rican lasagna). But he also offered some tidbits of advice for the youngsters, telling them to ""surround yourself and fill yourself up with the thing you're chasing.""? Responding to a question about being successful as a Latino, Miranda said,?""You'll face struggle. You will face people telling you you've got to look a certain way, you will face people telling you that you have to tell a specific story."" He added, ""You could write a bad version of someone else's story but only you can tell your story."" Cardenas set up the event, billed as a ""town hall"" focused on civic engagement, after meeting Miranda's father, political consultant Luis Miranda, and chatting with him over coffee about the need to expose Latino youth to role models who?look like them. The elder Miranda brought his son onboard and was in the audience, along with Miranda's mother, Dr. Luz Towns-Miranda, at the event on Thursday.? Cardenas' 29th Congressional District is nearly 70% Latino and almost 45% of residents were born outside the United States. ""It's about talking to 1,000 children, who many of them are scared,"" Cardenas told reporters afterward. ""It's important for us to understand that examples like Lin-Manuel Miranda ... we don't have to be angry voices."" Miranda also addressed questions about the current political climate and the recent violence?in Charlottesville, Va. ""As scary and tragic as the events of last week were, the outpouring of pushback has been heartening,"" Miranda said. ""If you're a kid and you're scared in this country, there's a lot of adults who are working really hard and have your back.""

"Last Updated Jul 30, 2017 4:33 PM EDT Russian President Vladimir Putin says the U.S. will have to cut its diplomatic staff in Russia by 755 under new sanctions from Moscow. Russia's Foreign Ministry on Friday ordered a reduction by Sept. 1 in the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia. It said it is ordering the U.S. Embassy to reduce the number of embassy and consular employees in the country to 455 in response to the U.S. Senate's approval of a new package of sanctions. ""We had hoped that the situation will somehow change, but apparently if it changes, it won't be soon,"" Putin said in an interview televised on Rossiya 1, explaining why Moscow decided to retaliate. ""I thought it was the time to show that we're not going to leave it without an answer."" It was not clear how many reassignments that would mean from the Moscow embassy and the three U.S. consulates in Russia. CBS political contributor Ed O' Keefe and Republican strategist Hogan Gidley join CBSN to discuss the latest news out of the nation's capital. Putin said in the interview that he ordered the move because he ""thought it was the time to show that we're not going to leave that without an answer."" Putin said more than 1,000 people are currently employed at the Moscow embassy and three U.S. consulates in Russia. They include both Americans and Russians hired to work in the diplomatic offices. The White House has offered no comment on the demanded staff cut, and instead referred all questions for comment to the State Department. The Department of State would not comment on the number of diplomats in Russia. A State Department official said: ""It is our policy to not comment on the number of individuals serving at our missions abroad.?"" CBS News' Margaret Brennan reports that a White House official confirmed President Trump is expected to sign the Russia sanctions legislation early this week, but has not yet received the official bill on his desk.?In a statement late Friday, the White House said that Mr. Trump had ""read early drafts of the bill and negotiated regarding critical elements of it."" Having read the latest version, the White House said Mr. Trump intends to sign it. A bill that would slap new economic sanctions on Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election is winding its way through Congress, although it's... The bill also imposes sanctions against Iran and North Korea. The?Senate passed the bill?Thursday, 98-2, two days after the House pushed the measure through by an overwhelming margin, 419-3. Both were veto-proof numbers. But the White House had objected to a key section of the bill that would mandate a congressional review if Mr. Trump attempted to ease or end the sanctions against Moscow. The bill had somewhat put Mr. Trump in a corner, since the congressional review had been put in the bill due to a weariness from both sides of the aisle about Mr. Trump and Putin. The legislation is aimed at punishing Moscow for interfering in the 2016 presidential election and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria, where the Kremlin has backed President Bashar Assad. Putin said in his Sunday announcement that the new sanctions would cause damage to the Russia-U.S relationship. Asked about the potential for additional sanctions against Washington, Putin described the reduction in diplomatic staff as ""painful"" and said he currently opposes further measures. ""We certainly have something to respond with and restrict those areas of joint cooperation that will be painful for the American side but I don't think we need to do it,"" he said, adding that such steps could also harm Russian interests. Putin mentioned space and energy as the main areas where Russia and the United States have successfully pursued projects together. Russia is open to cooperating with the U.S. on various issues including terrorism and cybercrime but instead it ""only hears unfounded accusations of meddling in U.S. domestic affairs,"" the Russian leader said. Along with the cap on the size of its diplomatic corps in Russia, the Russian foreign ministry on Friday said it also was closing down a U.S. recreational retreat on the outskirts of Moscow as well as warehouse facilities The diplomatic tit-for-tat started under former U.S. President Barack Obama. In response to reports of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and shut down two Russian recreational retreats in the U.S.																																																																																																																					"
"In the wake of a failed GOP-led effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California say the path forward toward health care reform includes ""regular order."" Speaking on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, Flake said issues like health care, in addition to the nation's debt crisis, can't be tackled by one party alone. ""We've just seen the limits of what one party can do,"" said Flake. ""I'm glad to see that now we're talking about sitting down with our colleagues, going back to committee, going back to what we call regular order, and letting the committees and the experts deal with it, and bringing the public in more than we have before,"" he added.? Flake, who details the divide among the Republican party in his new book, ""Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle,"" said that in the fallout over health care, the next best way to solve the issue requires ""both parties sitting together and sharing the risk."" ""It's hard to imagine that can happen when we're ascribing the worst motives to our opponents,"" he said.? Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, joins Face the Nation Moderator John Dickerson to discuss his new book, ""Conscience of a Conservative"" that calls on ... Flake's comments come after Senate Republicans' attempt to?repeal parts of Obamacare failed?in a drama-filled, middle-of-the-night vote.? President Trump issued a series of tweets?following the bill's failure, saying, ""As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!""? Meanwhile, Feinstein, also appearing on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, appeared to echo Flake's call for bipartisanship in the health care debate -- saying, ""You can't take a bill as big as this one, write it with a select group of people in a back room, not let one of the political parties even see it until the Friday before a vote comes up, and think that this bill is going to pass."" She also called for regular order, urging Congress to now hold a series of hearings on health care in order to achieve the best outcome possible.? Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-California, discusses the North Korean missile test, the failed health care bill, and the criticism of Attorney Gener... The bipartisan effort, embraced by both Flake and Feinstein, is also a shared feeling among Americans. A new CBS News Nation Tracker Poll found that?more Americans prefer that Republicans now work with Democrats to improve Obamacare (47 percent), rather than try to repeal it outright (21 percent) or replace it with something exclusively of their own (19 percent). This sentiment is particularly strong among Democrats and independents, but a quarter of Republicans want to keep Obamacare, with bipartisan improvements. While the two senators appear to agree on positive steps forward in the health care debate, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, made it clear that his chamber is moving on to other things. ""It is time to move on,"" McConnell said when the Health Care Freedom Act failed early Friday morning, noting the other unrelated topics the Senate would take up in the hours ahead.?

"Tianna Rooney has already bought the poster board for the sign she'll wave when the 16-year-old refugee boy her family is taking in arrives in the United States. Rooney knows the exact words of welcome she'll write on it, in the teenager's native language from the African country of Eritrea. But Rooney's family is leaving the sign blank, for now. She and her husband, Todd, fear actually writing the words ""Welcome Home"" could break her heart. The foster son they're waiting for is part of a small, three-decade-old U.S. program for so-called unaccompanied refugee minors that has been halted by a series of new refugee bans and travel limits imposed by the Trump administration in the name of fighting terrorism. By blocking the program, the U.S. travel bans have stranded more than 100 refugee children who were already matched to waiting American foster families. Without parents or other adult relatives, those kids are living on their own in countries of temporary refuge, in limbo while their U.S. foster parents hope for a court ruling that will allow the children to finish their journeys. Since the June day a refugee agency matched the Rooneys with their foster son, which turned out to be the same day of the first Supreme Court ruling barring him, ""we have experienced this very unexpected ride of grief in our family,"" says Rooney, a 39-year-old family therapist and mother of two from Brighton, a suburb of Detroit. Meanwhile, the boy who fled his home country at 13 to avoid widespread forced military conscription of children continues to fend for himself on the streets in his temporary refuge in another African capital, with no phone or internet for the Rooneys to reach him to explain the delay. ""There's part of me that really hopes he knows a family wants him,"" Tianna Rooney says. Since the 1980s, the program for orphaned refugee children has brought in more than 6,000 refugee children, including 203 last year. ""These are kids on their own, and struggling to survive,"" said Elizabeth Foydel, policy counsel with the International Refugee Assistance Project, a Washington, D.C., legal-aid group for refugees. ""How long do you feel comfortable with your child not having a caregiver?"" Foydel says she asks other Americans. ""Trying to manage for themselves?"" The program for orphaned refugee children from around the world is different from one started by the Obama administration in 2014 for Central American children fleeing a surge in violence there. In the program for unaccompanied refugee children, kids eking out a living by themselves in a refugee camp or elsewhere must first come to the attention of a U.N. agency, which may choose to refer them for the U.S foster program, especially if the children are deemed to be particularly vulnerable wherever they are now. The children must then pass U.S. security screenings and other requirements, and win a match with an American foster family or group home. But a series of Trump administration orders, and court rulings interpreting them, are now barring refugees with no close family in the United States. That requirement shuts out the refugee children in the foster program, who have no relatives they can turn to anywhere. The child refugees newly blocked from waiting American foster families include five Ethiopian sisters, ages 9 to 16. The girls lost both parents in 2009, and have faced abuse alone in the war zone of neighboring South Sudan and in Sudanese cities, said Jessica Jones, policy counsel for the Baltimore-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. Along with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Lutherans are one of two U.S. groups running the program on behalf of the U.S. State Department. Other waiting children include a 17-year-old couple originally from the Asian country of Myanmar and the baby they had together in a refugee camp, after fleeing attacks on their Rohingya religious minority in Myanmar. In her home in another Detroit suburb, Sharon Martin, 64, has bought a crib for the young refugee family from Myanmar. But the children's books she bought, Martin said, are really for her. ""If they come, I can finally read to a child again,"" Martin says. Refugee workers say the family faces forced return to Myanmar if their U.S. arrangements fall through. In San Francisco, meanwhile, web designer Julie Rajagopal and husband Mike Gougherty, a senior planner for a regional ferry system, are two of the lucky ones. The 16-year-old boy they are fostering also fled a lifetime of forced military service in Eritrea, at 13. When he landed in March, a slight youth coming off the plane in an ill-made tracksuit, he was among the last refugee foster children to make it into the U.S. Rajagopal, 35, often had stayed up through the night calling government workers and charity officials in the faraway African hub of Cairo to speed her new foster son's paperwork. On a clear day this summer, the teen strolled with the couple at a park overlooking San Francisco. In the city's hip Mission District, he blended seamlessly in a red sweater and shoes he carefully matched himself, and jeans he insisted on lovingly ironing with each wear. Meanwhile, in Brighton, the Rooneys and their 10- and 12-year-old sons stack new socks and T-shirts in the bedroom they've set aside for the boy they nicknamed ""Five,"" meaning the eagerly awaited fifth member of their family. Tianna Rooney recently got out the poster board, thinking to work on the welcome sign. After a concerned look from her husband, she put it away. ""We want to think positive thoughts"" that their foster son will come safely, Todd Rooney said. ""But without endangering ourselves. Without setting ourselves up for a heartache.""																																																																																																																					"
"Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said Sunday that North Korea poses a ""clear and present danger"" to the United States, in the wake of the country's second?test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Feinstein said on ""Face the Nation"" that after spending time on intelligence and in briefings, she's ""convinced that North Korea has never moved at the speed that this leader has to develop an ICBM to put solid fuel, to have an interesting launch device, and to have a trajectory which, as of the latest analysis, would enable it to go about 6,000 miles and maybe even hit as far east as Chicago."" ""We can't have that,"" she added. ""To me, it points out the danger in isolating a country, that they go to the science and the technical know-how to show their brute force, not to handle the isolation."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein on ""Face the Nation,"" July 30, 2017 Feinstein's comments come after?President Trump tweeted Saturday?about North Korea, saying he is ""disappointed"" in China for not doing enough in regard to the country -- a sentiment Feinstein echoed. ""I'm very disappointed in China's response, that it has not been firmer or more helpful,"" she said.? China has said?that it shouldn't be held responsible for solving the nuclear standoff with North Korea, and that it doesn't hold the key to resolving the issue.? The intercontinental ballistic missile North Korea tested Friday flew longer and higher than the first one the country tested, according to its wary neighbors, leading analysts to conclude that a wide swath of the U.S. including Los Angeles and Chicago is now within range of Pyongyang's weapons. Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga has said that the missile flew for about 45 minutes -- about five minutes longer than the ICBM that was test-fired on July 4. Following the launch, the U.S. conducted a missile defense test Sunday, using a Terminal High Altitutde Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in Alaska. The U.S. Air Force launched a medium-range ballistic missile over the Pacific Ocean, and the THAAD system -- in Kodiak, Alaska -- ""detected, tracked and intercepted the target,"" the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said in a statement Sunday. Feinstein said ""the only solution is a diplomatic one."" Feinstein added that she hopes incoming White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly will be effective in beginning some ""very serious negotiation with the North and stop this program.""

"Sen. Jeff Flake says the Republican Party has ""lost its way,"" and is urging members to turn back to what he calls ""traditional conservatism"" -- after a particularly contentious week in Washington. ""We've given in to nativism and protectionism. And I think that if we're going to be a governing party in the future and a majority party we've got to go back to traditional conservatism,"" Flake said Sunday on ""Face the Nation."" In his new book, ""Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle,"" the Arizona Republican -- who will likely face challenges in his race for reelection next year -- outlines some of his differences with President Trump.? Flake was?reluctant to endorse Mr. Trump?in the days leading up to the 2016 election, criticizing Mr. Trump for his pivots on immigration, a major issue for the senator whose state shares a border with Mexico.? Since then, Flake has taken a tougher stance on Mr. Trump than some other Republicans, in one case urging the FBI to release any tapes of conversations between Mr. Trump and?fired FBI Director James Comey.? Flake writes in his new book, ""When we excuse on our side what we attack on the other, then we are hypocrites. If we do that as a practice, then we are corrupt. If we continually accept this conduct as elected officials, then perhaps we shouldn't be elected officials."" Asked whether he believes Republican leaders are complicit in this notion if they don't call out the president, Flake responded, ""I do think so.""? ""The last thing you want to do is wake up every morning and see a tweet... You know, it's tough not to just say, 'I'm not going to respond,'"" Flake said. ""And we can't respond to everything. But there are times when you have to stand up and say, 'I'm sorry. This is wrong.'"" ""There are truths that are self-evident,"" Flake added. ""And you've got to stand up and call -- whether it's the White House or other elected officials -- to task when they're-- they're not doing what they should. And I do think that we bear the responsibility, if we're elected officials, to do that."" Flake said the 24-hour news cycle and impact of social media is, in large part, helping drive the Republican Party apart. ""I think certainly the modern media culture values those who yell the loudest,"" Flake said. ""And so the tougher path is frankly to have the kind of demeanor that some people might call boring."" ""But you've got to move ahead and tackle the policy issues,"" he added. ""And the problem is this is very much getting in the way of us solving the problems that we've got to solve.""

"Friday night a video rocketed through social media. It was of the president shaking hands with people invited to attend a health care speech at the White House Monday.? A little boy was there in a wheelchair and the president passed him by. People sent around the video as proof of President Trump's shriveled spirit. He would not even stoop to notice a child in a wheelchair. This was unfair to the president. In reality, the first thing the president had done upon entering the room was stop, bend over, and talk to the child. This isn't about this one incident. It's about an instinct. Snap judgments like this are corroding our culture. We're so ready for evidence to confirm the absolute worst about an opponent it snuffs out our charity.? To show that the president lacked generosity those who passed around the clip were themselves being ungenerous. A moment of reflection might have caused people to wonder whether-- as is so often the case-- the picture or the soundbite was incomplete or misleading.? White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci weaponized this instinct last week when he accused Reince Priebus of leaking his financial disclosure form. It wasn't a leak. The information was publicly available, but who paused to learn that when it was more fun to just believe it was a sinister leak. Some might point out the president has often shown a lack of generosity himself. He has, even this week, to his own Attorney General. But this is no excuse.? Standards either exist or they don't. They don't exist only to help your team abuse the competition. Dropping standards to win is also diminishing our public life. Most people who passed around that clip would agree. That's the generous way to look at it.? Back in a moment.																																																																																																																					"

"Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election to President Donald Trump, but some Republicans in Congress are intensifying their calls to investigate her and other Obama administration officials. As investigations into Russian meddling and possible links to Trump's campaign have escalated on both sides of the Capitol, some Republicans argue that the investigations should have a greater focus on Democrats. Democrats who have pushed the election probes ""have started a war of investigative attrition,"" said GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a member of the House Judiciary Committee. Several officials from former President Barack Obama's administration and Clinton's campaign have appeared before or been interviewed by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees as part of the Russia investigation, along with Trump campaign officials. The GOP-led committees are investigating whether Trump's campaign had any links to Russian interference in last year's election. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has continued a separate investigation into whether Obama administration officials inappropriately made requests to ""unmask"" identities of Trump campaign officials in intelligence reports. The House Judiciary Committee, which has declined to investigate the Russian meddling, approved a resolution this past week to request documents related to the FBI's now-closed investigation of Clinton's emails. In addition, Republican on that committee wrote the Justice Department on Thursday and asked for a second special counsel, in addition to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, to investigate ""unaddressed matters, some connected to the 2016 election and others, including many actions taken by Obama administration."" ""The American public has a right to know the facts 〞 all of them 〞 surrounding the election and its aftermath,"" the lawmakers wrote. Republicans want to investigate the unmasking issue and also Clinton's email scandal that figured prominently in the campaign. They also frequently bring up former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and former FBI Director James Comey's testimony that she told him to call the Clinton email investigation a ""matter"" instead of an investigation during the campaign. Nunes wrote his own letter to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats last week, saying that his committee has learned that one Obama administration official had made ""hundreds"" of the unmasking requests. Even though he remains committee chairman, Nunes stepped back from the Russia investigation earlier this year after he was criticized for being too close to the White House. Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, took over the leading role. The committee has conducted bipartisan interviews of witnesses; Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner appeared on Tuesday, a day after talking to Senate staff. But partisan tensions have been evident. GOP Rep. Pete King of New York, who's on the House Intelligence Committee, said after the Kushner interview that the committee investigation into Russian meddling is a ""sham."" ""To me there is nothing to this from the beginning,"" he said of his committee's own probe. ""There is no collusion ... it's the phoniest investigation ever."" Both the Senate and House committees have interviewed or expressed interest in interviewing a series of Democratic witnesses, including Obama's former national security adviser, Susan Rice, and former U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power 〞 both of whom Republicans have said may be linked to the unmasking. Rice met with staff on the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month, and Power met with the panel Friday. ""Ambassador Power strongly supports any bipartisan effort to address the serious threat to our national security posed by Russia's interference in our electoral process, and is eager to engage with the Senate and House committees on the timeline they have requested,"" Power's lawyer, David Pressman, said in a statement.

"His tweets have the power to shape international relations, send stock prices up 〞 or down 〞 and galvanize the American public.

And, as much as possible, we'll relate what else was going on at the time. Check back for more as Trump continues to tweet. President Trump assured the public that he planned to work during the remainder of his time at?his New Jersey golf club. Trump tweeted Thursday morning that he would take meetings in Bedminster, N.J. He returned there Wednesday to resume his 17-day ""working vacation"" after brief visits to Washington and New York. Trump planned to meet separately Thursday at his golf club with Linda McMahon, the administrator of the Small Business Administration, and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a longtime Trump supporter.? Trump also prepared for an unusual meeting Friday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland with his national security team to discuss strategy for South Asia, including India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Vice President Mike Pence was cutting short a long-planned Latin America tour to attend the meeting. That came as fallout continued over Trump's response to?violence in Charlottesville, Va., where a woman was killed when she was hit by a car on Saturday while protesting a white supremacist rally. Though out of public view, Trump sought to make his voice heard on Twitter as he found himself increasingly under siege and alone while fanning the controversy over race and politics toward a full-fledged national conflagration. In other tweets Thursday morning, the president?attacked two Republican senators and the news media, deepened his defense?of Confederate war memorials, condemned an attack in Barcelona, Spain, and repeated a widely discredited anecdote about a U.S. Army general's treatment of Muslim prisoners.

And, as much as possible, we'll relate what else was going on at the time. Check back for more as Trump continues to tweet. Hours after a van plowed through a crowd in Barcelona, Spain,?and left at least 12 people dead, President Trump tweeted condemnation of the attack and quickly followed with a statement about U.S. Army Gen. John Joseph Pershing that historians describe as urban legend. The full claim, which Trump repeated several times during his 2016 presidential campaign, is that in the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, Pershing had his men dip 50 bullets in pig?blood and use them to kill 49 Muslim prisoners. The survivor was told to relay the experience to others. The story claims that terrorism decreased for decades. If true, the story would constitute a war crime under U.S. law, which prohibits execution of prisoners. The tale has circulated across the Internet for years. Trump told it in February 2016 during a speech to supporters in North Charleston, S.C., in which he lauded the benefits of heavy-handed interrogation techniques.? ""He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs＊ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: 'You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened.' And for 25 years, there wasn＊t a problem. OK? Twenty-five years, there wasn＊t a problem,"" Trump told the crowd. Two months later during a speech that criticized President Obama's acceptance of Middle Eastern war refugees into the U.S., Trump told the same story to supporters in Costa Mesa. This time, he altered the number of problem-free years from 25 to 42. In a 2013 edition of Pershing's memoir, a letter from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell to Pershing was added in the footnote. The letter described a long ""custom to bury [insurgents]?with pigs when they kill Americans."" Bell called the tactic ""a good plan."" The letter does indicate that pig blood was at one time used, or at the very least discussed, as an intimidation tactic against Muslim fighters, since Islam considers pigs unclean. But there's no evidence that Pershing 每 who historians describe as less brutal than his predecessors 每 ever used such a technique. ""This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited,"" Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian, told Politifact. ""I am amazed it is still making the rounds.""

And, as much as possible, we'll relate what else was going on at the time. Check back for more as Trump continues to tweet. President Trump attacked two Republican lawmakers, Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona, in tweets Thursday morning, deepening his feud with members of his party. Both men got the sort of unkind brands Trump favors: ""Flake Jeff Flake"" and ""Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham."" Strikingly, the president offered a semi-endorsement of Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator who plans to challenge Flake in a primary next year 每 a stand that would put him at odds not only with Flake, but with the state's senior senator, John McCain, whom Trump jabbed, not for the first time, earlier this week. Presidents almost never get involved in primary battles against incumbents of their own parties 每 when they have, the efforts have usually ended badly for the White House. But Flake opposed Trump last year and angered him further in recent weeks with the publication of his new book, which sharply criticizes both Trump and Republicans who have supported him. Trump's jabs come two days after he again attacked McCain?and after last week's series of slams against the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell. In this case, Trump's intervention likely will deepen his fight with two senators at once, McCain and Flake 每?just as the president has, perhaps not coincidentally, scheduled a political rally in their state for Tuesday, in Phoenix.? Last month, after McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer, Ward publicly called on him to step down from the Senate, saying he would die soon and that Gov. Doug Ducey should consider her as a replacement. She ran against McCain and lost in 2016 in a bitter primary in which she said he was too old to be reelected. Ward is a favorite of a family of wealthy, deeply conservative, Republicans donors, the Mercers, who have been major financial backers of Trump and also of his strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. White House officials have met with Ward and other candidates who might oppose Flake, and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently made a point of leaving open the possibility that Trump would get involved in the primary. Further deepening the feud, Trump also took a swipe at McCain's closest ally in the Senate, Graham, calling him a ""publicity seeking"" lawmaker. Trump criticized Graham for what the senator had said about Trump's remarks on the violence last weekend in Charlottesville, Va. Heather Heyer was killed when she was struck by a car driven into a crowd of people on Saturday who were protesting white supremacists in Charlottesville. The reference to Graham's ""trouncing"" presumably referred to Graham's poor showing when he briefly sought the GOP presidential nomination last year. He was easily reelected to the Senate in 2014.? In a statement, Graham responded that Trump's praise of Heyer was ""very nice and appropriate. Well done."" ""However, because of the manner in which you handled the Charlottesville tragedy, you are now receiving praise from some of the most racist and hate-filled individuals and groups in our country."" In a separate tweet, Trump accused ""the Fake News"" of distorting ""what I say about hate, bigotry, etc. Shame!""

Showing his characteristic refusal to back down in the face of criticism, President Trump deepened his defense of Confederate war memorials Thursday, sending out a series of messages on Twitter that adopted the language and arguments of white nationalists who have opposed their removal. Trump's equation of Gens. Lee and Jackson, who took up arms against the Constitution, with Presidents Washington and Jefferson repeated one of the major arguments that defenders of the Confederate monuments have made. Monuments to leaders of the Confederacy were erected across the South, and in some other parts of the country, mostly starting in the early years of the 20th century, as whites fought to prevent black citizens from voting and increased the strictures of segregation that barred blacks from schools, hotels, restaurants and white sections of trains and other public accommodations.? The placement of the statues and monuments in public squares coincided with the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the murder of thousands of blacks by lynch mobs in the early decades of the last century. To blacks, and many white Southerners, the statues have long been a symbol of racial oppression. In recent years, the movement to take them down and, in some cases, put them in museums instead of public parks, has gained strength in many Southern cities.

Johnson said?on Thursday that he helped arrange a highly unusual meeting between Orange County GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher and?WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange this week. Rohrabacher?said in a statement that?he plans to bring information to President Trump from the three-hour meeting, which took place Wednesday?in London at the Ecuadorian Embassy, where Assange?has been living in asylum since 2012. He would not detail that information to The Times, but in an interview Thursday morning with the Daily Caller, Rohrabacher was more explicit, saying he and Assange talked about ※what might be necessary to get him out§?and suggested they discussed a?presidential pardon in exchange for?information on the theft of emails?from the Democratic National Committee, which were published by WikiLeaks before the 2016 presidential election. ※He has information that will be of dramatic importance to the United States and the people of our country as well as to our government,§ Rohrabacher told the Daily Caller. ※Thus if he comes up with that, you know he＊s going to expect something in return. He can＊t even leave the embassy to get out to Washington to talk to anybody if he doesn＊t have a pardon.§ Johnson, who is known for being?banned from Twitter?after he asked users for help ※taking out§?a civil rights activist,?said that he and Assange attorney Jennifer Robinson also?were in the meeting. Johnson wrote in an email to The Times?that the meeting was the result of a ※desire?for ongoing communications§?from both Rohrabacher and Assange.?Rohrabacher spokesman Ken Grubbs said the congressman alerted the White House about his planned trip to visit Assange. The White House has not confirmed whether it was aware of the meeting ahead of time. Rohrabacher＊s?office said that during the meeting, Assange?repeated his claims that the Russian government was not involved in the theft of Democratic?emails. The release of the emails put Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on the defensive and are among the incidents that led to investigations by the Justice Department and multiple House and Senate committees into potential ties between President Trump＊s campaign and election meddling. Multiple U.S. intelligence agencies think Russia was involved in the theft of the emails. In a statement, DNC spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said, ※We＊ll take the word of the U.S. intelligence community over Julian Assange and Putin＊s favorite Congressman.§?? Assange, who has been criticized by many U.S. officials for WikiLeaks＊?alleged?ties to Russia, remains in asylum at least in part because British authorities have threatened?him with arrest for jumping bail after Sweden made sexual assault allegations against him. Those allegations since have been dropped, but?Assange, who is Australian,?also could face?legal problems in the U.S. The?Washington Post reported in April?that federal prosecutors were weighing whether to bring charges against members of WikiLeaks, in part over information leaked by Chelsea Manning, the U.S. soldier convicted of handing over diplomatic cables to the organization. Rohrabacher, who has?long been criticized for his fondness for?Russia, believes he is the only congressman who has?visited Assange. Shortly after the trip was revealed, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee called for Rohrabacher to step down from his post on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he chairs a subcommittee on Eurasian affairs. Grubbs called the Democratic committee＊s call ※absurdly but predictably partisan.§? Grubbs also said Rohrabacher?paid for the trip to London 〞?which he took?while?many of his House colleagues are working and holding town hall meetings in their districts 〞?with personal funds.

Following a flood of reports by?female entrepreneurs?detailing lewd remarks and unwanted sexual advances by male investors, a California lawmaker wants state law to explicitly prohibit such harassment.? State Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) announced Thursday she was introducing a measure to amend California's Unruh Civil Right Act to expressly forbid sexual harassment between investors and entrepreneurs.? Jackson said she believes such behavior already is barred under existing law under a blanket prohibition in the Unruh Act, which outlaws discrimination based on sex, gender, ethnicity and other categories.?But, she noted, the act also specifically names certain business relationships as being protected from such harassment.?By naming the relationship between investors and start-up founders, she hopes that will provide additional clarity for women who have been harassed. ""Because there hasn't been that clarity, I think women have been reluctant to step forward,"" Jackson said in a call with reporters. ""By including this specifically, it reaffirms and will hopefully provide the kind of incentive for women who have been victimized by this behavior to step forward?because?it will be specifically identified?in the law."" The proposal was prompted by a spate of reports from female tech entrepreneurs, who went public with stories of being asked on dates and experiencing?unwanted physical contact when dealing with male venture capitalists, whose investments are crucial to getting fledgling start-ups off the ground. ""Their stories have peeled back a shroud of?secrecy and exposed behaviors that are simply not acceptable in any industry,"" Jackson said. The disclosures have prompted a round of self-reflection in the tech industry, with some venture capitalists issuing public mea culpas, and others promising a crackdown on predatory behavior. Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, said Silicon Valley ""understands it has to change,"" but self-policing measures such as decency pledges ""really won't cut it."" ""The women that we talk to are tired of being treated by venture capitalists?as sexual opportunities instead of investment opportunities,"" Farrell said. Jackson plans to insert her measure into an existing bill, SB 224, in a process known as a ""gut-and-amend."" But with the Legislature slated to end its work for the year in less than a month, she said her bill will not be taken up until next January, when the new legislative year begins.

"Republican, Democratic and even bipartisan plans for reshaping parts of the Obama health care law are proliferating in Congress. But they have iffy prospects at best, and there were no signs Monday that GOP leaders have chosen a fresh pathway after last week's collapse of their struggle to repeal and rewrite the statute. Despite a weekend of tweets from President Donald Trump insisting that the Senate revisit the issue, Republican prospects for garnering 50 votes to push something through the chamber seemed to worsen after Sen. John McCain returned to Arizona for brain cancer treatments. He was among three GOP senators who joined Democrats in opposing a bare-bones bill rolling back a few pieces of President Barack Obama's statute, dealing it a stunning 51-49 defeat, and his absence probably denies leaders their best chance of turning that vote around. Rather than resuming its health care debate, the Senate began considering a judicial nomination Monday. In the House, 43 Democratic and Republican moderates proposed a plan that includes continuing federal payments that help insurers contain expenses for lower-earning customers and limiting Obama's requirement that larger employers offer coverage to workers. But movements by House centrists seldom bear fruit in the House, where the rules give the majority party ironclad control, and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., offered little encouragement. ""While the speaker appreciates members coming together to promote ideas, he remains focused on repealing and replacing Obamacare,"" said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. The House approved its health care overhaul in May after barely overcoming its own GOP divisions. Mr. Trump has threatened anew in recent days to cut off the payments to insurers, which total $7 billion this year and are helping trim out-of-pocket costs for 7 million people. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Trump will decide this week whether to pay them in August, and insurers have cited the monthly uncertainty as a factor in rising premiums. As Mr. Trump also called for an end to ""bailouts for insurance companies"", CBS News' Nancy Cordes reports that about six million Americans on the individual market still benefit from the cost-sharing funds issued to insurers.? The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) found that insurers would need to hike their average premiums an additional 19 percent by next year to compensate for the lost funding.? Larry Levitt, Vice President of KFF told CBS News that ""Insurers really have two choices if these payments stop. One is to increase premiums, the other is to exit the market completely."" He added, ""if insurers decide that this kind of undermining of the market is going to continue and they exit the market entirely, that could leave millions of people uninsured with no other options."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said GOP leaders should ""follow the example of their members releasing some proposals with Democrats today"" and engage in ""serious bipartisan conversations,"" but she didn't specifically endorse the bipartisan proposals. The group was led by Reps. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J. One proposal would require companies with at least 500 workers to offer coverage, up from the Obama law's cutoff of 50 workers. Hoping to find some way forward, health secretary Tom Price was meeting with some governors and at least one senator, Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, congressional and statehouse aides said. Among those attending was Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who's been trying to defend his state's expansion of Medicaid, the health insurance program for poor people, against proposed GOP cuts. Price said last week that the administration would advance its health care goals using regulations that Congress does not have to approve. Cassidy and Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Dean Heller, R-Nev., have proposed converting the $110 billion they estimate Obama's law spends yearly for health insurance into grants states could use for health programs as they see fit. Shortly after the Senate rejected his last-ditch bill Friday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., invited Democrats to present their ideas on the issue. But he quickly constructed an obstacle for one top Democratic desire: continuing the payments to insurers. ""Bailing out insurance companies with no thought of any kind of reform is not something I want to be part of,"" McConnell said. Obama's statute requires that insurers reduce those costs for low-earning customers. Kristine Grow, spokeswoman for the insurance industry group America's Health Insurance Plans, said Monday that halting the federal payments would boost premiums for people buying individual policies by 20 percent. Besides continuing those payments, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has pushed two other Democratic proposals. Under one by Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Tom Carper of Delaware, the federal government would help pay larger than expected claims for insurers providing coverage on the federal and state online marketplaces established by Obama's law. Another by Sen. Clare McCaskill of Missouri would let people in counties where no insurers offer policies on exchanges buy the same coverage that members of Congress purchase. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated last week that exchanges would offer no coverage next year in 40 of the country's roughly 3,000 counties. Tennessee's two GOP senators 〞 Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker 〞 have suggested legislation that would let people in counties without available coverage on their exchanges to use the Obama law's tax credits to buy individual policies outside of those marketplaces.

"Not being old enough to cast an actual ballot in a state or national election hasn't stopped 12-year-old Millie March of Northern Virginia from getting involved in politics.? When her spirited endorsements of President Trump's agenda at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) went viral in February, March became the unofficial representative of youngsters everywhere who support Mr. Trump. On Monday, March raised the bar for her civil involvement on ""Fox & Friends,"" saying she was not ruling out a future run for the White House.? ""If the country needs me, I will run. I don't care about being the first female president,"" March said when asked if she would like to pick up where former candidate Hillary Clinton left off. It wouldn't be March's first competitive campaign, either. Although known as an ardent defender of the president inside the classroom, March managed to win her elementary school's race for student president earlier this year.? https://t.co/Wcl1kYNft8 via @youtube ""I asked them, 'Who's our president? Who's our president?' And they were like, 'Truuuuump＃'"" March said, joking about some of her classmates who were less happy about November's outcome.? On ""Fox & Friends,"" her father said that the March family used to be be involved in politics, but his daughter's views and political leanings were completely her own. ""We don't tell her what to think,"" he said. ""She's the one that has read the books. She's the one that watched the news shows."" At one point during the program, March provided rapid-fire analysis on Republican Ed Gillespie's run for Virginia governor in the 2018 midterms: ""He is a winner. He will win. He almost beat Mark Warner in the Senate election.""? At CPAC, March represented Virginia Kids4Trump, a pro-Trump organization for politically-inclined youth in the Old Dominion. There, before reporters and camera crews, March held multiple press conferences where she advocated for the real-estate mogul-turned-president. ""Without Trump, I wouldn't be here,"" she said. ""There was this guy. He talked about all the issues we were facing, all the problems. Okay, that's normal. Every politician does that. Then something extraordinary happened. He said how to fix them."" March's strong support of Mr. Trump and her articulate criticisms of Washington have caught the attention of some of Mr. Trump's closest allies. In the past year, March has shaken hands with many more politicians and Washington insiders than the average American.? March even met one-on-one with Mr. Trump less than two months out from election day.

"The Trump administration announced the U.S. will impose financial sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The move comes after Venezuela held a weekend election?that will give Maduro's ruling party virtually unlimited power in the South American country. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced the sanctions against Maduro in a brief statement on Monday, a day after the Venezuelan vote to elect a constituent assembly that will rewrite the constitution. ""Yesterday's illegitimate elections confirm that Maduro is a dictator who disregards the will of the Venezuelan people. By sanctioning Maduro, the United States makes clear our opposition to the politics of his regime and our support for the people of Venezuela who seek to return their country to a full and prosperous democracy,"" said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in a statement. As a result of the sanctions, the statement read, ""all assets of Maduro are now subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen and all U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with him."" At Monday's White House press briefing, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster read a statement from President Trump regarding the new sanctions. Mr. Trump condemned the Maduro regime's refusal to heed the Venezueulan constitution by carrying out a ""sham election."" ""This outrageous seizure of absolute power through a sham election represents a serious blow to democracy in our hemisphere,"" McMaster said. He added that Maduro ""is not just a bad leader -- he is now a dictator."" ?""The United States stands with people of Venezuela in face of this oppression,"" he said. Mnuchin also weighed in, saying, ""We very much believe sanctions do work and will continue to monitor this situation and consider additional sanctions."" ""All options are on the table and we'll consider everything,"" Mnuchin added. ?""Our objective is not to do anything that hurts the people of Venezuela."" The administration imposed sanctions on more than a dozen senior current and former Venezuelan officials last week, warning the socialist government that new penalties would come if Maduro went ahead with Sunday's election for the assembly.

"Last Updated Jul 31, 2017 7:27 PM EDT WASHINGTON -- An Army medic from Michigan who risked his life multiple times to rescue Vietnam War comrades is the first person to be awarded the Medal of Honor by President Trump. Mr. Trump presented America's highest military honor to James McCloughan on Monday afternoon at a White House ceremony, calling him ""a brave guy."" ""For over two centuries our brave men and women in uniform have overcome tyranny, fascism, communism and every threat to our freedom. Every single threat, they have overcome,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And we've overcome these threats because of titans like Jim, whose spirit could never be concurred. That's what this award is, and Jim's life represents so well: America's unbreakable spirit."" McCloughan was a 23-year-old private first class who had been drafted into the Army when, in 1969, he found himself in the middle of the raging, days long Battle of Hui Yon Hill. McCloughan voluntarily entered the ""kill zone"" to rescue injured comrades, even as he was pelted with shrapnel from a rocket-propelled grenade. ""The worst 48 hours of my life, and I'm getting an award for it,"" McCloughan told CBS News' David Martin in an interview. President Trump presents the Medal of Honor to former Army Specialist James McCloughan of South Haven, Michigan, during an East Room ceremony at the White House on Mon., July 31, 2017, in Washington, D.C. McCloughan is awarded with the medal for his heroic acts as a combat medic during the Vietnam War. In its announcement last month, the White House said McCloughan ""voluntarily risked his life on nine separate occasions to rescue wounded and disoriented comrades. He suffered wounds from shrapnel and small arms fire on three separate occasions, but refused medical evacuation to stay with his unit, and continued to brave enemy fire to rescue, treat, and defend wounded Americans."" Now 71 and living in South Haven, Michigan, McCloughan told The Associated Press in an interview last month that the battle was ""the worst two days of my life."" McCloughan described the shrapnel as ""a real bad sting"" and recalled, ""I was tending to two guys and dragging them at the same time into a trench line."" He said he looked down to see himself covered with blood, a wound so bad that it prompted a captain to suggest that he leave the battlefield to seek treatment. ""He knew me enough to know that I wasn't going,"" McCloughan said. The combat medic stuck around until the battle ended, coming to the aid of his men and fighting the enemy, even knocking out an enemy RPG position with a grenade at one point. In all, the Pentagon credits McCloughan with saving the lives of 10 members of his company. The Medal of Honor is given to Armed Forces members who distinguish themselves by going above and beyond the call of duty in battle. ""We honor you, we salute you, and with God as your witness, we thank you for what you did for all of us,"" Mr. Trump said to McCloughan. McCloughan left the Army in 1970 and spent decades teaching psychology and sociology and coaching football, baseball and wrestling at South Haven High School. He retired in 2008. In 2016, Defense Secretary Ash Carter recommended McCloughan for the Medal of Honor. But since the medal must be awarded within five years of the recipient's actions, Congress needed to pass a bill waiving the time limit. Then-President Obama signed the measure in late 2016, but he didn't get the opportunity to recognize McCloughan with the medal before his term ended this year. ""President Donald Trump will be putting that on me for the first time in his experience of doing such a thing,"" McCloughan said. ""That's pretty special.""																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Jul 31, 2017 6:58 PM EDT President Trump has removed Anthony Scaramucci from his new job as communications director, on his 11th day on the job --?he was named to the position?on July 21. ""Anthony Scaramucci will be leaving his role as White House Communications Director. Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team. We wish him all the best,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. Scaramucci was escorted out of the White House, a source told CBS News. This comes the same day that retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly was sworn in as the new White House chief of staff. The New York Times first reported the development, which said that Kelly asked Mr. Trump to remove Scaramucci from his role. The report added that Kelly also made clear Monday morning that he's now in charge. Kelly wanted ""more structure, less Game of Thrones,"" a source close to the White House told CBS News. The source added that Kelly will have far more latitude than Reince Priebus & did a good job negotiating terms of his service -- ""either I'm a chief of staff in name, or I'm the chief of staff."" Scaramucci had previously bragged that he would report directly to the president rather than the chief of staff. Just hours earlier, the president tweeted that there is no chaos at the White House. Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos! As the news began circulating Monday afternoon, outgoing press secretary Sean Spicer came out of his office where he had huddled with various people. He joyously asked, looking at a dozen or so reporters in the hallway, if there was a surprise party. At a Cabinet meeting earlier in the day, Mr. Trump said, ""I predict that General Kelly will go down, in terms of the position of chief of staff, one of the great ever. And we're going to have a good time, but much more importantly, we're going to work hard and we're going to make America great again."" Mr. Trump named Kelly, who had been serving as Homeland Security secretary, to the new role on Friday, replacing Reince Priebus. Priebus said that he had resigned from the position, which he had served in since the inauguration in January. Anthony Scaramucci, named Donald Trump's new White House communications director speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C. on July 21, 2017. Scaramucci was viewed as a provocative figure who bumped heads with both Priebus and Sean Spicer, who resigned from his job as press secretary the same day that Scaramucci was chosen to lead the White House communications operation. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has since taken over as press secretary. Last week, he came under fire for comments he made during a phone call with New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza. He said that he believed that Priebus had leaked information about the dinner he attended with the president that night. ""They'll all be fired by me,"" he said. ""I fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I'll fire tomorrow. I'll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus -- if you want to leak something -- he'll be asked to resign very shortly...Reince is a f******* paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac."" Then using a vulgar colloquialism, Scaramucci said that Priebus had tried to block him for months, and was now giving former Fox News executive Bill Shine the same treatment. The entire exchange between Lizza and Scaramucci was detailed in a story?published online Thursday by the New Yorker. Scaramucci is the second communications director to leave the position. In May, Michael Dubke resigned from the gig, saying that he was leaving for personal reasons. CBS News' Major Garrett, Jacqueline Alemany and Katiana Krawchenko contributed to this report. A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle																																																																																																																					"
"As Gen. John Kelly starts his first day as new White House chief of staff, his role leaves a vacancy at the Department of Homeland Security. Serving in the interim until a formal nominee is chosen by President Trump and a subsequent Senate confirmation process is completed, Elaine Duke, Deputy Secretary of DHS, will fill in as acting secretary for now. ? ? Duke, sworn in back in April, previously served as DHS Under Secretary for Management from 2008-2010.? CBS News' Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett reports that possible contenders to replace Kelly in the top job at DHS include Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert, and Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Thomas Homan. Also there was heavy speculation over the weekend that?Attorney General Jeff Sessions?could be moved to DHS.? But Garrett notes that the chance that Mr. Trump might shift Sessions from the Justice Department to DHS is a ""long shot,"" and several sources have said the move is ""unlikely."" Kelly will now be tasked with bringing discipline and order to the White House, as well as controlling access to Mr. Trump and assisting in the president's decision making.? Kelly replaces former chief of staff Reince Priebus, who was forced out on Friday.? Reince Priebus' tenure as White House chief of staff was the shortest in American history. CBS News correspondent Errol Barnett joins CBSN from W... Priebus is the latest in a series of departures from the White House, including White House press secretary Sean Spicer, White House communications director Michael Dubke, deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland and spokesman for the Trump legal team Mark Corallo.? Mr. Trump also terminated National Security Adviser Gen. Michael Flynn, FBI Director James Comey and Obama-era holdover and acting Attorney General Sally Yates.? Mr. Trump holds Kelly in high regard, which was evident at his swearing-in Monday, and this will be an advantage for him, but Garrett noted that he also faces a disadvantage, however, as he enters the White House role: ?No defined relationship with members on Capitol Hill and no personal experience with the warring factions within the Trump White House that has been in turmoil for weeks.?

"After President Trump announced a ""hard-power"" budget plan that prioritizes defense spending over diplomacy and foreign aid, the United Nations programs combating HIV and AIDS recently released some promising news. The number of people dying from AIDS around the world has been cut nearly in half since 2005, two years after the Bush administration initiated its plan to fight the disease in Africa, known as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. The U.N. announced the new figures last week. In Washington, lost amid the evident turmoil in the White House, came another shred of overlooked good news: PEPFAR announced that four African countries are close to getting their HIV/AIDS epidemics under control as a result of investments from the U.S. and global partners. Since 2011, HIV infections have been nearly halved among adults in Swaziland, the country with the world's highest prevalence of HIV in the world, PEPFAR said. Meanwhile, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe have also made ""significant progress towards controlling the HIV epidemic,"" according to a statement released Monday. ""The global community decided to move forward on this. No one ever thought that you could control a pandemic without a vaccine or a cure, but we are actually shrinking the pandemic in the future by decreasing the number of new infections,"" said Ambassador Deborah Birx, the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy. ""And we are doing that without a vaccine or a cure."" A pharmacist packs antiretroviral drugs at the AIDS Care Training and Support Initiative (ACTS) at White River Junction, South Africa, Monday Dec 15, 2008. The center, partly funded by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supports the development of a community-based palliative care unit which provides care, education and training for staff and community caregivers, volunteer counseling and testing facilities. Meanwhile in Paris, HIV/AIDS specialists from around the globe gathered for the 2017 Biennial World Conference. Experts trumpeted global strides in curbing the HIV/AIDS epidemic but worried that HIV could once again flourish around the world if the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to HIV research and treatment in the world's poorest countries come to fruition. ""As we gather today, the largest and most important donor in HIV response has threatened devastating cuts to funding for research and treatment programs,"" said Linda Bekker, president of the International AIDS Society, who addressed the conference on Sunday. ""These onslaughts on funding, principles and programs have already begun to erode the gains we have so painstakingly made."" The optimism expressed by Birx, the U.S. ambassador, is at odds with the uncomfortable reality of Trump's budget proposal. His administration would uproot a public health initiative that has saved millions of lives and provided hope to HIV/AIDS patients around the world. Mr. Trump's 2018 budget not only slashes PEPFAR by 17 percent -- from $4.6 billion to $3.8 billion -- it cuts global health programs overall by $2 billion. It also downsizes the National Institute of Health's National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which funds HIV/AIDS research, by 23 percent. Overall, the budget of the National Institutes of Health would be cut by $6 billion by the White House. Experts like Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations,?project a grim future as a result. Garrett fears ""a massive second global wave of AIDS will come, perhaps within the next 10 years,"" as new drug-resistant mutations of the disease arise and financial resources dwindle. While President Trump wrapped up his overseas trip to Paris, lawmakers on Capitol Hill were busy working on the 2018 budget, a Russia sanctions b... But last week, the House Appropriations Committee approved of a State and Foreign Operations Budget and a Health and Human Services budget that rejected much of Mr. Trump's vision. As Republicans in the White House and Congress clash over a total of $203 billion in proposed administration cuts over the next 10 years, it's possible that funding for both PEPFAR and the NIH, which have historically seen bipartisan support, could be restored in the congressional budget. ""[White House Budget Director Mick] Mulvaney declared this was a hardline budget, but saving lives around the world is a hardline issue,"" Dr. Jack Chow, the former ambassador and special representative on global HIV/AIDS under President George w. Bush, told CBS News. ""It's life or death. What's more hardline than that?"" While Mr. Trump's budget explicitly says that it ""reduces funding for several global health program, including HIV/AIDS, with the expectation that other donors can and should increase their commitments,"" Dr. Birx described Mr. Trump's overall approach towards public health as ""results, outcomes and impact focused."" Birx said the programs needed more scrutiny. ""Can we draw a straight line from taxpayers in Iowa from the countries and individuals we are serving?"" she said in an interview with CBS News. Birx said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed his commitment to PEPFAR during his budget and confirmation hearings and pointed to Vice President Mike Pence's support for PEPFAR in 2003 when the program was created. Pence also supported its reauthorization in 2008. ""It must be galling on the one hand to have the good news on the amazing impact that PEPFAR is having in some of the hardest hit countries, yet having this good news obscured by the budget scenario,"" said Richard Downie, the acting director of the Center for Strategic International Studies' Africa Program. ""So I imagine Ambassador Brix is putting a positive slant on this."" ""PEPFAR is already a very lean organization and I doubt there are many more efficiencies to be squeezed out of the program that would offset the kinds of cuts Trump is proposing,"" Downie added. But Birx, who was first appointed by President Barack Obama, downplayed the budget cuts by touting PEPFAR's self-sustaining infrastructure that has been developed over the past 14 years: supply chains, community access, databases and clinics that now exist. ""The exact same things for you need for healthy populations going forward,"" she said. ""I think we have to recognize that the U.S. government has invested almost $70 billion over the last 14 years,"" Birx said. But Downie said a cure is certainly not achievable in the future without continued investment. He credits PEPFAR for investments since its inception but says it's na?ve to expect to walk away from some of the poorest countries on Earth without there being some impact on people living with HIV. ""These are very tricky diseases that are constantly mutating and changing and if you let your foot off the gas for one moment, they can outpace you once again,"" Downie said.

"President Trump assured reporters that the Trump White House ""will handle"" the North Korean crisis, an issue he says he inherited from his predecessors.? ""We have a lot of tremendous things going on. We have some interesting situations we'll handle -- North Korea, Middle East, lots of problems we inherited from previous administrations -- we'll take of them, well take of them very well,"" he said. ? When pressed further on how exactly he would ""take care"" of the North Koreans, he told reporters, ""We'll handle North Korea, we'll be able to handle North Korea, it will be handled, we handle everything."" The North launched a intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), its second successful test of this type of long-range missile, late Friday night.? North Korea's first ICBM test was conducted on July 4. Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, described that test to CBS News as a ""game changer"" because Kim Jong Un is ""basically saying to President Trump 'come at me.'"" As the U.S. assesses its next steps, officials are facing the fact that, in many ways, they are too late. An unstable and unpredictable regime has developed its nuclear missile technology faster than anticipated, and President Trump has limited options, CBS News correspondent Julianna Goldman noted. Analysts say Friday's launch proves that North Korea could be capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, including Los Angeles and possibly Chicago, New York and close to Washington, D.C.? In response, the U.S. conducted a missile defense test Sunday using a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in Alaska, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said in a statement. Sunday's test marked the 15th successful intercept out of 15 THAAD tests, and it was carried out to collect ""threat data"" from an interceptor, the MDA said. The president expressed his frustration over the recent developments, tweeting on Saturday night that he was ""disappointed"" in China, and that country does ""NOTHING for us"" when it comes to?North Korea. He complained about the trade imbalance between the U.S. and China, which is the largest trade deficit the U.S. has with any country with which it trades. ""I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet... they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. The tweets marked the latest case of Mr. Trump urging Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more regarding North Korea.? When asked about his relationship with Xi at a press conference with French President Emannuel Macron earlier this month, Mr. Trump called Xi ""a friend,"" but added, ""We asked him for some assistance with respect to North Korea. Probably he could do a little bit more but we'll find out."" ? China?has countered that it shouldn't be held responsible for solving the nuclear standoff with North Korea, and that it doesn't hold the key to resolving the issue. On Sunday, the Chinese Mission to the U.N. said in a statement to CBS News that China ""is concerned about the current developments."" It added that North Korea should ""abide by the relevant resolutions of the [United Nations] Security Council and stop taking action that could lead to further escalation of the situation on the peninsula.""

"President Trump praised Gen. John Kelly as he was sworn in to be the new White House chief of staff, declaring that he'll do a ""spectacular job."" The former Homeland Security secretary fills the vacancy left by Reince Priebus, who was forced out last week. A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle ""What he's done in terms of homeland is record shattering,"" said Mr. Trump, continuing to lavish praise on his new chief of staff. ""We look forward to, if its possible, an even better job as chief of staff."" The president went on to applaud the ""records shattered"" within his administration, saying ""business spirit is the highest it's ever been, according to polls."" ""We're doing very well, we have a tremendous base, we have a tremendous group of support. The country is optimistic. And I think the general would just add to it,"" he said. Following their meeting, Kelly attended his first cabinet meeting as chief of staff, in what Mr. Trump referred to as ""the boardroom."" He predicted Kelly would go down as ""one of the greats"" in the history of chiefs of staff.? Mr. Trump made the announcement of his new hire on Twitter last last week, calling Kelly a ""Great American and a Great leader"" and saying he he has been a ""true star"" of the Trump administration.? I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American.... ...and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration Priebus released a statement shortly after the announcement, saying ?""It has been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve this president and our country."" He added, ""I want to thank the president for giving me this very special opportunity.? I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the president's agenda and policies. I can't think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God's blessings and great success."" The announcement that Kelly would take the job was applauded by many in the political world, who hailed the former Marine Corps general's leadership skills as an asset for the new role. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that she felt Kelly could be instrumental in the administration's fight against North Korea's nuclear provocations. ? It is unclear who will be replacing Kelly at DHS. For now, Elaine Duke, the deputy DHS secretary, has been named acting DHS secretary. The most recent shakeup came soon after White House press secretary Sean Spicer announced his resignation, a result of the naming of Anthony Scaramucci to be communications director. Late last week, Scaramucci lambasted Priebus in an conversation with the New Yorker's Ryan Lizza.??

"A proposed law that would require carmakers to build alarms for back seats is being pushed by child advocates who say it will prevent kids from dying in hot cars. The law also would streamline the criminal process against caregivers who cause the deaths - cases that can be inconsistent but often heavier-handed against mothers. The latest deaths came in Arizona on triple-digit degree days over the weekend, with two baby boys found forgotten in vehicles in separate incidents. More than two dozen child and road safety groups are backing the U.S. Senate bill introduced last week aimed at preventing those kinds of deaths by requiring cars to be equipped with technology that can alert drivers if a child is left in the back seat once the vehicle is turned off. It could be a motion sensor that can detect a baby left sitting in a rear-facing car seat and then alert the driver, in a similar way that reminders about tire pressure, open doors and seat belts now come standard in cars. Daniel Mitchell, 18, drove into a parking lot in Suisun City, Calif., on Monday, removed a car seat holding his newborn and placed it on the grou... ""The technology would help because if you're in a vehicle, your child is in the back seat, and you ignore that alarm: Go to jail. Do not pass go. You had a chance,"" said Janette Fennell of the advocacy group KidsAndCars.org. ""You talk to any of the judges, they'll tell you, they're beyond the hardest things they have to deal with."" Police say 1-year-old Josiah Riggins was in the car for hours Saturday, discovered dead only after his father drove roundtrip, twice, between their suburban home and a Phoenix church to drop off the mother and a sibling. Zane Endress, who was 7 months old, died Friday in Phoenix after being left in the car in the driveway at home, as his usual daycare drop-off routine was lost by his grandparents. He may be only 11 years old, but Bishop Curry is already working on a solution to a major problem plaguing the country: the tragic deaths of youn... ""A simple sensor could save the lives of dozens of children killed tragically in overheated cars each year, and our bill would ensure such technology is available in every car sold in the United States,"" bill sponsor Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said in a statement. ""It can take mere minutes on a hot day for a car to turn into a deathtrap for a small child."" The Phoenix Fire Department said these are some of the most difficult calls to go on, CBS affiliate KPHO-TV reports. ""When you see a lifeless infant still in a car seat and you say to yourself, 'That family tried to do everything right,'"" Phoenix Fire Capt. Rob McDade said. ""They were in the car seat, they're working two jobs probably, grandma, grandpa's helping out, aunt, uncle. It just breaks your heart."" ? No charges have been filed against the caregivers in either Arizona case, as police say the death investigations are underway. Detectives will determine criminality based on the caregiver's neglect, intent and mindset, while also being sensitive to the family's deeply felt loss of a child, Phoenix police Sgt. Mercedes Fortune said. ""Those are the very difficult questions. Each case is different. I can't tell you there's a set answer for any case because there really isn't,"" Fortune said. KidsAndCars.org, which has tracked more than 800 children who have died in this way since 1990, said criminal cases vary greatly, even when the circumstances are identical. Fennell said 90 percent of cases involve pure accidents, most likely a child forgotten by an adult. A 7-month-old boy died after being left in a hot car in a Phoenix driveway on July 28, 2017. In this month alone, a Tennessee couple was charged in the death of their 11-month-old daughter. A nearly 2-year-old boy was found dead in his father's BMW in south Florida. The nonprofit's analysis shows charges are filed about half of the time, though very rarely are the parents found guilty objectively because it was proven that the child was left behind to be harmed. There is also a noted gender bias: Mothers are more often charged than fathers, and among the convicted, women caregivers receive longer prison sentences than men, the study found. ""It's also a defense mechanism. If I make monsters out of these people, then it could never happen to me,"" Fennell said.

"Sen. Jeff Flake said Monday that the Senate rules should not be changed to eliminate the filibuster, or 60-vote threshold for most legislation, as President Trump has called for. In an interview on ""CBS This Morning,"" the Arizona Republican was asked if the Senate was likely to make that happen. ""No, and it shouldn't,"" Flake said. ""That would be a mistake. We are at our best in the Senate when we work across the aisle."" Flake said that Obamacare was pushed through by one party, and Republicans are struggling to repeal it. ""I don't want to lurch back and forth every couple of years from one extreme to the other,"" he said. ""Those rules are there for a reason. They're good. ... They invite us to work across the aisle."" Mr. Trump called again on Saturday to end the filibuster. This came a few days after the Senate failed to pass a ""skinny repeal"" of Obamacare through budget reconciliation, a process which meant it only required 51 votes to pass. However, it received support from just 49 GOP senators. The 60-vote threshold applies to most other legislation in order to advance it to a final vote. When the president has called for the elimination of the filibuster in the past, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has made clear that that won't be happening. Flake, who's up for re-election next year, said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday that the Republican Party has lost its way. He described some of the president's policies as not reflecting conservative values. ""I do think some things that he has done has been conservative. I think he appointed a great Supreme Court justice... regulatory policy that he has embraced is conservative... his instincts on tax policy, I think, are conservative,"" Flake said. ""But some things are profoundly un-conservative."" The president's ""protectionist attitude"" toward free trade and isolationism, Flake said, are ""not conservative."" Asked if he thinks the president will back his bid for re-election, Flake said it's up to him. ""Obviously, we have 52 senators. We have a small majority. I think we've reached about the limits of what we can do just with our small majority,"" he admitted. He then seemed to take a veiled shot at the president for not helping to facilitate bipartisan efforts. ""That's not going to happen if you refer to the other party as my enemies or losers or clowns,"" said Flake, who is out with a new book, ""Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle.""

"Last Updated Aug 1, 2017 10:48 PM EDT Republican-aligned advocacy group American Action Network (AAN) is launching a campaign Monday to promote the need for pro-growth tax reform and highlight problems with the current tax code. The group says it will work to educate Americans about the benefits of tax reform, which is another top priority for congressional Republicans and the White House. With the House gone on its August recess and the Senate to soon follow, AAN will spend $5 million on the initiative in August. It's kicking off the effort with a $1 million ad campaign in 34 congressional districts.? The group wants to keep pressure on GOP lawmakers to make sure they continue pursuing an overhaul of the tax code when they return to Capitol Hill. ""America's tax code is hurting you. It's outdated. It's complicated. And it's unfair. Every year, thousands of American jobs are shipped to places like China. Billions of dollars that could have built new factories and created jobs in America＃ are siphoned off overseas. And every day 每 working families are under attack. America's tax code is sabotaging our economy,"" says the 60-second ad. It's an effort that's been embraced by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who tweeted his praise of the campaign Tuesday. He said that he was ""pleased for such allies"" like AAN and said he was encouraged by the launch of its Middle Class Growth Initiative. Ryan has long championed reforming tha nation's tax code. My statement on @AAN's launch of the Middle Class Growth Initiative | https://t.co/61TSuTnnH6 #GrowthForAll pic.twitter.com/WeNF2qfHzj Different versions of the ad then go on to target key members of Congress by name. For example, New Jersey audiences may see messages singling out Rep. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey, a moderate member of the House Republican Conference. ""But things, are about to change, Congressman Leonard Lance is fighting to cut taxes and make America's tax code simpler, fairer, and pro-growth, Encouraging investment and job creation here, So America's working families see better jobs and higher paychecks.

"Millennials and Generation Xers outvoted baby boomers and older generations in the 2016 election, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by the Pew Research Center. In the election, millennials and Generation Xers cast 69.6 million votes, which is a slight majority of the 137.5 million votes cast nationwide, the analysis found. Baby boomers and older voters, meanwhile, cast 67.9 million votes. Millennials were ages 18 to 35 last year and accounted for 25 percent of the vote while Gen Xers were 36 to 51 last year and accounted for 26 percent of the vote. The younger age group of the two cohorts cast 34 million votes last year, which is up from 18.4 million that the age group cast in 2008. While Gen Xers slightly outvoted millennials in 2016, Pew says the millennial vote could surpass the older group in the 2020 presidential election. Pew says that the baby boomer vote peaked in the 2004 presidential election with 50.1 million votes.?

"MILWAUKEE -- Another ballpark brouhaha for Chris Christie. Carrying a basket of nachos, the New Jersey governor was caught on video confronting a Chicago Cubs fan during Sunday's game against the Milwaukee Brewers. The video circulating on Twitter showed Christie leaning over to nearly get in the man's face at Miller Park, holding the order of nachos in his left hand. At #Cubs #Brewers game. #ChrisChristie was getting razzed by fans, so he got in the face of one of them. 5:30 on @WISN12News pic.twitter.com/sx8euMgFy2 ""You're a big shot,"" Christie says before walking down the stairs. It was not known what caused the tiff. Christie was loudly booed on July 18 at Citi Field in New York after snagging a foul ball during a game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Mets. Last month, Christie also feuded with a constituent who called into the sports radio show that the governor was guest-hosting. Christie was in Milwaukee this weekend to watch the Brewers and Cubs, and was at Friday night's series opener. His son, Andrew, works in the Brewers' baseball operations department. On Thursday, Christie said public outcry over his decision to?lounge with his family on a public beach that was closed?during New Jersey's government shutdown ""upset"" his children more than anything else since he's been in office. Christie was photographed over the Fourth of July weekend by NJ.com at Island Beach State Park, where the state provides a summer home to the governor. Christie ordered the shutdown of nonessential state government, including state beaches and parks, amid a budget impasse.

"Oh yes. Mr. Trump has been quite public with his criticisms over the past few weeks. He has been upset with Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and the subsequent naming of a special counsel to take over the CIA probe. At the same time, the Republican-controlled Senate has made it quite clear that they want Sessions to stay, with Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley saying there's no way they'll confirm a replacement. Everybody in D.C. Shld b warned that the agenda for the judiciary Comm is set for rest of 2017. Judges first subcabinet 2nd / AG no way A couple of reasons. The first is that Sessions was popular with his colleagues in the Senate before he left for the Trump administration. He's well-liked, even among those who disagree with him. The second and more important reason is that firing Sessions would likely be a prelude to the firing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the former FBI director tasked with investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Because Sessions recused himself from the investigation, it means he can't fire Mueller, but a new attorney general could. The conventional wisdom in Washington supposes that this is the real reason Mr. Trump seems so anxious to get Sessions out of the way. A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle If Mr. Trump replaces Sessions with someone who fires Mueller, it could provoke a constitutional crisis, which the Senate appears anxious to avoid. So, for the moment at least, it looks like they're more than willing to stand up to Mr. Trump. He'd need to get a new attorney general, one Grassley says the Senate won't confirm. That means that the man who appointed Mueller in the first place, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, would become acting attorney general. This doesn't really solve any of Mr. Trump's problems, however, as it is essentially impossible to imagine Rosenstein ever fires Mueller. Here's where it gets a little tricky. Presidents typically can and do make recess appointment when Congress is not in session. This is a way for the executive branch to fill vacancies, such as those created by firings, without consulting with the legislature. The Senate will be in recess in August, which in theory means that Mr. Trump could fire Sessions and appoint someone new while all the senators are out of town. This recess appointment would last only until the new congressional term begins in January, at which point the new attorney general to be confirmed. But that's long enough for the Sessions replacement to fire Mueller. The thing is, though, Congress knows a way to block such appointments. By holding what are called pro forma sessions during the recess. Basically, it works like this: The senators all still leave town, but every three days or so someone shows up to say that Congress is still in session. So even though Congress isn't really doing anything, it is legally not in recess, meaning the president can't make a recess appointment. Pro forma sessions are the reason there have been no recess appointments since 2012. They don't need to be announced much in advance, as all the Senate leadership needs to do is schedule the sessions. A pro forma session usually lasts only a matter of minutes 每 they just gavel in and gavel out, once they figure out who's in Washington to do the honors. They typically happen every three days of the recess because the Constitution states that neither house of Congress can go on break for more than three days without the consent of the other. Presumably, yes, as the Senate has stayed in pro forma session in the most recent recesses, such as Memorial Day and the 4th of July. That means that Mr. Trump won't get to make his recess appointment, and that he's stuck with Sessions for the foreseeable future. It also means that recess appointments are well on their way to becoming relics.?																																																																																																																					"
"WASHINGTON --?The White House stepped up demands Sunday for revived congressional efforts on health care and suggested senators cancel their entire summer break, if needed, to pass legislation after failed votes last week. Aides said President Trump is prepared in the coming days to end required payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act as part of a bid to let ""Obamacare implode"" and force the Senate to act. It was all part of a weekend flurry of Trump tweets and other statements insisting the seven-year GOP quest to repeal former President Obama's signature legislative achievement was not over. ""The president will not accept those who said it's, quote, 'Time to move on,'"" White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said. Those were the words used by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., after the early Friday morning defeat of the GOP proposal. Ruth Marcus, Ben Domenech, David Nakamura, and Nancy Cordes discuss the failed health care bill and where it could go from here. Conway said Mr. Trump was deciding whether to act on his threat to end cost-sharing reduction payments, which are aimed at trimming out-of-pocket costs for lower-income people. ""He's going to make that decision this week, and that's a decision that only he can make,"" Conway said. For seven years, Republicans have promised that once they took power, they would scrap Obama's overhaul and pass a replacement. But that effort crashed most recently in the Senate Friday, and that's when McConnell said it was time to focus on other policy matters. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate, where no Democrats voted for the GOP bill and three Republicans defected in the final vote Friday. One of the GOP defectors, Sen. John McCain, has since returned to Arizona for treatment for brain cancer. ""Don't give up Republican senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace,"" Mr. Trump said in a tweet. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, when asked Sunday if no other legislative business should be taken up until the Senate acts again on health care, responded ""yes."" Chief political correspondent at Slate and CBS News political contributor Jamelle Bouie joins ""CBS This Morning: Saturday"" from Washington to dis... While the House has begun a five-week recess, the Senate is scheduled to work two more weeks before a summer break. McConnell has said the unfinished business includes addressing a backlog of executive and judicial nominations, coming ahead of a busy agenda in September that involves passing a defense spending bill and raising the government's borrowing limit. ""In the White House's view, they can't move on in the Senate,"" Mulvaney said, referring to health legislation. ""They need to stay, they need to work, they need to pass something."" Mr. Trump warned over the weekend that he would end federal subsidies for health care insurance for Congress and the rest of the country if the Senate didn't act soon. He was referring in part to a federal contribution for lawmakers and their staffs, who were moved onto Obamacare insurance exchanges as part of the 2010 law. ""If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!"" Mr. Trump tweeted. The subsidies, totaling about $7 billion a year, help reduce deductibles and copayments for consumers with modest incomes. The Obama administration used its rule-making authority to set direct payments to insurers to help offset these costs. Mr. Trump inherited the payment structure, but he also has the power to end them. The payments are the subject of a lawsuit brought by House Republicans over whether the health law specifically included a congressional appropriation for the money, as required under the Constitution. Mr. Trump has only guaranteed the payments through July, which ends Monday. While most Americans were sleeping, the 7-year Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare died on the floor of the Senate. GOP Sens. John ... A new CBS Nation Tracker poll found 47 percent of Americans prefer a bipartisan approach to fix Obamacare over a full repeal. While 62 percent disapprove of how the Mr. Trump is handling the issue. The poll also found more than half of respondents describe Mr. Trump's presidency as ""chaotic."" Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, one of the three Republican senators who voted against the GOP health bill on Friday, said she's troubled by Mr. Trump's claims that the insurance payments are a ""bailout."" She said Mr. Trump's threat to cut off payments would not change her opposition to the GOP health bill and stressed the cost-sharing reduction payments were critical to make insurance more affordable for low-income people. ""The uncertainty about whether that subsidy is going to continue from month to month is clearly contributing to the destabilization of the insurance markets, and that's one thing that Congress needs to end,"" said Collins, who wants lawmakers to appropriate money for the payments. ""I certainly hope the administration does not do anything in the meantime to hasten that collapse,"" she added. Mr. Trump previously said the law that he and others call ""Obamacare"" would collapse immediately whenever those payments stop. He has indicated a desire to halt the subsidies but so far has allowed them to continue on a month-to-month basis. Conway spoke on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Mulvaney appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" and Collins was on CNN as well as NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

The vice president and his wife, Karen Pence, arrived in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, to kick off the European tour that also includes stops in Georgia and Montenegro. Pence is scheduled to meet with the leaders of the Baltics - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - on Monday.

President Trump said Friday that the U.S backed NATO Article 5 and thanked the Romanian leader for fighting alongside American troops in Afghanis... In a press pool interview, Pence said he was sent to Europe by President Donald Trump ""with a very simple message."" ""That is that 'America First' doesn't mean 'America Alone,'"" Pence told Fox News. ""Our message to the Baltic states 〞 my message when we visit Georgia and Montenegro〞 will be the same: to our allies here in Eastern Europe, we are with you."" Later Sunday, he held talks with Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas. Issues included Estonia's current holding of the European Union presidency, trade, cybersecurity and the continuing tensions in the Baltic Sea region, where Russia and NATO have increased their military presence in recent years. ""NATO's collective position of deterrence and defense has strengthened in the Baltic region and the U.S.A. is indispensable to ensuring the security of our immediate neighborhood, as well as all of Europe,"" Ratas said in a statement. Ratas told Estonian broadcaster ERR he also brought up the possible deployment of Patriot surface-to-air missiles in his country. Lithuania also has said it would be eager to have the missiles in its territory. The U.S. military displayed Patriot missiles in Lithuania earlier this month after having used them in an exercise there. Poor anti-aircraft defense is seen by experts as the weakest link for NATO in the Baltics.

"The White House said late Friday that President Trump will sign legislation that strengthens sanctions against Russia and will allow Congress to block him from easing the penalties. In a statement, the White House said Mr. Trump had ""read early drafts of the bill and negotiated regarding critical elements of it."" Having read the latest version, the White House said Mr. Trump intends to sign it.? The bill also imposes sanctions against Iran and North Korea. The Senate passed the bill, 98-2, two days after the House pushed the measure through by an overwhelming margin, 419-3. Both were veto-proof numbers.But the White House had objected to a key section of the bill that would mandate a congressional review if Trump attempted to ease or end the sanctions against Moscow. The bill had somewhat put Mr. Trump in a corner, since the congressional review had been put in the bill due to a weariness from both sides of the aisle about Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.? The legislation is aimed at punishing Moscow for interfering in the 2016 presidential election and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria, where the Kremlin has backed President Bashar Assad. It also imposes financial sanctions against Iran and North Korea.? Before Trump's decision to sign the bill into law, Sen. John McCain, (R-Ariz.), said the bill's passage was long overdue, a jab at Mr. Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress. McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has called Putin a murderer and a thug. ""Over the last eight months what price has Russia paid for attacking our elections?"" McCain asked. ""Very little."" Earlier Friday, Russia's foreign ministry said it would require the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia to be reduced by September 1. The statement also said that if the United States further reduced the number of Russian diplomatic staff currently allowed in the U.S., Russia would mirror that action.?

"The Senate's middle-of-the-night vote that killed Republicans' plan to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act was, political observers say, one of the most dramatic legislative moments in recent history.? Normally, with a bill of this magnitude, people have a pretty clear idea once voting starts whether the party in power has enough votes, says CBS News chief congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes. That wasn't the case this time, and ""you could see from their body language that senators on the floor themselves didn't know where things stood,"" Cordes said.? In the moments leading up to the vote on the Health Care Freedom Act, senators sat and stood around the Senate floor, waiting for colleagues to make up their minds -- or persuade other colleagues to change theirs. Vice President Mike Pence worked to persuade Sen. John McCain to vote in favor of the measure, with many eyes on both of them.?

GOP Sens. John ... The vote on an amendment to send the bill back to committee, set to take place before the main vote, lasted roughly an hour. But that had nothing to do with the vote on the amendment, which easily failed.? McCain arrived on the floor shortly after midnight, and reporters began noticing his lengthy conversation with Pence. Their conversation lasted what seemed like forever to observers -- and the length indicated that perhaps Pence was still trying to persuade the Arizona Republican to vote in favor of the bill. Speculation grew when, after that, McCain walked over to talk to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats. McCain appeared to be getting along well with them, fueling speculation that he might?oppose the bill.? Finally, after more than an hour of waiting, the voting began.

Some Republicans -- including, seemingly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) -- were shocked.? But McCain's was only the first ""no"" vote, and his disapproval didn't necessarily kill the bill. So, the waiting continued, even though the bill appeared dead with McCain's vote. Sen.

With no stated alternative path to reforming health care, Republicans' months-long effort to repeal and replace Obamacare appeared dead, too.? The ""no"" votes from Collins and Murkowski were less of a surprise than McCain's, since they both opposed a motion to proceed on health care legislation earlier in the week.? Schumer choked up when he began talking about McCain, who was diagnosed with brain cancer. The two have served in the Senate together since Schumer was elected in 1998. He also acknowledged that the current law needs to be fixed, and he hopes to work with Republicans to do that.? ""I would say to my dear friend the majority leader, we are not celebrating,"" Schumer said. ""We are relieved."" McConnell called the vote ""disappointing."" ""This is clearly a disappointing moment,"" said McConnell, who appeared upset after weeks if not months of controversy over health care in the Senate.?

"President Donald Trump will nominate Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback to serve as ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom. If confirmed by the Senate, he'll run the State Department's Office of International Religious Freedom. Brownback is a former U.S. senator and representative. The White House said in a statement announcing his nomination, while serving as a member of the Senate, Brownback ""worked actively on the issue of religious freedom in multiple countries and was a key sponsor of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998."" Brownback's office isn't saying when he plans to leave office.?

But Kansas Republican Party Chairman Kelly Arnold said Wednesday he would expect Brownback to resign as governor once he's confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Arnold said that would likely be in the fall. Brownback's departure would elevate Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer to governor. The chairman of the Kansas Republican Party says Gov. Sam Brownback will be remembered as a governor who advanced conservative goals on abortion, gun rights and tax cuts. But a top Democrat says Brownback will be thought of as an unpopular governor who engineered a failed tax-cutting experiment. Kansas Senate Democratic Leader Anthony Hensley of Topeka says Brownback's legacy will be the budget problems caused by income tax cuts the governor advocated. But state GOP Chairman Kelly Arnold says no one will know how well the tax cuts would have worked because lawmakers rolled them back this year over Brownback's veto.

"Last Updated Jul 27, 2017 7:23 AM EDT The first meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Border Mayors Association since Donald Trump became president of the United States begins Thursday as the stakes of debate in Washington could hardly be higher for the region of 12 million people stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. Trump is moving ahead with plans to build a ""big, beautiful wall"" separating the two countries and add 5,000 Border Patrol agents, despite uncertainty about how much Congress will agree to pay. The U.S., Mexico and Canada are preparing to overhaul the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, one of Trump's favorite punching bags. As with other border gatherings of mayors and governors, one challenge was getting enough elected officials to attend. This year's hosts, Mayor Kevin Faulconer of San Diego and Juan Manuel Gastelum of Tijuana, Mexico, ensure that two of the region's largest cities are represented. Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, will be there, as will McAllen, Texas. El Paso Mayor Dee Margo won't attend because he will be in the state capital for meetings with the governor and legislators, said spokeswoman Olivia Zepeda. Pete Saenz, mayor of Laredo, Texas, needed to tend to city affairs after two weeks of business travel, said spokeswoman Blasita Lopez. Absent mayors from Mexico include the leaders of Mexicali, Nogales and Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros. Border mayors generally advocate for robust trade between the two countries and expanded international crossings to ease the flow of goods and people. They have given a cold shoulder to Trump's wall. Panels at the two-day gathering 〞 the group's fifth since 2011 〞 will cover Nafta, infrastructure, the state of U.S.-Mexico relations, public health and urban development. The mayors will work on a joint resolution on bilateral trade. ""Border mayors and governors have struggled over the years to create and sustain forums in which they can get to know each other and work together on a common agenda,"" said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute in Washington. The group's rotating venues may prove more challenging for small-city hosts who have more limited budgets and resources. ""Right now the border mayors association is a great idea with enough energy to get a meeting off the ground but without a structure,"" Wilson said. ""They need some glue to the organization."" The Border Governors Conference, which dates back to the 1980s, has been moribund for several years. In 2010, then-Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer canceled a Phoenix event after Mexico's border governors boycotted because she signed a tough law against illegal immigration. The New Mexico governor at the time, Bill Richardson, convened a meeting in Santa Fe, but he was the only one of four U.S. border governors to show. New Mexico was also the only U.S. presence the following year.																																																																																																																					"
"A former U.S. naval combat-tested officer said she feels angry that President Donald Trump is saying transgender veterans like her should be considered unfit to serve. Another transgender service member said he will not be kicked out without a fight. Transgender veterans and active-duty troops spoke Wednesday about Trump's Twitter pronouncement banning transgender people from military service. Here are their stories: _____ OFFENSIVE TO MILITARY VALUES President Donald Trump stunned the political world and many prominent Christian conservatives by announcing plans to ban transgender people from the military. Paula M. Neira, who left the Navy in 1991 and transitioned to female after leaving active duty, said she was angry at Trump's announcement. It brought up bad memories for the naval officer, who served on Sept. 11, 2001. She said the commander in chief is sending the message that the country does not want transgender troops. ""Nobody who is willing to volunteer to defend our country should ever be told that they're not fit because of other people's prejudice, and not because of any military necessity,"" she said. _____ VOWING TO FIGHT Rudy Akbarian, 26, said he will not leave the armed forces without a fight. ""I'm just serving as a soldier just like anybody else,"" Akbarian said. His chain-of-command was supportive of him as he transitioned from female to male. ""Everybody is hurt. Everybody is scared,"" he said. ""This is people's lives we're talking about. People who enlisted nearly 20 years ago and now 18 or 19 years in, now that's being taken away and they don't get to retire?"" _____ 'HEARTBREAK' Alaina Kupec, a Navy intelligence officer from 1992 until 1995, said she felt ""heartbreak"" after she heard about Trump's tweet. The 48-year-old transitioned to life as a woman in 2013. ""It just really saddened me for the transgender sailors and soldiers who are serving around the world today and are selflessly giving themselves to protect our country,"" said Kupec, who lives in Orange, New Jersey. _____ 'FORCED BACK INTO THE CLOSET' Air Force veteran Vanessa Sheridan said transgender people have always served in the military but now they are going to have to hide their identities if there is a new policy. ""My biggest concern now is going to be that transgender people are going to be forced back into the closet,"" said Sheridan, who is director of transgender relations and community engagement at Center on Halsted in Chicago. _____ 'FIRED BY TWEET' Capt. Jacob Eleazer, 31, who serves in the Kentucky Army National Guard, took the day off from his job as a therapist in Lexington to figure out the situation. ""Fired by tweet. It was honestly pretty shocking,"" he said. _____ FEAR OF THE FUTURE Combat veteran Shane Ortega, a transgender man in Los Angeles who served in the Army and Marines for more than a decade, said troops who are forced out may get a bad conduct discharge for being transgender, jeopardizing their VA benefits and future. ""That's the equivalent of being a convicted felon in American society,"" said Ortega, 30, who transitioned to a male in 2009, seven years before leaving the military after serving multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""They will not get gainful employment."" _____ 'PEOPLE KNOW WHO WE ARE NOW' Blake Dremann, a transgender, active-duty Navy lieutenant commander in Washington, said he will continue to serve ""regardless of what was said today."" ""Trans service members are continuing to do our jobs,"" said Dremann 36, president of SPARTA a trans advocacy group. ""People know who we are now and it becomes personal, especially when you've got families that are going to be affected by this."" _____ WHAT MATTERS MOST Emma Shinn, 41, a transgender woman who served in the Marine Corps for 20 years before retiring in 2014, said it was incredibly stressful to work under the military's previous policy that banned LGBT service members. ""It creates a gulf between the service member and his or her fellow Marines,"" said Shinn, who lives in Castle Rock, Colorado.

Eight states will have only one insurance choice next year. Here are the top 5 moments from a historic night at the Capitol Kirkpatrick said she is not onboard with letting Obamacare explode, regardless of consequences. ""A lot of people will get hurt,"" she said.? Williams says Senate Republicans ""snatched defeat from the jaws of repeal."" ""Trump needs a legislative win,"" Williams said.

"Last Updated Jul 28, 2017 7:03 PM EDT President Trump's Friday Twitter announcement that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John Kelly will replace Reince Priebus as White House chief of staff left one major question unanswered: Who is in charge at DHS?? Kelly's departure will leave an immediate vacancy at the department. His last day will be Monday, July 31, at which point Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke will become acting secretary, DHS press secretary Dave Lapan said in a statement Friday. Duke was sworn in on April 10. Kelly's permanent replacement will require Senate confirmation.

House Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Bennie Thompson (D-Mississippi), told CBS News the president's decision was ""rushed."" ""Unfortunately, It is clear that this decision was rushed and not well thought out,"" Thompson said.

""It has been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve this president and our country,"" Priebus said. ""I want to thank the president for giving me this very special opportunity.? I will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the president's agenda and policies. I can't think of a better person than General John Kelly to succeed me and I wish him God's blessings and great success."" The Friday afternoon announcement comes after a week of turmoil in the White House, in which the president's new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, assailed Priebus in a profanity-laced interview with the New Yorker. Mr. Trump posted the tweets from Air Force One on his way back to the White House from New York. Both Priebus and Scaramucci accompanied him on the trip.? Asked by reporters if Priebus was fired, incoming White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, ""We all serve at the pleasure of the president."" Mr. Trump briefly addressed reporters as he departed Air Force One. ""Reince is a good man. John Kelly will do a fantastic job,"" Mr. Trump said. ""General Kelly has been a star. Done an incredible job thus far. Respected by everybody. Great, great American."" President Trump announced he was replacing Reince Priebus with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly as White House chief of staff. CBS News Whi... Priebus' departure, coming exactly one week after White House press secretary Sean Spicer announced his, is not necessarily a surprise. Priebus has had a diminished profile in the White House for weeks, and the president hasn't exactly expressed support for him. On Thursday, Sanders declined to tell reporters whether the president still had confidence in his chief of staff.? Priebus, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, was brought on in an effort to provide Washington know-how to a president with no experience holding public office. Other RNC allies brought aboard included Spicer and Kate Walsh, who became deputy White House chief of staff. Walsh is now gone, and Spicer is on his way out.? Priebus and Scaramucci have long been at odds. Scaramucci was reportedly angling for the chief of staff position before Mr. Trump took office, but Priebus was named instead. When Scaramucci joined the White House staff last week, it became clear that he would have some of the responsibilities and access normally designated only to the chief of staff. Scaramucci, in his first White House press briefing, said he would report to the president directly, rather than to Priebus, and said he had the authority to fire people.? Tensions between the two escalated in the last 48 hours, as Scaramucci all but accused Priebus of leaking his financial disclosure information to the press, then launched into the tirade against Priebus to the New Yorker reporter.? Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) released this statement after the announcement that Priebus is out: ""Reince Priebus has left it all out on the field, for our party and our country,"" the statement said. ""Here is a guy from Kenosha, Wisconsin who revitalized the Republican National Committee and became White House chief of staff. He has served the president and the American people capably and passionately. He has achieved so much, and he has done it all with class. I could not be more proud to call Reince a dear friend."" ""I congratulate Secretary Kelly on his appointment, and look forward to working with him to advance our agenda,"" Ryan added.? It's unclear who will replace Kelly as DHS secretary. That concerns House Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Bennie Thompson (D-MS), who told CBS News the president's decision was ""rushed"" and ""not well thought out."" ""Unfortunately, It is clear that this decision was rushed and not well thought out,"" Thompson said. ""The president and Republicans insisted the DHS Secretary be confirmed on day one but now the President leaves this critical national security cabinet post vacant. He must now quickly replace Secretary Kelly with someone experienced and measured who understands that homeland security is not a partisan issue.""? This is a developing story.?																																																																																																																					"
"Sen. John McCain is returning home to Arizona to begin radiation and chemotherapy treatment, following his decisive vote to block his party's attempt to repeal parts of Obamacare. The Arizona Republican will begin the treatment Monday at the Mayo Center in Phoenix, but keep his work schedule and plans to return after August recess, according to a Friday statement from his office. The 80-year-old senator was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, after doctors performed surgery on a blood clot above his left eye.? McCain's vote was critical in Republican's failure to pass a ""skinny repeal"" of Obamacare, as the bill failed by one vote in the 1 a.m. hour on Friday. McCain was one of only three GOP senators to vote against the measure -- the others were Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.? When reporters asked why he cast a ""no"" vote, McCain's response was simple: ""I thought it was the right thing to do."" A few hours after the middle-of-the-night vote, McCain was back to work in his office.? The prognosis for the type of cancer McCain has is grim, CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Angus told ""CBS This Morning"" last week.? ""Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of brain cancer,"" Angus said. ""Most people live about 14 and a half months."" John McCain, who is a six-term senator from Arizona, a 2008 presidential candidate and a Vietnam war hero, is now fighting the biggest battle of ... Colleagues on both sides of the aisle offered their overwhelming support of McCain after his diagnosis. McCain is seen as somewhat of an institution in the Senate, having arrived in 1987 in a different era of politics.? In a resounding speech on the Senate floor upon his return after the diagnosis last week, he urged his colleagues to work across the aisle and return to regular order in the Senate, arguably, something he did with his?vote early Friday.? ""What have we to lose by trying to work together to find those solutions? We're not getting much done apart,"" McCain said in his Senate floor speech last week. ""I don't think any of us feels very proud of our incapacity. Merely preventing your political opponents from doing what they want isn't the most inspiring work. There's greater satisfaction in respecting our differences, but not letting them prevent agreements that don't require abandonment of core principles, agreements made in good faith that help improve lives and protect the American people.""

"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump paints a rosy picture of an improved Department of Veterans Affairs under his watch where accessing electronic medical records is ""so easy and so good"" and health care is freely available without any delays. The problem: It's not true. At a campaign-style event in Ohio this week, Trump's claims of progress were so overstated that even his own VA secretary, David Shulkin - who stood right next to him - would have to disagree. ""Since my first day in office, we've taken one action after another to make sure that our veterans get the care they so richly deserve,"" Trump said. But the multibillion-dollar IT initiative Trump cites has yet to be even budgeted, and an alternative program of private-sector care he describes is running out of money and needs reauthorization by Congress. Government auditors and whistleblowers say problems of long wait times and shoddy care persist. Some VA improvements happened before Trump took office. A look at some of the claims in his Youngstown speech Tuesday: TRUMP: ""We've begun to process seamlessly transferring veterans' medical records. Horrible situation. You couldn't get your medical records. And now it's so easy and so good. And the system is fixed, finally, after all of these years."" THE FACTS: While Shulkin announced plans last month to overhaul electronic records by replacing VA's aging information technology system, the multiyear effort has barely even begun. Shulkin has yet to negotiate pricing for the no-bid contract with the company that designed the Pentagon's system. The costs of a new IT system are not accounted for in Trump's proposed 2018 budget. Shulkin says the new system, when it's complete, also will be used to schedule VA medical appointments. In a May 30 ""State of the VA"" address, Shulkin pointed to the VA's outmoded scheduling systems that would remain in place for several more years for excessive wait times for veterans. Under questioning by Congress, Shulkin acknowledged the added costs of the IT upgrade could be substantial, running between $4 billion and $16 billion. He says the change will be ""high risk"" with no guarantees of a smooth roll out. TRUMP: ""We have Choice. ... We have nearly doubled the number of veterans given approvals to see the doctor of their choice."" THE FACTS: He's exaggerating the progress on this front. Trump is referring to the VA's Choice program, which offers federally paid medical care outside the VA. Put in place after a 2014 wait-time scandal at the Phoenix VA, the program allows veterans to see outside doctors if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles to a VA facility. VA's approvals to veterans to use Choice have grown under Trump, but they haven't nearly doubled. Shulkin wrote in a USA Today editorial this week that outside care programs for the first half of the year increased 26 percent over the same period last year. Trump also glossed over Choice's financial woes. The VA had assured Congress that the program's money would last until early next year. But Shulkin last month admitted that Choice suddenly faced a shortfall and would run out of money by mid-August. He cited excessive authorizations and poor budget planning. Congress is now scrambling to provide billions in emergency money to fill the gap, or risk disruptions in veterans' care. TRUMP: ""We've published wait times at every VA facility. I used to go around and talk about the veterans and they'd stand on line for nine days, seven days, four days ... 15 days. People that could have been given a prescription and been better right away end up dying waiting on line. That's not happening anymore."" THE FACTS: Problems of delay or substandard care at some of the VA facilities have not disappeared. The VA did begin publishing data in April on wait times at VA medical centers. Planning for it started 18 months earlier, under the Obama administration. According to Shulkin's ""State of the VA"" report, the VA is ""still in critical condition,"" with veterans waiting more than 60 days for new appointments at about 30 VA facilities nationwide. He also says about 1 in 6 primary care clinics is over capacity, ""meaning veterans are not being seen soon enough."" On quality of care, the VA's inspector general issued urgent action reports in April and May, warning that patients at the Washington, D.C., VA medical center were being put at unnecessary risk of harm due to bad inventory practices, like potentially dirty syringes and medical supply shortages. The Boston Globe also reported this month that 11 physicians and medical employees alleged the Manchester VA Medical Center in New Hampshire was needlessly endangering patients. The report described a fly-infested operating room and surgical instruments that weren't always sterilized. Shulkin has since ordered top-down reviews and removed the medical directors in Manchester and Washington. TRUMP: ""We've delivered same-day mental health services at every VA medical center."" THE FACTS: This may be the case, but it happened before Trump took office. Shulkin, an Obama administration holdover, publicized the effort as VA's undersecretary of health in April 2016, before Trump was elected. By late 2016, the department's blog announced that the goal of providing same-day primary and mental-health care when medically necessary would be achieved at every VA medical center by year's end. A Dec. 23, 2016, article in the Harvard Business Review cites new same-day services at all VA hospitals as evidence of notable progress under former VA Secretary Bob McDonald ""and his team."" Shulkin told Congress in late January the services already were fully in place.																																																																																																																					"

"Last Updated Jul 28, 2017 2:58 PM EDT President Trump traveled to Suffolk County Friday to talk about his administration's?crackdown on illegal immigration and violent crime, While he's expected to call on Congress to provide more funding for these efforts, this was also the first time Mr. Trump spoke publicly following the failure of the Senate to pass a bill to repeal and replace the nation's health care law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). He strayed from the topic of illegal immigration and eradicating MS-13 gang violence to say briefly that Congress should have approved the health care repeal, ""But you can't have everything."" But he promised the crowd, ""We're going to get it done. We're going to get it done."" And he repeated the sentiment, ""Let Obamacare implode.""? The president vowed to destroy the ""vile"" cartel MS-13, which he called ""particularly violent."" He said that these gang members don't like shooting people because ""it's too quick and too fast.""? ""I was reading, one of these animals was caught, and explaining, they like to knife 'em and cut 'em and let them die slowly because that way it's more painful. And they enjoy watching that much more,"" the president said. ""These are animals."" And he also pointed out that the gang was responsible for 17 murders in Suffolk County since January. Mr. Trump also had some questionable arrest advice for police officers. ""When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in - rough - I said, 'Please don't be too nice.' Like when you guys put someone in the car and you're protecting their head [with your hand],..like don't hit their head, and they've just killed somebody....I said, 'you can take the hand away.'"" Mr. Trump promised again that the wall on the southern border would be built, and said $1.6 billion was approved for the start of construction of the wall. This is half-true -- the House?passed a bill with this funding?this week, but the Senate has not yet approved the funding. ""We'll build a good wall,"" he said, adding ""We're going to build a real wall,"" a wall ""that works."" It would be an additional tool to stop the inflow of drugs into our country, the president explained. Mr. Trump's speech Friday afternoon took place at Suffolk County Community College in Brentwood, New York, close to where the ultra-violent street gang MS-13?committed a string of gruesome murders, including the massacre of four young men in April in a Central Islip park. He spoke against a backdrop of uniformed police officers and addressed law enforcement officers and family members of crime victims.? The Trump administration Justice and Homeland Security Departments have made targeting the gang a top priority. Mr. Trump's embattled attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has directed federal prosecutors to prioritize the prosecution of these gang members. The administration blames the resurgence of MS-13 in some areas on illegal immigration, and it believes that cracking down on so-called ""sanctuary cities"" and building a wall on the southern border will eradicate the problem. Shortly before he left the White House for Long Island Friday, the president tweeted, ""We will always ENFORCE our laws, PROTECT our borders, and SUPPORT our police!"" Live updates below: ? ""As you know, I am the big big believer in people in law enforcement, from day one,"" Mr. Trump said, explaining why he had come to Long Island. Uniformed police officers are standing behind the president as he speaks. ""We love our police, we love our sheriffs, and we love our ICE officers,"" and they've been working hard, he said. Of the gang MS-13, the president said, ""We're going to destroy the vile criminal cartel MS-13,"" among others. MS-13 members, he said, are ""animals,"" who ""don't like shooting people because it's too quick."" State police from New York and New Jersey, immigration officers, and other federal agency workers were in the audience, Mr. Trump said. He also welcomed some of his political supporters to the speech, including Rep. Chris Collins, whom he praised for being an early supporter of his presidential candidacy. And he thanked Rep. Peter King, who introduced him. Mr. Trump interrupted his MS-13 and immigration comments to say of the Senate that they ""should have approved health care last night."" But, he said, ""You can't have everything."" He promised, ""We're going to get it done. We're going to get it done."" And he repeated the sentiment, ""Let Obamacare implode."" Cities that have ""pathetic mayor[s]"" or a mayor who ""doesn't know what's going on"" are seeing less progress, Mr. Trump suggested. He recalled his own upbringing on Long Island, which he noted, did not see violence like that wrought by MS-13. Since Jan. 13, MS-13 members have killed 17 people in this area, Mr. Trump said. MS-13 members ""stomp on their victims"" and ""slash them with machetes.""? ""They have transformed peaceful parks...into bloodstained killing fields"" he said. ""They're animals."" We will find you, arrest you, jail you and deport you, Mr. Trump said, addressing MS-13 members directly.? The president called on Congress to provide funding for ""hundreds more immigration judges if we're going to dismantle these deadly networks,"" he told the crowd. Mr. Trump promised again that the wall on the southern border would be built, and said $1.6 billion was approved for the start of construction of the wall. This is half-true -- the House passed a bill with this funding, but the Senate has not yet passed the spending bill. ""We'll build a good wall,"" he said, adding ""We're going to build a real wall,"" a wall ""that works.""? It's an additional tool to stop the inflow of drugs into our country, the president said. The previous administration, he claimed, welcomed illegal immigrants into the country, allowing MS-13 to flourish. ""It got worse and worse,"" but he said, ""We turned that back."" White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci and chief of staff Reince Priebus both traveled to New York with the president, a day after the New Yorker published a story in which Scaramucci says of Priebus, ""Reince is a f******* paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,"" and made other vulgar comments about Priebus and Steve Bannon? The pool reporter on Air Force One asked Scaramucci about the New Yorker comments, but he declined to comment, saying only, ""Come on, that was not fair. You know that was not fair.""

"Three Republican senators defeated their party's eleventh-hour plan early Friday morning to repeal Obamacare: John McCain, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. Around 1:30 a.m. ET, the so-called ""skinny repeal"" plan devised by Senate Republican leaders and whose text was released only three hours earlier, was rejected in a dramatic 49-51 vote. For weeks, Collins, who represents Maine, and Murkowski, who represents Alaska, had been opposed to, or were skeptical about, a number of proposals throughout the process, which culminated with a series of votes that began earlier this week when senators voted to open debate on the House-passed health care measure, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Since the upper chamber first took up health care this year in late June, Collins had opposed the original repeal and replace plan, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), as well as the amended version that failed in a vote on Tuesday of this week. She also rejected legislation Wednesday that resembled a bill she also voted against in 2015 that would have repealed Obamacare, but would have delayed it from taking effect for two years so Republicans could come up with a replacement plan. On Tuesday, she even voted against a motion to proceed to open debate on the bill as she had been pushing for bipartisan negotiations and to start over at the committee level. In a statement after the final vote early Friday, Collins said that while she supported components of the final plan and that many Americans are suffering under Obamacare, she said Republican leaders punted on many difficult questions. ""We need to reconsider our approach,"" she said. ""The ACA is flawed and in portions of the country is near collapse. Rather than engaging in partisan exercises, Republicans and Democrats should work together to address these very serious problems."" The Senate narrowly rejected the GOP's so-called ""skinny repeal"" of Obamacare. Sen. John McCain cast a dramatic and decisive ""no"" vote, shocking ... Murkowski, meanwhile, had been concerned from the beginning about the effect BCRA, the repeal and replace plan, would have on Alaska's Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. The repeal and replace plans that were considered would have rolled back the expansion and would have cut funding from the entitlement program. She voted with Collins and Democrats Tuesday against advancing to debate and the amendment process on health care. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke delivered a warning to Murkowski about her vote, which was that her vote put Alaska's relationship with the Trump administration in jeopardy. Another reason the two senators opposed the ""skinny repeal"" -- it would have eliminated funding for Planned Parenthood and similar providers, which both of them made clear they would oppose. McCain's plan, however, to ultimately defeat the party's final attempt at a repeal this week was not expected. He was absent from Capitol Hill last week because of his brain cancer diagnosis. When he returned on Tuesday, most assumed he came back to rescue Republicans. On Tuesday, he voted to open debate and on the modified repeal and replace plan. On Wednesday, he was one of seven Republicans who voted against the 2015 repeal bill. Then on Thursday evening, he and Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, suddenly held a press conference announcing that they would not vote for the ""skinny repeal"" unless Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, assured them that it would not become law, and would only be the means to open up a conference committee with the House. Behind the scenes, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, had been lobbying McCain every day since he returned, several times a day, according to a source familiar with their conversations. Schumer knew in advance of the vote that McCain would defect, the source said. McCain argued in a statement Friday that the bill would not lower costs, increase competition or improve care for Americans. And, he said, the statement issued by Speaker Ryan was not sufficient to ease his concerns about its becoming law. ""While the amendment would have repealed some of Obamacare's most burdensome regulations, it offered no replacement to actually reform our health care system and deliver affordable, quality health care to our citizens,"" he said. ""We must now return to the correct way of legislating and send the bill back to committee, hold hearings, receive input from both sides of aisle, heed the recommendations of nation's governors, and produce a bill that finally delivers affordable health care for the American people."" None of the three senators is up for re-election next year.?																																																																																																																					"
"House Republicans appeared dumbfounded Friday as they digested the news that their Senate counterparts failed to deliver an Obamacare repeal plan across the finish line. There are deep divisions within the House Republican Conference about what comes next. Some say the ball is still in the Senate's court for dealing with the 2010 health care law. Others suggest it's time for bipartisan negotiations to fix Obamacare's vulnerabilities. And still others said they have no idea what the next step should be, admitting that they've hit a dead end. House Republicans discussed the situation Friday morning at a closed-door conference meeting and the mood was ""somber,"" Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, said afterward. ""I think we expected that the Senate would get something done and most of us expected to be here to deal with it,"" said Cole, who added that he's worried about the political implications for Republicans up for re-election in 2018. A dramatic overnight vote dealt President Trump a major political setback on health care. Senate Republicans failed to pass their latest attempt ... Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, on Friday praised the House for passing a health care measure in early May, but said, ""I am disappointed and frustrated, but we should not give up,"" and he urged the Senate to keep working toward a solution. ""People here in Washington need to keep their eye on the ball,"" said Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-New Jersey, who helped craft a proposal that helped House Republicans find consensus on their repeal-and-replace plan earlier this year. ""It took Democrats 50 years to socialize medicine,"" said Rep. Ra迆l R. Labrador, R- Idaho, Friday. ""I think we can take a little bit of time to protect the American people."" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, said Friday that Republicans have to ""regroup"" and find a strategy that can get 51 votes in the Senate. ""We had an infamous Friday as well,"" he said, recalling?the day in March when the plan in the House collapsed because GOP leaders were unable to secure enough votes for passage. Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, said Friday that the Senate is obstructing the conservative agenda and President Trump's agenda. ""It starts at the top with Mitch McConnell and it goes all the way down to the bottom, the newest senator, Luther Strange. We need new leadership in the United States Senate. If Mitch McConnell cannot get the job done then those 52 Republican senators have got to get together and try to figure out who amongst them have the leadership capability of getting the job done,"" he said. Asked if Mr. Trump did enough to coordinate with Senate Republicans, Brooks said, ""It's quite clear that nobody did enough in the House, the Senate and the White House...Collectively, we're supposed to be a team."" Some members said, however, that now it's time to reach across the aisle. ""I think that we should work in a bipartisan capacity,"" said Rep. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey. ""Right now, I think there's a great opportunity to enter into a bipartisan center of discussion on health care reform. That's where I think we go from here,"" said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pennsylvania, the chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group caucus. Some possible next steps, he said, could include stabilizing the individual market, maybe repealing the medical device tax and reforming the employer mandate. Republicans warned that if the status quo remains, that the entire health care system would implode, as the president has suggested. The House, for its part, leaves Friday for its month-long August recess and won't return until the beginning of September, during which time lawmakers will face a slew of deadlines to pass a government funding package and prevent a shutdown and to lift the debt ceiling. The Senate, meanwhile, will return to Washington next week for additional votes on nominations and a defense policy bill. It will also eventually go on recess until September.?																																																																																																																					"
"WASHINGTON?-- Trumpeting his administration's crackdown on illegal immigration and violent crime, President Donald Trump is traveling to Long Island to urge Congress to dedicate more funding to the fight. Mr. Trump is set to speak Friday afternoon at Suffolk County Community College in Brentwood, New York, close to where the ultra-violent street gang MS-13 has committed a string of gruesome murders, including the massacre of four young men in April in a Central Islip park. President Trump is expected to continue his tough talk on immigration and urge Congress to dedicate more funding to border enforcement and faster deportations in a speech in front of law enforcement officers and the family members of crime victims. A church in New Haven, Connecticut, is providing a safe haven for a single mother from Guatemala who faces deportation. More than 800 churches an... He has made cracking down on MS-13, also called Mara Salvatrucha, a top priority of his administration. The gang, which is believed to have originated in immigrant communities in Los Angeles in the 1980s and then entrenched itself in Central America when its leaders were deported, is infamous for its violent tactics, including torturing victims and hacking them with machetes. Its recruits are middle- and high-school students, predominantly in immigrant communities, who are said to risk violent retribution if they leave. Authorities estimate the group has tens of thousands of members across several Central American countries and many U.S. states. Mr. Trump's Justice and Homeland Security departments have made targeting the gang a top priority. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has directed his department's law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors across the country to prioritize their prosecution, as directed by an executive order Trump signed in February, among other measures. President Trump is set to visit Long Island, New York, on Friday to talk about the violent MS-13 street gang. What is MS-13? ""We're liberating our towns and we're liberating our cities. Can you believe we have to do that?"" Mr. Trump said at an Ohio rally earlier this week, adding that law enforcement agents were rooting out gang members - and ""not doing it in a politically correct fashion. We're doing it rough."" ""Our guys are rougher than their guys,"" he bragged. Since the beginning of January the Department of Homeland Security's investigative unit has arrested 3,311 gang members across the country in a number of targeted operations, said Tom Homan, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency could not provide numbers for a similar timeframe in 2016. The president's trip comes as Sessions is visiting El Salvador as part of a mission to increase international cooperation against the gang. Sessions met Thursday with his Salvadoran counterpart and members of an international anti-gang task force. Congressman Peter King, who represents Brentwood and will travel with the president from Washington, said that Trump's appearance would send a signal to communities that have been shaken by the violent killings. ""It's absolutely devastating. And almost all of these killings have occurred in my district, within 20 minutes of my home,"" he said. King said the gang is responsible for 17 murders between January 2016 and April 2017 in his district - but that the impact on largely immigrant communities has been larger because of the way the gang kills. In addition to torturing victims, King said, members have also sent video of gruesome crime scenes to their victims' loved ones ""This gang's chilling motto is 'mata, viola, controla,'which means 'kill, rape and control,'"" said Robert Hur, a top official at the Justice Department. ""They seek to live up to this motto through truly shocking acts of violence designed to instill fear: vicious machete attacks, execution-style gunshots, gang rape and human trafficking."" The Trump administration blames the gang's recent resurgence in certain areas on illegal immigration and believes policies like building a wall along the southern border and cracking down on so-called ""sanctuary cities"" will eradicate the problem. Critics see the focus misplaced and argue resources could be better spent on other enforcement efforts.

"After the plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act failed in the Senate, President Trump began tweeting about changing the rules in the Senate.?

If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate, they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority, not senseless 60... In most cases, legislation requires 60 votes in the Senate for passage, although this was not the case in the vote on the so-called ""skinny repeal"" early Friday morning. That amendment was, in fact, one that required only a simple majority of 51 senators to pass. GOP Senators Susan Collins, John McCain and Lisa Murkowski voted no, leaving Republicans short one vote.? Mr. Trump then tweeted again, adding, ""Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60. So many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes.""? ...Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60. So many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes.... Over the past few days, the Senate parliamentarian provided guidance that parts of the Senate plan to repeal Obamacare would require 60 votes, rather than 51, because they did not comply with what's known as the ""Byrd Rule."" This is the rule that bans the Senate from considering ""extraneous matter"" as part of a reconciliation bill. The Senate was using the budgetary tool of reconciliation to try to pass its health care bill with just 51 votes.? Amendments are considered ""extraneous"" by the parliamentarian if, for example, they don't produce a change in outlays or revenues, or if those changes are just incidental to the components of the provision that don't relate to the budget. Immediately after the measure failed, the president tweeted that the three Republicans and 48 Democrats had ""let the American people down,"" and ""As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!""?

""So, let me just put this in very stark terms,"" said Garrett on the latest episode of ""The Takeout"" podcast. ""You head into the 2018 midterms. You want this leadership team to be the bumper sticker for the Democratic House minority or not?"" ""No, I don't,"" Moulton responded. Moulton has been openly critical of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, particularly in the weeks since Democrats lost four special elections in June. He has frequently called for new leadership but is now more impatient to usher the current leaders out. ""There's going to have to be a pretty significant uprising in the House Democratic Caucus to make that happen,"" Garrett pointed out. ""Well, that's right,"" Moulton said. ""But I think it's the right thing to do. I mean, when Americans are losing their health care because we can't hold the Republicans accountable, when Donald Trump is running roughshod over our national security and putting the nation at risk because we can't hold him accountable in the House of Representatives."" ""What we've got to do - not just for our party, but I think for so many American people - is start winning again,"" he continued. ""Start bringing some balance back to Washington and start winning with leadership that the American people can trust - not the old, tired Democratic partisan leadership - but really a new generation of leaders who are going to put the country first."" Still, Moulton was careful to point out he considers Pelosi an ""amazing politician."" ""She's really achieved an awful lot,"" he said. ""Obamacare wouldn't exist - it's saved millions of lives - without Pelosi getting it through the House. Not a perfect piece of legislation, but she deserves a lot of credit for that."" In late June after Moulton and others called on her to step down as leader based on the results of the special elections. Pelosi defended her record on ""CBS This Morning,"" referring to herself as a ""master legislator."" ""We just lost the election,"" she said. ""We could write a message, but the fact is we need our members to write a message and they know full well 每 that that is something we're working with the Senate to go forward,"" she said. Moulton, who served four tours in Iraq as a Marine Corps infantry officer, disagrees. He insists the answer to the Democrats' messaging problem isn't coming from the members. That's the responsibility of the party leadership. While he says at this time he is not considering the role for himself, he is working hard to ?get fellow veterans involved in politics. ""I've been calling for a new generation of leadership in the Democratic Party, and that's why I'm working so hard to recruit these veterans across the country,"" he said. ""[They] want to get in, want to provide some new leadership - some less partisan leadership, some leadership that Americans of all political stripes can believe in.""

"TRENTON, N.J. -- Gov. Chris Christie says public outcry over his decision to lounge with his family on a public beach that was closed during New Jersey's government shutdown ""upset"" his children more than anything else since he's been in office. The two-term Republican governor made the comments Thursday night during his regular radio call-in show on 101.5 FM. Christie was photographed over the Fourth of July weekend by NJ.com at Island Beach State Park, where the state provides a summer home to the governor. Christie ordered the shutdown of nonessential state government, including state beaches and parks, amid a budget impasse. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was seen over the weekend enjoying time on a beach he closed because of the state's failure to pass a budget. Chri... He said during Thursday's radio show that his family was hurt by the backlash and ""they don't understand people's unfairness and, quite frankly, their ignorance."" A week after the images of the Christies on the beach surfaced, Monmouth University released polling data?that showed the governor's job approval ratings at an all-time low.? The survey found that 15 percent of New Jersey constituents approved of the job Christie was doing as their governor, while 80 percent disapproved. A majority of residents polled -- 55 percent -- also said the state was worse off because of Christie's time in office; an increase from just one year ago when 41 percent shared this sentiment, and just 15 percent said New Jersey was better off.? ""It really is difficult to drive approval ratings into the single digits, barring something like a criminal conviction. However, you have to admire Christie's seeming tenacity for trying to get his numbers down to that level,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute. When asked about ""beach gate"", two-thirds of Garden State residents showed negative views about Christie's day at the beach. Respondents were asked to describe how the images of Christie lounging on the beach with his family made them feel. The word ""disgusted"" was most commonly used, representing 7 percent of the responses, followed by ""anger"" and ""disbelief."" ?

"Last Updated Jul 28, 2017 4:22 AM EDT Senate Republicans' attempt to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act died early Friday morning, with three GOP senators -- Sen. John McCain, Sen. Susan Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski -- voting against the proposal.? ""So ... this is clearly a disappointing moment,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said right after the bill failed. Even a last-minute attempt by Vice President Mike Pence to persuade McCain to vote for the bill failed. McCain was key in an earlier Senate vote on the motion to proceed with efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, and many of his Republican colleagues looked to his return to the Senate as a sign that they would be able to pass some kind of health overhaul. ""From the beginning, I have believed that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced with a solution that increases competition, lowers costs, and improves care for the American people. The so-called 'skinny repeal' amendment the Senate voted on today would not accomplish those goals,"" McCain said in a statement released after the vote. The Republican-led Senate's first vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act suffered a bi- partisan rebuke Tuesday as nine Republicans j... The veteran Arizona senator said assurances from Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan that the House would be ""willing"" to try and improve upon the ""skinny repeal"" bill in conference ""does not ease my concern that this shell of a bill could be taken up and passed at any time."" ? The Health Care Freedom Act would have repealed key GOP objections to the ACA, including the individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax. The bill also cut off funding for Planned Parenthood. An amendment to the bill passed on Thursday also repealed the so-called ""Cadillac"" tax on the most robust and expensive health care plans. President Trump, who urged senators to pass the skinny repeal bill in a tweet before the vote, chastized the three Republican dissenters and all their Democratic colleagues in a tweet early Friday morning, saying they had ""let the American people down."" 3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch! Until hours before the vote, the bill had no publicly released text and was only known as the ""skinny repeal,"" prompting intense criticism from Democrats who say they and the public were shut out of the process.? ""Why is this being rushed through this way? Why is this being done in the dark of night?"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said in a five-minute statement before the vote, after Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyoming) repeatedly denied Democrats from asking any questions about the bill for an hour.? In the statement released after the late-night vote, McCain urged his colleagues to ""return to the correct way of legislating and send the bill back to committee, hold hearings, receive input from both sides of aisle, heed the recommendations of nation's governors, and produce a bill that finally delivers affordable health care for the American people."" ? The Congressional Budget Office estimated late Thursday night that 16 million more Americans would lose coverage by 2026, and premiums would increase between 2018 and 2026 by 20 percent compared with current law.? But conservative critics of the bill point out it doesn't repeal other key taxes and regulations in the ACA. Republicans in the House and Senate have been criticized for not having a clearer plan in place, after seven years of Obamacare and promises to repeal it.? It's unclear what the House will do next. The House GOP caucus was expected to convene to figure out its next steps Friday at 9 a.m., but that was before the latest bill failed.

"NEW YORK --?A Chinese billionaire who wanted to build a United Nations center in Macau and was accused of illegally paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to U.N. ambassadors to make it happen was convicted at his bribery trial on Thursday. The verdict was returned in Manhattan federal court against Ng Lap Seng, one of China's richest men. Ng was convicted of bribery, conspiracy and money laundering charges. Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim said in a statement Thursday evening that ""billionaire Ng Lap Seng corrupted the highest levels of the United Nations."" ""Through bribes and no show jobs, Ng turned leaders of the league of nations into his private band of profiteers,"" he wrote. ""Ng's journey from a Macau real estate mogul to convicted felon should serve as a cautionary tale to all tempted to follow his path. If you bring corruption to New York -- whether to the State Capitol in Albany or to the halls of the U.N. General Assembly 每 your journey may very well end in a Manhattan federal courtroom, with a unanimous jury announcing your guilt."" Prosecutors presented evidence that Ng from 2010 to 2015 bribed two U.N. ambassadors with hundreds of thousands of dollars to support his project to build a U.N. conference center, but defense lawyers contended that Ng only paid money when he was asked to spend it to speed the project along. A prosecutor earlier this week had urged the jury to convict Ng, saying he bribed the ambassadors so he could build a U.N. facility that would be as big as the one in New York, a claim a defense attorney dismissed as ""a big zero."" ""The defendant Ng Lap Seng corrupted the United Nations,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Janis Echenberg told the federal court jury on Tuesday during closings at a trial that kept Ng confined under 24-hour guard in a luxury Manhattan apartment for the last two years. She said the 69-year-old Ng paid millions of dollars to the two U.N. ambassadors to clear away red tape so he could build a conference center in Macau that would be the ""Geneva of Asia,"" where tens of thousands of people would spend money at his hotel, a marina, a condominium complex, a heliport and a shopping center. Echenberg said it was a project that would bring Ng and his family ""fame and more fortune."" ""Brick by brick, bribe by bribe, the defendant built the path that he thought would build his legacy,"" she said. Defense attorney Tai Park raised his voice repeatedly as he derided the prosecution as ""frankly outrageous."" ""It falls by its own weight,"" he said. ""It's a big zero."" Park reread aloud parts of a U.N. Task Force report that he said proved there were no rules or prohibition against the kind of private-public partnership that Ng had forged with the United Nations and its ambassadors to build a multibillion-dollar facility that would serve developing nations. He blamed the ambassadors -- former U.N. General Assembly President John Ashe and suspended Dominican Republic Ambassador Francis Lorenzo -- for abusing their relationships with Ng. ""Mr. Ng literally threw his money in every direction he was asked,"" Park said. Ashe, who died last year in an accident at home, had asked Ng to rescue him in 2014 with a $200,000 donation to pay for a concert after another person who was supposed to finance the event backed out, Park said. He said a $20,000-per-month salary paid to Lorenzo was for his job as president of a media organization meant to benefit developing nations. Echenberg said if there was any doubt about why Ng was paying Lorenzo a lot of money it was eliminated in December 2012, when he promised him an extra $30,000 monthly to speed approval of the Macau center. The prosecutor said Lorenzo's testimony was so damaging that Park spent six days on cross-examination. ""You know he's guilty just by the testimony of ambassador Lorenzo,"" she said. Lorenzo, who pleaded guilty to accepting and paying bribes, remains free on bail pending sentencing.?

"WASHINGTON -- Throughout his business career, Donald Trump placed a premium on fame. But President Trump's business organization wants to stay on the down low. CBS News has obtained a new confidentiality agreement rolled out after the election. The Trump Organization is requiring employees at all levels to sign it, or else they will lose their jobs. Employees must agree to keep secret any information they learn about anyone in the ""Trump family"" and extended family, including their ""present, former and future spouses, children, parents, in-laws."" ""I have reviewed confidentiality agreements in international, family-run hospitality organizations and... I have never seen a loyalty code to a family like this,"" said Debra Soltis, who has specialized in employment law for more than 25 years. Debra Soltis ""This confidentiality agreement looks more like what you would expect to sign if you were a nanny to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's children, where you were being brought into the home and exposed to private information,"" she said.? Specifically off limits: ""all political, legal, social, religious, health-related affairs, activities, views and/or opinions of any member of the Trump family... all photographs, movies, sketches, videos, sound or image recordings or likenesses of any member of the Trump family."" The agreement lasts forever and is retroactive. Before he took office, President Trump vowed to put his business into a trust and cede all control to his sons. But according to newly released d... Soltis says the agreement could discourage would-be whistleblowers. Because even though the company code of conduct requires employees to be truthful in any government inquiry, the confidentiality agreement has a clause saying if an employee is required by law to disclose confidential information, they have to notify the Trump Organization. ""What if an employee had information that was relevant and the public had every right to know? Under this agreement they could not share it. They couldn't raise their hand and say 'I know something, I've seen something.' And that is deeply troubling,"" she said. In a statement, the Trump Organization told CBS News it has used confidentiality agreements for many years.? ""This is no different than any other company in the hospitality industry and beyond,"" a spokesperson said. ""To suggest otherwise is not only disingenuous but downright absurd.""																																																																																																																					"
"President Trump honored five first responders to the Alexandria congressional baseball practice shooting Thursday afternoon at the White House with Medals of Valor, the highest decoration of bravery bestowed upon public safety officers. Mr. Trump presented the award to Capitol Police Special Agents David Bailey and Crystal Griner as well as Alexandria Police Department Officers Nicole Battaglia, Kevin Jobe and Alexander Jensen for their bravery responding to the attacks on the congressional baseball practice. ""I can only tell you from the campaign, the people love you, they respect you and they admire you,"" Mr. Trump said of law enforcement. On June 14, a gunman opened fire at a baseball practice in which Republican lawmakers were preparing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for charity. The rifle shots wounded five individuals, including both Griner and Bailey as well as House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana. The assailant was taken down at the scene. ""They are American heroes and we salute them,"" Mr. Trump said of the five law enforcement officers. Scalise was released Wednesday from MedStar Washington Hospital Center, which said the congressman has made ""excellent progress in his recovery from a life-threatening gunshot wound six weeks ago,"" according to a statement. Scalise, who is currently recovering from his injuries, was unable to attend the ceremony, but his wife Jennifer Scalise and members of his medical team were present. The majority whip released a statement thanking and congratulating the first responders. ""Most people instinctively run from danger, but these officers did not hesitate to put their own lives on the line to run towards it that morning of June 14 to protect the lives of others,"" Scalise's statement reads. Mr. Trump also thanked paramedics who responded to the Alexandria shooting and praised House-passed legislation aimed at assisting Capitol Police officers injured in duty. ""We are forever in your debt. Thank you God bless you, God bless our truly amazing law enforcement and God bless America,"" the president concluded.?

"Last Updated Jul 27, 2017 7:09 PM EDT Newly installed White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci called New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza Wednesday night to demand information about leaks emanating from the executive branch, and in the process criticized many of his colleagues while using copious profanity. ?? Scaramucci, apparently believing that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus had leaked information about a dinner President Trump had Wednesday night with Fox News host Sean Hannity and former Fox executive Bill Shine, first threatened to fire the entire communications staff if Lizza did not divulge the source of the leaks. When he resisted, Scaramucci continued to press the issue.? ""I ask these guys not to leak anything and they can't help themselves,"" Scaramucci said. ""You're an American citizen, this is a major catastrophe for the American country. So I'm asking you as an American patriot to give me a sense of who leaked it."" A financial disclosure form published on Politico's website last night appears to reveal details about the income of White House communications d... Scaramucci then teed off on Priebus and the White House communications team, and said that he believed the chief of staff had leaked the existence of the dinner because he had not been invited. ""They'll all be fired by me,"" he said. ""I fired one guy the other day. I have three to four people I'll fire tomorrow. I'll get to the person who leaked that to you. Reince Priebus -- if you want to leak something -- he'll be asked to resign very shortly...Reince is a f******* paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac."" Using a vulgar colloquialism, Scaramucci also said that Priebus had tried to block him for months, and was now giving Shine the same treatment. The entire exchange between Lizza and Scaramucci was outlined in a story published online Thursday by the New Yorker The White House communication director then turned his ire toward Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump's chief political strategist. Scaramucci, referencing a onanistic sexual act, said that he was not interested in attracting media attention like Bannon, preferring only to promote the president. ""I'm not trying to build my own brand off the f******* strength of the President,"" Scarmucci said. ""I'm here to serve the country."" Returning to the issue of leaks, Scaramucci said that he would find the leakers and that they would be likely be prosecuted: ""O.K., the Mooch showed up a week ago. This is going to get cleaned up very shortly, O.K.? Because I nailed these guys. I've got digital fingerprints on everything they've done through the F.B.I. and the f****** Department of Justice...the felony, they're gonna get prosecuted, probably, for the felony."" Scaramucci then got off the phone, saying he had ""to start tweeting some s*** to make [Priebus] crazy."" Minutes later, Scaramucci tweeted a warning that the people who released his financial records to Politico on Wednesday would be prosecuted, and appeared to implicate Priebus in the leak of that information. As it turned out, the information Politico reported on was a matter of public record. On Thursday, after the publication of the interview, Scaramucci responded on Twitter: I sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for @realDonaldTrump's agenda. #MAGA White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded to her boss' interview on Fox News Thursday night.

"The Senate has passed a sweeping sanctions package targeting Russia, Iran and North Korea with an overwhelming bipartisan majority, 97-2. The U.S. House passed the sanctions package Tuesday in a 419-3 vote, sending the legislation to the Senate. The White House has not definitively said that President Trump will sign the bill, but the the measure won a veto-proof majority in both the House and Senate. The measure -- a reprimand for Russian interference in the 2016 election cycle, among other things -- requires congressional approval before the president can ease or lift sanctions. The White House had criticized attempts to limit the president's sanctions powers, but the legislation's solid bipartisan support may be forcing the president's hand. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Monday night aboard Air Force One said the president is ""looking over"" where the legislation stood. Negotiators from the House and Senate came to an agreement on the legislation in recent days after it garnered overwhelming support in the Senate but stalled in the House. The Senate originally passed the legislation in a 98-2 vote in mid-June, but the House claimed the measure violated a clause in the Constitution that says bills that raise revenue for government must originate in the House. The Treasury Department fined ExxonMobil $2 million Thursday for violating U.S. sanctions in 2014 when it signed contracts with a blacklisted Rus... Although the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act also punishes North Korea and Iran for their aggression, the Russia portion of the legislation has received the most attention, given Mr. Trump's?reluctance to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin or acknowledge Russian meddling in the election. The White House has focused on the need to stand up to Russia instead because of its intervention in Ukraine and Crimea. According to the latest version of the legislation, Mr. Trump would have to send a report for any plan to ease sanctions to Congress, and Congress would have 30 days to accept or reject the plan.

Scaramucci exploded onto the White House scene last week, making it clear in his first press briefing he would not only be taking over the communications reins from outgoing press secretary and Priebus ally Sean Spicer, but that he would also have the access and powers normally designated to the chief of staff. He said he reports directly to the president, instead of to Priebus, and wields the authority to fire people. At the same time, Priebus' presence has seemed to diminish in the White House. But the distance between the two represents more than just ""healthy competition,"" as Sanders coined it.? Priebus, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, represents the establishment Republican wing brought on in efforts to provide Washington know-how to a president with no experience holding public office. Other RNC allies brought aboard included Spicer and Kate Walsh, former deputy White House chief of staff. They're now gone. Scaramucci has indicated his allegiance is to the president alone, and he's willing to go to bat for him. Like Mr. Trump, he's a New Yorker.

"Last Updated Jul 27, 2017 7:52 PM EDT WASHINGTON -- The GOP-controlled House has given tentative approval to a $1.6 billion down payment for President Trump's long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The controversial wall money is being given a ride on legislation to give the Pentagon a massive spending boost and increase funding for veterans medical care. The House passed the measure Thursday in a 235-192 vote. The House added Trump's wall funding by a 230-196 procedural vote earlier in the day that denied angry Democrats an up-or-down vote. The wall gets low marks in public opinion polls and is opposed by many of the GOP's more moderate lawmakers. Trump promised at nearly every rally and campaign event that Mexico would pay for the wall. Mexico said no, and U.S. taxpayers will have to provide the money. In advancing the broader $788 billion spending bill, Republicans are trying to ease a large backlog of unfinished spending bills and give both themselves and Trump political wins heading into the August recess. ""As promised to the American people, we are rebuilding and modernizing our military as an international powerhouse,"" said Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky. At issue are the spending bills passed by Congress each year to fund the day-to-day operations of federal agencies. Trump is pushing for a sweeping increase for the Pentagon and commensurate cuts of more than $50 billion, or 10 percent, from domestic agencies and foreign aid. House Republicans are responding by adding even more for defense but have significantly scaled back Trump's cuts to domestic programs like community development grants and medical research. GOP leaders had hoped to advance a broader ""omnibus"" package that would have included each of the 12 measures. But the GOP rank and file balked, so Republicans devised a smaller bill anchored by the Pentagon budget, funding for veterans programs, and money for the wall. ""Every single dime the President requested to start building a wall on our southern border he's going to get,"" said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. ""Most importantly, we're sending more to the VA to fix veterans' health care and reform outdated VA systems."" But most of the sweeping Pentagon increases -- which total about $60 billion above current levels and almost $30 billion higher than Trump's budget -- would evaporate next year unless there's a bipartisan agreement to raise budget ""caps"" set by a 2011 budget pact. A two-year agreement that eased those ""sequestration"" spending limits expires in September. A fall showdown with Senate Democrats over the wall awaits and both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate want additional funding for domestic programs. Democrats have lots of leverage because their votes are needed to pass the funding measures. For now, the Senate is working in a bipartisan fashion on a sharply different set of bills that, on average, are frozen at current levels. The House is on track to pass the measure along party lines. Democrats are furious that GOP leaders are denying them a vote -- which they believe they might have been able to win -- on killing Trump's border wall. More than 700 miles of fencing and other border barricades were built about a decade ago. Republicans from border states, swing-district lawmakers, and Republicans representing sizable Hispanic populations tend to oppose the wall but are backing it because the money will be paired with politically sacrosanct funding for troops in the field and health care for veterans. Earlier this year, Congress and Trump came together of spending bills for the current budget year that largely stuck to work done last year under former President Barack Obama. Trump reluctantly signed a $1.2 trillion catchall spending bill in May. The current measure, however, reflects the changed balance of power in GOP-controlled Washington. Weapons procurement is a top priority, including two additional littoral combat ships above Trump's request and 14 unrequested next-generation F-35 fighters. Democrats said the big gains for now are illusory since sequestration remains in place. ""We do not give certainty to our defense or confidence to our troops when we legislate with phony numbers when we refuse to make honest choices about our Defense budget,"" said Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ""Instead of giving certainty to our heroes in uniform, this bill would breach the sequester spending limit by more than $70 billion, forcing a mandatory 13 percent cut to all defense accounts.""

"Last Updated Jul 27, 2017 7:47 PM EDT As controversy engulfs the White House, new press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders focused half of Thursday's briefing on the administration's latest efforts to combat violence perpetrated by MS-13 gang members. With a White House under fire for President Trump's surprise announcement to ban transgender troops from the military, brewing tensions between chief of staff Reince Priebus and new communications director Anthony Scaramucci, and the president's Twitter attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Sessions is heading to El Salvador for meetings on MS-13, immigration and drugs, and Mr. Trump is scheduled to give a speech about eradicating the gang in New York Friday. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaks during a briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wed., July 26, 2017. On Thursday, Sanders handed the podium off to Robert Hur, principal associate deputy attorney general and Thomas Homan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, on the heels of a Justice Department announcement that Salvadoran prosecutors charged 113 MS-13 gang members in El Salvador earlier in the day. ""The attorney general has answered the president's call and we at the Justice Department are moving forward aggressively against MS-13,"" Hur told reporters. Big progress being made in ridding our country of MS-13 gang members and gang members in general. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! But Sanders, who reminded reporters to stay on the topic, couldn't keep them in line for long. For the second day in a row, the White House had no answer for what will happen to transgender troops currently serving in the military. Sanders repeated what she said on Wednesday, that the White House is working out the details with the Pentagon. Asked whether the president's sudden announcement distracts from other important agenda, she said Mr. Trump can walk and chew gum at the same time, a line she has offered before in times of controversy. Sanders paused before answering whether the president has confidence in Priebus, whose role seems to be overshadowed by the entrance of Scaramucci. Sanders declined to answer. ""Look, I think I've addressed this question when it comes to staffing and personnel many times, that if the president doesn't, then he'll make that decision,"" Sanders said. ""We all serve at the pleasure of the president. And if he gets to a place where that isn't the case, he'll let you know.""																																																																																																																					"
"SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador ?-- After being berated for a week by President Donald Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Thursday he will stay in the job for as long as Trump wants him to serve. He conceded that the president's criticism pains him, though. Asked by Fox News' Tucker Carlson whether he thinks Mr. Trump's criticism is fair, Sessions said that ""it's kind of hurtful, but the president of the United States is a strong leader."" He also told Carlson the president ""has had a lot of criticism, and he's steadfast, determined to get his job done, and he wants all of us to do our job. And that's what I intend to do."" Sessions told The Associated Press he and Mr. Trump have a ""harmony of values and beliefs"" and he intends to stay and fight for the president's agenda ""as long as he sees that as appropriate."" ""If he wants to make a change, he has every right,"" Sessions said in an interview outside the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador during a mission to increase international cooperation against the MS-13 gang. ""I serve at the pleasure of the president. I've understood that from the day I took the job."" Congressional Republicans have rallied around Sessions, a former senator from Alabama, and expressed mortification at the humiliation visited on him by the president in several interviews and a series of tweets branding him weak and ineffective. Mr. Trump is upset that Sessions recused himself months ago from the investigation into interactions between Russian officials and the Trump campaign, and that he has not taken a tougher line against his defeated Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina warned Thursday there would be ""holy hell"" to pay if Mr. Trump fired Sessions. After meeting his Salvadoran counterpart, Sessions told AP he was ""thrilled"" with the support he's received, presumably from lawmakers. ""I believe we are running a great Department of Justice,"" he said. ""I believe with great confidence that I understand what is needed in the Department of Justice and what President Trump wants. I share his agenda."" He acknowledged, with considerable understatement, ""it hasn't been my best week .... for my relationship with the president."" The two have not spoken recently, he said. ""But I look forward to the opportunity to chat with him about it."" In Washington, lawmakers are aiming to prevent the dismissal of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a development that might be made easier if Sessions were pushed aside. Graham is working on legislation that would block the firing of special counsels without judicial review. Democrats Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday they are among the senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee who are working with Graham on the effort. Graham and Whitehouse lead the Judiciary panel's subcommittee on crime and terrorism and have been investigating Russian meddling in the election along with the committee's chairman, Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley. In a tweet,?Grassley indirectly warned that should a new attorney general need to be confirmed, it couldn't happen in 2017. ""Everybody in D.C. Shld b warned that the agenda for the judiciary Comm is set for rest of 2017. Judges first subcabinet 2nd / AG no way,"" he tweeted Wednesday night. ? Blumenthal said that the bill ""might be a committee effort"" and said that it would protect Mueller and other special counsels. He said firing Mueller ""would precipitate a firestorm that would be unprecedented in proportions."" Sessions recused himself from the investigation into election meddling after he admitted to meeting with Russia's ambassador during the campaign.

"Last Updated Jul 27, 2017 5:44 PM EDT The newly-named White House communications director is taking aim at leakers. In a Wednesday night tweet that has since been deleted, Anthony Scaramucci called for federal investigators to look into how Politico obtained his financial disclosure forms. (Politico said Thursday the documents were publicly available, not leaked.) CBS News chief Washington correspondent John Dickerson said, ""Often, leaks are the sign of a White House that's not operating in a healthy way.""? The ""Face the Nation"" moderator joined ""CBS This Morning"" to discuss what the constant drip of information out of the White House might mean, why ""clamping down"" on leaks doesn't really work, and President Trump's recent criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.? Dickerson said the problem with cracking down on White House leaks is that ""it creates an atmosphere of a little bit of terror. ... It makes everybody kind of look over their shoulder."" Scaramucci appeared to take aim at White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and called the release of his financial forms a felony 〞 which it is not. Scaramucci clarified his earlier post on Twitter, writing: ""Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks.""? Anthony Scaramucci made a number of appearances on Sunday morning TV programs threatening to take drastic action to stop leaks to the press and f... Dickerson said it's important to distinguish more common leaks from those that could harm national security. ""Harmless leaks are the result of a process that doesn't work. Where people feel like they're not being heard. Where their opinions are being discarded. Where things are happening to their colleagues that irritate them,"" Dickerson said. ""White Houses are healthy when people are all working for a common purpose, but if they see that it's all about self-preservation or that people can make end-runs around the process, then they leak."" Dickerson also pointed out why a White House sometimes actually needs leaks. ""They need relationships with reporters to float things out there without making them official to take care of stories that may look bad but may need explanation off the record. They need a conduit of information with reporters,"" he said.? While leaks have been a focus for President Trump since he took office, Dickerson said, ""Republicans working on health care right now are talking not about leaks from the White House, they're talking about things that have come out of the president's own mouth, distracting his agenda. What he said to the Boy Scouts, what he's doing with Jeff Sessions 〞 which Republicans on the Hill are scratching their heads about."" President Trump has been publicly critical of his attorney general, prompting criticism from some in his own party. ""It's amazing how confused Republicans are 每 who are allies of Jeff Sessions, who want the president to do well 每 by this public situation that's emerged. But Jeff Sessions has been looking into leaks. These are the illegal leaks. These are things of classified information,"" Dickerson said.? ""This could be a way, if the Justice Department does something publicly, the president could take an off-ramp and say, well, now they're taking care of this thing and everything's OK, it's back on track and I'll move on. But that's if he really wants his attorney general to stay, and we're just not sure whether that's the case or not.""?

"The head of the Boy Scouts of America apologized Thursday for President Trump's speech?at the Scouts' annual jamboree, saying it ""was never our intent"" to inject politics into the event. ""I want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree,"" Chief Scout Executive Michael Surbaugh wrote Thursday. ""We sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program."" Mr. Trump addressed a crowd of about 40,000 at the 2017 National Jamboree in West Virginia on Monday, repeatedly mentioning several hot-button political issues. He criticized former President Barack Obama, discussed ongoing efforts in Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, reflected on his electoral victory and blasted the ""fake media."" ""I go to Washington and I see all these politicians, and I see the swamp,"" Mr. Trump told the crowd. ""And it's not a good place. In fact today I said we ought to change it from the word 'swamp' to the word 'cesspool' or, perhaps, to the word 'sewer.' But it's not good. Not good."" ? President Trump waves after speaking to Boy Scouts during the National Boy Scout Jamboree at Summit Bechtel National Scout Reserve in Glen Jean, West Virginia, on July 24, 2017. Parents and former Scouts were alarmed by the president's pointedly partisan remarks and the reaction of the crowd, which at one point booed when Mr. Trump mentioned Mr. Obama, who also addressed the gathering as president. Surbaugh wrote Thursday that the gathering was overshadowed by the president's remarks and the ensuing backlash. He noted that presidents had been invited to speak at the gathering since 1937, and the president traditionally serves as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America. Surbaugh said the Scouts' invitation to Mr. Trump was ""in no way an endorsement of any person, party or policies."" ""For years, people have called upon us to take a position on political issues, and we have steadfastly remained non-partisan and refused to comment on political matters,"" Surbaugh wrote. When asked about Surbaugh's comments during Thursday's press briefing at the White House, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders rejected the suggestion that the president owes the Scouts an apology. ""I was at that event and heard nothing but a lot of cheering,"" Sanders said. ""I haven't seen the statement from the Boy Scouts, so I can't comment any further than what I saw firsthand.""

"Last Updated Jul 27, 2017 3:24 PM EDT The Senate voted 51-50 on Tuesday afternoon on a motion to proceed to a health care bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, with Vice President Pence casting the tie-breaking vote. For seven years, repealing the health care law has been one of the central organizing principles of the GOP -- but they've found it difficult to deliver on it now that they're actually in power. With the vote on Tuesday narrowly passing, the Senate began debate on a bill to replace the ACA that passed the House in March, voting on a series of amendments to that legislation.? How did we get to this moment? Here's a timeline of health care reform efforts during the President Trump's time in office and during the 115th Congress: Mr. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office aimed at tackling Obamacare's individual mandate. The individual mandate requires Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. Mr. Trump gave his administration an extended timeline to repeal and replace Obamacare. When asked if repeal legislation would pass in 2017, Mr. Trump said in an interview with Fox News, ""Yes, in the process and maybe it'll take till sometime into next year but we're certainly going to be in the process."" House Republicans praised their outline to repeal and replace Obamacare, as GOP leaders distributed talking points to their colleagues which said their plan ""ensures more choices, lower costs and greater control over your health care."" House Republicans circulated a draft of their health care bill, which Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said the plan was ""a recipe for disaster,"" while House Minority Nancy Pelosi, D-California, noted that the Republican draft would result in millions of Americans losing coverage. ? Some of the key provisions in the House Republican bill included the end of Medicaid's expansion, the elimination of taxes on the wealthy and the creation of tax credits up to $4,000. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, announced a vote on a Republican sponsored bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will be held the following week. House Republicans postponed a vote on the American Health Care Act as they didn't have enough support for the bill to pass. The postponed vote also came in the wake of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) releasing a score on the bill. Their findings estimated that 14 more people would be uninsured by 2018 and 24 more million people uninsured by 2026 under the new plan compared to the current law. Coupled with the CBO score was the release of a Quinnipiac University poll that highlighted the unfavorable ratings of the House Republican bill. The poll showed that only?17 percent of American voters approve of the AHCA. During the evening, White House OMB Director Mick Mulvaney indicated to House GOP members that Mr. Trump was finished negotiating on the bill. The President requested a vote on May 24th so that the administration could move onto other items on Mr. Trump's agenda. House Speaker Paul Ryan officially cancelled the vote on the ACHA as it didn't have enough support from House GOP members. During his press conference, Ryan said House Republicans ""came up short"" and noted that Obamacare will remain in the ""foreseeable future."" After Speaker Ryan pulled the bill from the floor, Mr. Trump said Republicans came ""very, very close"" to passing the bill. He added that it is time to ""let Obamacare explode."" Mr. Trump also pressured the House Freedom Caucus to vote for the legislation. ""The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!"" Mr. Trump tweeted.Mr. Trump also pressured the House Freedom Caucus to vote for the legislation. ""The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!"" Mr. Trump tweeted. The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan! The White House proposed a new health care plan to repeal and replace Obamacare as Vice President Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney met with House GOP members. After meeting with the House Republican conference, Speaker Ryan told reporters there is no legislative text yet and they are in the ""concept stages"" of the bill.? After not supporting the first version of the American Health Care Act in March, the House Freedom Caucus supported a new version of the bill that included an amendment from Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-New Jersey, that would allow states to apply for waivers from some parts of Obamacare, including the law's definition of essential health benefits and its rules regarding pre-existing conditions. States who wish to obtain a waiver under the proposal would be required to set up a high-risk pool to cover sicker people who might otherwise be unable to purchase insurance, but there were questions about whether the high-risk pools would provide sufficient coverage.? The House Freedom Caucus had been criticized by President Trump for not supporting the original version of the bill. The caucus, a group of roughly three dozen House conservatives, argued that the AHCA wasn't a full repeal of Obamacare. Mr. Trump expressed his frustration with the caucus when he tweeted, ""The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!"" The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! In an interview with CBS News ""Face the Nation,"" Mr. Trump insisted that pre-existing conditions were covered in the new version of the AHCA. He added that the bill evolved from the original version that failed a month earlier. ""This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay?"" he said in the ""Face the Nation"" interview. The House passed the updated version of the AHCA with a final vote count of 217-213. The bill passed with 20 Republicans voting against the bill and without any support from Democrats. ? The bill includes revamped tax credits, while eliminating Obamacare's individual mandate that requires people to purchase health insurance. The bill would also freeze Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and allow states to receive Medicaid funding as a block grant. The challenge then moved to the Senate and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted that Senators should proceed with caution.? The Kaiser Family Foundation released?a poll on the favorability ratings?of the ACHA. According to the poll, 55 percent Americans viewed the AHCA as ""unfavorable,"" while 31 percent of Americans favored the bill. Senate Republicans released their ""discussion draft"" of their health care bill, which would repeal and replace Obamacare, after weeks of secrecy. The 142 page bill, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), was supposedly crafted by 13 Senate Republican men in a closed door process.? But even some members of that group complained they had no idea what was in the bill, and that it was being written by Majority Leader McConnell's staff.? The Senate is using the budget reconciliation process to get the bill through, which means that Republicans need a simple majority--50 votes plus a tie breaking vote from the Vice President, instead of? 60 votes to get the bill through the legislative process. The Senate currently has 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats. The bill would cut Medicaid expansions under Obamacare and eliminate the Obamacare individual mandate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the Senate would vote on the measure before the July 4 recess. The CBO released their score on the Senate health care bill, which indicated that 22 million more Americans would be uninsured over ten years under the new plan. This score was similar to the CBO's score of the AHCA, which estimated that 23 more million Americans would be uninsured under that plan. The dismal forecast was enough for Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah to announce their opposition. ? Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas had already voiced their opposition. A day after the CBO score was released on their health care bill, McConnell informed Senate Republicans that a vote on their bill would be postponed until after July 4 recess. McConnell said Republicans lack the votes to pass the legislation as it currently stood. ""We're still working toward getting at least 50 people in a comfortable place,"" McConnell said. As Senate Republicans were scrambling to garner votes to pass their bill, Mr. Trump added to the health care debate by tweeting, ""If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!"" If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date! Some Republican senators who headed home for the July 4 recess were confronted by constituents opposed to the repeal effort. After on event in Kansas, conservative Sen. Jerry Moran said, ""I think at this point, it's time to figure out how ＃ to get rid of the bad things and improve on the things that need to be improved,"" according to Politico. In Iowa, GOP Sen. Joni Ernst declined to take a stand in support of the Republican bill during her own town hall meeting. ""I am not going to say whether I would or would not support that bill, because I am offering up my own ideas, my own suggestions, and I'd like to see them included in the bill,"" the Iowa senator said, according to the Des Moines Register. ""We'll continue with those discussions."" The Senate released a new draft of the BCRA, which included an amendment proposed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, in their latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. Sen. Cruz's amendment would allow insurers to sell cheaper bare-bones plans if they offer a plan that complies with Obamacare standards. The modified version also would keep three Obamacare taxes on the wealthy and have an increase of $45 billion dollars to combat the opioid crisis. The bill needed 51 votes, including a tie breaking vote from Vice President Pence, on a motion to proceed, which would bring the bill to floor. Sen. Collins and Sen. Paul announced they would vote against the motion to proceed on this version of the bill, which meant that Senate Republicans could not afford to lose another vote, assuming that no Democrats would vote for the bill to advance. Republican Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran announced their opposition to the BCRA, joining Sen. Collins and Sen. Paul.? The four senators expressed they were a 'no' vote on the motion to proceed, which meant McConnell would be unable to even begin work on the amendment process. McConnell released a statement expressing his disappointment with the Senate being unable to pass a repeal and replace bill. McConnell's statement also indicated that the Senate will vote on the House bill passed in May. The first amendment on the House bill would be to replace the House bill with a bill from 2015, which would repeal Obamacare and give lawmakers two years to devise a replacement. The 2015 bill passed the Senate two years ago. Sen. Collins, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia announced?their opposition to repealing Obamacare without a replacement. Their announcement to vote 'no' on the motion to proceed complicates McConnell's proposal to hold a vote on repeal only legislation. At a White House event with military officers, Mr. Trump said to ""let Obamacare fail."" When discussing the collapse of Obamacare, ?Mr. Trump added, ""I can tell you that the Republicans are not going to own it. We'll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say how do we fix it?"" Mr. Trump hosted a White House lunch with Senate GOP members to make another pitch to repeal and replace Obamacare. ""For seven years, you had an easy route,"" Mr. Trump said to Senate GOP members. ""I don't think we should leave town unless we have a plan."" Mr. Trump's push for a repeal and replacement plan during the lunch comes a day after he said to ""let Obamacare fail."" Later in the day, the CBO released its score on the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017, which is the repeal only bill McConnell said the Senate will vote on after the second version of the BCRA failed to gain enough support. The score displayed that 32 million more people would be uninsured under this plan by 2026 compared to current law. The CBO released its score of the second version of the BCRA that included the amendment proposed by Sen. Cruz. The score forecasted that 22 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2026 under the new plan compared to Obamacare. The Senate parliamentarian determined that certain provisions in the BCRA violate the ""Byrd Rule,"" which means that these provisions would require a 60-vote point of order, rather than the simple majority granted through the budget reconciliation process. The Senate Budget Committee released the provisions that violate the ""Byrd Rule"" that would need a 60-vote point of order. Some of the provisions include defunding Planned Parenthood and funding for cost-sharing subsidies. Mr. Trump delivered remarks a day before a vote is expected on the motion to proceed to a Senate health care bill. He urged Senate Republicans to ""keep their promise"" to repeal and replace Obamacare after seven years of campaigning on this issue and unifying behind this promise. ""We, as a party, must fulfill that promise to repeal and replace, what they've been saying for the past 7 years,"" Mr. Trump said. In the morning, Mr. Trump said Senate Republicans have another opportunity to repeal and replace Obamacare when he tweeted, ""Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace after years of talking & campaigning on it."" Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace after years of talking & campaigning on it. The Senate voted 51-50 with Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote on the motion to proceed to debating the AHCA, which is the bill the House passed in May. Sen. Collins and Sen. Murkowski were the only Senate Republicans who voted 'no' on the motion to proceed. All Senate Democrats opposed the procedural vote. Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, Sen. Capito and Sen. Paul voted 'yes' on the motion to proceed. After being diagnosed with glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer, last week, Sen. John McCain of Arizona returned to the Senate to vote 'yes' on the motion to proceed. He was welcomed by applause and a standing ovation from Senate members from both parties.? Later this evening, the Senate voted on a motion to advance the BCRA, the Senate GOP's health care plan. The vote failed with a final vote count of 43-57. The Senate needed 60 votes to advance the proposal, instead of 51 votes. The plan needed 60 votes because it included Sen. Cruz's proposal and a proposal from Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio that wasn't scored by the CBO. According to a McConnell aide, Sen. Portman's proposal would help transition low-income people from Medicaid to private insurance plans. Nine Senate Republicans voted against the measure. They include: Sen. Collins, Sen. Graham, Sen. Heller, Sen. Lee, Sen. Moran, Sen. Murkowski, Sen. Paul, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas. The Senate failed to pass Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming and Sen. Paul's amendment of a clean Obamacare repeal. Their amendment was the 2015 Obamacare repeal with a two year implementation period to devise a replacement. The Senate voted 45-55 with seven Senate Republicans voting against the measure. The Republican Senate defectors were: Sen. Heller, Sen. Capito, Sen. Collins, Sen. McCain, Sen. Portman, Sen. Murkowski and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Texas. All of the senators, with the exception of Collins, supported the measure in 2015. After the clean repeal vote failed, the Senate held three more votes. Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana put forth a motion to send to the bill back to committees. The Donnelly motion failed with a 48-52 vote. The Senate also voted on Sen. Heller's amendment, which pushed for senators to commit to Medicaid funding. Nevada was the first state to expand its Medicaid program under Obamacare. Sen. Heller's amendment need a waiver from the Budget Act to advance. The Senate rejected Sen. Heller's amendment to get a waiver with a 10-90 vote. The final vote in the Senate Wednesday was on a proposal from Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. The proposal aimed at sending the bill back to the Senate Finance Committee and would ensure that people with disabilities would not lose access to their Medicaid coverage. This motion failed 48-51. Throughout the day, Senate Republican leaders were drafting a ""skinny repeal"" of Obamacare. The draft hasn't been released yet, but it would most likely eliminate the individual and employer mandate and a medical device tax imposed by Obamacare. On the Senate floor in the evening, Sen. Minority Leader Schumer said Democrats will not offer amendments to the bill and urged Sen. Majority Leader McConnell to be more transparent in the legislative process. Once news of a ""skinny repeal"" broke, 10 governors 每 five Republicans and five Democrats 每 quickly signaled their opposition to the new proposal in a letter to Senate leadership.

"A financier for one of the largest foreign investment firms in Russia says the meeting arranged between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian entities during the 2016 campaign had a quid pro quo -- repealing the U.S.-passed Magnitsky Act and the sanctions enshrined in it in exchange for a ""sizable offer"" to the campaign itself.? ""It's clear the interest and goal in that meeting was to repeal the Magnistky Act, said Bill Browder, CEO and founder of Hermitage Capital Management before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. ""It's the one thing we can agree with certainty that happened in that meeting.""? He added, ""I do know how the Russian government behaves, and this was a big ask -- to request that the possible future president of the United States, to repeal a major piece of human rights legislation, they wouldn't have gone in and said please repeal this without something in return."" President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is facing backlash for his involvement in a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and a R... But Browder said he does not know what the Russians would have offered in return. ? ""I do know the KGB, the FSB, would have studied their targets carefully and construct an offer that's appealing and sizable enough to be consistent with what they're asking for,"" he told the committee. Aside from Trump Jr., Trump top adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer, who, according to Trump Jr., was purported to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton that could be helpful to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. In his opening remarks before the committee, which is probing Russian meddling in the 2016 and possible Trump campaign ties to the Russian government, Browder detailed his investigation and efforts to shed light on ""massive corruption"" within Russia.? Browder said through his investigation, he ""made Russia a better place for some period of time"" but as a result, exposed billions of dollars in corruption connected to the Putin regime.? American businessman Bill Browder, who was once the biggest foreign investors in Russia, has since become a vocal critic of the country and has c... The financier explained that as a result of his digging, he was expelled from the country after being deemed a ""national security threat."" It was during that time, Russian officials raided his Moscow office and subsequently stole corporate documents connected to investment holding companies of funds he advised.? He hired lawyer Sergei Magnitsky to investigate why his office had been raided, Browder said, and the two discovered Russia's Interior Ministry had seized the company's documents in order to commit fraud, effectively stealing back $230 million in taxes paid to the Russian government, from the Russian government. ""It was theft of money that was originally Russian government money,"" Browder claimed. ? Magnitsky was later jailed for his efforts in the investigation of widespread fraud, and, according to Browder, was tortured repeatedly and was denied medical treatment by prison guards -- leading to his death while in custody in the Moscow prison.? Browder also testified that while Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskya, who had attended the Trump Jr. meeting in 2016, has claimed she never worked for the Kremlin, she had previously been on a ""massive campaign"" to lobby against the Magnitsky Act, and helped disseminate false stories alleging Magnitsky was not killed in prison, in an attempt to get the act quashed.? ""It was a campaign to effectively cover up a murder,"" said Browder. One of the individuals hired by Veselnitskya to help guide the lobbying campaign against the Magnitsky Act was?Glenn Simpson, of opposition research firm Fusion GPS -- the very same firm that hired spy Christopher Steele to compile a dossier with negative -- if unsubstantiated -- information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia. Simpson, according to Browder, had pitched stories to media outlets before Browder came to D.C. to help lobby in favor of the Magnitsky Act.? The Magnitsky Act eventually passed with the help of Browder's lobbying efforts in 2012, effectively punishing Russian officials for Magnitsky's death by barring a variety of Russians from entering the U.S. and from using American banking systems.? Browder pointed out that Putin was so infuriated by the adoption of the Act, Russia tried Magnitsky for his ""crimes against the Russian government,"" ?three years after he had died in prison.? Putin, in retaliation, barred a dozen U.S. officials from entering his own country and halted the American adoptions of Russian children.? While the topic of adoptions has been a repeated refrain for Trump associates in describing the agenda for the June meeting, Browder says, ""Russian adoptions was really code for Russian sanctions."" ""With certainty, no one was talking about adoptions at that meeting,"" Browden said. ""They were talking about the repeal of sanctions so Russian murderers can freely travel and keep their money."" Further, the Russian intelligence community would have been ""well aware of the meeting in advance"" of the Trump Tower gathering, Browder told the committee. ""It's entirely plausible they would have looked at all the people who influence leaders in America and see if they're bribable or extortable,"" he said. ""This is what they do."" When pressed on the effectiveness and need for further sanctions on the Russians government, Browder theorized that ""when it impacts Putin's money personally, he's afraid of having his money frozen and seized."" He added, ""targeted sanctions are 100 times more upsetting to Russians than broad sanctions in Russia.""

"Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are working on legislation that could attempt to insulate Special Counsel Robert Mueller from being fired. A Republican and two Democrats said Thursday they're among committee members working on legislation that would prevent the firing of special counsels without judicial review. They are Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrats Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. A Graham spokesman says the senator's still working on the bill, and it's unclear when it will be introduced. Graham has sternly warned Trump not to fire Mueller or Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He said Thursday there would be ""holy hell"" to pay if Trump fired Sessions. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley issued an indirect warning to the president about firing Sessions Wednesday night. He tweeted that everybody in Washington should be warned that his committee's agenda ""is set for the rest of 2017."" Judicial nominations would come first, followed by sub-Cabinet positions. ""AG no way,"" his tweet ended. Everybody in D.C. Shld b warned that the agenda for the judiciary Comm is set for rest of 2017. Judges first subcabinet 2nd / AG no way If the president were to fire Sessions and nominate a new attorney general, in hopes of appointing someone who would be able and willing to fire the special counsel probing Russia, that person would not be in place until after the end of the year, Grassley is suggesting. His tweet indicated he would not hold a confirmation hearing for a new AG until after the end of 2017.? That would mean that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would take over as attorney general, and he's the one who appointed Mueller to be special counsel.

"WASHINGTON?-- The U.S. will continue to permit transgender individuals to serve openly in the military until Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has received President Donald Trump's ""direction"" to change the policy and figured out how to implement it, the nation's top military officer said Thursday. In a memo to all military service chiefs, commanders and enlisted military leaders, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said ""there will be no modifications"" to current policy for now, amid questions about Trump's announcement on Twitter that the U.S. government will not ""accept or allow"" transgender people to serve in any capacity in the military. ""I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement,"" Dunford began, adding that nothing would change until the president's direction has been received by Mattis and Mattis has issued ""implementation guidance."" ""In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,"" Dunford wrote. ""As importantly, given the current fight and the challenges we face, we will all remain focused on accomplishing our assigned missions."" President Trump's decision to ban transgender service members appeared to come in response to a spending debate that had been taking place on Cap... The Dunford statement suggests that Mattis was given no presidential direction on changing the transgender policy. Mattis has been away on vacation this week and has been publicly silent amid questions about whether he favors Trump's announced ban. Dunford himself was not aware that Trump was going to announce a transgender service ban on Wednesday, a U.S. official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter and so spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump's announcement caught the Pentagon flat-footed and unable to explain what it called Trump's ""guidance."" His proclamation, on Twitter rather than any formal announcement, drew bipartisan denunciations and threw currently serving transgender soldiers into limbo. ""Please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,"" the commander in chief tweeted. Trump wrote that he had consulted with ""my generals and military experts,"" but he did not mention Mattis, the retired Marine general who less than one month ago told the military service chiefs to spend another six months weighing the costs and benefits of allowing transgender individuals to enlist. At the time, Mattis said this ""does not presuppose the outcome of the review,"" but Trump's tweets appeared to have done just that. The Pentagon has refused to release any data on the number of transgender people currently serving. A Rand Corp. study has estimated the number at between 1,320 and 6,630 out of 1.3 million active-duty troops. Criticism for Trump's action was immediate and strong from both political parties. His action is ""harmful, misguided and weakens, not strengthens our military,"" said Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. John McCain, the Arizona Republican and Vietnam War hero, said Trump was simply wrong. ""Any American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving,"" he said. ""There is no reason to force service members who are able to fight, train and deploy to leave the military -- regardless of their gender identity."" Not everyone at the Capitol agreed. Rep. Duncan Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said, ""The president's decision was the absolute right decision. ... It's about time that a decision is made to restore the warrior culture and allow the U.S. military to get back to business."" Transgender people already in uniform were concerned about what comes next. ""Everybody is hurt, everybody is scared,"" said Rudy Akbarian, 26, who is in the military but did not want to identify his branch. Akbarian, who said his chain of command was supportive as he transitioned from female to male, said his time to re-enlist is coming up and he might stay to ensure there is a strong voice for transgender troops like himself. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Defense Department was working with the White House to ""address the new guidance"" from Trump. That suggested there is not yet any new written policy or executive order. Trump's sudden declaration appears to halt a decades-long trend toward more inclusive policies on military service, including the repeal in 2010 of a ban on gays serving openly. President Bill Clinton in 1993 began the push to allow gays to serve. In December 2015, President Barack Obama's Pentagon chief, Ash Carter, announced that all military positions would be open to women. Liberalizing policy on transgender troops was the next step. Just last week, when asked about the transgender issue at a Senate hearing, Gen. Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, ""I am an advocate of every qualified person who can meet the physical standards to serve in our uniformed services to be able to do so."" He mentioned no opposition among service chiefs to allowing transgender service. Transgender service members have been able to serve openly since 2016, when Carter ended the ban. Since Oct. 1, transgender troops could receive medical care and start changing their gender identifications in the Pentagon's personnel system. Carter also gave the services until July 1 to develop policies to allow people already identifying as transgender to join the military if they meet normal standards and have been stable in their identified genders for 18 months. On June 30, Mattis extended the July 1 deadline to next Jan. 1, saying the services should study the impact on the ""readiness and lethality of our forces."" That is the prism through which Mattis has viewed most, if not all, personnel issues. Just last week he ordered a high-level Pentagon review aimed at verifying that all military personnel policies ""support and enhance warfighting readiness and force lethality."" In a series of tweets, Trump said allowing transgender troops to serve is an unacceptable burden on the military's ability to fight and win wars. ""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail,"" he wrote. The Rand Corp., a federally funded think tank, has estimated that extending gender transition-related health care coverage to transgender personnel would cost the military $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year, out of a yearly Pentagon budget of more than $600 billion. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump had made ""a military decision."" She said it was his judgment that allowing transgender service ""erodes military readiness and unit cohesion."" Sanders said the ""president's national security team was part of this consultation"" and that Trump ""informed"" Mattis of his decision immediately after he made it on Tuesday.

"Last Updated Jul 27, 2017 1:57 PM EDT Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke delivered a warning to GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, about her vote on the health care bill, CBS News Nancy Cordes confirmed in an interview Thursday morning.? ""I did have a conversation with the secretary, and he told me what I already knew, which was that the president wasn't pleased with the vote that I had taken, and I knew that,"" Murkowski told Cordes.? The Alaska Dispatch News first reported the conversation and said that Zinke had also called her fellow Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, who is also a Republican. After President Trump blasted Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, for opposing a motion to proceed to open the health care debate, According to the Alaska Dispatch, Zinke said that Murkowski's ""no"" vote on Tuesday put Alaska's relationship with the Trump administration in jeopardy. Murkowski told Cordes, ""The reality is that it was a difficult conversation,"" but she didn't think that the idea of a threat was an ""appropriate"" characterization. Some issues and pending legislation items that both senators care about could now be at risk, the Alaska Dispatch said, such as nominations of Alaskans to positions in the administration, drilling projects in Alaska and an effort to build a road through a wildlife refuge. ""I'm not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop,"" Sullivan told the newspaper about the threat from Zinke, who delivered what the senator called a ""troubling message."" ""I tried to push back on behalf of all Alaskans. ＃ We're facing some difficult times and there's a lot of enthusiasm for the policies that Secretary Zinke and the president have been talking about with regard to our economy. But the message was pretty clear,"" Sullivan added, according to the report. If Zinke were to to stop Alaskan drilling projects, it would contradict the boost he attempted to give the oil and natural gas industry a couple of months ago. In May, he declared, ""The only path for energy dominance is a path through the great state of Alaska."" And he signed an order encouraging more production in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and calling for an update of current assessments of oil and natural gas resources in Alaska's North Slope.? Murkowski and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, were the only two Senate Republicans who opposed a motion to proceed to open debate on the House-passed heath care bill on Tuesday. Sullivan voted in favor of the motion.?																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Jul 28, 2017 1:35 AM EDT CBS News' Rebecca Shabad, Emily Tillett, John Nolen and Kathryn Watson have contributed to this developing story. The Senate is set for a midnight vote on the ""skinny repeal"" bill, only two hours after the text of the legislation -- called the Health Care Freedom Act -- was released.? The bill repeals the individual and employer mandates, among a few other key Republican objectives. On Wednesday, a vote to simply repeal Obamacare failed to attract enough votes, with seven Republican senators voting against the measure.? President Trump has made it clear that he believes this is Republican's final chance to repeal and replace President Obama's signature legislation, as he pledged to do on the campaign trail. Mr. Trump urged senators not to leave Washington, D.C., for August recess before they do.? Around 10 p.m., the Senate introduced the text of the ""skinny repeal,"" now called the Health Care Freedom Act, not long before an expected midnight vote? Several key senators said they would not vote for a ""skinny repeal"" vote without an accompanying guarantee from the House that it will go to conference and not pass as it is, meaning the bill will almost certainly fail without further developments? A single payer system amendment offered by Sen. Daines fails in the Senate, 57-0, after failing to secure a single ""yes"" vote. 43 senators voted ""present."" Sen. John McCain, Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Sen. Susan Collins voted no on the ""skinny repeal"" bill,?dooming its fate.? Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) are having a long discussion ahead of the much-anticipated health care vote, ostensibly so Pence can persuade McCain to vote for the bill. Earlier in the day, McCain had said he wouldn't vote for the ""skinny repeal"" without an assurance from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan that the bill would go to conference. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) eventually joined the conversation.? The proposal from Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington) to send the ""skinny repeal"" bill or Health Care Freedom Act back to committee failed, as expected.? The next vote should be the main one, although senators are stalling. Vice President Mike Pence arrived at the U.S. Capitol around 11:30 p.m. Thursday, ahead of a health care vote series expected around midnight. As the vice president, he reserves the power to cast a tie-breaking vote, if necessary.? President Trump urged Republican senators to do something about Obamacare late Thursday night, although it's unclear specifically what he is advocating.? Go Republican Senators, Go! Get there after waiting for 7 years. Give America great healthcare! The Congressional Budget Office late Thursday released an estimate on the Health Care Freedom Act, which shows 16 million more people would be uninsured by 2026. It would also increase premiums by 20 percent compared to current law between 2018 and 2026. The American Medical Association released this statement from its president, David Barbe, opposing the ""skinny repeal"" proposal: ""Action is needed to address problems in the individual insurance market, but the so-called 'skinny' bill is a toxic prescription that would make matters worse,"" Barbe said. ""Eliminating the individual mandate will lead to adverse selection, triggering higher premiums and further destabilizing the individual market. The stated goal was to advance policies to lower premiums, but the 'skinny' bill would do the exact opposite, harming patients across the country.? Senators are expected to begin voting shortly after midnight, although other votes will come before any vote on the main bill.? Here is the text. The bill would do the following: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the legislation restores freedom to aspects of health care that Obamacare took away.? ""I would urge everyone to support it,"" McConnell said.? This bill apparently requires a simple majority to pass, not 60 votes.? Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), one of the handful of Republican who said he would not vote for the ""skinny repeal"" bill unless he received absolute assurances from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan that the bill would go to conference instead of becoming law as-is, said he is satisfied with Ryan's approach. Ryan earlier in the evening said he would permit the skinny repeal bill to go to conference in the House, but only after it first went to conference in the Senate.? Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), one of the other key senators who opposed passing skinny repeal without assurances from Ryan earlier in the day, said Ryan's statement wasn't sufficient to persuade him to vote for the bill as it stands.? The Senate is an amendment to the bill proposed by Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nevada) to repeal Obamacare's so-called ""Cadillac"" tax, 52-48. The Obamacare measure imposed a 40 percent tax on the cost of employer-sponsored health care coverage for individuals whose annual premiums are higher than $10,800, and families whose annual premiums exceed $29,050. The tax was intended to curb health care spending by penalizing wealthy people who have the most robust health care plans.? An attempt from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) to send the bill back to a Senate committee for further study failed, 43-57. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan released a statement saying the ""burden remains on the Senate"" to prove it can come up with a passable bill, saying the House will go to conference -- but not before the Senate does.? The Senate, Ryan said in a statement, must pass a conference bill first.? Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) said Ryan's statement was not enough for him to move forward with ""skinny repeal."" Obamacare is collapsing and hurting American families. We have to keep working at this until we get the job done. https://t.co/ypv3TV2eZ0 pic.twitter.com/7JlFgb1z4S Republican members of the House will convene on Capitol Hill at 9 a.m. to determine a path forward on health care. It's unclear if there will be any more direction from House leaders Thursday night, after key Republican senators said they will not vote to pass the ""skinny repeal"" bill unless they are guaranteed the House will conference on it so it isn't standalone legislation.? Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, spoke to reporters before the Graham/McCain press conference and said he personally opposes the skinny repeal because it could increase premiums and doesn't fulfill their promise to repeal Obamacare.? He said he doesn't think that the skinny repeal has the votes in the House, and leadership in the House and Senate know this. Key Republican senators Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) said they will not vote for the skinny plan alone without a guarantee from Speaker of the House Paul Ryan that it will go to conference and not become law.? Without their support -- Republicans can only afford to lose two votes -- the skinny plan cannot pass.? ""The skinny bill as policy is a disaster,"" said Graham, flanked by his Republican colleagues and calling the skinny bill alone a ""fraud."" Graham said the skinny bill is not a repeal of Obamacare, and if Republicans pass that plan alone, they will be responsible for the collapse of health care.? ""I'd rather get out of the way and let it collapse than have a half-ass approach that is not our problem,"" Graham said. McCain said the ""status quo"" of Obamacare is not satisfactory, but he also can't support the skinny plan as it stands.? Johnson said he has a very simple request: Guarantee a conference immediately after skinny repeal. The skinny bill alone, he said, doesn't come close to keeping Republicans' promise to repeal Obamacare.? Graham said passing the skinny plan alone would be the ""dumbest thing"" in political history.? Rep. Mark Meadows (R-North Carolina), who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus has said the skinny plan alone will be dead on arrival in the House.? America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP)? addressed a letter to Senate leaders, calling for short-term stability and longer-term improvements in the individual health insurance market and emphasizing that the deadline is rapidly approaching for insurers to make final decisions about their premiums and participation for 2018. The letter read, ""This continued uncertainty 每 combined with targeted proposals that would eliminate key elements of current law without new stabilizing solutions 每 will not solve the problems in the individual market, and in fact will result in higher premiums, fewer choices for consumers, and fewer people covered next year."" It went on to say, ""We would oppose an approach that eliminates the individual coverage requirement, does not offer alternative continuous coverage solutions, and does not include measures to immediately stabilize the individual market."" The CEO of AHIP previously sent leadership a letter slamming the Cruz amendment as ""simply unworkable."" Speaking on the floor, Ron Wyden of Oregon slammed the skinny repeal plan, saying ""who knows what was done at the GOP lunch today between the salad course and the entree."" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, advised members that while last votes are currently scheduled for Friday before their scheduled recess, the ""House schedule is subject to change"" depending on what the Senate produces on health care.? Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio told reporters on Thursday, ""The leadership team said the intention was if we vote on a final bill we would get it to the House. With that understanding I'm going to support it, I don't know the final product, you'd have to ask them.""? He added, ""I don't think it's a replacement, want to be sure we're going into conference."" The single payer system amendment offered by Sen. Daines fails in the Senate after failing to secure a single ""yes"" vote in its favor.? Graham says skinny repeal a ""trust but verify situation""? Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters he still needs confirmation that his amendment being put forth is ""conferenceable"" but that the House will also agree to having a conference in the first place before moving forward on a vote to support the skinny repeal plan.? Graham said he has faith that Republican leadership would assure him either way.? ""My guess is we're very close to the votes and well have the votes,"" Sen. Blunt of Missouri told reporters of the progress on the skinny repeal plan.? He added, ""I think we'll get it done tonight,"" noting that the plan is a ""significant step in right direction to go to conference."" ""Fat or skinny or anorexic or bulimic, I don't know yet, I know it's kind of messy,? but it's pretty in a way because this is how democracy works,"" the Louisiana Senator says of the skinny repeal plan. ? Kennedy says that everyone will be able to offer their amendment, saying ""there will be hundreds, maybe thousands"" offered.? The Senate comes to session to vote on a on the single payer amendment plan offered by Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana who opposes the single-payer system. The effort is largely seen by Democrats as a ""political trick"" by Republicans to force Democrats to be on the record where they stand on Single payer system.? Daines is not expected to vote for his own amendment.? ""This is a political stunt in the midst of the unprecedented and disastrous process Republicans have undertaken to repeal the Affordable Care Act,"" wrote Sen. Bernie Sanders in a statement. ""I truly don't know when it's gonna be released, its still a work in progress,"" Collins of Maine told reporters on Thursday Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin echoes his colleagues calls for a skinny repeal plan to usher in a move toward conference.? Sen. Bob Corker would not get into details of the skinny repeal plan, but told reporters that, ""the substance of this is not revelenat, what's relevant is getting to conference."" He added, that Senators ""want to be assured"" that this is a ""lifeline to the conference."" Sen. Steve Daines told reporters, ""We need to do a repeal and replace of Obamacare and the skinny bill, in my opinion, is only like a motion to proceed, it's a vehicle to move forward.? Sen. Lindsey Graham said he is a ""no"" on the skinny repeal plan if the Graham-Cassidy amendment cannot be included in a conference agreement.? Graham told reporters on Thursday that he is set to meet with the Senate parliamentarian and Sen. McCain this afternoon to see if his amendment would be able to be included in conference, giving it a ""chance to build it out."" If it is, Graham said, ""I'll move forward with the skinny bill, but I told everybody this cannot be the final product."" He added, ""About half the conference would not tolerate having the skinny bill be our final answer on health care. "" ""If they send it back over and say this is the best we can do, no way, because if you passed it as a standalone, it will destroy the insurance markets and we would own the failure of Obamcare.? When asked if he knew of any details of what was currently included in the skinny plan, he responded, ""the skinny bill is getting bigger."" Asked by a reporter on Capitol Hill if he was ""not a definite yes at this point"" on the skinny repeal approach to the health care bill, Sen. McCain responded, ""no certainly not."" He added, ""I'll have to look at it, but it depends on how my governor feels as far as the provisions and what those concerns are."" Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee joined the chorus of his Republican colleagues in saying many Senators have no idea what the ""skinny repeal"" plan entails exactly. Corker told reporters, however, ""What I have in my pocket is very different than what was being discussed on the floor yesterday."" Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby told reporters on Thursday that while Senators ""don't know what is going to happen today, I'm hopeful we can pass the skinny bill."" He added, ""While I'm straight out repeal and replace later, I think we got to get what we can get, and do what we can do. That's part of the legislative process, I hope it'll work today, but we'll see."" As Shelby explained to reporters that politicians have to ""keep their word"" to their constituents, a protester with Epilespy approached Shelby in his gaggle with reporters, explaining to the Senator, ""I would never be covered under what your proposing."" Shelby responded to the protester's pleas, ""Any group that's underserved, for medical, we ought to protect."" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, says that while he'd prefer the Senate's final health care plan to be a ""fuller bill"", the skinny repeal approach is a step in the right direction toward reform.? ""I suspect we'll find that this is going to be a continuing, bubbling up situation until we really go through the hole situation,"" Hatch added. Hatch conceded that while much of the debate over what Senators were actually voting for on Thursday was up in the air, he said Republicans are ""hopeful that we'll have a little better cooperation on tax reform."" Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont says that state waivers largely violate the Senate's rules according to the Senate Parliamentarian, requiring a majority of 60-votes to pass.? The issues of waivers is just another section of original BCRA, the repeal and replace plan, that violates the Senate's Byrd Rule.? Under the Byrd rule, according to the ?the Senate is ""prohibited from considering extraneous matter as part of a reconciliation bill or resolution or conference report thereon."" The definition of what constitutes 'extraneous matter' is set in the Budget Act; however, the term remains subject to considerable interpretation by the presiding officer.? Under current law, 1332 waivers allow states to waive certain Affordable Care Act provisions as long as they can ensure that they cover the same number of people, same level of services and same protections against high out of pocket costs. ""The function of reconciliation is to adjust federal spending and revenue, not to enact major changes in social policy. The parliamentarian's latest decision reveals once again that Republicans have abused the reconciliation process in an attempt to radically change one-sixth of the American economy by repealing the Affordable Care Act,"" said Sanders in a statement. Ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon echoed Sanders comments, saying in a statement, ""Today's decision confirms that Senate Republicans cannot use their partisan, go-it-alone reconciliation process to water down key consumer safeguards like protection for people with pre-existing conditions and essential health benefits that Americans count on today."" The Senate majority leader said in remarks on the Senate floor Thursday morning that, ""Senators will have the opportunity to consider many, many more amendments tonight. I know that colleagues in both parties are eager to do so. I encourage Senators with health-care ideas 〞 whether Republicans, Democrats, or Independents 〞 to bring their amendments to the floor."" He added, ""I urge everyone to keep working hard so we can get this over the finish line 〞 it's what our constituents, and our country, deserve."" The Senate GOP Conference is expected to meet behind closed doors Thursday for lunch to discuss the next steps forward on health care.? Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said Democrats would not continue offering amendments to the bill until they see the Republican plan.? The upper chamber is scheduled to vote after Senate lunches Thursday on an amendment proposed by Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, that will ask senators whether they support a single-payer health care system.? ?

"Amid brewing speculation that President Trump is planning to issue his next firing in the form of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa is warning Mr. Trump that lawmakers will be hard-pressed to confirm a new pick anytime this year.?

Grassley indicated that it will be quite some time before a replacement is confirmed by the Senate.? Lawmakers have already expressed their lack of interest in following through with a recess appointment as Congress is set to go on their August break sometime in the next few weeks.? When pressed on the president's possible intentions to bring in a new attorney general during the recess, Rep.

Fellow lawmakers have also come out publicly against?Mr. Trump's recent string of comments against Sessions and sided with their former colleague, including South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham who called the president's critical tweets ""inappropriate.""

"President Trump on Saturday urged Senate Republicans to take up another health care bill ""before voting on any other bill,"" saying they will unless they're ""total quitters,"" and threatening to end ""bailouts"" for insurance companies and members of Congress if they don't. But only the day before, after Senate Republicans' attempt to repeal parts of Obamacare failed in a drama-filled, middle-of-the-night vote, the president tweeted, ""As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!"" The latest tweets from the president on Saturday indicate that, even as the House and Senate leave for August recess, he will pressure them to charge ahead.? The president's tweet about ""bailouts"" ending for insurance companies could refer to cost-sharing subsidies, which are payments the federal government makes under Obamacare to insurance companies to subsidize lower health-care costs for low-income families. That tweet came after the president spent the morning on Twitter railing against the ""very outdated filibuster rule,"" saying the Senate should only need 51 votes, not 60. The Senate health care bill failed to gain 51 votes, attracting 49 votes in favor. If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon! Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters, Repeal & Replace is not dead! Demand another vote before voting on any other bill! But, despite the president's urging that the Senate take up another health care bill before voting on anything else, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) made it clear that his chamber is moving on to other things. ""It is time to move on,"" McConnell said when the Health Care Freedom Act failed early Friday morning, noting the other unrelated topics the Senate would take up in the hours ahead.?

"Weary Republicans in Washington may be ready to move on from health care, but conservatives across the United States are warning the GOP-led Congress not to abandon its pledge to repeal the Obama-era health law - or risk a political nightmare in next year's elections. The Senate's failure this past week to pass repeal legislation has outraged the Republican base and triggered a new wave of fear. The stunning collapse has exposed a party so paralyzed by ideological division that it could not deliver on its top campaign pledge. After devoting months to the debate and seven years to promising to kill the Affordable Care Act, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky., simply said: ""It's time to move on."" But that's simply not an option for a conservative base energized by its opposition to the health law. Local party leaders, activists and political operatives are predicting payback for Republicans lawmakers if they don't revive the fight. ""This is an epic fail for Republicans,"" said Tim Phillips, president of Americans For Prosperity, the political arm of the conservative Koch Brothers' network. ""Their failure to keep their promise will hurt them. It will."" To the American Conservative Union, the three Republican senators who blocked the stripped-down repeal bill that failed in the wee hours Friday are ""sellouts."" A Trump-sanctioned super political action committee did not rule out running ads against uncooperative Republicans, which it did recently against Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada. There are limited options for directly punishing the renegade senators 〞 John McCain of Arizona, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. None of the three is up for re-election next fall. McCain, whose dramatic ""no"" vote killed the bill, is serving his last term in office, has brain cancer and is hardly moved by electoral threats. While most Americans were sleeping, the 7-year Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare died on the floor of the Senate. GOP Sens. John ... Still, broad disillusionment among conservative voters could have an impact beyond just a few senators. Primary election challenges or a low turnout could mean trouble for all Republicans. Democrats need to flip 24 seats to take control of the House of Representatives, a shift that would dramatically re-shape the last two years of President Trump's first term. ""If you look at competitive districts, swing districts, or districts where Republicans could face primary challenges, this is something that will be a potent electoral issue,"" Republican pollster Chris Wilson said of his party's health care failure. ""I don't think this is something voters are going to forget."" One such challenger has emerged. Conservative activist Shak Hill, a former Air Force pilot, plans to run against second-term GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock in a competitive northern Virginia district. Hill told The Associated Press that Comstock, who voted against a GOP House health care repeal bill in May, ""has failed the moral test of her time in Congress."" The leaders of other groups, such as Women Vote Trump, have begun to court primary challengers to punish those members of Congress deemed insufficiently committed to President Donald Trump's agenda. ""I expect that we will get involved in primaries,"" said the group's co-founder, Amy Kremer. ""You cannot continue to elect the same people over and over again and expect different results."" On Capitol Hill, some Republicans insist their health care overhaul could be saved in the short term. Yet party leaders - backed by outside groups - are signaling that they would probably move on to taxes. Republicans hoped the issue would bring some party unity, even as realists in Washington view the a tax overhaul - something that hasn't happened in more than 30 years - as one of the most complex legislative projects possible. The Trump administration has become engulfed in internal drama over personnel and personalities. Mr. Trump on Friday ousted his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and replacing him with Home Security Secretary John Kelly. The president did not appear to share conservatives' outrage about the Senate's vote, but repeated his promises to remake the health system. ""You can't have everything,"" Mr. Trump said, adding: ""We'll get it done. We're going to get it."" Around the country, Republican voters continue to support efforts to repeal former President Barack Obama's health law, even if there is little agreement on an alternative. A CNN poll released last week found that 83 percent of Republicans favor some form of repeal, while only 11 percent of Republicans want the party to abandon the repeal effort. Among all adults, 52 percent of voters favor some sort of repeal, with 34 percent favored repeal only if replacement could be enacted at the same time. ""The political pressure on something like this is real,"" said GOP strategist Mike Shields. ""I don't think this is over."" Chief political correspondent at Slate and CBS News political contributor Jamelle Bouie joins ""CBS This Morning: Saturday"" from Washington to dis... Like others Republican operatives, Shields said the party's ability to enact the rest of Mr. Trump's agenda - taxes, infrastructure and the border wall - could help ""mitigate how upset people will be"" about health care. ""If this is part of a general trend,"" he said of the GOP's governing struggles, ""I think that can be pretty disastrous for 2018."" Republicans will be held responsible for any negative economic fallout from the current health system's failure, said Paul Shumaker, a North Carolina Republican pollster and senior adviser to Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. As early as October, voters are likely to see increased costs as insurance companies notify people about their new rates. By next October, it will be too late to unlink Republicans from the problem, Shumaker said. For now at least, many Trump supporters blame the Republican Party's problems on its leaders in Congress. ""They certainly didn't have their house in order,"" said Larry Wood of Waynesboro, Virginia, who voted for Trump only after supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the 2016 GOP primary. The 69-year-old retired homebuilder says the failure falls at the feet of Congress. Mr. Trump seems content to let the current system collapse. ""As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!"" he said in a tweet. --- Beaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.

"Last Updated Jul 29, 2017 2:02 PM EDT President Trump went after Senate Republicans in a series of tweets Saturday morning, calling for an end to the filibuster two days after the party's Obamacare repeal bill failed to attract a majority of senators. Mr. Trump called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to end the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to advance most legislation. The so-called ""skinny repeal"" bill that collapsed in the Senate early Friday morning was supported by just 49 Republican members. The very outdated filibuster rule must go. Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate. Mitch M, go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT'S TIME! Mr. Trump said his fellow Republicans in the upper chamber ""look like fools and are wasting time"" by preserving the filibuster. Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time...... ....8 Dems totally control the U.S. Senate. Many great Republican bills will never pass, like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare. Get smart! McConnell does not have the power to abolish the filibuster on his own, and has repeatedly said he does not support such a move. Under Senate rules, any change to the filibuster would require a majority of members to vote in favor -- a prospect that is unlikely, given widespread opposition to doing away with the tool. In April, 61 senators of both parties signed a letter to Senate leaders saying they would oppose eliminating the filibuster for legislation, which allows the minority party to influence bills. ""Regardless of our past disagreements on that issue, we are united in our determination to preserve the ability of members to engage in extended debate when bills are on the Senate floor,"" the letter said. ? McConnell likewise dismissed Mr. Trump's entreaties to eliminate the 60-vote requirement weeks later.? ""It would fundamentally change the way the Senate has worked for a very long time. We're not going to do that,"" McConnell said in May after Mr. Trump threatened to shut down the government and called for a 51-vote threshold. Senate Republicans say they are using the ""nuclear option"" after failing to end the Democrats' filibuster on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. ... In 2013, Democrats in the majority eliminated the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, with the exception of Supreme Court justices. In April, McConnell and Senate Republicans invoked the ""nuclear option,"" after Democrats tried to block a vote on nominee Neil Gorsuch, Mr. Trump's choice to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Antonin Scalia. The move eliminated the 60-vote threshold for nominees to the high court. But the filibuster remains in place for pieces of legislation. Senate Republicans sidestepped the legislative filibuster in their Obamacare repeal plan by using a legislative process known as reconciliation, which requires just 50 votes to pass measures affecting the budget. The repeal effort collapsed when three Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John McCain of Arizona -- voted against a last-ditch effort to pass a slimmed-down bill.

In the introduction of the novel, Clinton writes: ""In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I've often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net. Now I'm letting my guard down."" ?? According to Simon & Schuster, Clinton also addresses the ""challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics.""? Hillary Clinton delivered the commencement address at her alma mater, Wellesley College. She spoke to grads about how she's coping with her elect...

"It hasn't produced much. The only thing that's passed is the motion to proceed with the bill, which only formally opened debate. It's no surprise, really, given the slim Senate majority that allows for only two Republican defections -- and that's only on the amendments that can be passed with 51 votes. Some will require 60. On Tuesday night, the Senate GOP's main plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), failed 43-57 on a procedural vote.? A vote on a more ambitious repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was also defeated Wednesday 45-55, with seven Republicans defecting.? It's being called the ""skinny repeal."" ""Skinny,"" in this instance, does not mean streamlined or efficient. Its meaning is more akin to ""skin and bones,"" the bare minimum that might slip by senators this week. They also want to wrap in provisions that qualify for a 51-vote threshold rather than a supermajority, which would be 60 votes. In theory, it would eliminate the individual mandate, which required Americans to buy health insurance, and it would also dispense with the requirement that employers with at least 50 full-time employees offer health care coverage. The skinny repeal would also get rid of the tax on medical taxes, which helped pay for the ACA but is wildly unpopular with both Republicans and Democrats. But until we see the text of the bill, which hasn't been released yet, we don't know exactly what it will repeal. Senate Republicans were still discussing Wednesday what could be included. While Republicans are still unsure about what's actually in the ""skinny repeal,"" the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scored several provisions Wednesday that could wind up in such a measure, according to Senate Democrats. CBO projects that such a bill would leave 16 million more Americans uninsured, Senate Democrats say. A senior Senate Democratic aide says that CBO told Senate Democrats that it would result in premiums that are roughly 20 percent higher than under current law each year.? The following provisions were wrapped into this estimate: repeal of the individual and employer mandates, repeal of the medical device tax, defunding Planned Parenthood, a repeal of the Prevention and Public Health Fund and repeal of the Community Heath Center Fund. They don't like it.? Ohio Sen. Rob Portman is reserving judgment -- ""we'll see what's in it,"" he told reporters Wednesday. Meanwhile, Wisconsin's Ron Johnson similarly said that Republicans still don't really know what would be repealed. He wants ""a more organized process,"" though. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham won't vote for the plan unless he can get a commitment that his own amendment, which he introduced alongside fellow Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, will be part of conference negotiations. That amendment calls for the ACA's taxes on the wealthy to stay in place, and would also give more health care money to states.? ""If it's just the skinny bill,"" Graham told reporters, ""All of us will vote against it, that will not be a success, we're not going to trick our constituents.""? Tennessee's Bob Corker said Wednesday that he doesn't know what the skinny repeal looks like, but he feels that ""what you're really voting on is to try to keep the discussions alive between the House and Senate. It's not policy itself but we realize, you know, its try to create a bigger discussion about repeal in the House and Senate."" Nope -- if you believe Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, a conservative. It has ""zero chance,"" he told reporters Wednesday. No. It would then go into conference, where negotiators from the Senate and the House would go to work on a bill that could pass both houses. Here, Meadows says that the conferees would face ""unbelievable, unbearable"" pressure to fatten up the skinny repeal, figuratively speaking. ""We can't wait for seven years and seven months and the best we can send to the president is what he could have done almost by executive order? My constituents wouldn't be okay with that, and I don't think the majority of our constituency of Republicans would be okay with that,"" he said. Meadows thinks It would look similar to where the Senate bill originally was -- that is, the BCRA (which didn't pass the Senate) -- with ""a little bit more for Medicaid"" and risk pools for some consumers. But fellow House Republican Tom MacArthur, a moderate, seems dubious about this: ""I don't know how you repeal without a responsible replacement, and I don't know if just lifting mandates and some of the taxes...puts more stress on the current system."" The members of the conference who would decide what the compromise would look like are appointed by the leadership of the relevant House and Senate committees. So, if -- and this is a big if -- if the Senate passes its skinny repeal, the prospect for an identical bill to BCRA that can make it through both the House and Senate could come down to who the members of the conference are.? In any case, it wouldn't be easy. Bills almost never go into conference anymore, CBS News chief congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes notes. Congress has been getting worse and worse at compromising, and whenever possible, they try very hard to make sure the House passes the Senate's version of a bill or vice versa. ?

"Last Updated Jul 26, 2017 6:56 PM EDT After President Trump announced a surprise shift in policy directed at transgender people serving in the U.S. military, the members of the political world and LGBTQ community across the country are reacting to the administration's ban on openly trans service members. The ban reverses an Obama-era military policy in operation since last year, which allowed transgender service members to serve openly in the military after former?Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the previous ban, saying it was ""the right thing to do."" The new proposed policy drew immediate backlash for Mr. Trump's apparent reversal on his commitment to protecting the rights of the LGBTQ community: In response to Mr. Trump's policy announcement, Davis said in a statement, ""We will continue to work closely with the White House to address the new guidance provided by the Commander-in-Chief on transgender individuals serving the military.? We will provide revised guidance to the Department in the near future."" ""Today further exposed President Trump's overall goal to erase LGBTQ Americans from this nation. Trump has never been a friend to LGBTQ Americans, and this action couldn't make that any more clear."" Every patriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve. Full stop. so, biggest baddest most $$ military on earth cries about a few trans people ? but funds the F-35? ??sounds like cowardice ??? #WeGotThis Dremann, who served in Afghanistan in 2011, told CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan on Wednesday that Mr. Trump's decision ""impact[s] me absolutely personally."" ""I've done 11 deployments, including five strategic patrols,"" Dremann said. Dremann began transitioning from female to male in 2013 and said he was worried by Mr. Trump's tweets. Civil rights and veterans groups reacted with outrage after President Trump tweeted that transgender people will not be allowed to serve in the U... ""Transgender people are already serving in various aspects of the military honorably and they've shown no impact to readiness or the lethality of our mission,"" Dremann said. He said no American should be prevented from serving openly in the military. ""I do want to say to the service members that are currently transitioning in the military: Continue to do what you're doing,"" Dremann said. In a statement following the ban, Carter, who originally called for an end to the ban, said, ""Quality people in uniform are what make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever seen. I continue to maintain that what matters in choosing those who serve is that they are best qualified. To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military."" He added, ""This action would also send the wrong signal to a younger generation thinking about military service."" ""This is an outrageous and desperate action. The thousands of transgender service members serving on the front lines for this country deserve better than a commander-in-chief who rejects their basic humanity."" Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Blumenthal said of the policy ban, ""I think that the president's statement contravenes the doctrines of the military, and we'll have to review it in the Armed Services Committee."" In a statement following the ban, Duckworth, a combat veteran herself, said, ""When my Black Hawk helicopter was shot down in Iraq, I didn't care if the American troops risking their lives to help save me were gay, straight, transgender or anything else. All that mattered was they didn't leave me behind."" She added, ""If you are willing to risk your life for our country and you can do the job, you should be able to serve〞no matter your gender identity, sexual orientation or race. Anything else is discriminatory and counterproductive to our national security."" Speaking on the House floor, Kennedy said in response to Mr. Trump's tweets, ""When our bravest men and women raise their hand and volunteer to defend our nation, they defend all of her people. Rich and poor, young and old, democrat and republican, gay and straight. Americans of all races, religions, ethnicities, gender identities. Our soldiers do not discriminate. They don't offer to pay the ultimate sacrifice for some Americans and not for others. Their government owes them that same courtesy."" He added, ""To the thousands of brave transgender men and women serving today in uniform, please know that a grateful nation does not take your service, your patriotism for granted. you deserve better from your president, you deserve better from your government, you deserve better from your country."" The Vietnam War veteran and frequent advocate for vets said in a statement, ""The president's tweet this morning regarding transgender Americans in the military is yet another example of why major policy announcement should not be made via Twitter."" McCain went on to say the statement was ""unclear"" and that ""there is no reason to force service members who are able to fight, train and deploy to leave the military -- regardless of their gender identity."" The party leader said in a statement, ""This smacks of politics, pure and simple. The United States military?already?includes transgender individuals who protect our freedom day in and day out. Excommunicating transgender soldiers only weakens our readiness; it doesn't strengthen it."" Angelo added, ""The president's statement this morning does a disservice to transgender military personnel and reintroduces the same hurtful stereotypes conjured when openly gay men and women were barred from service during the military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' era. "" Graham, speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, echoed McCain's criticism that ""we shouldn't make policy by tweets."" He added that the Senate should have the Department of Defense ""over for a hearing"" to discuss the policy changes, saying he wants to hear from the military directly.? In a statement responding to Mr. Trump's announcement, Feinstein called the decision a ""step in the wrong direction."" ""Since becoming an all-volunteer force more than four decades ago, men and women of every race, religion, ethnicity, sexual preference and gender identity have proudly served in our armed forces."" She added, ""It's nothing more than cruel to tell the 15,000 transgender individuals currently serving honorably that they are no longer wanted just because of who they are. Democrats will do all we can to change this discriminatory policy."" ""There is no medically valid reason to exclude transgender individuals from military service. Transgender individuals are serving their country with honor, and they should be allowed to continue doing so. ""AMA policy also supports public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender dysphoria as recommended by the patient's physician. According to the Rand study on the impact of transgender individuals in the military, the financial cost is a rounding error in the defense budget and should not be used as an excuse to deny patriotic Americans an opportunity to serve their country. We should be honoring their service - not trying to end it."" ?																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Jul 26, 2017 11:00 PM EDT WASHINGTON -- Incoming White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has been promising to pursue leakers throughout the Trump administration, and now, it seems, he believes his own information has been leaked. On Wednesday night, Scaramucci tweeted: ""In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony. I will be contacting?@FBI?and the?@TheJusticeDept?#swamp?@Reince45"" A screengrab shows a tweet, which was later deleted, posted to White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci's account on July 26, 2017. The tweet was later deleted from Scaramucci's account. That mention of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus -- after #swamp -- in this tweet is a little mysterious. However, in the past few days, Priebus has seen two of his allies in the White House depart for reasons related to Scaramucci; outgoing press secretary Sean Spicer and another press aide, Michael Short. Multiple news organizations drew the link from the structure of Scaramucci's original tweet, reporting that he appeared to be suggesting that Priebus should be investigated in relation to leaking information to the media. Scaramucci, however, denied the insinuation, saying in a subsequent tweet that he was merely putting all leakers on notice that ""all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks.""? Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks. @Reince45 pic.twitter.com/AB0reseuX1 The Scaramucci tweet came after Politico reported Wednesday night on the income that the newly named White House communications director stands to collect, even while he's in his new public sector job. Between January 2016 and the end of June, he earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in Skybridge Capital and $5 million in salary, according to Politico's Lorraine Woellert. Woellert cited an Office of Government Ethics disclosure form that ""hasn't been previously reported."" But it's not a certainty that the document leaked. That form, likely a 278e personal financial disclosure form, can be requested from OGE by members of the media for journalistic purposes. Woellert may have done just that.? The Justice Department also responded to Scaramucci's tweet and agreed that leaks need to be contained. ""We have seen an astonishing increase in the number of leaks of classified national security information in recent months,"" said DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores in a statement. ""We agree with Anthony that these staggering number of leaks are undermining the ability of our government to function and to protect this country,"" she added. ""Like the Attorney General has said, 'Whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail,' and we will aggressively pursue leak cases wherever they may lead.""?

"A group of 10 governors, including Republicans, is urging the Senate to reject a proposal for a so-called ""skinny repeal"" of Obamacare. ""The Senate should also reject efforts to amend the bill into a 'skinny repeal,' which is expected to accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage,"" they said in a letter Wednesday to Senate leaders. The Republican governors who signed the letter are: The following Democratic governors also signed it: They are urging Senate Republicans to set aside the House-passed health care bill under consideration in the upper chamber, which they call ""flawed,"" and they call for bipartisan negotiations and to work directly with governors. The governors' positions could be a major factor in how senators from their states would vote this week. ""True, lasting reforms can only be achieved in an open, bipartisan fashion,"" they said. Congress should be working to stabilize the insurance market and make insurance more affordable, argued the governors, who said that the proposals pending in the Senate don't fulfill those goals. ""The bill still threatens coverage for millions of hardworking, middle class Americans. The bill's Medicaid provisions shift costs to states and fail to provide the necessary resources to ensure that no one is left out, including the working poor or those suffering from mental illness or addiction,"" they said. Two major proposals to dismantle the 2010 health care law failed in the Senate Tuesday and Wednesday. One would have repealed and replace Obamacare, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) and the other would have delivered a partial repeal of Obamacare, delayed for two years to come up with a replacement. Senate Republicans are now talking about a ""skinny repeal,"" which could repeal the individual and employer mandates as well as the medical device tax. They were still debating on Wednesday, however, what provisions could be wrapped in. They are aiming to include items that would qualify for a simple majority vote.																																																																																																																					"
"MOSCOW -- A bill that would slap new economic sanctions on Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election is hung up in the Senate. Some senators consider the bill too broad because it targets North Korea and Iran as well.? Understandably, the Russians don't like it either. Some of America's European allies are also opposed.

"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration authorized sanctions against 13 current and former officials of the Venezuelan government on Wednesday and threatened harsher action if Venezuela's president goes ahead with a controversial election. The announcement came four days before the vote to select members to an assembly tasked with rewriting the country's constitution. Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro established the controversial National Constituent Assembly by decree amid a growing political and humanitarian crisis. The White House said the election would strengthen Maduro's grip on power and solidify his status as a dictator. The bridge that connects Venezuela and C迆cuta, Colombia, has always been a busy border crossing, but the number of Venezuelans walking into Colom... On July 16, over 7 million Venezuelans voted overwhelmingly against establishing the assembly in a symbolic referendum called by the opposition. Opponents believe the assembly is meant to circumvent the Venezuelan parliament and act as a rubber stamp for Maduro. Maduro called the vote illegal. The individuals targeted by the Treasury Department include the vice president of Venezuela's state owned oil company, the national police chief, the national elections director, the country's ombudsman and the Venezuelan army chief. In a statement, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin threatened further sanctions against anyone elected to the National Constituent Assembly. During a briefing with reporters on Wednesday outlining the sanctions, a senior White House official called the upcoming election a ""critical line that if crossed could be the end of democracy in Venezuela."" ""Designations that the U.S. will be making this afternoon reflect the U.S. commitment to use all the economic diplomatic and legal tools available to us to respond to extraordinary threats Venezuela's democratic institutions face,"" the official said. The official also said President Trump is considering even tougher action targeting the Venezuelan economy if Maduro presses ahead with the Sunday vote. Those measures could include a ban on Venezuelan gas imports, the White House said, which could further cripple the oil-rich nation's economy. An anti-government activist is assisted and carried away on a motorbike during clashes with the police during a 48-hour general strike called by the opposition, in Caracas on Wed., July 26, 2017. ""All options are on the table to take after the July 30 voting of the Constituent Assembly,"" the official said. ""It is certainly our hope that Maduro will change his position and not go through with the Constituent Assembly."" Maduro showed no signs of backing down on Wednesday. On Twitter shortly after the sanctions were announced, Maduro retweeted an interview with RT in which he said he will not suspend the election, slated for Sunday. Maduro said opposition members should compete in the election and join the National Constituent Assembly. Maduro later appeared on national television to present the sanctioned officials with swords. He called the U.S. sanctions ""insolent"" and said the assembly will be Venezuela's ""revenge."" Maduro is presenting the sanctioned officials with swords en cadena. He says constituent assembly will be Venezuela's ""revenge"" pic.twitter.com/fEFqMOa9DB The Venezuelan president came to power in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez. Under Maduro's watch, Venezuela's economy has careened off a cliff. Economic mismanagement and corruption have led to food shortages that have?left millions on the verge of starvation. Over 100 protesters have been killed during clashes over the past four months, and the U.S. estimates 430 political prisoners are currently being held by Maduro's regime. Maduro has claimed that the Constituent Assembly, which has the power to rewrite the constitution, is the only peaceful way forward for the volatile nation. The Trump administration's announcement of additional sanctions came hours after opposition groups launched a 48-hour nationwide strike to boycott Sunday's vote. Administration officials would not comment on the effect sanctions may have in the case of Josh Holt, a 25-year-old American who has been imprisoned in Venezuela for over a year.

"Thirty-five percent of Americans approve of President Trump's job performance, according to a Reuters poll released Wednesday. Fifty-nine percent disapprove of the job the president is doing. The new data mark a bit of a drop in Mr. Trump's poll numbers: less than two weeks ago, on July 14, the president's approval rating in the same Reuters survey stood at 42 percent, and his disapproval rating stood at 55 percent. A Gallup poll released Wednesday had similar findings: just 37 percent of Americans nationwide said they approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing as president, while 58 percent said they disapprove. The president's numbers were a bit better -- but still underwater -- in an Economist survey released Wednesday. In that poll, Mr. Trump's approval rating among registered voters was 41 percent, and his disapproval rating was 54 percent. Dan Senor, senior advisor to Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan in the 2012 presidential campaign, joins ""CBS This Morning"" to discuss Donald Trump's appr... The Economist poll also documented how Americans view Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed by the Department of Justice to oversee the investigation into Russian election meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Mr. Trump has, in recent days, publicly criticized both Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation preceded the appointment of a special counsel. The president's criticism has led to speculation that he may be preparing to fire Mueller or Sessions, or both. Only 17 percent of registered voters in the Economist poll said they believe Mr. Trump should fire Mueller. A majority -- 51 percent -- said the president should not fire the special counsel. Fifty-four percent said they approve of the Justice Department's decision to appoint Mueller to head the investigation. Twenty-six percent said they disapprove of that move. Make sure you tune into Face the Nation this Sunday for an in-depth look at new poll numbers from our CBS News/YouGov Nation Tracker survey. The Reuters poll surveyed 1,532 Americans over a five-day period, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percent. The Gallup poll surveyed 1,500 Americans between July 23 and July 25, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus three percent. The Economist poll surveyed 1,232 registered voters nationwide between July 23 and July 25, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.

"Last Updated Jul 26, 2017 4:18 PM EDT A proposal that would partially repeal Obamacare fell short of the 51 votes needed to pass it Wednesday afternoon, dealing yet another blow to the GOP effort to roll back the 2010 health care law. The Senate rejected the plan in a 45-55 vote. All Democrats voted against it, along with seven Republicans. They are: All of them except Collins voted in favor of a nearly identical proposal two years ago. Republicans needed a simple majority, 51 votes, rather than a supermajority to pass it because they were using the budget reconciliation process.? The vote was among a number of amendments that are being debated and voted on in the Senate this week as Republicans try to find consensus on a repeal plan. The text of the legislation mirrors a bill that the Senate passed in 2015 that President Obama then vetoed. Under the measure, most of Obamacare would be repealed, but that wouldn't take effect for two years, giving Republicans time to come up with a replacement plan. Three Senate Republicans came out against this idea last week: Susan Collins, Shelley Moore Capito and Lisa Murkowski. This plan could also be even more complicated if Democrats retake control of any part of Congress in 2019. CBO projected earlier this month that 32 million more people would be left without health insurance in 2026. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, was a major proponent of this repeal plan because it delivered what he called a ""clean repeal"" of the law. It went further than other Republican proposals in terms of repealing the law.? The vote was originally scheduled for earlier in the day, but it was delayed until the afternoon so that a procedural issue could be hashed out.? This comes a day after Senate Republicans' most comprehensive plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), failed 43-57 late Tuesday after it required 60 votes. This contained a proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that would allow insurers to sell less expensive bare-bones plans alongside plans that comply with stricter Obamacare standards. And a proposal was added from Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, that would ""assist low-income people moving off of Medicaid and onto private insurance plans,"" according to an aide to McConnell. The last option that Republicans are discussing is a so-called ""skinny repeal,"" which would repeal Obamacare's individual and employer mandates as well as the medical device tax. They want to wrap in any provision that could qualify for only 51 votes. Senate Republicans say this would allow them to move to a conference committee and further negotiate a deal with House Republicans. The chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, however, Rep. Mark Meadows, said that the ""skinny repeal"" couldn't pass the House. ""Oh, no. There's zero chance,"" he told reporters. Asked if he's okay with a conference committee, he added, ""Yeah. I would prefer they get a deal done before and that way we do an up or down over here. But if it's coming back skinny it won't be an up or down vote.""

"Rep. Mo Brooks, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Alabama, said Wednesday that he would drop out of the race if his GOP primary rivals also step aside to make way for Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Sessions, who has been heavily criticized by President Trump in recent days, is the previous occupant of the seat Brooks is running for. Sen. Luther Strange was appointed as Sessions' successor, but will have to defend the seat against Brooks, Judge Roy Moore, and a number of other Republican challengers in next month's GOP primary. In a statement released Wednesday, Brooks referred to Mr. Trump's treatment of Sessions as a ""public waterboarding."" ""I cannot remain silent about the treatment Jeff Sessions is receiving from President Trump,"" said in a statement. ""If the President has reservations about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, that is okay. No two people agree all the time. But President Trump should raise his reservations with Attorney General Sessions privately, man to man, one on one, not publicly scorn a great man like this."" Brooks solution is to allow Sessions to reclaim his Senate seat in the Republican-dominated state. To do that, Brooks said he would drop out of the race so long as his Republican opponents do the same. ""If all Republican candidates collectively agree to simultaneously withdraw from this race, then we clear the way for the Republican Party of Alabama to nominate Jeff Sessions to be the Republican nominee for the December 12, 2017 general election,"" Brooks said. He can return to the Senate where he has served us so well. [The] President can then appoint whomever he wants as Attorney General."" According to Brooks, he has not discussed the proposal with Sessions, who has given no sign that he intends to quit his current job or return to the Senate.?

"Last Updated Jul 26, 2017 5:20 PM EDT In laying out his reasons for moving on Wednesday to?ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, President Donald Trump cited the ""tremendous medical costs"" associated with the policy. ? His claim raises several immediate questions, such as exactly how much the Department of Defense spends on providing health care for transgender service members, as well as whether there are enough transgender people in the armed forces to move the needle on the department's annual $6 billion in health care spending on active-duty forces. ....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you The answer? President Trump's assertion that permitting transgender people in the armed services entails major health care costs appears to be overblown, based on estimates from the think tank RAND, which?was asked by the Department of Defense to study the issue last year. Health care costs for treating active members who want to transition to another gender would increase by between $2.4 million to $8.4 million annually, RAND found. That translates to 0.04 percent to 0.13 percent of the agency's annual spending on health care. ""Our study found that the number of U.S. transgender service members who are likely to seek transition-related care is so small that a change in policy will likely have a marginal impact on health care costs and the readiness of the force,"" the Rand researchers wrote.? Likewise, a 2015 study in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that the health care costs related to transition for transgender service members ""is too low to warrant consideration in the current policy debate."" Its author estimated the costs at $5.6 million annually, or ""little more than a rounding error."" Mr. Trump's announcement reverses an Obama-era military policy that began last year under which transgender service members may openly serve in the military. Since that policy was implemented, transgender troops have been able to receive medical care and start changing their gender identification in the Pentagon's personnel system.? When former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced the transgender service policies in 2016, he cited RAND's estimate that about 2,500 people, out of 1.3 million active-duty service members, are transgender.? ""The medical treatment that service members who are currently transgender requires fairly straightforward, well-understood,"" Carter said at the time in a press briefing to discuss the policy. RAND was ""able to make those estimates. And that was, as they said, minimal."" Some military personnel are already in the process of changing gender, or have been formally approved to change gender. The numbers are small, however, with the Associated Press noting it currently stands at about 250 service members.? NEW: Former Defense Secretary Ash Carter responds to President Trump's Transgender Ban pic.twitter.com/p8jY1FfXDZ Carter spoke out on Wednesday against President Trump's transgender ban in a statement to CBS Evening News. "" To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in the military,"" he said. ""There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably."" Some conservatives said they supported President Trump's ban. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Missouri said Wednesday in a statement that ""sex-change surgeries"" would ""cost more than a billion dollars over the next ten years."" She didn't cite a source for her estimate.? Even if the military spent at the top end of the estimated range for health care on transgender service members -- $8.4 million per year -- it would reportedly represent a fraction of what it spends on Viagra. The Department of Defense spent $41.6 million in 2014 on the erectile-dysfunction drug, or about five times what transgender service members would cost, according to an estimate from the Military Times.?

"A former information technology staffer for Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Monday was arrested on charges of bank fraud at Dulles International Airport as he was attempting to travel to Pakistan.? Imran Awan, 37, of Lorton, Virginia, pleaded not guilty to one charge of bank fraud during a Tuesday arraignment at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. According to the court, Awan was granted permission to return to his home under specific conditions, including obeying a strict curfew, wearing a GPS monitoring device, giving up his passports and staying within a 50-mile radius of his home. Awan was fired by office of the?former chair of the DNC?on Tuesday, according to his attorney Chris Gowen.? Awan is accused of trying to defraud Congressional Federal Credit Union, a popular bank for Capitol Hill staffers, by misrepresenting a home $165,000 home equity loan he attempted to obtain for a piece of rental property. FBI Special Agent Brandon Merriman, who penned the charging document, stated in an affidavit that Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, misrepresented the property for which the loan was to be granted, identifying it as a ""principal residence."" According to Merriman, the credit union does not normally issue home equity loans for rental properties.? Merriman wrote in the document that Awan was attempting to leave the U.S. and not return. Awan, however, did have a booked returning flight set for January 2018. Merriman also noted that Awan's family, including his wife, designated as a co-conspirator in the charges, left for Pakistan months before him with multiple bags and boxes packed. The affidavit stated that agents followed Awan and her family during their departure in March, and inside their bags, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol found around $12,000 in cash along with ""household goods, clothing and food items."" Awan's attorney railed against the charge in a statement to CBS News, saying that was a ""modest real estate matter"" exacerbated by ""ultra-right-wing-media"" and ""anti-Muslim bigotry."" Awan, Gowen said, has been victimized, and the charges against him will not hold up in court. He added that Awan was not trying to flee the country -- he just wanted to visit family members who were staying in Pakistan with other extended family because of financial troubles.? ""They will stand and fight whatever charges are presented,"" Gowen said about Awan and his wife. ""Once they have prevailed, we will have a chance to more closely examine the ugly political and media dynamics that have driven this controversy from the beginning."" Gowen said the charge of bank fraud ultimately stems from a previous criminal investigation earlier in the year looking into accusations that Awan and his wife were overcharging members of Congress for technical equipment and pocketing the difference. When the investigation was revealed in February, many of the members of Congress who had contracted with Awan and his wife fired them suddenly. However, Wasserman Schultz, who employed Awan on a full-time basis, retained him until Tuesday.? In a statement to CBS News, Gowen said: ""The government spent several months investigating allegations made by the right wing and has not found any wrongdoing by our client. Instead they have charged him with bank fraud with a criminal complaint that's only direct allegation to Mr. Awan is that he did not disclose all of his rental income on his tax returns.""? The investigation leading up to the bank fraud charge and eventual arrest of Awan, according to Merriman, included physical surveillance and multiple FBI interviews. Gowen said that Awan right now is distraught from the arrest but is driving for Uber in the meantime to make ends meet. According to Gowen, Awan is in contact with his family in Pakistan, and he is set to be back in court on August 21.? CBS News reached out to Wasserman Schultz. Her spokesperson David Damron confirmed Awan's previous employment and termination on Tuesday.?

In his address to the students, Mr. Trump called his election ""a pretty amazing moment"" in history. ""We're doing a good job, our country is doing so well now,"" Mr. Trump said of his presidency. ""We're doing a good job. Are you all happy?"" he then asked the students, who responded with claps. The president then went on to say that his administration has created the ""best job numbers in 17 years,"" adding that ""enthusiasm for manufacturers and business is at just about the highest point since they started taking those tests."" Upon conclusion of the president's remarks, a reporter asked Mr. Trump, ""how did you decide your policy on transgender people in the military?"" He responded by shaking his head and saying, ""she's very rude."" At the Boy Scout Jamboree, President Trump delved into his political struggles. CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett joins CBSN... Earlier this week, Mr. Trump addressed another group of young leaders: the Boy Scouts of America. His speech to the 40,000 Boy Scouts at the National Boy Scout Jamboree quickly turned political when he joked about firing Health and Human Service Secretary Tom Price, swiped at former president Barack Obama, called out mainstream news as ""fake media"" and boasted about his election victory. Following Mr. Trump's remarks, the Boy Scouts of America issued a statement to CBS News saying it is ""wholly non-partisan"" and does not ""promote any one political position, candidate or philosophy."" Parents also expressed concern?and dismay about the political nature of Mr. Trump's Boy Scout address. Both the American Legion Boys Nation and Auxiliary Girls Nation have been sending high school students on trips to Washington, D.C. to learn more about the federal government since the 1940s. At the end of his address, a reporter asked Mr. Trump, ""how did you decide your policy on transgender people in the military?"" to which he shook his head, pointed at a student and responded, ""you go ahead, she's very rude."" The president congratulated the students on their participation in their organizations and thanked them for coming to the White House. The students then broke out into song, followed by chants of ""USA! USA!"" After telling the students he views them as ""the next generation of American leaders,"" he praised his administration's ""job numbers"" for being the ""best job numbers in 17 years,"" adding that ""enthusiasm for manufacturers and business is at just about the highest point since they started taking those tests."" He also said that the students are helping to ""make America greater than ever before."" The president thanked the students for their ambition and determination, advising them to ""never give up."" The students shouted back ""no sir!"" ""We're doing a good job, our country is doing so well now. We're doing a good job,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Are you all happy?"" he then asked the students, to which the students responded with claps. The president said that the students help ""promote American values."" He also acknowledged former president Bill Clinton's participation in the American Legion Boys Nation, in addition to other American leaders and lawmakers who were members of the youth mock government organizations.

"The Senate Judiciary Committee dropped its subpoena to hear from former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and request to hear from Donald Trump Jr. in a Wednesday hearing on on foreign lobbyist registration and the Trump dossier, settling for interviews and documents from them instead.? The committee also withdrew a subpoena for Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which hired spy Christopher Steele to compile a dossier with negative -- if unsubstantiated -- information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia. Amid the multiple probes of Russian interference in the 2016 election and any ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on Wednesday dove into the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) governing foreign lobbying and influence, and Fusion GPS' ties to a legal case involving the Magnitsky Act, a law intended to punish human rights violators in the Kremlin. In doing so, Grassley poked at the credibility of accusations of any ties between Mr. Trump and Russia.? ""Mr. Simpson's company, Fusion GPS, is the same firm that oversaw the creation of the unverified Russian dossier,"" Grassley said in the hearing. ""Around the same time, Fusion also helped orchestrate a campaign to repeal the Magnitsky Act, for the benefit of Russian governments. There are public reports that the FBI used the dossier to kickstart its Russian investigation. Did the FBI know that Fusion pitched propaganda for the Russians, even as it pushed the dossier? What would they say about its reliability if the dossier was represented to any court, should this fact have been disclosed?"" Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA) joins CBSN to describes the state of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's meddling in... With the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating Russian election meddling and any connections between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia, Grassley has turned to investigating related matters. The Republican is also investigating how Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Manafort, Trump Jr. and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner at Trump Tower in June 2016, was allowed to be in the U.S. in the first place.? In a continuation of Wednesday's hearing on Thursday, William Browder, who heads up Hermitage Capital Management, is expected to accuse Fusion GPS, Veselnitskaya and American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin of trying to smear Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison in 2009 after revealing a $230 million tax theft. The Magnitsky Act is named after him. Browder will argue that if Fusion GPS lobbied on behalf of the Russian government without registering with the U.S. government, it would violate FARA. ""Veselnitskaya, through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsky Act,"" Browder's prepared testimony reads. ""He contacted a number of major newspapers and other publications to spread false information that Sergei Magnitsky was not murdered, was not a whistle-blower and was instead a criminal. They also spread false information that my presentations to lawmakers around the world were untrue."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California), the ranking member on the committee, said it's time to put teeth into FARA:? ""I don't know a time when the United States feels more invaded, and by this I mean, 21 states' election systems were pierced in this last election, we believe by Russia,"" Feinstein said, calling that, an ""interference with our sovereignty.""

Hoping up to conjure up the same momentum that led to a 1986 tax overhaul under President Reagan, Republican leaders on the House Ways and Means Committee traveled to the Reagan Ranch on Wednesday to pitch an?equally ambitious tax plan. They were thousands of miles from Washington, but the congressmen couldn't?avoid commenting on President Trump's remarks about the deadly violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend. They were peppered with questions from reporters about the incident, and asked if they remained confident in the Republican president. One congressman said Trump's latest controversy was distracting for the Republican agenda, including tax reform. But House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas said he believes the tax overhaul will stay on track, despite the distractions in the White House. The 1986 legislation was a bipartisan effort hammered out by Reagan and a Senate controlled by Republicans and a House controlled by the Democrats. After Reagan took office in 1981, he won a 25% cut in personal income taxes and big tax breaks for businesses. The cuts were a catalyst for the tax reform package that passed five years later. The proposals outlined Wednesday, however, are purely a Republican effort, with negotiations between Trump and GOP leaders in the House and Senate.? Brady promised to invite Democrats to the table, saying they have lots of good ideas?and have just as much interest in creating jobs and keeping U.S. companies from moving overseas. But there is little evidence of bipartisan cooperation?on the tax plan thus far in Washington. ※Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, if you＊re serious about delivering to pro-growth tax reform to the American people this year, we＊re serious about working with you,§ Brady said. Brady was joined by three other GOP committee members at Reagan＊s rustic former home, known as Rancho del Cielo and the Western White House, nestled in the Santa Ynez Mountains just north of Santa Barbara. Their speeches, delivered not far from the stone front porch the former president built himself, were thin on specifics and thick?with praise about Reagan＊s years as America＊s 40th president. The staging of the news conference was planned to mimic the scene when Reagan signed legislation enacting the tax cuts in 1981, which he did at a table in front of the ranch home. The congressmen on Wednesday stood behind a replica of the table used by Reagan, complete with a stack of papers resembling a tax bill piled on top.? ※The Reagan reforms were all about the American people, about workers and middle-class families and Main Street businesses. It was focused on fairness. Closing special interest loopholes,§ Brady said. ※I think President Reagan would be pretty disappointed with the tax code we have today. Fairness has been replaced with favoritism for Washington special interests.§ Brady indicated that the tax overhaul, which has yet to materialize in an actual bill, would ※continue to reward homeownership,§ a?possible indication that some form of the mortgage tax deduction would remain in place. He also said there is support to reduce?taxes even if it means a short-term increase in the national deficit, as long as the cuts stoke the U.S. economy and job creation. Brady condemned those behind the deadly mayhem in Charlottesville last weekend, but did not address Trump＊s comments suggesting an equivalence between those protesting the white supremacists and the white supremacists?responsible for the violence. He said he doubts that this and other?controversies?surrounding the Trump administration will derail efforts to pass the tax overhaul this year. But Ways and Means Committee member Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) was more pointed in his words about?the president. He said that it＊s crucial for Trump to lead the effort?to overhaul the tax system, and that it and other policy work in Washington is endangered by his actions. ※It＊s horrific to put those protesting hate and those promoting hate on the same level,§ Curbelo said. ※Yes, it＊s an unneeded distraction＃. I hope he＊ll stop. I＊m not counting on it.§																																																																																																																					"

Luther Strange secured a runoff spot late Tuesday in the Republican primary for his seat. The senator now faces top vote-getter Roy Moore, the outspoken former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Moore＊s horseback ride to the polls Tuesday demonstrated the political showmanship that has made him a favorite among Alabama voters. With about four-fifths of precincts reporting results late Tuesday, Moore had 43% of the vote, compared with 31% for Strange. With no candidate achieving the 50% needed to secure the nomination, the Republican runoff is set for Sept. 26. The race exposed the potential reach as well as the limits of Trump＊s influence, even in a state where the president remains hugely popular. Voters consistently preferred Moore, despite a strong White House endorsement for Strange, who took over the seat this year when Jeff Sessions, the state＊s longtime senator, resigned to become U.S. attorney general. But Trump＊s support appears to have at least enabled Strange to avoid the embarrassment of not securing the second spot. ※We＊re on to the runoff,§ Moore tweeted as the Associated Press called the race about two hours after polls closed. ※Time for conservatives across Alabama to unite and deliver a knockout punch to the establishment!§ Trump＊s investment in the race was never a sure bet in the primary.

John Curtis, the mayor of Provo, Utah, will likely fill the congressional seat vacated by former Rep. Jason Chaffetz. On Tuesday, Curtis won a three-way Republican primary in the state＊s deeply conservative 3rd Congressional District, which spans much of Provo and portions of Salt Lake City. Curtis, a Mormon, who has served as mayor since 2010, is widely regarded as a moderate. Last year, he did not vote for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, citing moral concerns about the Republican nominee. Even so, on Wednesday, Trump retweeted a Fox New alert about Curtis＊ win, saying ※Congratulations John!§ Curtis' primary victory is expected to lead to a win in the fall general election; Democrats are significantly under-matched in the district. Republicans have won the seat in every general election since 1998. Chaffetz?held the seat since 2009 and stepped down in June to begin work at Fox News.

America＊s top business executives may have bristled over President Trump's ban on refugees, his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and his decision to bar transgender Americans from the military. But it wasn＊t until the embattled president all but defended white supremacists in the aftermath of the deadly clashes over the weekend in Charlottesville, Va., that the country＊s corporate elite decided they had had enough. By Wednesday, so many executives had resigned from Trump＊s economic advisory and manufacturing councils, including the heads of General Electric Co., Intel Corp. and Campbell Soup Co., that the president announced on Twitter that he was disbanding the panels. Some members pushed back on Trump＊s suggestion that the disbandment was the president＊s decision. JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief Jamie Dimon said the economic advisory council, known formally as the Strategic and Policy Forum, had already decided to end on its own. Members began discussing dissolving the group after watching Trump's news conference Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter speaking on condition of anonymity. Forum members organized a call for 11:30 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday to survey who wanted to stay in or out. The group overwhelmingly sought to shut the forum down, according to the source. Leaders of consumer brands expressed concern about how their images could be tarnished, while heads of other corporations feared the effect Trump was having on the business climate.

An embattled state senator could face a recall election as soon as this fall?after an appeals court on Monday delayed enforcement of a law crafted by Democrats to slow down the process. The new law was written with hopes of delaying a recall election for state Sen. Josh Newman (D-Fullerton) until next year, but?his opponents have wanted a special?election this year.?They targeted?the freshman lawmaker after his vote in favor of gas and vehicle taxes as part of a $52-billion transportation plan. The new?law,?written by legislative Democrats and signed by Gov. Jerry Brown,?added significant new steps to certifying a recall election. Newman's opponents challenged the?law in court last month, arguing that there is no legal justification for the new law to apply?retroactively to pending recall efforts like the one against the senator. Justice Vance W. Raye's order issued Monday requires state elections officials to set aside the new law until the case is resolved in court. That delay would probably mean a recall election could be held in Newman's Southern California district in November. ""We're very pleased,"" said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., which is supporting the recall and filed the lawsuit against the new rules. ""This was an inappropriate action by the Legislature."" Recall backers have submitted more than 96,000 voter signatures to call a special election -- far more than the 63,593 valid signatures needed. Democrats said Monday night that legislative action had been prompted by charges that voter signatures were being gathered through a promise to repeal the gas tax. ""It's in the overwhelming public interest to safeguard the integrity of the recall process and to ensure that recall petitions are not being signed under false and fraudulent pretenses,"" said Jonathan Underland, press secretary for Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de?Le車n (D-Los Angeles). A spokesman for Secretary of State Alex Padilla said the court order is still being reviewed. August 15, 9:10 a.m.: This story was updated with a quote from the Senate leader's spokesman, who responded on behalf of Sen. Newman.																																																																																																																					"

A stream of protesters spanning blocks in Manhattan converged on Trump Tower on Monday afternoon as President Trump prepared to stay overnight in the city for the first time since he took office. Shouting ""No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA,"" thousands of protesters jammed sidewalks along Fifth Avenue ahead of Trump＊s arrival from Washington. During a brief visit back to the White House, which is undergoing renovations while he vacations at his golf resort in New Jersey, Trump took a firmer stand on the white supremacist violence that racked Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. ※Racism is evil,§ he said, calling hate groups ※repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.§ Yet for many of the protesters, Trump＊s remarks were too late, overshadowed by his statement on Saturday that ""many sides"" were responsible for the violence and his initial failure to name white supremacist groups as aggressors.

And, as much as possible, we'll relate what else was going on at the time. Check back for more as Trump continues to tweet. President Trump on Monday answered two days of bipartisan furor over his initial response to deadly protests in Charlottesville, Va., with a statement for the first time explicitly blaming white supremacists for the ※racist violence§ over the weekend. But in a tweet sent hours later, Trump appeared to suggest that he'd spoken out only to appease his critics and seemed frustrated that his remarks hadn't done more to silence them. ""Realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied,"" Trump lamented, calling members of the media ""truly bad people!"" The president＊s statement on Charlottesville was a hastily arranged do-over that implicitly acknowledged the need to stanch the self-inflicted damage his first reaction had caused him and his administration. Criticism and outrage had continued to build, including among Republicans, to Trump＊s Saturday remarks blaming ※many sides,§ in effect lumping together for fault the anti-racism counter-protesters with the gun-wielding white supremacy groups Trump declined to name. But the president appeared to resent?that such a do-over was warranted. After reading a brief statement from a teleprompter at the White House, he pivoted and left, ignoring reporters＊ shouted questions, including several asking whether he regretted his delay in specifically blaming the racists. During an unrelated announcement on trade later in the day, a reporter asked why he had taken two days to condemn the hate groups by name. ※They＊ve been condemned. They have been condemned,§ Trump snapped. When asked about a Monday news conference that the White House had announced and then?canceled, Trump insisted he had already held one.?Then, when the reporter persisted, Trump labeled him ※fake news§ as he strode from the room. Trump's outburst and later tweet did little to alleviate criticism from those who suggested that he had been less than eager to denounce the white supremacists but that he had felt forced to do so.

President Trump took aim at Democrats on Monday morning in a tweet, claiming that they are responsible for ""some of the worst trade deals in World History,"" which he promised to address. Trump's tweet came several hours before he announced that he had?asked his trade office to consider investigating China for the alleged theft of American technology and intellectual property. Trump, in the midst of a 17-day vacation, left his New Jersey golf club to return to the White House to sign an executive action on the investigation. He suggested that more steps would be taken against China on trade issues. ""This is just the beginning 〞 I want to tell you that,"" Trump said. ""This is just the beginning."" There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year. Later Monday, Trump tweeted that it had been a ""big day"" and promised that ""great trade deals"" were in the works. Trump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world's second-largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth. In an editorial Monday, the China Daily, a mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, linked Trump's trade announcement against China to his disappointment over China's purported failure to rein in North Korea. The newspaper said a trade inquiry, which could lead to punitive tariffs on Chinese exports, would ""poison"" U.S.-China relations. Trump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security, leading to speculation that raising the possibility of a probe 〞 without committing to one 〞 could be a negotiating tactic to get China to step up its assistance with North Korea. Trump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven't been delivered on deadline. He made addressing the U.S. trade deficit with China a centerpiece of his campaign last year and has suggested raising tariffs on goods from China.

The chief executive of pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. publicly resigned from a White House manufacturing council on Monday, declaring he felt ※a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.§ The move by Kenneth Frazier, one of corporate America＊s leading African American executives, came after President Trump was criticized for not explicitly condemning white supremacists after violent clashes with counter-protesters turned deadly in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday. Trump quickly lashed out at Frazier on Twitter. About four hours later, Trump delivered a statement from the White House in which he denounced the hate groups at the center of Saturday＊s violence. ""Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,"" Trump said. But he hadn＊t forgotten about Merck. Later Monday, Trump slammed the company again on Twitter, calling it ※a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S.§ Frazier was among more than two dozen corporate executives and union officials advising the Trump administration on boosting American manufacturing. Now he has become the latest high-profile CEO to leave a White House business council in recent weeks in protest of Trump＊s statements or actions. After Trump＊s initial comments in the wake of the deadly Charlottesville protest, blaming the violence ※on many sides§ without specifically denouncing the white nationalists who were at the center of the clashes, Merck posted a statement on Twitter from Frazier announcing his resignation from the council. Many on Twitter noted that Trump responded more quickly and specifically to Frazier＊s resignation than he did to the violence in Charlottesville.

President Trump, facing another tough patch in his presidency, will hold his first rally in the West since his inauguration, announcing Wednesday that he will travel to Arizona next week. The rally could provide a place for Trump to announce a pardon for Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona county sheriff and Trump campaign supporter who was recently convicted of having defied a judge＊s order to stop racial profiling of Latinos when he was in office. Trump told a Fox News contributor this week that he was considering a pardon, which would be broadly controversial but potentially excite some of his core supporters. The trip is a departure for Trump, who has previously stuck mostly to Ohio, West Virginia and other areas with traditional white, blue-collar voters for such events. He has seldom traveled west of the Mississippi since becoming president. The mayor of Phoenix responded with his own message for Trump: Please stay away. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, released a statement calling on the president to halt his plans as the nation continues to grapple with fallout from the violence in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend. Stanton also warned Trump against any pardon of Arpaio.

On Wednesday morning, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) had hoped to focus on Los Angeles County's transportation needs as it prepares for the 2028 Olympics. So in?a discussion?that included Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles) and L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, Pelosi and local leaders gathered at Union Station to discuss?the need for federal money?to complete major road, highway, bridge?and transit projects, and highlighted the fact that Trump has not unveiled his promised $1-trillion infrastructure investment plan.? But afterward, Pelosi?was pressed by reporters mainly to respond to the president's assertion that ""there is blame on both sides"" for the weekend?violence that erupted during white nationalist protests in Charlottesville, Va. ""I was hoping we could focus first of all on infrastructure?because that＊s what we＊re here to talk about,"" the San Francisco resident said. ""We haven't seen an [infrastructure] initiative yet. We even thought we might see one yesterday, but we didn't,"" she continued, referring to Trump's?own planned remarks?on infrastructure?that veered off course Tuesday when?he?repeated explosive comments about?the violent protests in Virginia.? ""What we saw yesterday was the president clearly demonstrating that he doesn't know right from wrong, true from false, American patriotism from white nationalism,"" Pelosi said. ""Very sad for our country."" However, she added that she has not promoted the idea of impeaching Trump, and that not knowing right from wrong ""is not necessarily grounds for impeachment."" Some?Democratic representatives have called for impeachment, and on Tuesday night, Pelosi's fellow Bay Area representative, Jackie Speier, called for Trump to be removed under the 25th Amendment.? ""If he crosses the line in terms of obeying the law, then we'll see,"" Pelosi said. Pelosi also commented on the fight over whether a rally organized by a conservative group that has featured white nationalist speakers in the past?should go forward as scheduled in San Francisco on Aug. 26. The minority leader, who has asked the National Park Service to reconsider a permit for the protest,?said that Trump?had ""ginned up"" far-right groups, including white nationalists, and that the United States is facing a ""moment of truth"" in terms of what is deemed acceptable public expression. ""The 1st Amendment is very important to us. ...?It does not give you a constitutional right to yell, 'Fire!' in a crowded theater,"" she said.

After President Trump signed an executive order in January and vowed to strip federal funds from ""sanctuary"" cities, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez decided to honor federal authorities' requests to hold county prisoners for deportation. Trump thanked Gimenez in a tweet that contained a video of Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions speaking Wednesday in Miami, where he denounced?Chicago for its defiant ※sanctuary city§ stance, again blaming the city＊s surge in crime on policies designed to protect immigrants. Although the link between illegal immigration and rising crime is weak 〞 studies show immigrants tend to commit crimes at lower rates than other people 〞 Sessions suggested Miami＊s policies contributed to a dramatic drop in homicides. ※The same Independence Day weekend when Chicago suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, Miami-Dade also had a historic number of shooting deaths 〞 zero,§ Sessions?said. He said the Trump administration would not continue giving money to cities ※that actively undermine the safety and efficacy of federal law enforcement and actively frustrate efforts to reduce crime in their cities.§ ※So if voters in Chicago are concerned about losing federal grant money: Call your mayor,§ Sessions said. The dangers of immigrant crime are a major concern for Trump＊s base of voters, and the issue was a favorite theme of his campaign.

"Politicians facing news coverage that they＊d rather avoid generally don＊t convene free-wheeling press conferences. But as we＊ve seen most every week of his time in office, President Trump is not a normal politician or public figure. Look no further than the 23 minutes he spent with reporters on Tuesday. Good morning from the state capital. I＊m Sacramento Bureau Chief John Myers, and things have been quiet here on the final week of a month-long legislative recess. But not so in the lobby of the Manhattan skyscraper that bears the president＊s name. ＆TWO SIDES,＊ TRUMP INSISTS Trump＊s news conference 〞 ostensibly convened to talk about his infrastructure plans 〞 was dominated by his decision to again insist that it wasn＊t just white nationalists responsible for the melee in Charlottesville. And then, he insisted that some attendees wanted nothing more than to protect the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. ※This week it＊s Robert E. Lee. I noticed Stonewall Jackson is coming down,§ Trump said, alluding to another Confederate general. ※I wonder 〞 is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You really have to ask yourself, where does it stop?§ All of this just one day after much more stern comments about, and condemnation of, the various far-right groups that assembled in Virginia＊s most well-known college town. If you＊ve lost track a little of the president＊s various comments about the deadly violence there, we＊re keeping tabs. We＊ve also got the full transcript of Trump＊s remarks to reporters in New York City on Tuesday. THE AWKWARD AFTERMATH FOR REPUBLICANS Like so many times before in the first seven months of this presidency, and the second time since the weekend, Republicans sought some way on Tuesday to put some daylight between themselves and their party standard-bearer. THE BLAME AND THE BACKLASH Matt Pearce takes a closer look at what happens now for the ※alt-right§ movement 〞 and how all of the attention these groups have received is likely a double-edged sword. Pearce also compiles a look at how blame for Saturday＊s violent clashes is being assigned by far-right and mainstream media. AND SPEAKING OF RACE, HATE AND SPEECH... There are laws in many states about who can take down statues like those of Confederate soldiers, and when. California lawmakers have urged the National Park Service to think twice about a permit for an ※alt-right§ group＊s event next weekend in San Francisco. In the aftermath of the weekend＊s events, Los Angeles officials took aim at a Canoga Park house from where they allege a white supremacist group has been running a major drug operation. The Hollywood Forever Cemetery plans to take down a monument commemorating Confederate veterans after calls from activists and vandalism threats. Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger donated $100,000 to a group devoted to fighting hate speech. And the new chancellor of UC Berkeley, where earlier clashes have made news, told returning students that the new academic year will be devoted to free speech. SWEET HOME, ALABAMA: ELECTION NIGHT The furor over Trump＊s comments obscured important political news from Alabama, where the president＊s pick, Sen. Luther Strange, advanced to a Republican runoff next month with Roy Moore. Democrat Doug Jones cleared a crowded field to become his party＊s nominee. THE DANGER OF CUTTING OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES Also overshadowed by Tuesday afternoon＊s events was a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that showed even Trump＊s talk of ending federal healthcare subsidies could have huge effects. The analysis shows that doing so would balloon the size of insurance payments for some Americans as well as the federal government＊s deficit. White House officials responded by calling the budget office projection a ※flawed report,§ although they didn＊t actually identify any flaws in it. A FALL RECALL ELECTION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA? The backers of an effort to remove state Sen. Josh Newman (D-Fullerton) after only months in office won an early round in court on Monday. An appeals court put a temporary stay on the election law that Democrats crafted to lengthen the election calendar and push a potential contest into 2018. Meanwhile, the state＊s campaign finance watchdog agency takes a big vote on Thursday 〞 deciding whether to remove campaign contribution limits for Newman＊s fellow lawmakers who want to give money to the anti-recall effort. As Patrick McGreevy reports, the agency＊s vote comes on the heels of surprising new information 〞 revealed through public records obtained by several news organizations 〞 that show the effort to erase the campaign donation limits was quietly discussed by one labor union backed commissioner and a Democratic attorney.

Gavin Newsom continued his swing through Central Valley for his 2018 bid for governor Tuesday, courting a?packed hall of supporters and the merely curious with vocal support of water storage, single-payer healthcare and California's bullet train. Those issues resonate?in this swath of inland California, a place still limping out of the recession where voters often complain of being ignored by Sacramento politicians except at election time. Newsom?ditched?his microphone in favor of pacing up and down the aisles inside Tuolumne Hall in downtown Fresno. He took questions from the about 200 people for close to 90 minutes. Near the opening of the event, Newsom addressed?the weekend＊s deadly violence in Charlottesville, Va., and President Trump＊s comments blaming?counter-protesters as well as white supremacist groups for the mayhem. ※That kind of bigotry, that kind of hatred, people that stoke that kind of fear 〞 these aren＊t dog whistles. These are racial provocateurs,§ Newsom told the crowd, eliciting applause. ※They have no place in America, let alone in this state.§ Newsom?also fielded questions focused on proposals to strengthen the state＊s water supply and healthcare system. In?both cases, Newsom＊s responses fell short of solid commitments. The lieutenant governor said he was a strong backer of the $7.5-billion water bond approved by voters in 2014, including $2.7 billion for water storage. But he did not say for certain that he would support the proposed Temperance Flat Dam on the San Joaquin River, which would directly affect Central Valley farmers, or the proposal for the Sites Reservoir?in the Sacramento Valley. Newsom reminded the audience that the dams aren't exactly popular in the Bay Area and that other options such as underground storage may also be viable. Still,?he assured the audience that he doesn't oppose the dam projects and indicated he would support the reservoirs if approved. On healthcare, Newsom touted the fact that, as mayor of San Francisco, he helped establish a?citywide universal healthcare program that predated President Obama＊s Affordable Care Act. ※I do believe in Medicare for all. I do believe that it＊s inevitable in this country,§ Newsom said. ※Eventually we＊ll have some courage federally and we＊ll get there. The question is how can we complement that debate here in California.§ Newsom said he was committed to continuing the debate over whether California can launch its own single-payer healthcare system, proposed in a bill shelved in the state Legislature this year. But he cautioned that it＊s a difficult issue to tackle given the enormous cost and complexities involved. ※I＊d be lying to you if I [told you I] had a detailed plan,§ Newsom said. Sally Garcia, 73, a retired secretary from Clovis, said she came to Tuesday's event?with her husband, Jess, so that they would start educating themselves about the candidates running for governor. Garcia, a?Democrat,?left impressed. ※He seem to say the right things for the group here,§ she said. ※He was talking to valley people.§ Newsom＊s visit to Fresno is part of a broader Central Valley campaign swing, coming after stops in Placer County and Stockton. On Wednesday he heads to Bakersfield. Mike Evans, chairman of the Fresno County Democratic Party, said Newsom＊s main Democratic rivals 每 former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and state Treasurer John Chiang 每 have also been regular visitors?to?the Central Valley since they launched their bids. Seth Smith, who runs a veteran-owned medical marijuana cultivation business in Watsonville, said he liked what he saw in Newsom, but needs to hear more details on his?plan to create jobs and improve education in California. He was impressed by Newsom's defense of so-called sanctuary cities and his vow to protect immigrants, including those who entered the country illegally. Smith was aware, of course, that?Newsom was a major supporter of the successful November ballot initiative that will legalize the recreational use of marijuana in the state. ※That＊s one of the reasons I know him,§ said Smith, a Navy veteran and fourth-generation farmer who grew up in Fresno. ※I don＊t know who else is running.

Luther Strange as polls opened Tuesday morning in the Republican primary for Strange's seat. Strange should have had an easy lock on the seat he took over when Jeff Sessions, the state＊s longtime senator, resigned to become the Trump administration＊s attorney general. But the race has become an early test of Trump＊s power to persuade his most dedicated supporters. Trump＊s approval rating remains sky-high in Alabama, but that enthusiasm has not spilled over to Strange, who is also favored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Strange is trailing fiery former judge Roy Moore, according to recent polling. The outcome could foreshadow a deepening feud between the GOP＊s base voters and party leaders in the months to come. Some voters will surely be inspired by Trump＊s endorsement of Strange. But others still have doubts about how Strange was appointed to replace Sessions and his ties to McConnell and other Republican leaders, who have grown increasingly unpopular among many in the base. ※They＊re confused,§ said Terry Lathan, chairwoman of the Alabama Republican Party. With no candidate likely to emerge with a majority from a field that started with 10 Republicans, the top two vote-getters are expected to compete in a runoff in September.

"With a strong push from President Trump, Alabama Sen. Luther Strange secured a runoff spot late Tuesday in the Republican primary for his seat. The senator now faces top vote-getter Roy Moore, the outspoken former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Moore＊s horseback ride to the polls Tuesday demonstrated the political showmanship that has made him a favorite among Alabama voters. With about four-fifths of precincts reporting results late Tuesday, Moore had 43% of the vote, compared with 31% for Strange. With no candidate achieving the 50% needed to secure the nomination, the Republican runoff is set for Sept. 26. The race exposed the potential reach as well as the limits of Trump＊s influence, even in a state where the president remains hugely popular. Voters consistently preferred Moore, despite a strong White House endorsement for Strange, who took over the seat this year when Jeff Sessions, the state＊s longtime senator, resigned to become U.S. attorney general. But Trump＊s support appears to have at least enabled Strange to avoid the embarrassment of not securing the second spot. ※We＊re on to the runoff,§ Moore tweeted as the Associated Press called the race about two hours after polls closed. ※Time for conservatives across Alabama to unite and deliver a knockout punch to the establishment!§ Trump＊s investment in the race was never a sure bet in the primary. And it may not be one that can be easily replicated in other contested Republican primaries in Nevada and Arizona, where the president is far less popular. ※It＊s a weird race,§ said Brent Buchanan, a consultant in Alabama who is unaffiliated with any of the candidates. ※I don＊t think you take this and say this is an omen for the 2018 primaries. There＊s just too many anomalies to make assumptions off what happens.§ Trump may be more helpful in upcoming primary races by steering clear of the states where his popularity has tumbled and the Republican incumbents are charting their own paths, often with their own brands. In Nevada, Sen. Dean Heller, who faces a pro-Trump challenger, recently acknowledged that he voted for Trump last fall, a disclosure that may shore up his base of Republican support but could drive off more centrist Republicans and independents in the Silver State. In Arizona, ads are now promoting Sen. Jeff Flake, one of Trump＊s most outspoken Republican critics, as principled in a nod to opposition to the president, despite a challenge from a Trump-aligned candidate. Other primary races among Republicans hoping to take on Democratic incumbents in Indiana and West Virginia are emerging with splits over Trump support. But in Alabama, strategists were relying on the president＊s high-profile tweets to boost Strange＊s sagging campaign by turning out voters who may not have been paying close attention to an otherwise sleepy August special primary election. Trump repeatedly tweeted his support for Strange as polls opened Tuesday morning, as did Vice President Mike Pence. The Senate Leadership Fund, a group aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), poured $4 million into the race. Strange highlighted his ties to the president. ※We＊ve developed a personal friendship. We like each other,§ he said on ※Fox & Friends.§ ※I＊ve done everything you could possibly do to support the president＊s agenda, and believe me that＊s what the people of Alabama want to see done.§ But the senator continued to face skepticism from voters that may follow him to the runoff. On the job just a few months, ※Big Luther,§ as the towering senator is known, was scrutinized over his backing from McConnell, who is unpopular among many Trump voters, and his appointment by the former governor, who resigned amid an ethics investigation Strange had spearheaded as Alabama＊s attorney general. In Moore, voters had a known favorite who in many ways had captured Trump＊s appeal to state voters. Moore has twice been sidelined from the bench, forced to resign as chief justice of the state Supreme Court for refusing to take down a Ten Commandments display, and later, after being reinstated by voters, suspended for failing to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court＊s upholding of same-sex marriage. Trailing in the nine-candidate field was Rep.

"President Donald Trump says the groups protesting against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, were ""also very violent."" President Donald Trump says the groups protesting against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, were ""also very violent."" On Tuesday, President Trump took questions from journalists after a discussion about infrastructure. What follows is a transcript of the question-and-answer session provided by the Federal News Service. QUESTION: Why do you think that CEOs are leaving your manufacturing council? TRUMP: Because they're not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country. We want jobs, manufacturing in this country. If you look at some of those people that you're talking about, they're outside of the country. They're having a lot of their product made outside. If you look at Merck, as an example, take a look where -- excuse me -- excuse me -- take a look at where their product is made. It's made outside of our country. We want products made in the country. Now, I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they're leaving out of embarrassment because they make their products outside. And I've been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you're referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country. You can't do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places. You have to bring this work back to this country. That's what I want. I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... wait so long (inaudible)? TRUMP: I didn't wait long. I didn't wait long. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I didn't wait long. I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct, not make a quick statement. The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement. But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the facts. It takes a little while to get the facts. You still don't know the facts. And it's a very, very important process to me. And it's a very important statement. So, I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts. If you go back to my＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I brought it. I brought it. I brought it. QUESTION: What did you (inaudible)? TRUMP: As I said on -- remember this -- Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America. And when I went on from there. Now, here's the thing. As to -- excuse me -- excuse me -- take it nice and easy. Here's the thing. When I make a statement, I like to be correct. I want the facts. This event just happened. In fact, a lot of the event didn't even happen yet, as we were speaking. This event just happened. Before I make a statement, I need the facts. So I don't want to rush into a statement. So making the statement when I made it was excellent. In fact, the young woman who I hear is a fantastic young woman, and it was on NBC, her mother wrote me and said through, I guess, Twitter, social media, the nicest things and I very much appreciate that. I hear she was a fine, a really -- actually, an incredible young woman. But her mother on Twitter thanked me for what I said. And honestly, if the press were not fake and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice. But unlike you and unlike -- excuse me -- unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts. VIDEO: Trump blames ""both sides"" for violence in Charlottesville ? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: They don't. They don't. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: How about a couple of＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: How about a couple of infrastructure questions? (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Mr. Trump, was it terrorism, that event? Was that terrorism? TRUMP: Say, what? QUESTION: The CEO of Wal-Mart said you missed a (inaudible) opportunity to help bring the country together. Did you? TRUMP: Not at all. I think the country -- look, you take a look. I've created over a million jobs since I'm president. The country is booming. The stock market is setting records. We have the highest employment numbers we've ever had in the history of our country. We're doing record business. We have the highest levels of enthusiasm. So the head of Wal-Mart, who I know, is a very nice guy, was making a political statement. I mean＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: ... it the same way. And you know why? Because I want to make sure when I make a statement that the statement is correct. And there was no way -- there was no way of making a correct statement that early. I had to see the facts, unlike a lot of reporters -- unlike a lot of reporters＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I didn't know David Duke was there. I wanted to see the facts. And the facts as they started coming out were very well stated. In fact, everybody said [my Monday] statement was beautiful; if he would have made it sooner, that would have been good. I couldn't have made it sooner because I didn't know all of the facts. Frankly, people still don't know all of the facts. It was very important that -- excuse me, excuse me -- it was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly. Because if I would have made a fast statement, and the first statement was made without knowing much other than what we were seeing. The second statement was made after -- with knowledge, with great knowledge. There are still things -- excuse me -- there are still things that people don't know. I want to make a statement with knowledge. I wanted to know the facts. OK＃ (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Was it -- two questions. Was it terrorism? And can you tell us what you're feeling about your＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Well, I think the driver of the car is a disgrace to himself, his family and his country. And that is -- you can call it terrorism. You can call it murder. You can call it whatever you want. I would just call it as the fastest one to come up with a good verdict. That's what I'd call it. Because there is a question. Is it murder? Is it terrorism? And then you get into legal semantics. The driver of the car is a murderer. And what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable thing. QUESTION: Can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon? Can you talk about that? TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: I would echo Maggie's question. Steve Bannon＃ TRUMP: I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it. QUESTION: But can you tell us broadly what you're -- do you still have confidence in Steve? TRUMP: Well, we＊ll see -- and look, look. I like Mr. Bannon. He's a friend of mine. But Mr. Bannon came on very late, you know that. I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that, and I like him. He's a good man. He is not a racist, I can tell you that. He's a good person. He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard. But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon, but he's a good person, and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly. VIDEO: Trump says ""we'll see"" what happens with Steve Bannon ? QUESTION: Do you have confidence in him? Because he has called on you to defend your national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, against＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I've already done it. I did it the last time. QUESTION: And he called on it again linking this ＃ TRUMP: Sen. McCain? QUESTION: ...the alt-right and＃ TRUMP: Sen. McCain? You mean the one who voted against [repealing] Obamacare? Who is -- you mean Sen. McCain who voted against us getting good healthcare? QUESTION: Sen. McCain said that the alt-right is behind these attacks, and he linked that same group to those who perpetrated the attack in Charlottesville. TRUMP: Well, I don't know -- I can't tell you. I'm sure Sen. McCain must know what he's talking about. But when you say the ""alt- right,"" define ""alt-right"" to me. You define it, go ahead. QUESTION: Well, I think that ＃ TRUMP: No, define it for me, come on. Let's go. Define it for me. QUESTION: Sen. McCain defined them as the same group＃ TRUMP: OK, what about the alt-left that came charging (inaudible)? Excuse me. What about the alt-left that came charging at the -- as you say, the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? QUESTION: Mr. Trump＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Let me ask you this. What about the fact they came charging -- that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. QUESTION: Sir＃ TRUMP: As far as I'm concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day. Wait a minute, I'm not finished. (CROSSTALK) I'm not finished, fake news. That was a horrible day＃ QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) TRUMP: I will tell you something. I watched those very closely, much more closely than you people watched it. And you have -- you had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent, and nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now. You had a group -- you had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit, and they were very, very violent. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Do you think that the -- what you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis? TRUMP: Those people -- all of those people -- excuse me. I've condemned neo-Nazis. I've condemned many different groups. But not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists, by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee. So -- excuse me. And you take a look at some of the groups and you see -- and you'd know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases you're not, but many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. So this week it's Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson's coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you all -- you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop? But they were there to protest -- excuse me. You take a look, the night before, they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. Infrastructure question, go ahead. QUESTION: Should the statue of Robert E. Lee stay up? TRUMP: I would say that's up to a local town, community, or the federal government, depending on where it is located. QUESTION: Are you against the Confederacy? QUESTION: How concerned are you about race relations in America? And do you think things have gotten worse or better since you took office? TRUMP: I think they've gotten better or the same -- look, they've been frayed for a long time. And you can ask President Obama about that, because he'd make speeches about it. But I believe that the fact that I brought in -- it will be soon, millions of jobs, you see where companies are moving back into our country, I think that's going to have a tremendous positive impact on race relations. We have companies coming back into our country. We have two car companies that just announced. We have Foxconn in Wisconsin just announce. We have many companies I say pouring back into the country. I think that's going to have a huge, positive impact on race relations. You know why? It's jobs. What people want now, they want jobs. They want great jobs with good pay. And when they have that, you watch how race relations will be. And I'll tell you, we're spending a lot of money on the inner cities. We're going to fix -- we're fixing the inner cities. We're doing far more than anybody's done with respect to the inner cities. It's a priority for me. And it's very important. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Mr. President, are you putting what you're calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane? TRUMP: I'm not putting anybody on a moral plane. What I'm saying is this. You had a group on one side and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible. And it was a horrible thing to watch. But there is another side. There was a group on this side, you can call them the left. You've just called them the left -- that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that's the way it is. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... on both sides, sir? (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides. Are＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Well, I do think there's blame -- yes, I think there's blame on both sides. You look at -- you look at both sides. I think there's blame on both sides. And I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it either. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: And -- and -- and if you reported it accurately, you would say (inaudible). (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: (inaudible) started this (inaudible) Charlottesville. They showed up in Charlottesville to protest＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. (inaudible) themselves (inaudible) and you have some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides. You had people in that group -- excuse me, excuse me -- I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same (inaudible)＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So, will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down -- excuse me -- are we going to take down -- are we going to take down statues to George Washington? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: OK. Good. Are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner. Now, are we going to take down his statue? So you know what? It's fine. You're changing history. You're changing culture. And you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally. But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. OK? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats. You've got -- you had a lot of bad -- you had a lot of bad people in the other group＃ (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: ... treated unfairly (inaudible) you were saying. You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly? (inaudible) understand what you're saying. TRUMP: No, no. There were people in that rally, and I looked the night before. If you look, they were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day, it looked like they had some rough, bad people -- neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest, because you know -- I don't know if you know, they had a permit. The other group didn't have a permit. So, I only tell you this, there are two sides to a story. I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment. But there are two sides to the country (sic). Does anybody have a final -- doesn't anybody have a -- you have an infrastructure＃ (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: What makes you think you can get an infrastructure bill? You didn't get healthcare. You＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Well, you know, I'll tell you. We came very close with health care. Unfortunately, John McCain decided to vote against it at the last minute. You'll have to ask John McCain why he did that. But we came very close to healthcare. We will end up getting healthcare, but we'll get the infrastructure. And actually, infrastructure is something that I think we'll have bipartisan support on. I actually think -- I actually think Democrats will go along with the infrastructure. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Mr. President, have you spoken to the family -- have you spoken to the family of the victim of the car＃ (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: ... I'll be reaching out. I'll be reaching out. QUESTION: When will you be reaching out? TRUMP: I was very -- I thought that the statement put out -- the mother's statement I thought was a beautiful statement. I must tell you, I was -- it was something that I really appreciated. I thought it was terrific. And really, under the -- under the kind of stress that she's under and the heartache that she's under, I thought putting out that statement to me was really something I won't forget. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. President Donald Trump says the groups protesting against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, were ""also very violent.""

"President Trump＊s most useful ally in his push to restore the dominance of coal, oil and gas in America could ultimately turn out to be a pair of bankrupt solar firms seeking help from the federal government getting back on their feet. In an unorthodox trade case roiling the solar industry worldwide, the duo of distressed panel makers is aiming to empower Trump with the authority to slap punishing tariffs on foreign competitors 〞 mostly in China and other Asian countries 〞 whose cheap panels have fueled the massive growth in U.S. solar installations. The fallout from the case that was heard Tuesday by the U.S. International Trade Commission threatens to destabilize the massive network of installers and other nonmanufacturing businesses that make up the bulk of the American solar industry. Nearly 90% of the panels it uses are produced abroad. Prices of panels would roughly double should the two U.S. manufacturers get the relief they are seeking, several independent analysts warn. Some 88,000 installation and other jobs in the U.S. solar electricity sector 〞 one in every three 〞 would vanish, according to the Solar Energy Industries Assn. California, with its robust solar industry, would lose the most by far. The consequences for green power in the U.S. would be so serious that even conservative think tanks that have been tangling with the solar industry for years are speaking up on its behalf, warning Trump against imposing the sanctions. They are joined by big electricity companies that have had their own misgivings about the expansion of solar, as well as some of the nation＊s biggest retailers and dozens of members of Congress. But solar companies are bracing for the worst. Independent analysts tracking the industry are warning that Trump, who would be the ultimate decision maker on tariffs should the commission rule the bankrupt firms have been unfairly hurt, could easily pull the trigger on heavily taxing imported panels. It would be a rare opportunity for Trump to use his executive authority to punish the imports that a flagging segment of U.S. manufacturing blames for its troubles. The move would drive up the price of solar, enabling fossil fuel companies to recapture lost market share. At a Washington hearing room packed with solar activists Tuesday, officials from Georgia-based Suniva and Oregon-based SolarWorld, the two bankrupt solar firms seeking relief, riled many of those present by arguing the levies are essential to the survival of solar manufacturing in America. ※The U.S. is literally strewn with the carcasses of shuttered solar manufacturing companies,§ said Suniva attorney Matthew McConkey. He said American companies that design and produce photovoltaic panels are ※on the precipice of extinction§ in the U.S. amid the crush of cheap imports flooding the market and need the administration to intervene. Prices of foreign solar panels have dropped to as low as 35 cents per watt recently. The complaint seeks to force them up to 78 cents to protect American manufacturers. Suniva filed its case under a rarely exercised provision of trade law called Section 201, which enables the president to broadly impose tariffs if the commission finds such a drastic move is needed to protect an American industry from a deluge of foreign imports. It hasn＊t been exercised since 2001, when George W. Bush invoked it in an effort to protect the U.S. steel industry from Mexican and Canadian imports. The move sparked retaliation, and the World Trade Organization ultimately voided the steel levies two years later. Only a fraction of U.S. solar jobs are in companies like Suniva and SolarWorld. Most are in other sectors of the market that have embraced the plunging cost of imported panels. A spike in those prices threatens to slow growth dramatically. ※It is hard to think of a free trade issue that is more fundamental or more clearly shows the benefits of free trade and the enormous cost to the economy and consumers of heavy tariffs,§ said Eli Lehrer, president of the R Street Institute, a free market think tank. His group has joined the conservative advocacy groups American Legislative Exchange Council and Heritage Foundation 〞 both longtime irritants of the solar industry 〞 in lobbying to protect it from the kind of levies threatened. The White House has so far stayed silent about the case as it winds its way through the commission, which will decide by late September whether action is warranted. But Trump has been expressing interest in exercising the power to impose protectionist levies using this obscure provision of trade law since before his election. A trade agenda the administration presented to Congress in March calls it a ※vital tool.§ Trump has not often been swayed by the kind of bipartisan pressure he now faces to reject such tariffs. He did not heed a similar lobbying campaign to stay in the Paris agreement on global warming. Independent analysts at Bloomberg New Energy Finance and Clearview Energy Partners warned investors to be prepared for a costly unsettling of the solar supply chain. Goldman Sachs alerted investors that it expects ※solar installations would fall precipitously in the U.S.§ if Trump imposes the tariffs Suniva and SolarWorld are demanding. Whether the tariffs would even help the firms seeking them is a matter of debate. Suniva cast doubt on how much faith the solar company has in the case to save its business when one of its biggest creditors offered to make the whole thing go away for some cash. That creditor, SQN Capital Management, wrote a Chinese solar trade group, offering to pull the plug on the case 〞 which SQN is bankrolling 〞 if the Chinese group would buy $55 million in Suniva equipment SQN got stuck with in the bankruptcy. SQN is not the only Suniva affiliate to cast a shadow over the trade complaint. The firm that owns 64% of Suniva is actually located in China 〞 one of the main targets of the trade case. That firm, Shunfeng, has declared the case bad for the solar industry. Many solar executives back in California agree. ※This would significantly shrink the size of the market and directly impact the number of people employed in our value chain,§ said Tom Werner, chief executive of the large solar firm SunPower. His California-based company employs 1,000 people directly and works with a dealer network that includes 12,000 solar installers. He is bracing for the market to drop by as much as 60% if the levies being sought are imposed. Werner said he would have to cut his costs proportionately. Also deeply anxious about the case is the Los Angeles chapter of the National Electrical Contracting Assn., which represents firms employing more than 1,000 solar installers in the region. ※These are good middle class jobs,§ the association wrote in a letter opposing the levies. ※This proposed tariff would＃ make America the highest priced solar country and decimate the market.§ Yet other veterans of the California solar industry traveled to Washington Tuesday to warn trade commissioners that America is going to altogether cede the business of solar cell innovation to foreign competitors if the few homegrown companies left are not protected. Among them was Stephen Shea, who had been the vice president of a company called Beamreach Solar, which only recently had invested millions in a factory in Milpitas, Calif., to manufacture new generation solar cells. In January, Beamreach went bankrupt. It couldn＊t compete with cheap imports. ※I＊m convinced that without relief, the few remaining U.S. producers will go the way of Beamreach,§ Shea said.

"The federal deficit would swell and premiums for some health plans would rise sharply if the Trump administration makes good on a threat to cut off subsidies for low- and medium-income buyers of health insurance, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday. The report from the nonpartisan budget office, which analyzes the cost of legislation for Congress, provided the latest ammunition in a fight that has taken place largely behind the scenes on whether Trump will try to keep the market for individual health insurance stable over the next year or actively disrupt the marketplaces in hopes of forcing Congress to repeal or significantly change the Affordable Care Act. At issue is a provision of the law that greatly lowers the cost of insurance for millions of low- and middle-income consumers who do not get insurance from their jobs. Currently the law requires insurers to hold down deductibles and co-payments for people who receive coverage through the Obamacare marketplaces and whose incomes fall below a threshold of roughly two-and-a-half times the federal poverty level. That requirement can save thousands of dollars for families with big medical bills, especially those with low incomes, but it imposes a significant cost on insurance companies. To make insurers whole, the government reimburses them with what are known as cost-sharing reduction payments, totaling about $600 million a month. But as the new report explained, cutting off the payments would not save the government money overall, and instead would worsen the federal deficit. The fact that cutting that aid would increase federal spending may seem paradoxical, but it stems from the way Obamacare works. If the government stopped making the cost-sharing payments, insurers would still be required to hold down deductibles and co-payments for low- and moderate-income consumers. To avoid losing money, some insurers would pull out of the marketplaces. Most, however, would raise premiums, the budget office projected. The premiums for the medium-cost silver plans on the exchanges would go up by about 20% to 25% over the next couple of years, the budget office said. The cost of those higher premiums would land primarily on taxpayers, not on individual consumers. That＊s because nearly 80% of people receiving coverage on the marketplaces also receive a second kind of government assistance to help pay monthly premiums. As overall premiums rise, so will the cost of those other government subsidies. The net result would be to increase the federal deficit by almost $200 billion over the next 10 years, the budget office said. For months, President Trump and his top aides have threatened to end those payments, which they have characterized as insurer bailouts. But the administration has also missed self-declared deadlines for a decision. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has repeatedly left open the question of whether the payments will be made. The government makes the payments each month, with the next one due next week. Many congressional Republicans have counseled the administration to keep the payments intact, fearing a cutoff would destabilize insurance markets. Uncertainty over the future of the payments already has prompted insurers to raise premiums for next year, industry executives have said. The disruption would also greatly increase the number of people, particularly in rural areas, who live in areas with no insurers selling policies on the marketplaces, the budget office said. The budget office based its forecast on an assumption that payments would be phased out in an orderly way, starting in January. If the administration were to order a more abrupt end, insurance markets would be more severely disrupted, according to budget office staff members who briefed reporters on the condition that they not be quoted directly. Democrats quickly seized on the new report to amplify demands that Trump commit to continuing the payments. ※Let's be clear: this is not ＆Obamacare imploding.＊ We're talking about POTUS deliberately sabotaging the insurance market,§ Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said in a message on Twitter. If Trump cuts off the payments, ※he'll be responsible for Americans paying more for less care,§ said Senate Democratic leader Charles S. Schumer of New York. White House officials responded by calling the budget office projection a ※flawed report,§ although they did not identify any flaws in it. ※This disastrous law has devastated the middle class, and must be repealed and replaced. No final decisions have been made about the [cost-sharing reduction] payments. We continue to evaluate the issues,§ Ninio Fetalvo, a White House spokesman, said in a statement. Ironically, the renewed dispute comes as the markets under the Affordable Care Act have started to stabilize after a summer of disruption. Some insurers have pulled out of the individual market, notably Anthem Blue Cross. But the number of counties nationwide with no insurer serving the marketplace is now down to only two, from 38 earlier this summer, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracks the issue. If the subsidy payments are ended, insurers pulling out of the market would leave about 5% of the population in counties with no marketplace insurer, the budget office said. The cost-sharing reductions have long been a flash point. Republicans went to court in 2014 to challenge them, saying Congress had never appropriated money for them. A federal district judge agreed last year. The Obama administration appealed, and the ruling has been on hold ever since. At one point, Trump administration officials talked of dropping the appeal as a way to kill the payments, but Democratic state attorneys general recently won the right to intervene in the case, which would allow them to keep it alive if Trump pulled out.

Trump traveled to Manhattan after a brief visit to the White House, which is undergoing renovations while he vacations at his golf resort in New Jersey. The native New Yorker said Friday that he had stayed away since January because he realized the impact of the street closings and other aspects of a presidential visit.

Trump had taken a firmer stand earlier in the day on the white supremacist violence that wracked Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. But for many of the protesters, his remarks were too late, overshadowed by his statement on Saturday that ""many sides"" were responsible for the Charlottesville violence and his initial failure to name white supremacist groups as aggressors.

"President Trump＊s preferred candidate in the Alabama Senate primary Tuesday faces an uphill battle in a contest that could set the tone for other Republican Party skirmishes ahead of the 2018 midterm election. Trump endorsed Sen. Luther Strange, who should have had an easy lock on a seat he took over when Jeff Sessions, the state＊s longtime senator, resigned to become the Trump administration＊s attorney general. But the race has become an early test of Trump＊s power to persuade his most dedicated supporters. Trump＊s approval rating remains sky-high in Alabama, but that enthusiasm has not spilled over to Strange, who is also favored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Strange is trailing fiery former judge Roy Moore, according to recent polling. The outcome could foreshadow a deepening feud between the GOP＊s base voters and party leaders in the months to come. Some voters will surely be inspired by Trump＊s endorsement of Strange. But others still have doubts about how Strange was appointed to replace Sessions and his ties to McConnell and other Republican leaders, who have grown increasingly unpopular among many in the base. ※They＊re confused,§ said Terry Lathan, chairwoman of the Alabama Republican Party. With no candidate likely to emerge with a majority from a field that started with 10 Republicans, the top two vote-getters are expected to compete in a runoff in September. More troubling for ※Big Luther,§ as the towering 6-foot-9 Strange is known locally, is that Moore has held steady in polls and would be a formidable opponent if the two faced off next month. Moore is a colorful and well-known figure in Alabama, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court who was removed for refusing to get rid of a Ten Commandments display. He was later reinstated by voters only to be suspended after not conforming with the U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding same-sex marriage. Despite such setbacks, Moore at times seems more Trump-like in his outspokenness and popular support than Strange, the candidate Trump has supported through tweets and a robo-call. ※Luther has a tough battle on his hands,§ said Brent Buchanan, president of Cygnal consulting in Alabama, which is not working with any of the candidates. ※You have to tear down Moore, but nobody＊s every figured out the effective formula to do that.§ Democrats see almost zero chance to make inroads in Alabama, which has remained a Republican stronghold, though strategists in Washington are keeping tabs on developments. But more telling will be the outcome for Republicans, who are facing several spirited primary campaigns leading up to a midterm election they once hoped would put Democrats on defense. Two Republicans, Sens. Dean Heller in Nevada and Jeff Flake in Arizona, have long been known to be heading toward tough reelections in 2018. But now both are expected to face noisy primary campaigns with challengers from their right flank, testing their loyalty to Trump and to conservative issues. As money has poured in for Strange, including $4 million from McConnell＊s aligned Senate Leadership Fund, the message being sent to challengers is that the official channels in Washington are sticking with the incumbent. The group has been pounding the airwaves with ads critical of Moore, as well as another candidate in the race, Rep. Mo Brooks, hoping to ensure Strange can at least make the runoff. A National Republican Senatorial Committee affiliate poured in $200,000 for Strange on Monday. ※Sen. Luther Strange has done a great job representing the people of the Great State of Alabama. He has my complete and total endorsement!§ Trump tweeted last week. He followed up with another tweet Monday. Voters, though, have had other ideas. Some are skeptical of Strange because of the way he was appointed to the job. As the state＊s former attorney general, he was selected by a governor who was facing investigation and impeachment proceedings for possible wrongdoing related to a reported affair. He has since resigned. Others are still inspired by Moore for his strong stands, particularly on social issues. Brooks also retains a strong following as a conservative member of the House Freedom Caucus who was initially critical of Trump as a candidate, preferring Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. He has been criss-crossing the state on a ※Drain the Swap§ bus tour. Strange＊s backers are counting on Trump＊s tweets of support to push him to the runoff, and ultimately to election. ※It showed that the president is willing to engage in the Senate races and spend some of his political capital to achieve the outcome he wants,§ said Steven Law, a former McConnell aide now running the Senate Leadership Fund. ※That suggests he will take seriously his power and potential to impact the 2018 elections.§ President Donald Trump says the groups protesting against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, were ""also very violent.""

"Last Updated Jul 26, 2017 11:46 AM EDT President Trump announced in a Wednesday morning tweet that transgender people will not be allowed to serve in ""any capacity"" in the United States military. In a series of tweets, Mr. Trump announced the new policy after what he called ""consultation with my generals and military experts."" After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow...... ....Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming..... The president added that ""our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail."" The reversal appears to contradict Mr. Trump's previous tweets in support of the LGBTQ community during the 2016 campaign, saying in June of last year that he would ""fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs."" Thank you to the LGBT community! I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs. Mr. Trump's eldest daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump has also frequently spoken out in support of the LGBTQ community, tweeting that she was ""proud to support my LGBTQ friends."" I am proud to support my LGBTQ friends and the LGBTQ Americans who have made immense contributions to our society and economy. In response to Mr. Trump's early morning announcement, Defense Department's Press Director, Cpt. Jeff Davis said in a statement, ""We refer all questions about the President's statements to the White House."" Davis added, ""We will continue to work closely with the White House to address the new guidance provided by the Commander-in-Chief on transgender individuals serving the military. We will provide revised guidance to the Department in the near future."" The ban reverses an Obama-era military policy in operation since last year, which allowed transgender service members to serve openly in the military after former Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the previous ban, saying it was ""the right thing to do."" Since October 1, transgender troops have been able to receive medical care and start formally changing their gender identification in the Pentagon's personnel system. Obama's reversal of the ban mandated that the military had until July 1, 2017, to develop new policies to allow people already identifying as transgender to join the military if they met the variety of physical and medical standards necessary to enlist. The policy also mandated that individuals ""can no longer be discharged or otherwise separated from the military solely for being transgender individuals."" According to Defense, the policy was originally crafted through a ""comprehensive and inclusive process"" including leadership of the Armed Services, medical experts within the department, current transgender service members, outside advocacy groups and the RAND corporation. While Mr. Trump claimed the costs associated to allowing transgender service members into the military were too high in regards to medical needs, a?RAND study on the policy found that the costs of gender transition-related health care treatments were in fact relatively low. ""Using private health insurance claims data to estimate the cost of extending gender transition每related health care coverage to transgender personnel indicated that active-component health care costs would increase by between $2.4 million and $8.4 million annually, representing a 0.04- to 0.13-percent increase in active-component health care expenditures,"" the study reported. CBSN Originals explores the intricate world of gender, beyond him or her There are an estimated 1,320-6,630 transgender service members but few seek transition-related medical treatment -- between 29 and 129 per year, based on a survey of health insurance data. The RAND study went on to show that ""even upper-bound estimates indicate that less than 0.1 percent of the total force would seek transition-related care that could disrupt their ability to deploy."" The ban comes after military chiefs announced last month that they would seek a six-month delay before letting transgender people enlist in their services. Service leaders hammered out an agreement that rejected Army and Air Force requests for a two-year wait and reflected broader concerns that a longer delay would trigger criticism on Capitol Hill. Mr. Trump's surprise announcement comes amid his ongoing public battle with his Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the continuing Senate debate on health care. Meanwhile, in a statement by Sarah Kate Ellis, President and CEO of the LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD, Ellis said, ""President Trump today issued a direct attack on transgender Americans, and his administration will stop at nothing to implement its anti-LGBTQ ideology within our government -- even if it means denying some of our bravest Americans the right to serve and protect our nation."" Ellis added, ""Today further exposed President Trump's overall goal to erase LGBTQ Americans from this nation. Trump has never been a friend to LGBTQ Americans, and this action couldn't make that any more clear."" Chelsea Manning, the transgender soldier convicted of giving classified government materials to WikiLeaks who was released from a Kansas military prison last month, tweeted in response to Mr. Trump's ban saying, ""biggest baddest most $$ military on earth cries about a few trans people but funds the F-35? Sounds like cowardice."" so, biggest baddest most $$ military on earth cries about a few trans people ? but funds the F-35? ??sounds like cowardice ??? #WeGotThis President Barack Obama granted Manning clemency in his final days in office in January.

"As President Trump continues to publicly critique Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, says the president's comments on Sessions are ""not helpful."" ""I think you ought to praise in public and critique in private,"" Gowdy said on ""CBS This Morning"" on Wednesday. ""You shouldn't make personnel decisions, particularly at the Cabinet level, via Twitter,"" he added. ""It's a really hard job, the attorney general doesn't work for the president, he works for a blindfolded woman holding a set of scales."" The Republican's comments come after Mr. Trump's repeated admonishments of Sessions, saying he took ""very weak"" positions, was ""beleaguered"", and reiterated that he was ""very disappointed"" with Sessions during a Tuesday press conference with Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon. Gowdy said he understands Mr. Trump's frustrations over the Russia probe, saying that Sessions should have been ""more forthcoming"" about his interactions with Russian diplomats, but he suggested the matter is ""best discussed in private between two grown-ups."" ""Doing this publicly, I don't think helps our justice system,"" Gowdy said. Fellow lawmakers have also come out publicly against Mr. Trump's comments and sided with their former colleague, including South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham who called the president's critical tweets ""inappropriate."" Gowdy said he approved of Sessions recusing himself from the ongoing Russia investigation, saying that he had ""no choice"" in the matter, but said he should have told everyone about every meeting he encountered, adding that lawmakers ""shouldn't have to wait on the New York Times to tell us."" ""If I were interviewing people for the attorney general job, I would want to know is there any reason you can't do the job, or any cases you'd need to recuse yourself from,"" Gowdy said, adding that Jeff Sessions ""isn't the only person qualified to be attorney general in America."" When pressed on Mr. Trump's possible intentions to fire Sessions and bring in a new attorney general during the August recess, Gowdy said that he was not supportive of recess appointments.? ""I didn't like when Obama did it, it circumvents the Constitution,"" he said. In 2013, a federal appeals court ruled that under the Constitution, recess appointments can be made only between sessions of the Senate, not any time the Senate is away on a break. Gowdy added that he didn't think the president would follow through on a recess appointment. CBS News' Margaret Brennan reports that incoming White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci says Mr. Trump is not considering such a move.?

"Last Updated Jul 26, 2017 9:07 AM EDT Two senators were complaining that the White House is paying insufficient attention to the budget process, apparently unaware that their microphones were still on after a Senate subcommittee meeting Tuesday. Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, began discussing federal budget proposals. ""I swear, [the Office of Management and Budget] just went through and whenever there was 'grant,' they just X it out,"" Collins said. ""With no measurement, no thinking about it, no metrics, no nothing. It's just incredibly irresponsible."" ""Yes, I think 〞 I think he's crazy,"" Reed said. ""I mean, I don't say that lightly and as a kind of a goofy guy."" When asked later by CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan if he was referring to President Trump, Reed replied, ""I was talking about the budget legislation."" He did not elaborate. CBS News reached out to Reed's office for more clarification, which responded, ""They are talking about budget demands."" The hot mic recording continued with Collins' reply: ""I'm worried,"" she says. ""Oof,"" Reed sighs. ""You know, this thing 〞 if we don't get a budget deal, we're going to be paralyzed."" ""I know,"" Collins said. ""[Department of Defense] is going to be paralyzed, everybody is going to be paralyzed,"" Reed replies. ""I don't think he knows there is a [Budget Control Act] or anything,"" Collins said in reference to a law outlining the budget process. If Democrats and Republicans cannot reach a budget agreement, as Collins mentioned, there will be across-the-board cuts to discretionary spending, because of the Budget Control Act, passed in 2011. And that agreement requires 60 votes. ""He was down at the Ford commissioning,"" Reed says, apparently talking about Mr. Trump's recent announcement regarding a Navy aircraft carrier, ""saying, 'I want them to pass my budget.' Okay, so we give him $54 billion and then we take it away across the board which would cause chaos."" ""Right,"" Collins said. ""It's just 〞 and he hasn't 〞 not one word about the budget. Not one word about the debt ceiling,"" Reed said. ""Good point,"" Collins replies. The debt ceiling must be raised likely by mid-October or the U.S. risks defaulting on its debt. ""You've got [Budget Director Mick] Mulvaney saying we're going to put in all sorts of stuff like a border wall. Then you've got [Treasury Secretary Steve] Mnuchin saying it's got to be clean,"" Reed continues. ""We're going to be back in September, and, you know, you're going to have crazy people in the House."" Following this point in the conversation between the two senators, they began discussing Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas. Recently, Farenthold said in a radio interview that if Collins were not a female, he could challenge her to a ""duel,"" citing frustration with Collins' opposition to the Senate health care bill aimed at repealing Obamacare. ? ""Did you see the one who challenged me to a duel?"" Collins asked Reed. ""I know, trust me, do you know why he challenged you to a duel? 'Cause you could beat the s**t out of him,"" Reed joked. ""Well, he's huge and he 〞 I don't mean to be unkind, but he's so unattractive it's unbelievable,"" Collins said of Farenthold. ""Did you see the picture of him in his pajamas next to this Playboy bunny?"" she continued, referencing a photo of Farenthold wearing a matching pajama set with rubber ducks while standing next to a scantily-clad young woman. The recording of the conversation between the two senators conversation ended after this comment.?

"Last Updated Jul 26, 2017 9:07 AM EDT MOSCOW -- A senior Russian diplomat said Wednesday that a new package of U.S. sanctions against Russia harms chances for improving the ties between the two countries, pushing them into ""uncharted territory,"" and that they ""defied common sense,"" CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports. Russian officials welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump's presidential win last year, hoping to mend relations with the United States, which reached a post-Cold War low under President Barack Obama. But six months into Mr. Trump's presidency, ties between the two countries remained tense, and the much-anticipated first meeting between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin early this month did not seem to produce any tangible results. Eager to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly backed a new package of sanctions against Moscow that prohibits Mr. Trump from waiving the penalties without first getting permission from Congress. The Treasury Department fined ExxonMobil $2 million Thursday for violating U.S. sanctions in 2014 when it signed contracts with a blacklisted Rus... Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov criticized the move on Wednesday as ""closing off the prospect for normalizing ties."" He said it ""defied common sense"" and told the Interfax news agency the new sanctions are pushing Russia and the U.S. ""into uncharted territory both in political and diplomatic sense."" In a press briefing, Kremlin spokeperson Dmitry Peskov called the proposed new sanctions unfriendly, and said ""the attitude to this (law) will be formed on the basis of a thorough analysis, and the decision (on how to respond) will certainly be taken by the head of state, President Putin,"" the Reuters news agency reported. ""Right now we can say that this is rather sad news from the point of view of Russia-U.S. ties and their further development,"" Peskov continued. ""This is no less disheartening from the point of view of international law and international trade relations.... But let's now wait until it becomes a law,"" he said. The director of the Russian International Affairs Council, Andrei Kortunov, told CBS News that Russians aren't happy about being put in the same category as Iran and North Korea. ""Basically, the signal is: You three bad guys will get the same treatment from the United States congress,"" Kortunov said. ""And with all due respect, but Russia is not North Korea."" Another lawmaker said the only course ahead was to come up with a ""painful"" response to Washington's move, D'Agata reports. Meanwhile, the European Union had its own concerns with the new proposed set of sanctions. On Wednesday, EU commissioners released a statement which ""expressed their concerns notably because of the draft bill's possible impact on EU energy independence,"" the AFP news agency reported. France's foreign ministry said Wednesday that the sanctions could violate international law, Reuters reported, and Germany said it would examine the new package. Germany and Austria in recent weeks have criticized the planned penalties, saying they could affect European businesses involved in piping Russian natural gas. German spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said Wednesday that Germany opposes in principle ""sanctions with extraterritorial effects."" She added it's important for the European Union and the U.S. to continue closely coordinating sanctions against Russia and ""in this light, we will examine in detail the bill that has now been approved."" German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer said the U.S. isn't entitled to tell European companies how to do business with a third country, but the legislation has improved from the original proposal.

"No knot-tying demonstrations. No wood-carving advice. President Trump went straight to starting a fire in a speech at a national Boy Scout gathering. Parents, former Scouts and others were furious after Mr. Trump railed against his enemies, promoted his political agenda and underlined his insistence on loyalty before an audience of tens of thousands of school-age Scouts in West Virginia on Monday night. Is nothing safe? @realDonaldTrump turns @boyscouts event into Nazi Youth rally. Boy Scouts must repudiate such a disgraceful display. ""Is nothing safe?"" Jon Wolfsthal, a former special assistant to President Barack Obama, wrote on Twitter, saying Trump turned the event into a ""Nazi Youth rally."" Mr. Trump, the eighth president to address the National Scout Jamboree, was cheered by the crowd, but his comments put an organization that has tried in recent years to avoid political conflict and become more inclusive in an awkward position. ""I go to Washington and I see all these politicians, and I see the swamp,"" he told the Scouts. ""And it's not a good place. In fact today I said we ought to change it from the word swamp to the word cesspool or, perhaps, to the word sewer. But it's not good. Not good."" The knot-tying was left to Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who said on Twitter that his stomach was in knots over Mr. Trump's over-the-top delivery. As a Scout leader, my stomach is in knots about what Trump did today. If you haven't watched it yet, don't. It's downright icky. ""If you haven't watched it yet, don't,"" Murphy said. ""It's downright icky."" The Boy Scouts' official Facebook page was barraged with comments condemning the speech. Several people posted links to the Scouts' policy on participation in political events -- which sharply limits what Scouts should do. Boy Scouts are typically 10 to 18 years old. One woman wrote in disbelief that the Scouts started booing when Mr. Trump mentioned Obama. On Tuesday, the day after the speech, the association released a statement to CBS News saying they are ""wholly non-partisan"" and do not ""promote any one political position, candidate or philosophy."" ""The invitation for the sitting U.S. President to visit the National Jamboree is a long-standing tradition dating back to President Franklin Roosevelt in 1937. Since then, an invitation to speak has been extended to every U.S. President that has had a Scout Jamboree occur during his term,"" the group said in a statement.? The statement went on to say that the 80-year long custom of inviting presidents to speak ""is based on our ""Duty to Country"" from the Scout Oath and out of respect for the Office of the President of the United States.""? ""As one of America's largest youth-serving organizations, the Boy Scouts of America reflects a number of cultures and beliefs. We will continue to be respectful of the wide variety of viewpoints in this country,"" they added.? Mr. Trump noted from the podium that Obama did not personally attend either of the two national jamborees during his tenure. (Obama did address the 2010 gathering by video to mark the Scouts' 100th anniversary. The jamboree is typically held every four years.) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former president of the Boy Scouts, invited Mr. Trump to the gathering, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Tuesday. ""When all is said and done, those Boy Scouts, what they will remember from the jamboree in West Virginia is that the president showed up,"" Nauert said. ""And that's a pretty incredible thing."" The pushback from Americans over the speech included members from both parties. ""I just don't think it was appropriate,"" said Rob Romalewski, a Republican and retired information-technology expert from suburban New Orleans who attained the rank of Eagle Scout as a teenager and has worked with the Boy Scouts all his adult life. ""It just doesn't seem like he was talking to the boys,"" Romalewski said. ""He was more or less just using it as an excuse to babble on."" Nancy Smith, a Democrat and elementary school teacher from Shelby Township, Michigan, said she won't encourage any of her six grandchildren to enter Scouting. Smith is asking for an apology from the national group. Mr. Trump kicked off his speech by saying, to cheers from the boys, ""Who the hell wants to speak about politics when I'm in front of the Boy Scouts? Right?"" Yet much of what he had to say next was steeped in politics. Mr. Trump began to recite the Scout law, a 12-point oath that starts with a Scout being trustworthy and loyal. ""We could use some more loyalty, I will tell you that,"" said the man who is alleged to have asked fired FBI Director James Comey for a pledge of loyalty. In his speech, Mr. Trump also jokingly threatened to fire Health Secretary Tom Price -- an Eagle Scout who joined him on stage -- if lawmakers do not repeal and replace Obama's health care law. He called Washington a ""swamp,"" a ""cesspool"" and a ""sewer."" He repeatedly trashed the media, directing the crowd's attention to the reporters in attendance. In one aside, he told the boys they could begin saying ""Merry Christmas"" again under his watch. In another, he talked about a billionaire friend -- real estate developer William Levitt -- who sold his company, bought a yacht and led ""a very interesting life."" ""I won't go any more than that, because you're Boy Scouts, so I'm not going to tell you what he did,"" Mr. Trump teased. Then he said he had run into the man at a cocktail party. The moral of Mr. Trump's tale was that Levitt ""lost momentum,"" something he said they should never do. Levitt is often considered the father of postwar American suburbia, founding communities such as Levittown on New York's Long Island, but was criticized for refusing to sell to blacks. In the past few years, the Boy Scouts have retreated from the culture wars, dropping their ban on gay Scouts and Scout leaders, and have tried harder to recruit minorities. Zach Wahls, an Eagle Scout and co-founder of Scouts for Equality, a nonprofit group that has pushed to end discrimination against gay and transgender people in Scouting, said Mr. Trump's remarks ""really harmed the Boy Scouts' ability to do that work, which is all about serving America."" ""The wrong speech at the wrong place at the wrong time,"" Wahls said.																																																																																																																					"
"?Ivanka Trump has spoken at a fundraiser Tuesday night in Washington for Vice President Mike Pence's political committee. That's according to two people who attended the fundraiser and demanded anonymity to share information from the private event. Trump said Pence has been a key ally of the president and that Republicans should begin preparing for the 2018 congressional elections. Pence's political committee can dole out money to his preferred candidates.

California corrections officials have failed to ensure prison staff?members properly evaluate, treat?and monitor inmates at risk of taking their own lives, according to a scathing state audit released Thursday. The California State Auditor?report, requested by a joint legislative audit committee,?found state prisons?failed to follow their own suicide prevention and response policies, while?their average suicide rate was?substantially higher than the average of U.S. state prisons 〞 22?per 100,000?inmates versus 15.66 per 100,000 inmates. The state auditor's office reviewed 40?files on prisoners who committed or attempted suicide at four state prisons. Thirty-six inmates required suicide-risk evaluations, but mental health staff?failed to complete at least one?required risk evaluation for 10?prisoners?and completed inadequate risk evaluations?for 26?others. Prison staff members were said to have left some sections of these evaluations blank. They often didn't appropriately justify determinations of suicide risk, or failed to develop adequate plans for treatment, the report said. Court-appointed mental health experts had alerted corrections officials to the problems?for the past several years, it?found. Out of 25 inmates requiring treatment plans,?prison staff members did not develop adequate approaches to care?for 23 and failed to create any plans for?two, the audit found. Staff at all four prisons insufficiently monitored?inmates at risk of suicide, failing to check in on them at the required 15-minute?intervals, auditors found. The rates of women who have committed suicide in California state prisons soared, according to the report. From?2014 through?2016, women comprised about 4%?of the?total inmate population but?accounted for roughly 11% of its inmate suicides. Almost all occurred at the California Institute for Women in San Bernardino. Although drug involvement and domestic violence were among?factors that could have contributed to the higher rate of female inmate suicides, state auditors said, state prisons had not made sure staff were trained on suicide prevention and?response. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provides mental healthcare to roughly 123,000 men and 5,800 women incarcerated at its facilities.? State auditors recommended that the state Legislature require corrections officials to properly train staff and continue to develop their?oversight processes, including audits of prisons＊ risk evaluations and treatment?plans. The department should be required to report its progress each year, the report said. Corrections officials said no suicides had been reported at the California Institute for Women this year, where new programs to help suicide prevention offer brief, discreet counseling services. In a statement, state corrections?secretary Scott Kernan said the department ""has made a great deal of progress implementing policies, training, and support for suicide prevention practices statewide, and acknowledges there is further progress to make.""

"The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced Wednesday that it is?suing the Justice Department?to obtain more information about one of the government's surveillance programs. The government only has to tell individuals that it has been spying on them under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act if the evidence gathered is being used in a criminal trial or legal proceeding, the ACLU pointed out in a press release about the lawsuit. ""The vast majority of Americans surveilled under Section 702 will never be criminally prosecuted, so they will never know that the government has been secretly watching them,"" the ACLU said in its statement Wednesday. ""And without definitive proof that the government spied on them, individuals have an incredibly difficult time challenging the government's spying in court."" Under the statute, which is set to expire in December unless Congress renews it, the government sweeps up hundreds of millions of communications -- emails and phone calls -- involving Americans, without a warrant.? The Justice Department informed the ACLU, in response to another FOIA request, that it had issued a 31-page memo with its new policy, but it only gave the memo to federal prosecutors. The document has not been publicly released. It is this document that the ACLU is suing to release. CBS News' Paula Reid contributed to this report.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Jun 21, 2017 2:32 PM EDT Senate Democrats gathered outside the Capitol on Wednesday morning to protest the health care bill currently being drafted by their Republican colleagues, which is to be unveiled Thursday and?could be voted on as early as next week. ""Every Democrat, from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin and everyone in between, is united in defeating this 'mean' bill,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, a reference to the fact that?President Trump called the House version of the bill ""mean"" last week. The House?passed its version in May, while the Senate measure is currently being drafted by 13 male Republican senators who have kept the process and details of the bill tightly under wraps. ""We don't know what the bill looks like because it's been written by 13 male Republicans behind a closed door,"" Senator Al Franken, D-Minnesota, told the crowd. ""This heartless legislation that an overwhelming number of Americans oppose,"" he later added. Nearly three-quarters of Americans feel that Senate Republicans should discuss their plans openly with the public, according to a new CBS News poll released Tuesday. ""If you have a good bill, a bill that actually helps people, you don't need to keep it secret,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, declared, as the crowd that had gathered to hear the Democratic lawmakers broke into a chant of ""No hearing! No vote!"" All 46 Democratic senators in addition to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Sen. Angus King of Maine, are expected to oppose the proposed health care bill, and are attempting to convince just three of the 52 Republican senators to join them in their opposition to the bill, which needs just a simple majority to pass. ""Let me tell you what I believe: today as we stand here, they don't have the votes yet,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, who also described the Republican's draft of the bill ""morally bankrupt"" and ""evil."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, is aiming for a vote on the health care bill before Congress begins its week-long July 4 recess. ""I expect to have a discussion draft on Thursday and we will go to the bill obviously once we get a [Congressional Budget Office] score -- likely next week,"" McConnell told reporters Tuesday.?

"Democrats' decisive Tuesday night loss in Georgia's special election -- a race into which they poured tens of millions of dollars to make it the most expensive House race in U.S. history -- is leaving Democrats to strategize a path forward for the 2018 midterm elections.? Democrats had hoped a victory by Democrat Jon Ossoff over Republican Karen Handel would be a referendum against President Trump, and give them momentum and a winning strategy to succeed in other races. But Mr. Trump's low approval ratings weren't enough to sink Handel, especially given that neither candidate dwelled on Mr. Trump during the campaign. Handel's win -- 52 percent to Ossoff's 48 percent, disrupted those hopes of taking the seat left vacant by Republican Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price. Republicans have held that seat since Newt Gingrich won it in 1978, although Mr. Trump barely won the district by 1.5 percent in 2016.? Meanwhile, Ossoff's loss came in spite of massive Democratic fundraising. Ossoff had raised roughly $23 million and spent about $22 million as of the most recently available campaign finance reports. At the end of the day, money did not win the election. After the most expensive congressional race in history, largely from the Democrats' cash infusions, Ossoff called for campaign finance reform.? Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Massachusetts), tweeted that Ossoff's loss ""better be a wake up call for Democrats"" to look ahead, not backwards. #Ossof Race better be a wake up call for Democrats - business as usual isn't working. Time to stop rehashing 2016 and talk about the future. But all is not necessarily lost for Democrats. For one thing, Ossoff, a 30-year-old former Capitol Hill staffer, did outperform his district's partisan leanings by six points, according to Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report.? Former Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-California), said Ossoff's loss was ""tough,"" but Democrats, ""can and will do better in 2018."" Tough, tough loss in Georgia, but the fight goes on. Dems can and will do better in 2018. For Republicans, Handel's win had to offer some reassurance in Washington. It takes enormous pressure off Republicans, as they look to craft an Obamacare replacement bill acceptable to both chambers of Congress. A Handel loss would likely have been seen as not only a referendum on Mr. Trump, but a referendum on the GOP's progress -- or lack thereof -- on health care so far this year. Her win also seems to show the Republican strategy of tying Democratic candidates to the liberal House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi (D-California), can still be a winning one.? In terms of recruiting, Republicans who might have been uncertain about running next year will be less nervous after this string of victories. Ossoff's loss is the latest in a string of Democratic losses in all three other special congressional elections that have taken place this year. However, those races were all the result of vacancies stemming from the president's appointment of Republican officeholders to cabinet positions. All of those districts were GOP districts. Though it's hard to say what the landscape will look like a year from now, a loss certainly would have been discouraging, especially to wavering GOP incumbents considering retirement and to potential candidates. But Handel's win only buys some breathing room, as Russia investigations, White House intrigue and policy disagreements on Capitol Hill continue to stall the GOP agenda in Washington.?

"Last Updated Jun 21, 2017 5:05 PM EDT WASHINGTON?〞 Montana Republican Greg Gianforte was sworn into the House Wednesday as the newest member of Congress, a month after he body-slammed a reporter who had questioned him about the GOP health care bill. Gianforte, a wealthy former software executive, has called for civility in politics following his conviction for assaulting the reporter the day before winning a special congressional election. Gianforte, 56, won a May 25 special election to serve the remaining 18 months in the House term vacated by now-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Gianforte, who already has filed for re-election, was to take the oath of office by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Gianforte said his main priority is to make sure Montanans' voices are heard, and he pledged to ""protect our Montana way of life from federal overreach and bring accountability to Washington."" With Gianforte officially joining the House, Republicans have?239 members to 193 for Democrats. Three seats are vacant although the elections have been held. The winners will be sworn in later. Gianforte told The Associated Press last week that he is keenly aware he will carry with him the distinction of being the congressman who beat up the reporter. ""I can't erase it, but I did do everything in my power once the event was over to take responsibility,"" he said. Members of Congress have an obligation to ratchet down the vitriol in politics, especially after last week's shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise during a Republican congressional baseball practice, Gianforte said. The shooter had volunteered for Bernie Sanders' Democratic presidential campaign and expressed grievances online about President Donald Trump and Republicans. ""I believe that good things can come out of bad,"" Gianforte said. ""It's important to make sure we reach out to all parties and hear their voice. I think the other parties have an obligation, as well, to be respectful and in that dialogue."" Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs said Gianforte body-slammed him to the ground and broke his glasses after Jacobs asked about the health care bill that had recently passed the Republican-controlled House. Audio taken by Jacobs recorded the sounds of a scuffle followed by Gianforte yelling, ""Get the hell out of here!"" Gianforte was ordered to pay a fine, perform community service and take anger management training, but he received no jail time. He also avoided a civil lawsuit by writing a letter of apology to Jacobs and donating $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In a statement Wednesday, Jacobs said he welcomed Gianforte to Capitol Hill, ""where I'm confident he will live up to his pledge to champion a free press and the First Amendment. In the courtroom last week, he openly offered to do an interview with me when he came to Washington and I look forward to taking him up on that in the coming days.""

"Republican Karen Handel shattered Democrats' hopes Tuesday night to take Georgia's 6th Congressional District seat away from the GOP and turn the election into a referendum on the policies and the person of President Trump.? So, who is she? Handel, 55, is the first woman Georgia Republicans have ever sent to Congress, an overlooked fact in the midst of Tuesday night's events. The former Georgia secretary of state lost multiple bids for higher office before winning her seat in Congress in the most expensive House race in history. In 2014, she lost a GOP primary for U.S. Senate to David Perdue, and in 2010, she narrowly lost her bid for the GOP nomination for governor.? Handel is no stranger to Washington, D.C. It's where she was born. She grew up in nearby Upper Marlboro, Maryland, where she went to high school. According to her Premiere Speakers Bureau bio, Handel left an ""abusive home"" at 17, finishing high school and entering the workforce on her own.? ""I've had to be tough my whole life. I moved out when I was 17 to get away from a pretty tough and difficult family environment,"" Handel said in a digital ad that ran this year.? Handel spent some time at Prince George's Community College in Maryland and at the University of Maryland, but never graduated from college, placing her in the roughly 5 percent of members of Congress without a bachelor's degree.? After her time at college, she worked at a Hallmark Cards store before working for Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn Quayle.? She and her husband, Steve Handel, who have no children, moved to the Atlanta area in the 1990s.? In the private sector, Handel held executive management positions with CIBA Vision and the accounting firm KPMG. She also served as president and CEO of the North Fulton Chamber of Commerce.? It was in Atlanta that Handel's career in politics really began, working as an aide in the office of then-Gov. Sonny Perdue in the early 2000s. Handel served as the chairwoman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners from 2003 to 2006, before she was elected Georgia's first Republican secretary of state in 2006. As secretary of state, Handel implemented a controversial voter ID law, legislation other states soon copied. Handel served in that role until 2010.? Georgia voters are sending the state's first Republican woman to Congress after a closely watched special election. Karen Handel got nearly 52 pe... In 2012, she gained national attention when she resigned from her role as a vice president at the Susan G. Komen for the Cure, after the board decided to restore funding to Planned Parenthood. Handel wrote a book in the wake of her departure -- ""Planned Bullyhood: The Truth Behind the Headlines about the Planned Parenthood Funding Battle with Susan G. Komen for the Cure."" On the issues, Handel is a standard conservative Republican -- she is pro-life, wants a simpler tax code, pro-border wall and supports a strong national defense, according to her website. During her 2014 Senate bid, Handel said she would be more like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) than Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). Handel is a fan of the Indianapolis Colts, an NFL team that left Baltimore, Maryland, in the 1980s.

Mr. Trump on Friday morning tweeted about his own Twitter use, likening it to what he perceives as a successful messaging campaign. The president's lawyers and some Republicans?have urged him to ease up on his tweeting, out of concern that it may hurt him legally in the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, and in the the lawsuits over his travel ban. ""These tweets that he does feeds that lynch mob,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina,?said on Sunday about?Mr. Trump's Twitter strategy on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""You're your own worst enemy here, Mr. President. Knock it off."" ? George Conway, lawyer and husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, suggested last week to the president that his Twitter posts about his travel ban being struck down by district courts were not helping him in the courtroom. ""These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won't help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters,"" Conway said. ""Sad.""? ? On Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein responded to Mr. Trump's tweet that he's ""being investigated for firing the FBI director.""

"Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the finances and business dealings of Trump son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner, in relation to his investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election, the Washington Post reported Thursday, citing U.S. officials familiar with the matter. CBS News confirmed late last month that Kushner is under scrutiny in the?probe into Russian election meddling. The special counsel's office did not respond to a request for comment on the report.? Kushner's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, issued a statement reading, ""We do not know what this report refers to.? It would be standard practice for the Special Counsel to examine financial records to look for anything related to Russia.? Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about Russia-related matters.? He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry."" ? FBI agents and federal prosecutors have also been examining the financial dealings of other Trump associates, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Carter Page, who was listed as a foreign-policy adviser for the campaign. Federal investigators are looking into meetings Kushner held in December with Russia's ambassador and a banker from Moscow, CBS News previously reported. The banker, Sergey Gorkov, is the head of VEB Bank, a state-owned Russian entity that is the subject of U.S. government sanctions. Gorkov was trained by Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB.?

"Last Updated Jun 16, 2017 11:10 AM EDT NEW YORK -- Delta Air Lines and Bank of America have announced that they are pulling their sponsorship of a Manhattan-based theater company's portrayal of Julius Caesar as a Donald Trump look-alike in a business suit who gets knifed to death on stage. Atlanta-based Delta released a statement on Sunday saying it was pulling its sponsorship from The Public Theater ""effective immediately."" ""No matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging of Julius Caesar at this summer's Free Shakespeare in the Park does not reflect Delta Air Lines' values,"" the statement said. ""Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste."" Though the Public's version of William Shakespeare's classic play is unchanged from its 400-year-old original, the production portrays Caesar with a gold bathtub and a pouty Slavic wife. President Trump's name is never mentioned. The theme of the play is a lesson on how badly things go awry when people see fit to kill their leader. In the second act of the play, chaos ensues, and society falls apart. Tina Benko, left, portrays Melania Trump in the role of Caesar's wife, Calpurnia, and Gregg Henry, center left, portrays President Trump in the role of Julius Caesar during a dress rehearsal of The Public Theater's Free Shakespeare in the Park production of ""Julius Caesar"" in New York in this May 21, 2017, file photo provided by The Public Theater.

The nonprofit theater that prides itself on its innovative and challenging work said it was aware that the play has ""provoked heated discussion"" among audiences, sponsors and supporters. ""We recognize that our interpretation of the play has provoked heated discussion; audiences, sponsors and supporters have expressed varying viewpoints and opinions,"" the statement said. ""Such discussion is exactly the goal of our civically-engaged theater; this discourse is the basis of a healthy democracy."" On Sunday, Donald Trump Jr. retweeted a Fox News story about the play and wrote, ""I wonder how much of this 'art' is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does 'art' become political speech & does that change things?"" I wonder how much of this ""art"" is funded by taxpayers?

It added that ""no NEA funds"" are supporting the New York State Council on the Arts' grant to the Public or its performances. ""Julius Caesar"" tells a fictionalized story of a powerful, popular Roman leader who is assassinated by senators who fear he is becoming a tyrant. It is set in ancient Rome, but many productions have costumed the characters in modern dress to give it a present-day connection.

"WASHINGTON?-- Senate Republicans' struggle to pass a health care bill is jeopardizing another one of President Donald Trump's top priorities: overhauling America's tax system. A day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., delayed a vote on a bill to scrap much of Democrat Barack Obama's health law, questions lingered about whether congressional Republicans could pass big, complicated pieces of legislation. ""The whole idea is to do health care first because you gain an advantage there to go on and do tax reform,"" said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan. ""We've sort of bollixed that up, but I'm encouraged."" Senators were still struggling Wednesday to reach an agreement on key parts of the health bill before they leave Washington for a week-long recess. Moderates complained that too many people would lose coverage while conservatives said the bill wouldn't do enough to lower insurance premiums. It is important for Congress to resolve the health bill before moving on to a tax overhaul. Here's why: The health bill provides nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts that won't add to the nation's mounting debt. Republicans are counting on those tax cuts to help them write a new tax code that raises less money. Also, Republicans are using a complicated rule that enables the Senate to pass both a health bill and a tax package with a simple majority, preventing Senate Democrats from blocking the legislation. Under the rule, Congress has to resolve health care - by either passing a bill or killing it - before lawmakers can pass a tax package. ""They need to resolve health care one way or another before they do tax reform,"" said Rohit Kumar, a former tax counsel for McConnell who is now with PwC. Thirty-one years after the last tax overhaul, there is widespread agreement that the current system is too complicated and picks winners and losers. There is, however, widespread disagreement over how to fix it. Republican leaders in Congress want to simplify the tax code and make it more efficient in a way that does not add to the federal government's mounting debt. That means some would pay more and some would pay less, a heavy political lift among politicians who have deep political and practical disagreements. ""I think what it says is that it's harder than it looks,"" Kumar said, adding: ""I think part of what you're seeing here is the steep learning curve of what it takes to govern and the trade-offs that have to be made and the compromises that have to be made even with members of your own party,"" Kumar added. Some rank-and-file Republicans want to cut taxes even if it adds to the debt. ""The debate will be whether it's a tax cut or a revenue-neutral tax-shifting bill,"" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. ""I'm sort of on the tax cut side of that."" For individuals, Republicans leaders want to lower overall tax rates and make up the lost revenue by eliminating some popular tax breaks, including the federal deduction for state and local taxes, a proposal opposed by Democrats and some Republicans in states like New York, New Jersey and California. For businesses, House Republicans want to lower the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. They would make up the lost revenue by increasing taxes on imports and eliminating the deduction for interest on debt, two proposals that face widespread opposition, even from other Republicans. Trump wants to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent but has been less specific on how it would be financed. The Trump administration has said the president hopes to release a comprehensive plan in September. But Congress will be dealing with several other big issues, including funding for the government and extending the government's ability to borrow. ""I was much more optimistic earlier in the year,"" said Jon Traub, a former Republican staff director for the House Ways and Means Committee who is now with Deloitte Tax. ""I've become more pessimistic as the days have ticked by, closer and closer to the crunch time of when a bunch of big things have to be done with a limited number of days left on the calendar,"" Traub said.

"Amid continuing party turmoil over the lack of support of the latest version of the Republican Senate health bill, additional funds have been added to the Better Care Reconciliation Act for opioid treatment, as well as new language to allow for Health Spending Accounts (HSA) funds to be used for insurance premiums to quell members' concerns, CBS News has confirmed.? Overdoses are now the leading cause of death of Americans under the age of 50, and these drugs are the biggest culprits CBS News' Major Garrett reports that Trump administration officials confirm $45 billion was added at the request of various Republican members, including Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. Many Republican moderates have expressed concern over the way the bill addresses Medicaid funding, particularly as it relates to treating the nation's?opioid epidemic. Residents in states like West Virginia and Ohio rely on government health coverage. While Portman and Capito are generally reliable votes for GOP leadership, their constituents' reliance on Medicaid has become a major sticking point for their support.? In many cases, voters with addiction problems rely on Medicaid for treatment help, and Portman and Capito both represent states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. Last year about 100,000 low-income West Virginia residents with Medicaid coverage had drug abuse diagnoses, according to state health officials. The newly added HSA language is for conservatives as they regard Health Savings Accounts as a way for individuals and families to save for future health care costs and wanted flexibility for funds to be used for premiums. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said the Republican health care effort is ""working along very well"" and suggested there could be a ""big surprise coming."" The White House did not elaborate on what Mr. Trump meant. His comments came just one day after Republican leadership announced they would be delaying the vote amid concerns that the bill lacked the necessary support to pass in the Senate.? But leaders are still aiming to have a revised bill crafted by Friday so that it can be scored over the July 4 recess. Following a closed-door Senate GOP Conference lunch Wednesday, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, said the goal by Friday is ""to get a bill that we can then get scored."" Cornyn, however, cautioned that the issues at play are ""all up in the air until we can find a way to build consensus to 50 votes.""

"It was a platform most politicians can only hope for: A captivated, 6,000-person crowd and more than an hour of live, prime-time television coverage to hype the Republican vision for a new health care system. But when President Donald Trump got around to talking about the Republican plan 〞 about 15 minutes into his speech 〞 he was wildly off message. Instead of preaching party lines about getting the government out of Americans' health decisions and cutting costs, he declared: ""Add some money to it!"" President Donald Trump says getting approval of a Senate health care bill will be ""very tough."" But he predicts that Republicans will at least ""get very close"" and may ""get it over the line."" The moment captured a major dilemma for Republicans as they look for ways to jumpstart their stalled health care overhaul. A master salesman, Trump has an inimitable ability to command attention, and that could be used to bolster Americans' support for Republican efforts and ramp up pressure on wavering lawmakers. But some lawmakers and congressional aides privately bemoan his thin grasp of the bill's principles, and worry that his difficulty staying on message will do more harm than good. ""You know, he's very personable and people like talking to him and he's very embracing of that, so there will be certain people he'd like to talk to,"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. ""But I'd let Mitch handle it,"" he continued, referring to the lead role Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has played thus far. McConnell delayed a vote on the health legislation this week after it became clear he couldn't muster enough Republican support to offset the unanimous opposition from Democrats. GOP leaders are now hoping to pass a bill in the Senate and reconcile it with an earlier version approved by the House before lawmakers head home for their August recess. Trump has largely ceded the details to McConnell, deferring to the Kentucky lawmaker's legislative expertise. He has spent some time talking privately to wavering senators, including Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, testing his powers of persuasion. But he's invested no significant effort in selling the American people on the impact the Republican bill would have on their health care coverage, beyond making sweeping declarations about how wonderful he expects it to be. ""We're looking at a health care that will be a fantastic tribute to your country,"" Trump said during a White House event Wednesday. ""A health care that will take care of people finally for the right reasons and also at the right cost."" His approach is a contrast to former President Barack Obama, who delivered an address to Congress on health care and held town halls around the country about the Democrats' legislation in 2009. The Obamacare measure barely cleared Congress and became a rallying cry for Republicans, something Obama blamed in part on a failure by his party to communicate its virtues clearly to the public. At times, even Trump's largely generic health care commentary has left Republicans fuming. Some lawmakers were particularly irked by Trump's assertion that the House bill 〞 which he robustly supported and even celebrated with a Rose Garden ceremony 〞 was ""mean."" One Republican congressional aide said that comment left some lawmakers worried that the president 〞 who had no real ties to the GOP before running for the White House 〞 could turn on them if a bill passes but the follow-up becomes politically damaging. The official insisted on anonymity in order to describe private discussions. Newt Gingrich, the former GOP House speaker and a close Trump ally, said Republicans have struggled to communicate about the complexities of health care policy because ""nobody has served as a translator."" He said Trump is well-positioned to take the lead, but acknowledged that the real estate mogul-turned-politician would need some help from policy experts in formulating a sales pitch. ""Trump will be able to repeat it with enormous effectiveness once somebody translates it,"" Gingrich said. The White House disputes that Trump isn't steeped in the details of the Obamacare repeal efforts. Economic adviser Gary Cohn and other officials on the National Economic Council have convened several meetings with him to explain differences between the House and Senate bills. One senior White House official described the president as ""fully engaged"" in the process. During a private meeting Tuesday with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who is strongly opposed to the current Senate bill, Trump said his priority was to increase the number of insurance choices available to consumers and lower monthly premiums, according to an administration official with direct knowledge of the discussion. The official said the president also specifically highlighted the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office's projection that average premiums would be 30 percent lower in 2020 if the Senate bill took effect. To some Trump allies, more public engagement on a substantive policy debate like the future of the nation's health care system would also be a welcome reprieve for a president whose approval ratings have tumbled amid the snowballing investigations into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. ""I think his numbers would go up if he had a couple of addresses,"" said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser. ""If he communicates directly with the American people, he cuts through the noise.""

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is delaying the vote on the Senate health care bill -- originally slated to take place before the July 4 holiday -- while a number of GOP senators remain opposed to their own party's unpopular proposal. The House passed its version of health care reform in May, but only narrowly, and with no Democratic support. Republicans have championed repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare since its passage in 2010, but as the months of President Trump's administration drag on, some in Washington, D.C., are becoming skeptical that they can make good on that Trump campaign promise. So, what happens if -- well, nothing happens? Obamacare will remain the law of the land, although it will be in shaky shape. Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, says that efforts to repeal the bill have created an atmosphere of instability that have exacerbated the ACA's problems. ""Of course [the ACA] is imploding,"" Kominski tells CBS News. ""[President Trump] is pushing it off a cliff."" That means insurers will continue to leave the health care markets set up by the ACA, particularly in areas with a high ""risk profile"" that have more people with chronic illnesses and other things that could increase health care costs. Insurers, Kominski says, are ""the opposite of first responders. They're the last responders. First responders run to the danger. Health insurers run away from the dangers."" Experts on both the left and right agree that the new atmosphere of uncertainty about the ACA that would result from a failure to pass a new bill would cause problems. ""If they don't [pass legislation] then you're going to take everything that was already wrong with the ACA and add more uncertainty on top of it,"" says Robert Graboyes, a senior research fellow and health care scholar at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. Broadly speaking, the answer is probably yes, as premiums have already gone up considerably over the last year. But a lot of that depends on what the Trump administration decides to do next, particularly when it comes to funding the law. Premium subsidies, which the government gives out to help people pay for health insurance plans based on their income and what kind of plan they want, would stay untouched. However, the Trump administration could cut off cost-sharing reduction payments, or CSRs, which are paid to insurers to help defray the costs of deductibles and the like. ""We've seen insurers pull out in the face of the uncertainty created by the administration and we've also seen insurers propose significant premium increases, due to that uncertainty,"" says Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. So I think if the Senate bill fails, I think there's just tremendous uncertainty about what the Trump administration will do in running the marketplaces for 2018, and we could certainly see more insurers pull out or raise premiums significantly in the face of that."" Kaiser Family Foundation found premiums, after tax credits, would rise under the Senate health plan. For all age groups, premiums for so-called s... If the Trump administration gets rid of CSRs, they could go quite high. In North Carolina, Blue Cross Blue Shield is already warning its ACA enrollees that premium prices could increase more than 20 percent if the cost-sharing premiums are done away with. Covered California, the state Obamacare exchange, has asked insurers to provide two sets of premium rates -- one with CSRs, and one without them. If the CSRs stick around, which is up to the administration, and the federal government keeps funneling money to insurance companies, the premium rate hike is expected to be around nine percent.? Without any new legislation, Obamacare remains the law of the land. That includes the financial penalties on those who don't have insurance. But the Trump administration could -- and has already indicated it might -- simply choose not to enforce those penalties. The penalty was already difficult to enforce under Obamacare, Graboyes said. But any emphasis that the penalty won't be enforced could encourage young and healthy people who might have purchased health care to stay out of the market, potentially hiking premiums for others.? No. Again, the law stays on the books unless Congress gets rid of it and replaces it with something else. ""Reversion to the pre-Obamacare status quo is not possible without federal legislation,"" says Michael Cannon, the director of health policy at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""The Medicaid expansions and subsidies will still be on the books, as will the insurance regulations,"" says conservative health care analyst Avik Roy. ""Businesses can 'collapse onto themselves' and go away. When government programs fail, they stay on the books."" At the same time, insurance companies would be likely to keep pulling out of individual counties, meaning that more and more Americans would have no ACA options whatsoever, or perhaps just one plan to choose from. According to Kaiser Family Foundation, 47 counties -- encompassing 33,894 enrollees -- are at risk of having no insurer on the marketplace for them in 2018.? Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel was one of the architects of President Obama's signature Affordable Care Act. He also met with President Trump three times to... ""If the House and Senate can't move forward with this disastrous legislation that they're proposing, then for the time being Medicaid continues as is,"" says Kominski. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, is considered an extremely able legislative tactician. However, he's in an uncomfortable spot. Some conservative Republican senators oppose the bill because they believe it doesn't go far enough in repealing the ACA, while more moderate members of the GOP caucus worry the bill will hobble popular services. Democrats, meanwhile, are uniformly opposed to the legislation. Republicans have a narrow majority in the Senate, controlling 52 seats to the Democrats' 48. That means McConnell can afford two no-votes from Republicans, while three would kill the bill. Nine Republicans?now oppose the bill in its current form, meaning it will be exceptionally difficult to pass this legislation by the end of July.

"Last Updated Jun 29, 2017 3:43 PM EDT WASHINGTON -- What is a bona fide relationship and why does it matter? It's the basis for the implementation of the president's travel ban, and after the Supreme Court's ruling that the ban can be partially enforced, the Trump administration has set new criteria for visa applicants from six mainly Muslim nations and all refugees that require a ""close"" family or business tie to the United States.? The new rules took effect at 8 p.m. ET Thursday following the State Department sending a cable to all U.S. embassies and consulates late Wednesday, which was obtained first by The Associated Press. A parent, a spouse, child or sibling. According to the New York Times, this also includes step siblings. Visas that have already been approved will not be revoked, but instructions issued by the State Department say new applicants from Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen must prove a relationship with a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling already in the United States to be eligible. The same requirement, with some exceptions, holds for would-be refugees from all nations who are still awaiting approval for admission to the U.S. Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancees or other extended family members are not considered to be close relationships, according to the guidelines issued in the cable. The cable's language ""closely mirrored the Supreme Court's order on the travel ban, though it appeared to interpret it in a narrow manner, notably in its definition of close family,"" according to Reuters. ""It was unclear Wednesday evening whether the State Department's interpretation of the court's order would spark further legal action by opponents of the ban."" Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights, remarked to the AP that, ""Initial reports suggest that the government may try to unilaterally expand the scope of the ban - for example, by arbitrarily refusing to treat certain categories of familial relationships as ""bona fide."" These reports are deeply concerning. We are watching for official word."" The State Department says that a close relationship must be ""formal, documented and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading"" the ban. The ban may also not apply to people who have ""previously established"" or ""significant business"" contacts with the U.S. Journalists, students, workers or lecturers who have valid invitations or employment contracts in the U.S. would be exempt from the ban. People who are traveling with a recognized international organization or the U.S. government will also be allowed to travel to the U.S. Visas that have already been approved reportedly will not be revoked. The exemption does not apply to those who seek a relationship with an American business or educational institution purely for the purpose of avoiding the rules, the cable said.? A hotel reservation or car rental contract, even if it was pre-paid, would also not count, it said. Refugees who are in transit through July 6 will be admitted, senior administration officials said Thursday. After that, they will be assessed according to the new guidelines laid out in the executive order. The officials also told reporters that a resettlement agency that provided a formal assurance will not be considered sufficient to prove a bona fide relationship. Consular officers may grant other exemptions to applicants from the six nations if they have ""previously established significant contacts with the United States""; ''significant business or professional obligations"" in the U.S.; if they are an infant, adopted child or in need of urgent medical care; if they are traveling for business with a recognized international organization or the U.S. government or if they are a legal resident of Canada who applies for a visa in Canada, according to the cable. Critics said they are watching closely to see how the guidelines are used. Thousands take part in demonstrations against president's executive order banning all refugees and blocking travelers from seven Muslim-majority ... On Monday, the Supreme Court partially lifted lower court injunctions against Mr. Trump's executive order that had temporarily banned visas for citizens of the six countries. The justices' ruling exempted applicants from the ban if they could prove a ""bona fide relationship"" with a U.S. person or entity, but the court offered only broad guidelines -- suggesting they would include a relative, job offer or invitation to lecture in the U.S. -- as to how that should be defined. Senior officials from the departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security had labored since the decision to clarify the ruling and Wednesday's instructions were the result. The new guidance will remain in place until the Supreme Court issues a final ruling on the matter. Arguments before the justices won't be held until at least October, so the interim rules will remain in place at least until the fall. Shortly after taking office, Mr. Trump ordered the refugee ban and a travel ban affecting the six countries, plus Iraq. He said it was needed to protect the U.S. from terrorists, but opponents said it was unfairly harsh and was intended to meet his campaign promise to keep Muslims out of the United States. After a federal judge struck down the bans, Mr. Trump signed a revised order intended to overcome legal hurdles. That was also struck down by lower courts, but the Supreme Court's action Monday partially reinstated it. The initial travel ban led to chaos at airports around the world, but because the guidelines exempt previously issued visas, similar problems are not expected. After a judge blocked the original ban, Mr. Trump issued a scaled-down order and the court's action Monday further reduced the number of people who would be covered by it. Also, while the initial order took effect immediately, adding to the confusion, this one was delayed 72 hours after the court's ruling. Under the new rules, would-be immigrants from the six countries who won a coveted visa in the government's diversity lottery -- a program that randomly awards 50,000 green cards annually to people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States -- will also have to prove they have a ""bona fide relationship"" with in the U.S. or are eligible for another waiver or face being banned for at least 90 days. That hurdle may be a difficult one for those immigrants to overcome, as many visa lottery winners don't have relatives in the U.S. or jobs in advance of arriving in the country. Generally, winners in the diversity lottery only need prove they were born in an eligible county and have completed high school or have at least two years of work experience in an occupation that requires at least two other years of training or experience.

A Republican source told CBS News that the fundraiser is expected to pull in roughly $10 million dollar for the GOP.

"President Trump called on Congress to pass two bills that will come to a vote tomorrow: one that would cut funding to ""sanctuary cities,"" which provide safe haven to undocumented immigrants who might otherwise face deportation, and another ""Kate's Law,"" which would increase the maximum penalty for criminals who entered the country illegally. ""We're calling on all members of Congress to honor grieving American families by passing these lifesaving measures in the House, in the Senate, and then sending them to my desk for a very rapid signature,"" Mr. Trump said in a White House meeting Wednesday with families of victims of violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. In the meeting, the victims' families shared stories of their lost loved ones. One mother who lost her son fought back tears, saying that if the legislation were ""done earlier, my son would still be here."" Another grieving mother brought the remains of her son with her to the White House and praised the Mr. Trump's decision to run for president. Both bills will receive a vote in the House tomorrow. The Republican-proposed sanctuary cities bill, titled the ""No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,"" would withhold federal funds from cities or states that don't cooperate with federal laws regarding undocumented immigrants. It also states that local law enforcement cannot be precluded from asking immigrants about their legal status. A central promise of President Trump's campaign for the White House was that he'd build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but the Trump admini... The second bill, ""Kate's Law,"" is named after 32-year-old Kate Steinle who was shot and killed in San Francisco by an undocumented immigrant with seven felony convictions who had already been deported five times. If passed, it would impose a mandatory five-year minimum sentence on immigrants who have previously been deported and re-enter the country. According to the White House website, ""the bill is consistent with the Administration's broader efforts to strengthen enforcement of our immigration laws and improve the security of our Nation's borders."" Earlier Wednesday, Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Thomas D. Homan also encouraged the House to vote in favor of the bills, describing them as ""the most significant piece of legislation I've seen that's going to help keep our communities safe and law enforcement officers safe."" ""The America I grew up in, you respected the laws, you revered law enforcement professionals, and I just see in the last several years there's almost this feeling that it's okay to not comply with the law, it's okay to not comply with law enforcement officers,"" Homan said. ""No longer are we going to vilify the men and women of ICE for doing their job, they're American patriots, every one of them,"" he later added. In a White House briefing Wednesday, Homan said that the administration's priority is the removal of criminal aliens, but that anyone in the country illegally is subject to deportation. He also explained that with regard to Kate's Law, the more deportations undocumented immigrants have on their records, the more severe the penalties they could be subject to. ""If we don't have border security, if we don't enforce the laws that's written in the books, you're never going to patrol the border,"" Homan said. ""Why do you think we have 11-12 million people in the country now? Because there has been this notion that if you get by the border, you get in the United States, you have a U.S. citizen kid, no one's looking for you. But those days are over.""?																																																																																																																					"
"President Trump lashed out at the Washington Post in a tweet Wednesday morning calling the paper ""FAKE NEWS!"" and linked it to tech giant Amazon as a ""guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes."" The message comes a day after the Washington Post, owned privately by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos and not Amazon itself, published a story about fake Trump?TIME?covers hung at various Trump properties. ""Tweets speak for themselves,"" Deputy White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in response to queries about the tweet's meaning. But as with many of Mr. Trump's tweets, it's not totally clear what he specifically meant. ? If he was tweeting about sales taxes, Mr. Trump would be incorrect in saying that Amazon isn't paying taxes. Since April, Amazon has been collecting sales tax from states. In the past, Amazon had tried to avoid collecting and remitting sales taxes because it gave the internet retailer a competitive advantage over brick and mortar retailers. CNN retracted and apologized for an online story linking former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci with a Russian bank, and three employees resigned. ... Mr. Trump has called out a number of news organizations, particularly in recent days, for being ""fake."" He and his aides have trained their focus on CNN over a story led to the resignation this week of three employees, and a video released by conservative activist James O'Keefe's group, Project Veritas, that purports to show a CNN producer undermining the network's editorial decisions about the Russia investigation. But this particular tweet puts into the spotlight the complicated relationship the president seems to have with Amazon CEO Bezos, who purchased the Post in 2013. The Amazon-Washington Post link became a target of then-candidate Trump's tirades during the 2016 campaign. Mr. Trump blasted Bezos and claimed the tech CEO wanted political influence that Amazon could benefit from. ""Believe me, if I become president, oh, do they have problems,"" Mr. Trump said at a rally in April, 2016. ""They're going to have such problems."" He also, at the time, accused Bezos of using his ownership of the Washington Post to protect Amazon from taxes. Bezos had suggested Trump's campaign rhetoric was ""eroding our democracy."" Then, at a tech gathering at Trump Tower during the transition in December, Bezos introduced himself as someone who is ""super excited about the possibilities this could be the innovation administration"" and appeared to have a positive outlook after his meeting. In a statement to Business Insider at the time, Bezos said his meeting was ""very productive."" This month, Bezos participated in Mr. Trump's roundtable with the American Technology Council at the White House and applauded the administration's work in technological innovation. He encouraged using commercial technology to save money and develop artificial intelligence to improve government services. A representative from Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about Bezos's reaction to Wednesday's tweet. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment about the nature of Bezos's and Trump's relationship. And it remains unclear what ""problems"" candidate Trump meant Amazon would have during his presidency.

The attraction was last closed in 2009 to add then-President Obama, who has a speaking role. Abraham Lincoln and George Washington also have speeches in the exhibit. Obama recorded his speech for the ""Hall of Presidents"" in the White House.? Disney CEO Bob Iger told reporter's at an attraction opening last month that a script for Mr. Trump was in the works and that Disney Imagineers had began creating his bust shortly after the January inauguration.? Iger had recently left Mr. Trump's business advisory board following the administration's decision to leave the Paris Climate Agreement?

"Randy Bryce, an Army veteran and ironworker, has announced that he will challenge Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, in 2018. Bryce, a Democrat who is active on Twitter under the handle @IronStache, has already run for office twice before, losing state House races in 2012 and 2014. But his first campaign ad quickly went viral, and is already turning heads in what could prove to be a major contest in next year's midterms. Wow〞This ad by union ironworker Randy Bryce, who is challenging Paul Ryan is seriously powerful & moving @IronStache https://t.co/Yso8SxIvm6 President Trump won Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, which Ryan represents, by 10 points last November. And it's unusual, although not unprecedented, for sitting House Speaker's to lose reelection. The last time that happened was 1994, when Speaker Tom Foley, D-Washington, lost his seat in the ""Republican Revolution"" that returned the chamber to GOP control after decades in Democratic hands. In a focus group with Republican strategist and CBS News contributor Frank Luntz, supporters of President Trump said House Speaker Paul Ryan isn'... Ryan has represented the district since 1999, and became Speaker in 2015. Since then, he has always been reelected with more than 50 percent of the vote. In 2016, he won 65 percent of the vote. Bryce, however, insists that Ryan is vulnerable, and is expected to campaign with a message centered on health care. ""It's not the same Paul Ryan that initially ran,"" Bryce told NPR over the weekend. ""He - I mean, even now he'll come across as a nice guy, but it's been over 600 days since the man has had any kind of public listening session in the district."" Bryce supported Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, in last year's contentious Democratic presidential primary. His run could indicate whether Democrats will be successful in adopting a more progressive message, particularly in working class districts that went for Mr. Trump in the last general election. Despite Mr. Trump's success in the district, and though it does tilt Republican, it only narrowly went for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, and was won by Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama in 2008. And given Ryan's role in leading a deeply unpopular Congress, which has struggled to deliver on its legislative goals since Mr. Trump took office, there is perhaps a chance that Bryce could make history by flipping the district. ""I'm running being me,"" Bryce told NPR. ""I'm not trying to be anything. I'm not a politician. I'm a working guy that has - you know, lives in a neighborhood of working people. And it's standing up and it's listening. The big thing right now is working people want to be heard.""?																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Jun 26, 2017 4:57 PM EDT WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court has decided to hear arguments on President Trump's travel ban affecting six countries, mostly Muslim, that are deemed by the federal government to present a higher risk of terrorism to the U.S. The case will be argued in October. The high court also lifted most of the injunction blocking President Trump's travel ban, allowing it to take effect in most instances. Here are a few of the highlights from the Supreme Court's decision to take the case: The opinion was?Per Curiam?-- that is, it was an unsigned decision, and the Supreme Court did not release the breakdown of the justices' votes. But because there were also no dissents on the question of hearing arguments in the travel ban case, it's assumed that that the decision to take it up is likely to have been 9-0, or unanimous. This is was the way that the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions interpreted the opinion. The president said in a statement that he was ""particularly gratified that the Supreme Court's decision was 9-0."" However, there was another part of the decision, regarding the implementation of the travel ban, which had been stayed by two appeals courts. The justices allowed the ban to be blocked, in accordance with the lower court rulings, as it applies to travellers with ""a credible claim"" of a ""bona fide relationship with a person or entity"" in the U.S. On this question, a dissenting opinion was issued, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, and joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. These three think the partial implementation of the ban is not enough, and the ban should have been reinstated in its entirety for the six countries. The country had been waiting for the court to make its decision public about the biggest legal controversy in the first five months of Mr. Trump's presidency. The Supreme Court usually saves its most important decisions for the final day of the term. The issue has been tied up in the courts since his original order in January sparked confusion and widespread protests just days after he took office. The justices met Thursday morning for their last regularly scheduled private conference in June and probably took a vote then about whether to let the Trump administration immediately enforce the ban and hear the administration's appeal of lower court rulings blocking the ban. The court had to decide before late this week, after which the justices will scatter for the summer for speeches, teaching gigs and vacations. It would have taken five votes to reinstate the ban, but it only took four to set the case for argument. Justice Neil Gorsuch, Mr. Trump's nominee who was confirmed in April, is taking part in the highest-profile issue yet in his three months on the court. The case is at the Supreme Court because two federal appellate courts have ruled against the Trump travel policy, which would impose a 90-day pause in travel from citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said the ban was ""rooted in religious animus"" toward Muslims and pointed to Mr. Trump's campaign promise to impose a ban on Muslims entering the country as well as tweets and remarks he has made since becoming president. The ban ""stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation,"" the chief judge of the circuit, Roger L. Gregory wrote. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the travel policy does not comply with federal immigration law, including a prohibition on nationality-based discrimination. That court also put a hold on separate aspects of the policy that would keep all refugees out of the United States for 120 days and cut by more than half, from 110,000 to 50,000, the cap on refugees in the current government spending year that ends Sept. 30. The White House had asked the Supreme Court to allow it to start enforcing this policy and hear arguments about in the fall. The administration believes the Supreme Court is its best hope of having this policy upheld after the two appeals courts blocked it. President Trump's first executive order on travel applied to travelers from the six countries as well as Iraq, and took effect immediately, causing chaos and panic at airports over the last weekend in January as the Homeland Security Department scrambled to figure out who the order covered and how it was to be implemented. A federal judge blocked it eight days later, an order that was upheld by a 9th circuit panel. Rather than pursue an appeal, the administration said it would revise the policy. In March, the president issued a narrower order, but it, too, had been blocked. The government has argued that the ban was needed to allow for an internal review of the screening procedures for visa applicants from the six countries.

"House Majority Whip Steve Scalise has been upgraded to ""fair condition,"" MedStar Washington Hospital Center said Wednesday, a week after the shooting at the congressional baseball practice that left him wounded. ""Congressman Steve Scalise continues to make good progress. He is now listed in fair condition and is beginning an extended period of healing and rehabilitation,"" the hospital said in a statement Wednesday. Scalise had been upgraded to serious condition last Saturday, four days after he was shot in the hip by a gunman in Alexandria, Virginia. He had been in critical condition for several days. On Friday, Dr. Jack Sava, director of trauma at the medical center, said that Scalise was at ""imminent risk of death"" when he arrived last Wednesday. ""When he arrived, he was in critical condition with an imminent risk of death,"" Sava said at a briefing on the congressman's condition. ""He will certainly be in the hospital for a considerable period of time, presumably weeks."" Sava, however, added that ""an excellent recovery is a good possibility."" Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, is holding a blood drive for Scalise at the Capitol. Law enforcement officials shared their findings Wednesday from their investigation into the shooting. They revealed that they found a note on the gunman, James Hodgkinson with members of Congress's names on it. ""Items found on Hodgkinson included a piece of paper that contained the names of six Members of Congress. No context was included on this paper, however, a review of Hodgkinson's web searches in the months prior to the shooting revealed only a cursory search of two of those Members of Congress,"" they said. ""A second document with a rough sketch of several streets in Washington, D.C. was found on Hodgkinson, however, it was not deemed to be of investigative significance.""?

"MOSCOW -- Russia's defense minister said Wednesday that the security situation near the nation's western borders had worsened because of NATO's activities, and that Russia would be adjusting its defense posture in response. Sergei Shoigu, speaking Wednesday on a trip to Russia's westernmost Kaliningrad region, pointed at the alliance's exercise in the Baltics as an example of NATO's growing presence in the area. Since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. has been drawing down its military presence in Europe. But at the main docks in Bremerhaven in northern G... Shoigu added that large-scale drills in Eastern Europe reflect NATO's ""anti-Russian course."" He said the military would form 20 new units along its western frontiers by the year's end. Later this year, Russia and Belarus will hold the West-2017 war games -- exercises that U.S. officials have said could be made a much larger show of force by Moscow than in recent years. Also on Thursday, Russia's deputy foreign minister said he had cancelled upcoming talks with the U.S. undersecretary of state over a new round of U.S. sanctions against Russia. The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it had imposed sanctions on 38 Russian individuals and firms over Russia's activities in Ukraine. Tensions between the U.S. and Russia are rising after the U.S. downed a Syrian jet Sunday. Washington and Moscow are backing different sides in S... The Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday quoted Deputy Minister Sergey Ryabkov as saying that ""the situation is not conducive to holding a round of this dialogue"" that was scheduled for Friday and criticized the U.S. for ""not having offered and not offering anything specific"" to discuss. Russia-U.S. relations have remained tense even as the White House considers scheduling President Donald Trump's meeting with Putin on the sidelines of next month's Group of 20 meeting. Russian state TV showed video (see below), meanwhile, of a NATO F-16 fighter jet shadowing Shoigu's plane as it approached Kaliningrad. A Russian Su-27 fighter is then seen edging in between the minister's plane and NATO's jet to ward it off. Asked about the encounter, a spokesman for the military alliance told CBS News that it was ""standard practice whenever unknown aircraft approach NATO airspace, NATO and national air forces took to the sky to monitor these flights."" ? ""Our actions were routine,"" the NATO spokesman said. ""Generally, when NATO aircraft intercept a plane they identify it visually, maintaining a safe distance at all times. Once complete, NATO jets break away. This is standard procedure. All our pilots behave in a safe and responsible way.""? The statement from NATO added that, regarding who might have been on board any particular flight intercepted, ""we refer to the Russian authorities.""

"Just before a Capitol Hill meeting on Tuesday on tax reform aimed at helping families, attended by President Trump's daughter and top White House adviser Ivanka Trump, a hug between the eldest Trump daughter and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, left some on social media wondering if the brief encounter was more of a snub. The awkward embrace was captured by photographers, showing Trump appearing to be standing still, clutching her handbag, as Rubio went in for a warmer greeting. Ivanka Trump, daughter of President Donald Trump, is greeted by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as she arrives at the Capitol to meet with lawmakers about parental leave, in Washington, on Tue., June 20, 2017. According to a statement released by Rubio's office, Trump joined Republican lawmakers to discuss tax reform focused on families, in particular, the child tax credit. While Rubio said he was ""glad to see strong support for pro-family policies,"" it was the hug left the greatest impression, sparking running commentary from the two involved. Rubio, seeming to poke fun at the various ongoing Congressional investigations, launched into his own Twitter sleuth mode, after he was informed of the perception of an ""alleged fail hug"" with Trump. Just left Intel comm & informed meeting 2day with @IvankaTrump blowing up twitter over alleged failed hug! Investigating. Will respond soon ""We are also attempting to acquire multi-angle video which we believe will provide greater insight into this important matter,"" Rubio quipped.

(Faces blurred for security purposes) pic.twitter.com/GzSLe3JD3I ""Based on review of evidence and my own recollection, have concluded no hug was even attempted and press covfefe of alleged failed hug is false,"" the Republican senator reported, alluding to President Trump's famous Twitter gaffe that evolved into it's own debate over the meaning of ""covfefe.""

Anonymous sources say @marcorubio planned the alleged failed hug. I have no comment (but I would have hugged him anyway! ?) https://t.co/TChrqWsL4D Ivanka Trump later claimed Rubio's reporting was ""fake news"" and that he is an ""excellent hugger.""

"JERUSALEM -- President Trump's son-in-law and chief Middle East adviser, Jared Kushner, arrived in the region on Wednesday for a daylong visit aimed at restarting long-dormant Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Mr. Trump has tasked Kushner with the ambitious goal of laying the groundwork for what he calls the ""ultimate deal"" - but deep divisions remain, clouding chances of a significant breakthrough in one of the longest Mideast crises. The president has made it clear that working towards achieving a lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians is a top priority for him.? He strongly believes that peace is possible, a White House official said Tuesday. Dan Senor, co-founder of the Foreign Policy Initiative and co-author of ""Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle,"" joins ""CBS Thi... Kushner first met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, along with U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, Israeli envoy in Washington Ron Dermer and American Mideast envoy Jason Greenblatt, at Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem. A video released by Netanyahu's office shows him embracing Kushner and saying: ""This is an opportunity to pursue our common goals of security, prosperity and peace."" Later, Kushner will meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank city of Ramallah. This month marked the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Mideast war - a seminal event in which Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians claim these territories for their future independent state. After two decades of failed U.S.-led peace efforts, Palestinian statehood seems distant. Envoy Jason Greenblatt has already made several visits. ?Kushner and Greenblatt both accompanied the president on his May 22-23 visit to Jerusalem and Bethlehem, discussing a peace agreement's potential far-reaching impact in the region, the White House official said. Kushner and Greenblatt during the trip reaffirmed the two sides' commitment to work towards peace, and they've continued to have conversations with both parties since then. Even before his meetings, Kushner faced a new crisis. On the eve of his arrival, Israel broke ground on a new West Bank settlement for residents of an illegally built outpost that was dismantled in February under orders from the Supreme Court. Netanyahu had vowed to compensate the residents of Amona with a new settlement, built on a nearby site in the northern West Bank. ""The people of Amona really appreciate his efforts and the efforts from his office in fulfilling this commitment that started to come alive to create this new community,"" said Avichai Boaron, a spokesman for the settlers. The move has infuriated the Palestinians, who say all settlements are illegal obstacles to peace. Trump has asked Israel to show ""restraint"" in its settlement construction. ""This is the way Netanyahu is meeting Trump's envoys,"" said Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian official. ""The real question here is will the administration of Trump tell Israel that it is enough and they have to stop immediately all settlement activities, or they will accept this Israeli provocation?"" Kushner did not speak to reporters ahead of his talks Wednesday, and Israeli security agents blocked AP cameramen from filming the arrival of his convoy. In one case, a cameraman was ordered to leave a sidewalk outside the government compound that houses Netanyahu's office, and in other case, a cameraman was ordered to delete his memory card of all images of the prime minister's office. Once on the ground, Kushner, accompanied by Friedman, immediately paid a condolence visit to the family of a young female Israeli police officer who was killed by Palestinian attackers over the weekend near Jerusalem's Old City. Kushner said Trump asked him to personally convey the condolences of the American people. Three Palestinian attackers armed with an automatic weapon and knives assaulted officers on duty near the Old City in two locations on Friday evening. Police said Staff Sgt. Maj. Hadas Malka, 23, was rushing to respond to the initial attack nearby when a Palestinian assaulted her with a knife. Malka wrestled with the man for several seconds as he stabbed her multiple times before other officers saw what was happening and opened fire, killing him, police said. She later died of her wounds in hospital. Thousands attended her funeral Saturday night. Netanyahu visited her grieving family on Sunday and called Malka ""everybody's daughter and everybody's hero."" He also criticized Abbas for not condemning the attack. It was the latest incident in a wave of Palestinian attacks that began in September 2015. Since then, Palestinian assailants have killed 43 Israelis, two visiting Americans and a British student, mainly in stabbing attacks. Some 250 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire during the same period, most of them identified as attackers by Israel.

"Last Updated Jun 21, 2017 12:47 PM EDT A Homeland Security (DHS) official told a Senate panel that election systems in 21 states were targeted in Russian cyber attacks in the 2016 presidential election. Dr. Sam Liles, acting director of the Cyber Division of DHS, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that prior to the election, DHS had no indication that any adversaries, including the Russian government, were planning activities that would change the outcome of the election. However, DHS did detect activities throughout the spring and summer 2016 and later received reports of cyber probing of election infrastructures. Liles said that it is important to note ""None of these systems were involved in vote tallying."" He also told lawmakers that the activity by Russian hackers exploiting known vulnerabilities was indicative of ""simple scanning,"" an act he compared to someone ""walking down the street to see if you are home."" ""A small number of networks were exploited -- they made it through the door,"" said Liles. Wednesday's testimony by members of DHS and the FBI was the sixth open hearing on Russian influence on the 2016 election. In opening remarks, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner of Virginia called it a watershed moment in political history. ""This was one of the most significant events any of us on this dais will be asked to address in our careers, and only with a robust and comprehensive response will we be able to protect our democratic process from even more drastic intrusions in the future."" He added, ""At a minimal cost, Russia sowed chaos in our political system and undermined faith in our democratic process."" Warner said DHS had confirmed only two intrusions into the voter registration databases, in Arizona and Illinois. In light of the cyber attacks, Jeanette Manfra, Acting Director of the Undersecretary at DHS, said the agency still has confidence in voting processes because they are ""fundamentally resilient."" But DHS would not provide the exact states that were targeted because it is ""important to protect the confidentiality we have and the trust we have with that community,"" Manfra said. Warner argued that the country is ""not any safer"" not knowing the exact states that were impacted by the hack.? Sen. Marco Rubio echoed Warner's concerns, saying as the investigation moves forward, ""it is important Americans understand how our voting systems work and communicate that in real time."" He suggested if additional reports on compromised systems occurs in the 2018 election ""we can put out information in September so there aren't any doubts."" Manfra reassured Senators the agency will continue to investigate the cyber attack, saying ""this is one of our highest priorities."" She added, ""we aren't looking toward just 2018"" noting the importance of state and local elections throughout the calendar year. ? However, Connie Lawson, President-Elect of the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), expressed to lawmakers that state's are increasingly concerned DHS is not communicating enough about potential cyber attacks or threats, saying officials only recently learned about a threat in a leaked NSA report. This was after DHS had repeatedly told state election officials that no credible threats existed in the Fall of 2016.? ""It remains unclear why our intelligence agencies would withhold timely and specific threat information from chief state election officials, who can use it to better defend their systems and neutralize specific threats,"" said Lawson.? Steve Sandovoss, Executive of Illinois' State Board of Elections said that FBI officials never even informed them that it was the Russians who were behind the attacks on voting systems, a move Warner called ""stunning."" When asked if there were any remaining states that were not aware if they were attacked, Lawson said her home state of Indiana was never notified of such an intrusion, and assumed many others were not as well.? Warner said it was ""totally unacceptable"" local election officials don't even know if their state was part of the 21 targeted, saying there are many who claim Russia was not behind the attack, making the issue of notifying election officials even more vital. ? ""There are some still in the political process that believe this whole Russian incursion is a witch hunt into fake news, I can see some local official saying this is not a problem, this is not a bother."" Committee Chairman Richard Burr also asked whether the DNC hack was intended to launch the election year intrusion by the Russians, or whether it was one of multiple phishing expeditions by Russian actors. Priestap replied that it was ""one of many efforts."" ""You can call it a phishing expedition,"" he said, ""but they don't go after one place, they go after lots of places"" -- ""at least hundreds,"" he added. ?

"The Justice Department confirmed to CBS News that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has retained Charles J. Cooper as his personal attorney. Cooper is a founding member and chairman of Cooper & Kirk, PLLC and was named by the National Law Journal as one of the best civil litigators in Washington. He joined DOJ's Civil Rights Division in 1981 and was later appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the position of assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel. ? In a statement to CBS News, Cooper said ""I can confirm that I represent the Attorney General, but, as with all clients, cannot otherwise comment on confidential client matters."" The retainer does not pose as a significant development in the ongoing Russia investigation, since Mr. Cooper worked with Sessions throughout the confirmation process and during subsequent hearings. Sessions most recently testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he defended himself amid allegations that he had a third undisclosed meeting with a Russian official during the 2016 campaign and fielded questions about his role in the?firing of James Comey as FBI director?and the reason for his?recusal from the Russian investigation. He said that when the reporter asked him about any meetings with Russians in March, he said he ""immediately recalled"" an encounter at the Republican National Convention and a meeting in his Senate office with Kislyak. He said he ""never intended"" not to disclose those meetings publicly. He said he gladly would have disclosed a third reported meeting, had he remembered it. ? Sessions told lawmakers, ""I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, and the suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie.""?

"Last Updated Jun 21, 2017 12:35 PM EDT Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified before the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday that to his knowledge, Russia did not alter vote tallies or ballots in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Johnson did admit that there was a delay between the time it took for the FBI to learn about the cyberattack at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the time it took for him to learn about the discovery as DHS secretary. He led DHS amid Russian cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta, as well as?attacks against state election databases?last year. He advised states on how to protect themselves ahead of the election on Nov. 8. During the last open hearing held by the House Intelligence panel,?former CIA Director John Brennan told lawmakers that Russia may have successfully tried to recruit U.S. persons to influence the election. Brennan also said he was aware of intelligence and information that revealed contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign. He couldn't say, however, whether or not the activities amounted to collusion. The former DHS secretary said you'd have to ask the president, but added that he's seen various statements from him on that topic. Asked if that concerns him, Johnson said that a president and Cabinet members ""depends on the intelligence community"" and ""otherwise, if you don't, you can't effectively do your job."" ""You're flying blind,"" he said. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, asked the question and also asked how the government can ensure Russia won't attempt to alter votes in subsequent elections. Johnson said he made the claim about votes not being altered based upon what he knows, but made clear he has not had access to classified information in five months. Johnson said that he's ""not sure"" he had authority at DHS to investigate whether votes were altered. He said DHS does not engage in vote recounts and there are others who have that responsibility. Johnson reiterated that he and Clapper did make a statement and adds, ""We were very concerned that we not be perceived as taking sides in the election, injecting ourself into a very heated campaign or taking steps to themselves delegitimize the election process."" CBS News' Emily Tillett reports that Dr. Sam Liles, acting director of the Cyber Division of DHS, told the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday that prior to the election, DHS had no indication that any adversaries, including the Russian government, were planning activities that would change the outcome of the election. However, DHS did detect activities throughout the spring and summer 2016 and later received reports of cyber probing of election infrastructures. He said?election systems in 21 states were targeted in Russian cyber attacks in the 2016 presidential election. Johnson was asked what more the government should do in the future and he said to raise awareness about the ""evils and hazards of spear-phishing."" He said at the national level, someone should take the mantle of cybersecurity on ""full time"" to highlight the cyber issue. He said he would prefer that that person be from DHS. ""We really need a national leader to take charge of this issue,"" Johnson said. The former DHS secretary was asked by Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, what more the administration could have done before the election. Johnson said ""hindsight is brilliant"" and he said, ""I think it was unprecedented the scale and scope of what we saw them doing."" Johnson explained that one of the candidates, President Trump, was claiming that the election would be ""rigged"" and that by accusing Russia of being responsible for the cyber intrusions would undermine the integrity of the process. That comment, therefore, prevented the administration from going public about Russia sooner, he suggested. Johnson released a joint statement with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Oct. 7 accusing Russia of being behind the attacks. Johnson says that in his view, designating the election systems as critical infrastructure was a ""no-brainer"" and ""should have been done years before."" He said that it's only confined to the election infrastructure and not the politicians and not and political parties. Johnson noted that 16 sectors were already considered critical infrastructure. He said his recollection is that the FBI first discovered the intrusion into the DNC and he said ""I recall very clearly that there was a delay between that initial contact"" with the DNC and when the report got to him as DHS secretary. When it came to the initial scanning and probing of voter registration systems, it was discovered in late August, he said, and once it was found, he said that information came to him and other senior people at DHS ""pretty quickly."" The former DHS secretary says the key question for the president and Congress is what will be done to protect the U.S. democracy from the threat of cyberattacks in the future. Johnson said that last year's ""very troubling experience"" highlights ""cyber vulnerabilities in our political process and our election infrastructure."" The top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, said he'd like to hear from Johnson how the U.S. government responded to the Russian cyberattacks last year, the threat Russia posed and what steps the Obama administration took to protect election institutions. He released a 6-page prepared statement?on the eve of the hearing that praises the Committee's investigation and calls out Russian President Vladimir Putin for orchestrating cyberattacks with the direct purpose of influencing the 2016 election. ?

"China has invited President Trump's daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump along with her husband and White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner to visit Beijing later this year, according to a White House official. It's not clear whether the two would accept the invitation. The trip would be in the fall. The official commented Tuesday on condition of anonymity because nothing has been formally announced. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman says he noted reports of the invitation but was unaware of the specifics. Ivanka Trump, daughter and adviser to President Trump, and her husband Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, step off Air Force One upon arrival at Rome's Fiumicino Airport on May 23, 2017. The invitation from China underscores the influential roles that Kushner and Ivanka Trump hold in Mr. Trump's administration, including in matters of foreign policy. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump offered thanks to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Twitter for the government's efforts in establishing dialogue with the North Koreans in the wake of the death of U.S. student Otto Warmbier, who was released from North Korea last week. While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried! CBS News' Margaret Brennan reported Tuesday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis are meeting on Wednesday in Washington with two of China's top officials - the state councilor and the chief of the People's Liberation Army's joint staff department. Ramping up pressure on North Korea is going to be a major focus during the discussions as are other flashpoints, Brennan reports. The Trump administration has not been satisfied with the pressure applied by China on the North and believes more is possible. White House press secretary Sean Spicer addressed the concerns at Tuesday's briefing, saying, ""We have been very forceful in our political and economic pressure that has been applied in North Korea. I think we will continue to apply that, and obviously China can play and can continue to play a greater role in helping to resolve this situation. And we will continue to hopefully build on the relationship and the dialogue that we have with China.""

White House officials have confirmed that Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will join Trump on a tour of the college's agriculture program earlier in the day. Perdue has been outspoken about the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement to the agricultural sector and helped to persuade Mr. Trump not to withdraw from the agreement in April after he threatened to do so. Ross, who is leading talks to renegotiate NAFTA, said on Monday that efforts to renegotiate may spill into 2018. Starling stressed that renegotiating the deal is still a priority for the administration.? The president originally was slated to be in Iowa June 1, but that trip was postponed because of a change in his schedule. Wednesday's visit is his first to the state since he took office. Starling told reporters that there will be a ""monetary investment"" in the push to expand broadband access to farms in rural areas. However, the administration is still assessing the level of investment on top of leveraging private dollars so as not to ""supplant what states are already doing.""? Innovative farming tools depend on access to the web, which has lagged in rural areas because ""the private sector hasn't found an economic way into some parts of the country,"" Starling said on a conference call.? Kirkwood Community College was the first school in the country to develop a curriculum focused on geospatial technology and precision farming, which Starling says will be especially helpful to farmers this year in one of the ""toughest farm economies we've had in recent history.""? ""We are literally looking at half the net farming income in 2017 that we have seen in 2013,"" Starling said, based off of projections from the USDA.? ""I think we are still at a preliminary stage at this point but things are falling into place to get serious about doing work,"" Starling added. ""We want to move forward quickly.""? When asked about plans to make farming technology more affordable for farmers to access, Starling said bringing expensive, high tech tools to the market in an economical way is something that will be a part of Farm Bill reauthorization discussions. Mr. Trump's 2018 budget proposes to slash spending on farm bill programs by $228 billion over the next 10 years.? ""This technology is expensive and we have to be useful in terms of developing it and making sure we don't get in the way of it,"" Starling told reporters.? Starling said several members of Iowa's agricultural community will be in the crowd, including former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad who was recently confirmed as ambassador to China. ?The rally will also be a send off of sorts as Branstad readies to depart for China, Starling said.?

"Last Updated Jun 16, 2017 4:48 PM EDT Members of President Trump's transition team have received a memo directing them to preserve any records related to several federal investigations into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election, CBS News confirms. Politico first reported the memo. A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle ""In order to assist these investigations, the Presidential Transition Team and its current and former personnel have a responsibility to ensure that, to the extent potentially relevant documents exist, they are properly preserved,"" said a memo from a transition lawyer, obtained by Politico. The memo instructed aides and volunteers Thursday to save the documents related to Russia, Ukraine and several campaign advisers: Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone, Rick Gates and Michael Flynn, according to the report. The memo also warned, Politico said, that ""failure to follow these protocols could result in criminal or civil penalties, and could form the basis of legal claims, legal presumptions, or jury instructions relating to spoliation of evidence."" This comes as the federal investigation and congressional inquiries into Russian interference in the election moves along. On Thursday, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats met with lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee behind closed doors to ""to clear up a number of questions that remained from his appearance in open session last Wednesday""at a hearing that touched on Russia.

"SALEM, Ore.?-- In a move hailed by LGBT rights groups, Oregon became the first state in the U.S. on Thursday to allow residents to mark their gender as ""not specified"" on applications for driver's licenses, learner's permits and identity cards. Under the new rule approved by the Oregon Transportation Commission, Oregonians who select the new option will have an X appear instead of M or F on those cards. The rule, which takes effect on July 3, is a first for the U.S., David House, spokesman for Oregon's Driver and Motor Vehicles Division, or DMV, told The Associated Press. ""It's fitting that this is before us during Pride Week in Oregon and Pride Month around the country,"" said Commissioner Sean O'Hollaren. ""It's something that we should do because it's the right thing to do."" The DMV said the new rule, which the commission passed unanimously, came about after a Multnomah County judge in June 2016 allowed Jamie Shupe, a Portland resident, to legally change to ""non-binary"" gender. ""There's a little more truth and justice in the world today,"" said Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of Lambda Legal, the oldest and largest national legal organization that advocates for the civil rights of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people. Gorenberg said in a statement that when appearances don't appear to match gender markers on ID cards, people ""endure insults and psychological trauma that could largely be averted if they had an option to use a gender marker that does not contradict who they are."" CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman discusses the issues at stake as the Trump administration shifts policy on LGBT rights. Lambda Legal said that nationally, people have been harassed and even assaulted after presenting IDs to police, hospital workers, employers, airport staff, bank tellers and others that don't match their gender identity or expression. DMV Administrator Tom McClellan choked up as he read letters of support to the commission, including from someone who encountered an embarrassing situation while going through a body scanner at an airport, and the security officer didn't know whether to push the blue button for a male passenger or a pink one for a female one. House said Oregon is the first state or jurisdiction in the U.S. to create this option, but is not the first on the continent, and that the Canadian province of Ontario implemented the X option earlier this year. Caitlyn Jenner may be the world's most public transgender star, but she's not alone... ""It's exciting to see Oregon's Department of Motor Vehicles adopt this change. We know gender is a spectrum and some people don't identify as male or female,"" said Nancy Haque, co-executive director of Basic Rights Oregon, the state's largest nonprofit LGBTQ advocacy group. The group said other cultures and other countries that recognize non-binary genders include India, Bangladesh, Australia, New Zealand and Nepal. In California, the state Senate by a 26-12 vote passed a bill on May 31 to add a third gender option on state IDs, sending it to the state Assembly. The California Family Council, a conservative Christian group, opposes it, arguing that ""government documents need to reflect biological facts for identification."" The DMV said it studied state laws, updated computer systems, worked with law enforcement and courts and changed administrative rules to implement the change and comply with the Multnomah Court's order. Judge Amy Holmes Hen ruled that ""The sex of Jamie Shupe is hereby changed from female to non-binary."" Shupe was quoted last year by The Oregonian/OregonLive as saying: ""I was assigned male at birth due to biology ... My gender identity is definitely feminine. My gender identity has never been male, but I feel like I have to own up to my male biology. Being non-binary allows me to do that. I'm a mixture of both. I consider myself as a third sex.""																																																																																																																					"

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell postponed a vote on the Republican health care bill this week because he lacked the votes. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is calling on Trump to meet with Republicans and Democrats on the Senate bill. Asked about the request, Trump said Wednesday that Schumer ""hasn't been serious."" He added, ""Obamacare is such a disaster, such a wreck. And he wants to try and save something that's really hurting a lot of people."" The Senate delayed its vote on a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act after it failed to attract enough votes for passage. Earlier Wednesday, the president complained over Twitter about a New York Times story that portrays him as less engaged in the discussions over the Senate Republican health care bill than he was in the House bill.

Cornyn, however, cautioned that the issues at play are ""all up in the air until we can find a way to build consensus to 50 votes."" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who's opposed to the current version, said it's ""going to be very difficult"" to reach a health care deal in the next two days.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who was among the first to oppose the bill last week, said he hopes the Senate can produce a new bill by Friday and that he hopes it involves reducing premiums to a greater extent. Cruz said he believes the 52 Republicans in the Senate can come together to find the 50 votes needed for the bill, ""but it's going to take everyone being willing to give and come together behind shared principles.""

"Last Updated Jun 26, 2017 10:03 AM EDT The Supreme Court is taking on a new clash between gay rights and religion in a case about a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in Colorado. The justices said Monday they will consider whether a baker who objects to same-sex marriage on religious grounds can refuse to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. The case asks the high court to balance the religious rights of the baker against the couple's right to equal treatment under the law. Similar disputes have popped up across the United States. The decision to take on the case reflects renewed energy among the court's conservative justices, whose ranks have recently been bolstered by the addition of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the high court. The court will review a Colorado court decision that found baker Jack Phillips and his Masterpiece Cakeshop discriminated against the gay couple under Colorado law. Phillips told the Supreme Court he has free speech and religious rights under the First Amendment that should protect him. He said he should not be compelled to bake a cake specifically to honor a same-sex marriage. Colorado's anti-discrimination law protects people on the basis of their sexual orientation. Charlie Craig and David Mullins filed a complaint against Phillips and his suburban Denver shop after Phillips said he would not create and decorate a cake in honor of their marriage. Colorado did not permit same-sex couples to marry until 2014. Two years earlier, Craig and Mullin were planning to fly to Massachusetts, where same-sex marriage was legal, and host a reception in Denver upon their return to Colorado. They wanted a cake for the occasion. CBS News' Paula Reid reports that the court's decision to hear the appeal comes as a ?sign that conservative justices have a renewed energy to examine the issues of religious rights and gay marriage and potentially push back on the earlier decision.? This is a developing story and will be updated.																																																																																																																					"
"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi warned Monday that the Senate GOP health care bill that could be voted on later this week would be extremely harmful to Americans who rely on their health insurance. In an interview on ""CBS This Morning,"" the California Democrat said while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not yet released its cost estimate of the measure, she can already predict one major effect. ""We do know that many more people, hundreds of thousands of people, will die if this bill passes,"" Pelosi said.

"Nearly two-thirds of Americans say they support same-sex marriage, according to a Pew Research Center survey released Monday. The poll, which comes two years after the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, found that 62 percent support it now and 32 percent oppose it. Views on the issue have significantly changed over the last decade. In 2007, 54 percent of the public opposed it and 37 percent supported it, Pew said. Even last March, 55 percent said they support it while 37 percent opposed it. Majorities of both Baby Boomers and black people now support same-sex marriage, the poll found. The level of support among both demographics has risen by at least 10 percentage points over the last year. Meanwhile, Republicans remain divided with 48 percent of them and those who lean that way opposing same-sex marriage and 47 percent supporting it. Sixty-three percent of moderate and liberal Republicans said they favor it while 39 percent of conservative Republicans said they are against it. In 2013, 61 percent of Republicans opposed it compared to a third who backed it. The survey polled 2,504 adults between June 8 and 18 with a 2.3 percentage point margin of error.?

"The Republican drive to roll back Barack Obama's health care law is on a collision course with a national opioid epidemic that's not letting up. Medicaid cuts resulting from the GOP legislation would hit hard in states deeply affected by the addiction crisis and struggling to turn the corner, according to state data and concerned lawmakers in both parties. The House health care bill would phase out expanded Medicaid, which allows states to provide federally backed insurance to low-income adults previously not eligible. Many people in that demographic are in their 20s and 30s and dealing with opioid addiction. Dollars from Washington have allowed states to boost their response to the crisis, paying for medication, counseling, therapy and other services. According to data compiled by The Associated Press, Medicaid expansion accounted for 61 percent of total Medicaid spending on substance abuse treatment in Kentucky, 47 percent in West Virginia, 56 percent in Michigan, 59 percent in Maryland, and 31 percent in Rhode Island. In Ohio, the expansion accounted for 43 percent of Medicaid spending in 2016 on behavioral health, a category that includes mental health and substance abuse. Those states accepted the Medicaid expansion and represent a cross-section of places hardest hit by the overdose epidemic, which claimed more than 52,000 lives nationwide in 2015. Of the deaths, more than 6 in 10 were due to opioids, from prescription pain relievers like oxycodone to street drugs like heroin and an elephant tranquilizer. Tracy Plouck, Ohio's director of mental health and addiction services, said Medicaid expansion dollars from Washington have allowed her state to redirect its own resources to priorities like providing recovery housing after detox. Reversing that would have real consequences for people who are trying to straighten their lives out. ""If you go back into an environment where people are using, that sets you up with a risk that's nearly insurmountable,"" Plouck said. In Youngstown, Ohio, factory mechanic Paul Wright credits sustained help from Medicaid with his survival after he nearly died from a heroin overdose. Wright said he had started using as a teenager and has been drug-free now for 18 months. Before Medicaid expanded, his father's health insurance would pay for detox, but not for long-term treatment. Wright would relapse. With Medicaid, he's been able to get follow-up. ""It's truly sad, but I've been to many funerals since I've been clean,"" said Wright, who's in his mid-20s. ""I just think Medicaid 〞 honestly 〞 it saves people."" And he's able to work. The House GOP bill would end the extra funding states get through expanded Medicaid in 2020, and place a limit on overall federal spending for the program in the future. People already covered like Wright would be grandfathered in as long as they continue to meet eligibility requirements. But that's no comfort to Carolyn Givens, who runs the Neil Kennedy Recovery Center, where Wright gets help. ""If somebody could say to me, 'Carolyn, the crisis is going to be over next week,' I'd feel OK 〞 but I got 40 people on a waiting list,"" Givens said. Medicaid cuts have become a major sticking point in the Senate for the GOP's American Health Care Act. Republican leaders can only afford to lose two votes, and several GOP senators from hard-hit states have been critical. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. said Tuesday that senators are considering extending the phase-out by three years, to 2023. At a recent budget hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price defended the Trump administration and raised questions about how much difference Medicaid actually makes. The HHS budget for the opioid crisis is more than three times greater than two years ago, $811 million versus $245 million, Price said. That reflects increases approved by Congress beyond what Medicaid spends. Questioned by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., about the consequences of reducing Medicaid's commitment, Price responded that more government spending is not the answer. ""Let me respectfully suggest ... that the programs that are out there by and large are not working,"" Price said. ""We are losing more Americans today than we did last year ... clearly we're moving in the wrong direction."" Price suggested that states would be more effective with the greater flexibility promised by the GOP plan for Medicaid. Said Leahy: ""As a child I believed in the tooth fairy, but I'm a little bit older now."" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said it's too early to expect a turnaround in the epidemic. ""The resources are just getting to the communities,"" she said. In New Hampshire, ""we're just beginning to see the benefits of having the expansion of Medicaid to provide treatment for people,"" Shaheen added. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., wasn't convinced either. ""I'm having trouble, as many of us are, reconciling your stated goal (about the opioid crisis) being one of your top three priorities with these dramatic cuts, "" she said to Price during the hearing. Cutting financing for the Medicaid expansion ""would create an unsustainable financial obligation"" for West Virginia, said Allison Adler, a spokeswoman for the state's health department. Back in Youngstown, recovering addict Niki Campana says ""it's like the apocalypse around here."" Campana is helping other women with drug problems. ""I work with a lot of girls that struggle,"" she said at the Kennedy treatment center. ""We can get them on Medicaid in a day and get them in treatment. For that not to be able to happen, that would be horrible.""																																																																																																																					"

A working group consisting of 13 Republican men -- and no women -- has been negotiating the legislation's parameters behind closed doors, leaving many of their own GOP colleagues in the dark. Senate Democrats spent Monday night highlighting the secretive process by delivering floor speeches late into the night and requesting hearings so that the bill could be hashed out before the public. Senate Republicans are pushing for a health care vote next week, and Democrats are trying to push back. Politco health care reporter Jennifer Hab... Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, lambasted Republicans for their hypocrisy, given that Democrats were accused in 2009 of writing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare, in private. ""Now that the shoe's on the other foot and Republicans are in charge, all those concerns and criticisms have disappeared. No committee process, no hearings, nothing, quite the opposite of what they called four or five years ago. What gall!"" Schumer exclaimed on the Senate floor. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, tweeted in January 2010, ""The people have a right to know what is happening behind closed doors with secret HC negotiations."" Some Republicans not involved in the current negotiations are expressing frustration with the tight-knit process. ""I think we should have debated it in open, in committee hearings, have both sides bring in witnesses,"" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky. ""I don't think the parties are any different. I would give criticism, equally, to the parties, but what I would say is if you're doing it on one side only, what you're setting yourself up for is for failure."" If the Senate bill contains ""greater subsidies than Obamacare,"" Paul warned it's going to be hard for conservatives to support the measure. ""One of the key things I'll be looking for when it comes out, when I get a copy, is are there more subsidies in our bill than Obamacare? That, to me, really is a nonstarter,"" he said. Even one of the working group's members, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said he hasn't seen text. ""It has become increasingly apparent over the past few days that even though we thought we were going to be in charge of writing this bill within this working group, it's not being written by us,"" he said in a video post on Facebook. ""It's apparently being written by a small handful of staffers for members of the Republican leadership in the Senate. So if you're frustrated by the lack of transparency in this process, I share your frustration wholeheartedly."" Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, admitted Tuesday that ""this is one of the most significant votes that will be cast"" but stressed that Republicans need to sell it to the American people in order to be successful.? ""Whatever our plan is, those who are for that plan need to be able to explain to the American people why it is a good thing,"" he said. ""You can't just put a plan out there, cast a vote and be done."" While Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, appeared critical of the process not taking place in an open setting, he said Republicans have had ""ample opportunities"" to weigh in during meetings that have taken place twice a week. Without knowing the language, he said it's ""impossible"" to predict whether leadership can secure at least 50 votes in favor of the bill.? President Trump, for his part, may not be fully on board. In a meeting with tech leaders Tuesday, he said that the Senate health care bill ""needs more heart."" This comes after he called the House version ""mean""?last week, despite the event he hosted at the White House Rose Garden celebrating its passage. Nearly three-quarters of Americans said Senate Republicans should discuss their health care plans publicly, according to a CBS News poll released Tuesday. A quarter of the public, by contrast, said it should be developed in private. It also found 57 percent said Obamacare needs some changes, 28 percent said it should be repealed entirely and 12 percent said it should be kept in place. Republicans are relying on the budget reconciliation process to get the bill passed in the Senate, which only requires a simple majority -- 51 votes -- instead of a supermajority. They may still have to rely on Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote. The Senate currently has 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That means if all Democrats vote against the bill, only three no votes from Republicans can torpedo it. McConnell faces competing interests in his conference that are extremely difficult to reconcile. While hardliners push for a measure that would gut the Medicaid expansion, moderates want to preserve it, or at least see the expansion phased out more slowly. Either faction could kill the bill. Democrats took to the Senate floor Monday night to call out Republicans for crafting their health care bill behind closed doors. A CBS News poll ... Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, was among two Senate Republicans in December 2015 who voted with Democrats, against a bill to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood. In an interview with the Portland Press Herald last Friday, Collins made it clear that she won't vote for any bill until it's been scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The House narrowly passed its version of the health care bill in a 217-213 vote on May 4, but the CBO didn't release its cost estimate until May 24, which projected that 23 million more people would be without health insurance over the next decade under the bill. It's unclear if the working group has submitted complete text yet to the budget scorekeeper. A spokeswoman for the CBO did not respond to a request for comment. Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, another member of the working group, suggested the team is already in communication with CBO when he was asked Tuesday about how the tax credits in the Senate bill would differ from the House version. ""I think it will be more income-based, for sure,"" he said. ""We're still talking about how to do the age cohorts. We're looking at different iterations of it and trying to get some feedback from CBO."" The House bill would, among other things, repeal the individual and employer mandates put in place by Obamacare that required people to carry insurance or face a tax penalty. It would also provide refundable tax credits to help people afford coverage, expand health savings accounts and phase out an expansion of Medicaid. Asked if there's a Medicaid phaseout in the Senate bill, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, another working group participant, said ""I'm not aware of anyone talking about anything getting phased out. What I'm aware of is a discussion about first of all, keeping the Medicaid expansion, and gradually transitioning to the conventional split between the federal government and the states."" The members of the working group include Republican Sens. Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, Rob Portman, Tom Cotton, Pat Toomey, Orrin Hatch, Cory Gardner, John Barrasso, John Cornyn, Mike Enzi, Lamar Alexander, John Thune and Mike Lee.?

"CIA Director Mike Pompeo briefed former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on sensitive issues during Flynn's time in the position and during the transition, despite concerns about Flynn held by law enforcement and the intelligence community, CBS News justice and homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues reports.? The New York Times?was the first to report on the Flynn briefings. ?? For weeks, officials with knowledge of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and whether President Trump's campaign representatives had colluded with the Russians were wary about who they were briefing. Mr. Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 13 after, the administration says, Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russian officials. Flynn was among the most pressing concerns, and multiple sources say many officials beyond former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates believed Flynn had been compromised. Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, was fired on Jan. 30 for refusing to defend Mr. Trump's travel ban. In May, Yates told Congress she warned administration officials Flynn ""essentially could be blackmailed"" because he apparently had lied to his bosses about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. ? CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid joins CBSN with the latest details on reports that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn may have l... Before Flynn was fired, he was present when Pompeo briefed Mr. Trump on the most sensitive U.S. secrets.? CIA spokesman Dean Boyd told CBS News the CIA wouldn't comment on any briefings.? ""Whether the CIA Director briefed the President on a specific intelligence issue during a specific timeframe is not something we publicly comment on and we're not about to start today,"" Boyd said.? But some former U.S. intelligence officials say Pompeo had a responsibility to raise concerns he was aware of regarding Flynn. If he did know and didn't speak up, one former official said, Pompeo ""failed at his first and foremost job - to protect classified information from compromise."" It's unclear whether Pompeo was aware of the full details of the intelligence on Flynn. But by the time Pompeo was confirmed as CIA director, the questions and concerns about Flynn seemed to be common knowledge among top intel officials. Some U.S. government officials question whether other intelligence chiefs also had a responsibility to say something before offering briefings. A source familiar with the presidential daily briefings told CBS News that, in hindsight things, look different than they did at the time. Looking back, the source said, every intel agency should have refused to provide intelligence, but it wasn't the job of intelligence agencies to tell Mr. Trump who to include in the briefings. ""Was that a call the President should have made?"" the source asked.																																																																																																																					"
"Former?Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary?Jeh Johnson will testify Wednesday at 10 a.m. in front of the House Intelligence Committee as it continues its ongoing investigation into possible Russia interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Johnson released a 6-page prepared statement Tuesday evening that praises the Committee's investigation and calls out Russian President Vladimir Putin for orchestrating cyberattacks with the direct purpose of influencing the 2016 election. U.S. intelligence is still gathering new evidence of Russian cyberattacks before election day, and the leaked top-secret NSA report was only rece... ""On Election Day, DHS assembled a crisis-response team to rapidly address any reported cyber intrusions into the election process. To my current knowledge, the Russian government did not through any cyber intrusion alter ballots, ballot counts or reporting of election results,"" Johnson will testify. ""I am not in a position to know whether the successful Russian government-directed hacks of the DNC and elsewhere did in fact alter public opinion and thereby alter the outcome of the presidential election."" Johnson led DHS amid Russian cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta, as well as?attacks against state election databases?last year. He advised states on how to protect themselves ahead of the election on Nov. 8. ""Our intelligence community became increasingly convinced that the Russian government was behind the hacks of the DNC and other political institutions and figures,"" he will say Wednesday. ""By Election Day on November 8, a large number of state and local election officials did in fact respond to our offers of cybersecurity assistance,"" Johnson will say. ""More specifically, almost every state contacted DHS about its services, and 33 states and 36 cities and counties used DHS tools to scan for potential vulnerabilities and/or sought mitigation advice from us."" Johnson wanted to include election infrastructure as ""critical infrastructure,"" which would make it eligible for more protection, but in his prepared statement he said that he tabled the idea after states resisted his offer to help. Johnson will testify that ""on October 7, Director Clapper and I issued the statement formally and publicly accusing the Russian government of directing cyber 'thefts and disclosures [that] are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process.'"" ? Twice in his testimony, Johnson will ask President Trump and Congress: ""What are we going to do to protect the American people and their democracy from future cyberattacks?"" ""This very troubling experience highlights cyber vulnerabilities in our political process, and in our election infrastructure itself,"" he will say. Also, Johnson is expected to say that he announced on Jan. 6 a determination that election infrastructure in this country should be designated ""critical"" and his DHS successor John Kelly reaffirmed that designation.

"Last Updated Jun 20, 2017 11:21 PM EDT Republican Karen Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in Tuesday's special election for Georgia's 6th Congressional District seat, dashing Democrats' hopes of taking a seat Republicans have held since Newt Gingrich won it in 1978. Handel had 52.5 percent of the vote compared to Ossoff's 47.5 percent of the vote, with 81 percent of the district's 208 precincts in the Atlanta suburbs reporting.? Heavy flooding in the area made getting to the polls a challenge for voters, although more than 100,000 Georgians voted early. Handel will be the only woman in Georgia's congressional delegation.? The race between Handel and Ossoff has been the most expensive U.S. House race in history, and is projected to cost close to $60 million. Democrats outspent Republicans, in the hope of making the race a referendum against President Trump and his agenda. The seat was left vacant by Tom Price, selected by Mr. Trump to be secretary of Health and Human Services.? Polls close Tuesday night in Georgia in the House race to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Wall Street Journal senior video... In her victory speech, Handel thanked House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who texted her on a weekly basis to check in before he was shot last week at a congressional baseball practice that left him in critical condition.? Handel said there is a great need to ""lift up this nation so that we can find a more civil way to deal with our disagreements."" At one point, chants of, ""Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump"" broke out as Handel spoke.? Ossoff also gave a brief speech, after a disappointing result. Handel described her Democratic opponent as ""gracious."" Democrat Jon Ossoff is joined by his finance, Alisha Kramer, as he addresses his supporters after his defeat in Georgia's 6th Congressional District special election in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., June 20, 2017. ""As darkness has crept across this planet, you have provided a beacon of hope,"" Ossoff told his supporters. Handel, 55, served as Georgia's secretary of state from 2007 to 2010. She resigned to run for governor, but lost that race in a runoff. Handel also ran for U.S. Senate in 2014, but came third in the GOP primary. In the interim, she was a vice president at the Susan G. Komen for the Cure from 2011 to 2012.? Handel hasn't tied herself closely to Mr. Trump, but the president has voiced his support for her in tweets, and even tweeted about the race on Tuesday night.? Thank you @FoxNews ""Huge win for President Trump and GOP in Georgia Congressional Special Election."" Congratulations to Karen Handel on her big win in Georgia 6th. Fantastic job, we are all very proud of you! Mr. Trump won the district, considered solidly Republican, but by just 1.5 percent in 2016. Mitt Romney, for contrast, won the district by 23 points. The relatively wealthy district is 70 percent white, 13 percent black and 13 percent Hispanic.?

"OSHKOSH, Wis. -- As President Trump marks five months in office Tuesday, he has hit a new low in a CBS News poll. Only 36 percent of Americans told us they approve of the job he's doing. Mr. Trump is even losing support among Republicans. At Two Brothers Restaurant in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Trump supporters like Ken Schoenike are getting impatient -- but not with the president. ""Leave him alone. Let him do what he wants to do. The media is hounding on him constantly. I mean, really?"" said Schoenike. This group of retirees backs Mr. Trump on almost every move he makes, but with one exception, according to Adolf Hendricks. ""I think I would like to see him a little more presidential, perhaps, a little more dignified,"" he told CBS News. Les Talo says enough with the tweets. ""It just gives the Democrats fodder for their daily attacks on him,"" Talo said. A group of retirees speak with CBS News' Dean Reynolds about President Trump's performance. Warren Thomson dismisses the big issue consuming Washington: the Russian investigation. CBS News asked the group if they ever talk about the Russia probe and if it bothers anybody. ""This whole thing -- as far as I'm concerned -- is a conspiracy＃ it's a total distraction,"" one man said. They are among the 72 percent of Republicans who remain in Mr. Trump's corner, according to a new CBS News poll. But that number is down from 83 percent 52 days ago. And Mr. Trump's disapproval rate among Republicans is up seven points. Jennifer King, a church and school secretary, voted for Mr. Trump. We asked her what grade she would give Mr. Trump now. ""Probably a low C,"" she said. ""I still support him, but I would like to see some real results,"" she added. Jennifer King King wants tax cuts and more help for veterans, but believes Mr. Trump is too easily sidetracked. ""He is too busy fighting the media. He's too busy fighting accusations,"" she said. When asked what she thinks is the problem, she answered: ""I personally think it's his mouth."" But whether committed or wavering, these Mr. Trump voters believe that he hasn't been treated fairly. Most are willing to give him at least two years on the job before they would reconsider their support.

"By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto Americans' views of the economy are the on the rise and as high as they've been in 15 years. But whether President Trump gets approval for his handling of it depends heavily on partisanship. The same is true of whether people feel he is bringing business acumen to government. And overall, Republicans are also more likely to see the President as having accomplished more than his predecessors 每 while others say he's done less, or the same. Positive views of the economy have been inching up since last fall, and 64 percent of Americans now say the economy is in good shape, the highest percentage since May 2002. Majorities of all partisan stripes rate the nation's economy positively. Thirty-four percent say the economy is in bad shape. Forty-two percent of Americans approve of Mr. Trump's handling of the economy, and that rises to 80 percent among Republicans, independents are more divided, while Democrats (81 percent) decidedly disapprove. Among the Republicans and independents who say the economy is in good shape, most approve of President Trump's handling of it. ?That's not the case on the Democratic side. Three in four Democrats who rate the economy positively disapprove of how the President is handling it. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump touted his skills as a businessman, but over half of Americans (53 percent) overall don't think he is running the government like an efficient business. Republicans (68 percent) do think he is. How much the President has accomplished is also viewed through a partisan lens. Nearly half of Republicans (46 percent) say President Trump has accomplished more at this point than most presidents, while most Democrats (71 percent) think he has accomplished less. Independents tend to say less, or the same. Views on whether the President is standing up for you are more connected to partisanship and demographics than peoples' pocketbooks. Republicans, and evangelicals are more likely to say he stands up for them, while Democrats, women, and minorities are less likely. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Americans didn't see either presidential candidate as honest and trustworthy, and as President, Donald Trump continues to be seen by most as less than truthful. Just 35 percent of Americans think he tells the truth all or most of the time. Thirty-four percent think he hardly ever tells the truth, and 29 percent think he tells the truth some of the time. This poll was conducted by telephone June 15-18, 2017 among a random sample of 1,117 adults nationwide.? Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.? Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

"Tuesday's special election in Georgia's 6th Congressional District, the most expensive House race in U.S. history, became a race for the airwaves. About $42 million has been spent or reserved for TV and radio ads leading up to the showdown between Republican candidate Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff, according to an election-eve analysis by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. More than half of that has been committed since the first round of voting in April, when a run-off election narrowed the field to Ossoff and Handel, as they vie to fill the seat vacated by Republican Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Political ads, many of them attack ads, have inundated voters in the Atlanta suburbs in what is expected to be a tight race. Democrats are looking to make the race a referendum against President Donald Trump, as Republicans try to keep a seat Price had held since 2004. Ossoff's campaign so far has raised $23 million in 2017, and spent nearly $22 million, while Handel's campaign has raised $4.5 million and spent a little more than $3 million, according to campaign finance data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. That doesn't include spending from outside groups.? The politically charged, high-stakes race has fueled negative and controversial TV and radio ads, as well as digital ads.? Polls close Tuesday night in Georgia in the House race to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Wall Street Journal senior video... Both Ossoff and Handel condemned an outside group's attack ad that ran over the weekend, after a shooting at a congressional baseball practice near Washington, D.C., last weekend left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise critically injured. The ad, produced by the obscure Principled Leadership Project PAC, accuses the ""unhinged left"" of fueling violence against Republicans. The ad opens with the sound of gunshots, picturing Scalise being whisked away on a stretcher. ""Now the unhinged left is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans,"" the ad says. ""When will it stop? It won't if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday. Because the same unhinged leftists cheering last week's shooting are all backing Jon Ossoff. And if he wins, they win."" Even though Ossoff and Handel have denounced the ad, the group behind it has refused to back down.? In another controversial attack ad, the pro-Trump Great America Alliance political action committee ran a radio spot aimed to stifle the African-American vote for Ossoff with President Barack Obama's own words -- except, they weren't really Obama's words. The ad used Obama's voice as he read a passage from his book, Dreams From My Father. The passage Obama is reading, however, is a quote from a barber talking about Chicago's first black mayor.? ""Plantation politics,"" the ad says, in Obama's voice. ""Black people in the worst jobs. The worst housing. Police brutality rampant. But when the so-called black committeemen came around election time, we'd all line up and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Sell our souls for a Christmas turkey."" Then, the narrator, a black conservative named Autry Pruitt tells voters, ""Let's not sell out for another Christmas turkey. The more things change, the more they stay the same. The Democrats keep taking our votes for granted."" But the ad left off the context before those words, which reveals the barber is expressing how the black vote was taken for granted before the election of the first black mayor. The full context shows that the passage is about how positive things come from voting, PolitiFact pointed out, rating the ad ""pants on fire"" - in other words, a lie.? As voters go to the polls for Georgia's special congressional election, political reporter Victoria McGrane of the Boston Globe joins CBSN to dis... Another attack ad against Ossoff airing in May thanked him for his policies, featuring hipsters and hippies in San Francisco lauding the Democrat as, ""one of us."" ""We already have Nancy Pelosi as our congresswoman, now you're going to give us Jon Ossoff as our congressman,"" one person in the ad says, attempting to tie him to the liberal Democratic House leader. In another shot, the ad shows a cable car with Ossoff's picture, dubbing him, ""San Francisco's congressman.""? That ad was a part of a $6.5 million investment in the campaign from the Congressional Leadership Fund political action committee. But San Francisco's Municipal Transportation Agency threatened the Congressional Leadership Fund with a cease-and-desist letter, saying the group never received permission to use the cable car in its ad and forcing the Super PAC to remove the cable car from the ad. ? Ossoff has also put up its own negative ads, although not quite as controversial as the ones targeting him. His campaign, for instance, released an ad slamming Handel over her time as an executive at the Susan G. Komen Foundation, featuring an OBGYN from Georgia who says Handel ""cut off"" funding for Planned Parenthood cancer screenings. ""I don't usually get involved in politics, but as a doctor and a breast cancer survivor myself, what Karen Handel did is unforgivable,"" the OBGYN says in the ad. Handel resigned from the foundation in 2012, after it reversed an earlier decision to pull Planned Parenthood funding.

"A senior administration official confirmed to CBS News that on June 13, ?senior Trump administration officials met with Babak Namazi whose father and brother are both imprisoned in Iran.? In the wake of Otto Warmbier's return to the U.S. from North Korea detention and subsequent death, the White House is ramping up efforts to bring home two of the Namazi family members, Siamak and 81-year-old Baquer, in part due to concerns about their declining health. The Washington Post first reported the White House meeting with Namazi. Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American, was charged with espionage in 2015. His father was taken shortly afterward. They were not included in the Obama Administration's negotiations to free five American prisoners at the time of the nuclear deal. Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell is spearheading the prisoner release effort. She played a key role in bringing home NGA worker Aya Hijazi from Egypt, though more than 10 Americans remain behind bars there. Jared Genser, a lawyer for Namazi said in a written statement, that while Powell explained there were things being done she could not share, ""we discussed a number of concrete measures being considered"" making clear that the release of the Namazis is a ""top priority"" for the administration. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley also lent her support to the family, tweeting a photo of a June 15th meeting with Namazi, saying ""detaining political prisoners is one of the worst human rights abuses a country can do."" pic.twitter.com/10qqDUST8X Genser noted, however, that the family still has a ""very long way to go and undoubtedly many obstacles lie ahead.""?

A senior administration official and three people familiar with the potential changes said Spicer has discussed taking a more senior communications role in the White House, according to the Associated Press. The three people said Spicer has reached out to possible successors.?																																																																																																																					"
"The Trump administration late Thursday announced that it has formally reversed part of President Obama's immigration actions from 2014. The Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, program would have deferred deportations for the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents who have been in the U.S. since before 2010. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly signed a memorandum rescinding the program on Thursday, according to a fact sheet released by the department. Kelly said he made the decision ""because there is no credible path forward to litigate the currently enjoined policy."" Retired Gen. John Kelly testifies before a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee confirmation hearing on Kelly's nomination to be secretary of the Department of Homeland Security on Capitol Hill in Washington Jan. 10, 2017. The department made clear in the announcement that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program created by Mr. Obama in 2012 ""will remain in effect."" DACA has deferred deportations for people who entered the U.S. as children, who were under the age of 31 before June 15, 2012. Applicants must have also continuously lived in the U.S. since June 15, 2007 and come to the U.S. before his or her 16th birthday.? DAPA is not a program that ever went into effect. Before DAPA could be implemented, 26 states challenged the program in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which enjoined the implementation. After that, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision and the Supreme Court tied in the case in June 2016, effectively affirming the lower court's ruling to block the policy from being implemented. During his presidential campaign, President Trump promised on to terminate Obama's immigration actions.?

"Last Updated Jun 28, 2017 8:32 PM EDT The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it is implementing new enhanced security measures for all commercial flights coming into the United States, according to a senior DHS official. DHS Secretary John Kelly made the formal announcement at an event Wednesday afternoon. ""It is time we raise the global baseline of global aviation security. We must put in place new measures across the board to keep the traveling public safe,"" Kelly said. The measures, Kelly said, ""will include enhanced screening of electronic devices, more thorough passenger vetting and new measures designed to mitigate potential insider attacks."" By implementing the new procedures, he added, ""We send a clear message inaction is not an option."" The TSA confirmed Wednesday that it is testing new screening procedures for carry-on luggage at ten U.S. airports. Items like food, paper and add... Kelly said the measures, which will be phased in over time, will improve the security of U.S.-bound flights and is ""hopeful other nations will follow suit."" ""Unless we raise our security standards, terrorists will find a way to attack the weakest link. Today is just a starting point to reduce insider threats and identify suspicious passengers,"" Kelly added. The new measures will apply to both domestic and foreign air carriers for more than 280 last point of departure airports in 105 countries. This will impact approximately 2,000 flights a day and 325,000 passengers. DHS did not give specifics on what the new measures would include but said that passengers could expect to experience enhanced screening and extra security measures such as additional K9 teams and new screening technology. One new technology that may now be used: 3-D scanners that can better identify explosives in carry-on bags. The machines are being tested at Phoenix International Airport. Steve Karoly ""TSA is always looking for the best capability,"" said Steve Karoly, an assistant administrator at the Transportation Security Administration. ""The bad guy is very agile and always changing ... where we need to be that agile."" The Department also failed to give an exact timeline on when the new measures would be put in place but said they are ""giving the airlines sufficient time to implement these measures in an orderly fashion, with minimal impact for passengers"" and that they ""will take place in the near future."" U.S. officials are increasingly concerned about possible terrorist attacks on airliners. This means the ban on large electronics on flights to th... The more stringent measures stem from a growing concern about an explosive getting past airport scanners. ? DHS said that if airlines fail to comply with the new security directive, they could be subject to a number of penalties, including a?complete ban of larger personal electronic devices?on the entire aircraft (cabin or cargo), fines, pulling FAA certificates and restricting the airlines from U.S. airspace. The 10 carriers mentioned in the?original electronics ban?back in March could be removed from that ban if they comply with the new baseline security measures in this new directive. Until then, the electronics ban remains in place. CBS News' Katie Ross Dominick, Fernando Suarez and Jeff Pegues contributed to this report.

"Senior officials from the departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security labored Wednesday to finalize rules for visitors from six mostly Muslim nations who hope to avoid the Trump administration's revived travel ban and come to the United States. The deliberations came as U.S. embassies and consulates awaited instructions on how to implement this week's Supreme Court order that partially reinstated the ban after it was blocked by lower courts. The administration has given itself a Thursday deadline for implementing the scaled-back ban, which applies to visitors from Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen. The justices' opinion exempts applicants from the ban if they can prove a ""bona fide relationship"" with a U.S. person or entity. Government lawyers must determine how to define such a relationship. The court offered only broad guidelines - suggesting they would include a relative, job offer or invitation to lecture in the U.S. Shortly after the court's ruling, the State Department advised all U.S. diplomatic posts to await instructions. Until the new guidance is complete, posts were told to process applications as they had been, according to officials familiar with the situation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal communications publicly. President Donald Trump's initial travel ban in January led to chaos at airports around the world, but airlines say they don't expect similar problems this time. After a judge blocked the original ban, Trump issued a scaled-down order and the court's action Friday further reduced the number of people who would be covered by it. Also, while the initial order took effect immediately, adding to the confusion, this one was delayed 72 hours after the court's ruling. Virgin Atlantic said it was working with Customs and Border Protection, the Homeland Security agency responsible for admitting arriving foreigners into the United States. The airline said anyone with valid travel documents is expected to be able to travel to the U.S. as normal, but it recommended that passengers from the six countries check first with the U.S. Embassy. Some immigration groups plan to send lawyers to airports in case there are problems. The Dulles Justice Coalition, which established a pool of volunteer attorneys at Dulles International Airport after the first travel ban, is planning to return to the Virginia airport outside Washington, said DJC board member Sirine Shebaya. It remained unclear exactly when new instructions would be distributed to embassies and consulates. Among other questions lawyers were grappling with was how specific the instructions should be in interpreting a ""bona fide relationship."" A broad interpretation, for example, could allow for a contract or reservation with a rental car agency or hotel in the United States to be considered a legitimate relationship, the officials said. Similarly, an applicant's relationship with a distant, nonblood relative in the U.S. could be considered legitimate. The officials said the new guidance might not delve into such specifics and leave consular officers with discretion to make their own determinations. The Homeland Security Department has said only that it will implement the travel ban ""professionally, with clear and sufficient public notice."" The Supreme Court order also placed similar limitations on Trump's plan to temporarily halt all refugee admissions. But that may have minimal effect for now. Of the 50,000 refugees the government planned to accept in the current budget year, more than 48,900 have been allowed to enter the U.S. The State Department has said that the few remaining refugees to be admitted this year will not have to prove a ""bona fide relationship."" A new cap won't be in place until the start of the budget year in October, around the time that the Supreme Court considers the case. Trump ordered the refugee ban and a travel ban affecting the six countries, plus Iraq, shortly after taking office. He said it was needed to protect the U.S. from terrorists, but opponents said it was unfairly harsh and was intended to meet a Trump campaign promise to keep Muslims out of the United States. After a federal judge struck down the bans, Trump signed a revised order intended to overcome legal hurdles. That was also struck down by lower courts, but the Supreme Court's action Monday partially reinstated it.

"Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont on Tuesday defended his wife, Jane Sanders, former president of now-defunct Burlington College, from bank fraud allegations over a $10-million loan application sought by Ms. Sanders in 2011 to purchase 33 acres of land for the liberal arts institution.? ""My wife is about the most honest person I know,"" Sanders said to anchor Erin Burnett on CNN. ""When she came to that college, it was failing financially and academically. When she left it, it was in better shape than it had ever been."" ? Jane Sanders left the college in 2011, after having served as president for seven years.? The Vermont senator would not confirm or deny whether an official investigation was underway, but he did deny accusations that his wife manipulated application information in an effort to secure the loan.? ""Let's disagree openly and honestly,"" Vermont senator says, ""but violence is not acceptable."" ""When you go after people's wives that is really pathetic,"" he said. ""And that's where we are right now. That's about all I am going to say."" ""We'll let it play out,"" Sen. Sanders said. Last week, Sen. Sanders' enduring political aide Jeff Weaver confirmed that the senator and Jane Sanders had sought legal protection from attorneys Rich Cassidy and Larry Robbins. Sen. Sanders has referred to the allegations against his wife as political warfare, noting that they originated from Trump supporter and Vermont Republican Party Vice Chair Brady Toensing, as Sanders' presidential run was gaining momentum.? ""Five years later just at the moment, coincidentally, no doubt, when I am a candidate for president of the United States, Donald Trump's campaign manager, co-Vice Chairman of the Republican Party in Vermont, launched this investigation,"" Sen. Sanders said. ""It is a sad state of affairs in America, not only when we have politicians being destroyed, but when there are attacks against elected officials."" ?? Brady Toensing filed the original?request for a federal investigation into Jane Sanders to the U.S. Attorney to Vermont in January 2016, which he said ""appears to have started right away"" under the Obama administration. He also issued an additional request four months later to investigate the possible involvement of Sen. Sanders' office.? In response to Sen. Sanders' comments on Tuesday, Toensing said the senator's wife should not be exempt from public inquiry. The two, he said, are close and have played roles in each other's careers.? ""As indicated by his Senate financial reports, he profited from the $200,000 payout she extracted from Burlington College when she was forced out,"" Toensing said. ""She helped set up Our Revolution. She is running, making public appearances, and soliciting money for the Sanders Institute. Their relationship is financially and politically inextricable.""? ? ? Toensing said that in the spring of 2016, a former executive from People's United Bank ""complained that Sen. Sanders office pressured them to make the loan to Burlington College."" Josh Miller-Lewis, communications director for Sen. Sanders, said his office has not been notified that he is under federal investigation, despite reporting by Politico that said prosecutors might be looking into the allegations.? Sen. Sanders in May told reporters that he would not elaborate on the accusations drawn against him because ""there is a process going on.""? Former Burlington College President Carol Moore in an interview with Vermont Public Radio in May said the college closed last year, in part, because of the troubled $10-million loan, which the institution could not afford. Moore confirmed that the FBI had been in contact with her multiple times, asking about the the loan, since the request was filed by Toensing.?

"As White House officials debate their approach for a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Germany next month, one veteran diplomat is speaking out about the ""firm"" message Washington needs to send to Moscow. Former Ambassador William Burns ? ""This is not a time for chummy conversations,"" said former Ambassador William Burns, referring to the optics of Mr. Trump's meeting with Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in May. ""There are a lot of very serious differences between us and Russia, and I think it's really important for the president to make that clear so there's no misunderstanding about the depth of our concern."" According to the Associated Press, Mr. Trump is ""eager"" to meet with Putin ""with full diplomatic bells and whistles,"" but many in the Trump administration think it's best to maintain distance amid the ongoing investigation into Russia's meddling in the U.S. elections. Burns, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008 and retired from the State Department in 2014 as deputy secretary of state, shed light on Putin and why he aims to ""chip away at American influence."" President Trump is blasting former President Obama for not acting sooner when he learned Vladimir Putin ordered hackers to help the Trump campaig... ""I think Putin has a very combustible combination of grievance and insecurity and ambition. A lot of his worldview was shaped by the experience of Russia in the 1990s, the sense that Russia, which was then flat on its back economically, was being taken advantage of by the U.S. and the rest,"" Burns said. ""And that the U.S. in that period reinforced an international order, from Putin's point of view, that constrained Russia, denied it what he thinks is the entitlement of a major power, which is his sphere of influence in the former Soviet space and gave license to the U.S. and other countries to question Putin's very tough authoritarian rule inside Russia itself. So as a result of that, Putin's conclusion is that the way to ensure Russia' major power status is chip away at American influence and also point to external threats 每 to say to Russians, it's the United States that's trying to keep us down and I'm the person who can stand up to them."" Burns said there was ""a serious effort"" by the U.S. to understand and help the Russians during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but ""the basic problem was a Russia that was going through a really difficult period, and there was a sense of humiliation that you couldn't escape."" Now the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Burns said Mr. Trump needs to address the Russian hacking efforts first 每 ""a very serious assault on our democratic system"" 每 as well as continuing concerns over Russia's role in Ukraine and Syria. On Monday night, the White House released a stern warning to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad claiming it had ""potential"" evidence that Syria was preparing another chemical weapons attack against its own people. Russia responded Tuesday, with the Kremlin spokesman telling reporters that Moscow considers ""such threats against the Syrian leadership to be unacceptable."" According to Reuters, Assad also visited a Russian air base in western Syria on Tuesday. ""He's showing off. He's a thug,"" Burns said. ""He's trying to demonstrate that he can get away with the subjugation of his people, having consolidated control in the western part of his country, most of it. He's determined to try to do it in the east as well."" There's ""an awful lot at stake"" in Syria, Burns said, adding, ""it's a very combustible situation right now.""?

"Last Updated Jun 28, 2017 3:27 PM EDT U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley applauded the actions taken by the Trump administration in issuing a stern warning against the Assad regime's intent to launch another chemical weapon attack. The White House issued a surprise statement Monday night that threatened President Bashar Assad's government with ""a heavy price"" if it used chemical weapons. ""I can tell you that due to the president's actions, we did not see an incident. What we did see before was all the same activity we had seen prior for the April 4 attack, and so, I think by the president calling out Assad, by the U.S. continuing to remind Iran and Russia while they choose to back Assad, this is something we're not going to put up with, I like to think the president saved many men women and children,"" Haley said before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday. Defense Secretary James Mattis said that Syria's government had taken the warning seriously. His statement that the Syrians appear to have taken the White House warning against another chemical attack seriously is based on the fact that there hasn't been a chemical attack since the warning was issued, since the situation at Shayrat airfield has not changed. Mattis wouldn't say what specifically triggered U.S. concerns that an attack might be imminent. In her opening statement to lawmakers, Haley said America's friends and rivals know that the U.S. has ""found its voice at the United Nations."" ""We drew a red line: if the U.N. would not act collectively, the United States would act alone. And we did."" She added following the president's actions in Syria, ""the international community is now very clear about what the U.S. is for and what the U.S. is against."" When pressed however on her differences in views from Mr. Trump in tackling Russian interference, Haley said she and Mr. Trump were on the ""same team."" ""He supports me at the U.N. and supports what I'm doing at the U.N.,"" she said. ""I work for the president, and I don't go rogue on the president. He's aware of what I'm doing, in all of these issues we're not apart on it."" Haley also addressed the ongoing tensions with North Korea, recommending that the more pressure put on the North, the better. ""You are dealing with a paranoid leader who thinks we're trying to assassinate him and do a regime change,"" she said of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""We need to remember he is building a nuclear program. I think it's going to happen sooner because they're on target to do that, I would welcome any kind of pressure to slow down the process"" to denuclearization. Haley said as the focus remains on the North's nuclear and missile threats, the U.N. will continue to highlight the human rights violations the regime is committing, in the wake of detained American student Otto Warmbier's death. ""Warmbier's death brought home to Americans the brutality that North Koreans have known for decades."" Pressed at the hearing about proposed U.S. cuts to the U.N. budget, Haley said that the Administration was ""putting the United Nations on notice"" and that ""there's a lot of fat around the edges,"" CBS News' Pamela Falk reports.? Haley's comments were made as the U.N. just finalized its proposal for the peacekeeping and core budgets, and the U.S. Congress has yet to decide how much the U.S. will trim in its financial contribution to the U.N.?

"A solid majority of Americans continue to disapprove of President Trump's job performance, according to a host of recent opinion surveys.? A NPR/PBS/Marist poll released Wednesday found 38 percent of registered voters approve of the president's job performance, while 53 percent disapprove. ?(That survey also had some interesting findings on the public view of Republican efforts to overturn Obamacare.) In an Economist/YouGov survey?also released on Wednesday, 42 percent of registered voters said they approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing as president, while 53 percent said they disapprove. After six months in office, President Trump's approval rating hit a new low, according to a CBS News poll. Dean Reynolds traveled to Oshkosh, Wis... Thirty-nine percent of Americans in a Gallup poll released Tuesday gave the president's job performance a thumbs-up, while 57 percent gave it a thumbs-down. And a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Tuesday put Mr. Trump's approval rating at 34 percent among Americans nationwide, and his disapproval at 58 percent. The latest CBS News poll, released last week, found that 36 percent of Americans approve of the job the president is doing, while 57 percent disapprove. These recent polls also reveal a deep pessimism about the trajectory of the country 每 a trend that may help explain the president's lackluster approval ratings, and one that seems to have gotten worse over the last few months. Only 32 percent of respondents in the Economist survey said the country is headed in the right direction, while 57 percent said it's on the wrong track. In the PBS survey, 31 percent said we're on the right track, 63 percent disagreed. In the Reuters poll, 24 percent said we're headed in the right direction, while 61 percent said we're on the wrong track. And the latest CBS News numbers show 31 percent of Americans believe we're on the right track, while 64 percent say we're headed in the wrong direction. A new CBS News poll shows President Trump's approval rating is at 36 percent, the lowest point in our polling since he took office. His approval ... Admittedly, the right track/wrong direction numbers have never been particularly optimistic, in recent years. According to the RealClearPolitics average of polls, only once during the last eight years did the number of Americans who believe the country is headed in the right direction match the number of Americans who believe the country is off track: For a brief shining moment in June 2009, roughly 46 percent of Americans fell into each camp. Since then, pessimism has reigned. The stretch of Mr. Trump's presidency in which Americans were feeling best about the direction of the country came towards the end of March 每 in the RealClearPolitics average, on March 21, nearly 39 percent of voters said the country is on the right track, while over 51 percent said it's headed in the wrong direction. In the three months since, that gap has widened considerably. In the same average today, only about 33 percent of Americans say we're on the right track, while over 60 percent say we're headed in the wrong direction. The NPR/PBS/Marist poll surveyed 995 registered voters between June 21 and June 25, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent. The Economist/YouGov poll surveyed 1,295 registered voters between June 25 and June 27, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percent.

Some viewed Mr. Chaffetz' position as chairman of the oversight panel as a difficult one, with the Trump administration in power.

"Former White House press secretaries Ari Fleischer and Mike McCurry said in a ""joint tweet"" Wednesday that they oppose live TV coverage of the daily briefing with the White House press corps. ""We support no live TV coverage of WH briefing. Embargo it & let it be used, but not as live TV. Better for the public, the WH & the press,"" Fleischer tweeted, which he said was a ""joint tweet"" with McCurry. Fleischer, who served as press secretary to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2003, didn't elaborate further. McCurry was President Clinton's press secretary from 1994 to 1998. Their statement comes as President Trump's White House has been shifting away from on-camera press briefings and instead doing them off-camera in what's called a ""gaggle"" with reporters. Some TV news networks, including CBS News, have been sending professional sketch artists to cover them to make up for the lack of a visual. On-camera press briefings began in the 1990s when McCurry started allowing networks to broadcast them live. The White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA), which seeks to protect journalists' access to the White House, has opposed the against the changes made by Mr. Trump's communications team. ""The WHCA's position on this issue is clear: we believe strongly that Americans should be able to watch and listen to senior government officials face questions from an independent news media, in keeping with the principles of the First Amendment and the need for transparency at the highest levels of government,"" WHCA Presidnt Jeff Mason said in a statement last week after meeting with press secretary Sean Spicer and deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ""...We have urged the White House not to replace on-camera briefings with ""gaggles,"" not-for-broadcast question and answer sessions,"" Mason continued.

"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- The urgency was easy to find inside the private receptions and closed-door briefings at the Koch brothers' donor retreat in Colorado Springs, where the billionaire conservatives and their chief lieutenants warned this weekend of a rapidly shrinking window to push their agenda through Congress. No agenda items mattered more to the conservative Koch network than the GOP's promise to overhaul the nation's tax code and repeal and replace President Barack Obama's health care law. At the moment, however, both are bogged down by GOP infighting that jeopardizes their fate. ""There is urgency,"" said Tim Phillips, who leads the network's political arm, Americans for Prosperity. ""We believe we have a window of about 12 months to get as much of it accomplished as possible before the 2018 elections grind policy to a halt."" The window for action may be even smaller, some Koch allies warned at a weekend donor retreat that drew roughly 400 participants to the heart of the Rocky Mountains. The price for admission for most was a pledge to give at least $100,000 this year to the Kochs' broad policy and political network. There were also at least 18 elected officials on hand. Some hosted private policy discussions with donors while others simply mingled. In between meetings, Rep. Dave Brat, R-Virginia, predicted dire consequences in next year's midterm elections should his party fail to deliver on its repeated promises. ""If we don't get health care, none of us are coming back,"" he said in a brief interview. ""We said for seven years you're gonna repeal Obamacare. It's nowhere near repealed."" It's the same for tax reform, Brat said: ""We don't get taxes through, we're all going home. Pack the bags."" There was a sense of deep frustration from conservative officials and donors alike in some cases, who decried the pace of progress in Washington with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House for the first time in a decade. Texas-based donor Doug Deason has already informed a handful of congressional Republicans that the ""Dallas piggy bank"" is closed until he sees more action. He said he was recently approached by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, about hosting a fundraiser. ""I said, 'No I'm not going to because we're closing the checkbook until you get some things done,'"" Deason said, noting he's encouraged nearly two dozen major Texas donors to follow his lead. ""Get Obamacare repealed and replaced, get tax reform passed,"" Deason continued. ""Get it done and we'll open it back up."" While some donors threatened to withhold campaign cash, Koch's team outlined a broader strategy to help shape the debate. Already, Americans For Prosperity claims a paid staff of more than 400 full-time activists in 36 states. Koch officials said that the network's midterm budget for policy and politics is between $300 million and $400 million. The group is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to change their current health care proposal, which it views as insufficiently conservative. ""We are not committed to the Senate bill in its current form, but there is still time to make changes and we're actively working to improve it,"" Phillips said. At the same time, Koch's allies are aggressively pushing forward on the taxes. The network is running what it describes as ""a first wave"" of digital ads calling on more than 50 House and Senate Republicans in both parties to overhaul the nation's tax code. Later in the summer, Philips said, Americans for Prosperity will begin hosting rallies and other events to generate momentum for a tax overhaul in all 36 states where they have full-time operations. Sean Lansing, AFP's chief operating officer, warned that the Republican Party's House majority could be in jeopardy if the Republican-led Congress doesn't follow through. ""If they don't make good on these promises...there are going to be consequences, and quite frankly there should be,"" Lansing said. Republicans would have to lose 24 seats to lose the House majority. And in a handful of recent special elections, the GOP has prevailed, despite President Donald Trump's low approval ratings. Another Koch donor, Chris Wright, of Colorado, says Republicans likely have a 10-month window before any chance of major policy action is suffocated by next year's midterms. ""If we don't get anything done by then, the elections probably don't go very well,"" Wright said. ""They may not go well anyway.""																																																																																																																					"
"WASHINGTON?-- President Donald Trump is eager to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin with full diplomatic bells and whistles when the two are in Germany for a multinational summit next month. But the idea is exposing deep divisions within the administration on the best way to approach Moscow in the midst of an ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. elections. Many administration officials believe the U.S. needs to maintain its distance from Russia at such a sensitive time - and interact only with great caution. But Trump and some others within his administration have been pressing for a full bilateral meeting. He's calling for media access and all the typical protocol associated with such sessions, even as officials within the State Department and National Security Council urge more restraint, according to a current and a former administration official. Some advisers have recommended that the president instead do either a quick, informal ""pull-aside"" on the sidelines of the summit, or that the U.S. and Russian delegations hold ""strategic stability talks,"" which typically don't involve the presidents. The officials spoke anonymously to discuss private policy discussions. The contrasting views underscore differing views within the administration on overall Russia policy, and Trump's eagerness to develop a working relationship with Russia despite the ongoing investigations. Asked about the AP report that Trump is eager for a full bilateral meeting, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday that ""the protocol side of it is secondary."" The two leaders will be attending the same event in the same place at the same time, Peskov said, so ""in any case there will be a chance to meet."" Peskov added, however, that no progress in hammering out the details of the meeting has been made yet. There are potential benefits to a meeting with Putin. A face-to-face meeting can humanize the two sides and often removes some of the intrigue involved in impersonal, telephone communication. Trump - the ultimate dealmaker - has repeatedly suggested that he can replace the Obama-era damage in the U.S.-Russia relationship with a partnership, particularly on issues like the ongoing Syria conflict. There are big risks, though. Trump is known to veer off-script, creating the possibility for a high-stakes diplomatic blunder. In a brief Oval Office meeting with top Russian diplomats last month, Trump revealed highly classified information about an Islamic State group threat to airlines that was relayed to him by Israel, according to a senior administration official. The White House defended the disclosures as ""wholly appropriate."" In addition, many observers warn that Putin is not to be trusted. Oleg Kalugin, a former general with Russia's main security agency, known as the KGB, said Putin, a shrewd and experienced politician, has ""other priorities"" than discussing the accusations that Russia hacked the U.S. election with Trump, such as easing sanctions, raising oil prices, as well as next year's presidential elections in Russia. ""Putin knows how to redirect a conversation in his favor,"" Kalugin said. Nina Khrushcheva, a Russian affairs professor at the New School, said Trump is in an ""impossible position."" ""He can't be too nice to Putin because it's going to be interpreted in a way that suggests he has a special relationship with Russia,"" she said. ""He can't be too mean because Putin has long arms and KGB thinking. So Trump needs to have a good relationship with him but he also needs to fulfill his campaign promises of establishing better relations with Russia."" The White House said no final decision has been made about whether a meeting will take place. It did not respond to questions about the opposing views within the administration. Bilateral meetings are common during summits like the G20, where many world leaders and their advisers are gathered in one place. The meetings are typically highly choreographed affairs, with everything from the way the two leaders shake hands to the looks that they exchange and the actual words spoken offering glimpses into the state of affairs. The last U.S.-Russia bilateral meeting was a 2015 encounter between Putin and President Barack Obama that began with an awkward handshake and ended with progress on the brutal civil war in Syria. That 2015 meeting, the first in two years, involved a 90-minute sit-down at U.N. headquarters. Putin and U.S. officials later said the two leaders had made progress on issues related to Syria, which had strained their already tense relationship. For the Obama administration, cautious engagement was the name of the game, with the U.S. working tirelessly to find middle ground with Moscow on Syria, Ukraine and other issues. The disconnect between Trump and his advisers in the State Department and National Security Council over Russia runs deeper than the debate over a G20 bilateral. A former administration official who spoke anonymously to discuss classified information said that frustration is growing among foreign policy advisers over the failure of the White House to embrace a more cautious and critical approach to Russia. All 17 U.S. intelligence agencies have agreed Russia was behind last year's hack of Democratic email systems and tried to influence the 2016 election to benefit Trump. Trump has to directly ""say to Putin, 'We're not happy about you interfering in our election,'"" said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. ""If you don't say that, you are going to get hammered by the press and Congress and you can guarantee Congress will pass sanctions legislation against Russia."" ""They also need to keep their expectations very, very modest,"" added Pifer. ""If they aim for a homerun in Hamburg, my guess is they'll strike out.""																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Jun 27, 2017 4:41 PM EDT Senate Republican leaders have decided to delay a floor vote on their?plan to repeal and replace Obamacare?until after the July 4 recess because they've failed to secure enough votes to back it so far.? Republicans need 51 votes to pass the legislation, but one vote can be Vice President Mike Pence's tie-breaking vote. And assuming all Democrats vote against it, Republicans can only afford two defections. The Senate currently has 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats. Before senators consider the measure itself, they'll have to vote on a motion to proceed. Republicans can only lose two votes on this motion in order to advance the bill. After the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)?released its score of the Senate bill Monday, it appeared that the bill did not have the support necessary for the procedural motion.? The 142-page measure, would end Obamacare's penalties for people who don't buy insurance, cut back an expansion of Medicaid, but would keep protections for people with pre-existing conditions, compared to the House-passed bill. It would provide tax credits, based on income, age and geography, which would make more money available to lower-income recipients to help them buy insurance. This differs from the House bill, which tied its tax credits only to age. Obamacare taxes would be repealed under the bill. The Senate bill would provide for expanded tax-free Health Savings Accounts, and it would also eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year. Hours after text was revealed, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, announced with three other Senate Republicans that they opposed the bill in its current form because it doesn't go far enough in repealing President Obama's health care law. A day later, Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, became the fifth Senate Republican to reject the measure. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, came out against it after the CBO score. After leadership announced that the vote was delayed, three more Senate Republicans said they opposed the original version: Jerry Moran of Kansas, Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has a challenging road ahead as he faces trying to bridge the divide between conservatives who want a more robust repeal of Obamacare and moderates who are wary about phasing out Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. Here's a list of Senate Republicans who oppose the bill in its current form: Even if McConnell is eventually successful in getting it through the Senate, the process won't be over. The House and Senate would then have to reconcile their two bills and pass a final agreement in each chamber before it can be sent to President Trump's desk. CBS News' John Nolen and Alan He contributed to this report.																																																																																																																					"
"BOSTON -- President Trump lashed out at Sen. Elizabeth Warren over her criticism of his health care bill, calling her a ""hopeless case"" and ""highly overrated voice.""? Mr. Trump said during an interview on ""Fox & Friends"" that aired Sunday that Warren has a lot of ""hatred"" and ""anger"" that came out when Warren campaigned for Hillary Clinton, hurting the candidate's chances of winning the election.? ""I watched her campaigning for Hillary [Clinton], and she was so angry,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Hillary would be sitting back listening to her trying to smile, but there were a lot of people in that audience that were going 'Wow, is that what we want?' There's a lot of anger there and hostility."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Mr. Trump has called her ""Pocahontas"" in the past in reference to questions about Warren's heritage, but in Sunday's interview, he said ""that's an insult to Pocahontas.""? Warren, a leading liberal and defender of the Affordable Care Act, has opposed efforts to pass a bill to replace the law. The Massachusetts Democrat reiterated her opposition in a statement to The Associated Press on Sunday, saying the health care bill being pushed by Senate Republicans is a ""monstrosity"" and Trump should ""junk it and start over."" Warren says the bill will kick ""millions off health insurance.""?																																																																																																																					"
"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court will wrap its 2017 session on Monday, which could include a decision on President Trump's controversial travel ban.? The Supreme Court usually saves their most important decisions for their final day, and CBS News' Paula Reid says it's very likely they have come to a decision and they make that decision public on Monday. The justices met Thursday for their last scheduled private conference of the session. The White House has asked the Supreme Court to allow it to go ahead and actually start enforcing this policy and hear arguments about in the fall. The Trump administration believes the Supreme Court is its best hope of having this policy upheld after two lower courts blocked, it saying it's likely unconstitutional.? The Supreme Court will wrap its 2017 session on June 25, 2017. It will take five votes from the court to reinstate the ban, but only four votes to set the case for argument. The biggest question mark is Neil Gorsuch, Mr. Trump's nominee who will rule on this high-profile case just three months after joining the bench. The case is at the Supreme Court because two federal appellate courts have ruled against the Trump travel policy, which would impose a 90-day pause in travel from citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said the ban was ""rooted in religious animus"" toward Muslims and pointed to Trump's campaign promise to impose a ban on Muslims entering the country as well as tweets and remarks he has made since becoming president. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on key cases this week. Topics on the list include the separation between church and state, border control ... The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the travel policy does not comply with federal immigration law, including a prohibition on nationality-based discrimination. That court also put a hold on separate aspects of the policy that would keep all refugees out of the United States for 120 days and cut by more than half, from 110,000 to 50,000, the cap on refugees in the current government spending year that ends Sept. 30. Trump's first executive order on travel applied to travelers from the six countries as well as Iraq, and took effect immediately, causing chaos and panic at airports over the last weekend in January as the Homeland Security Department scrambled to figure out who the order covered and how it was to be implemented. A federal judge blocked it eight days later, an order that was upheld by a 9th circuit panel. Rather than pursue an appeal, the administration said it would revise the policy. In March, Trump issued a narrower order, but it too has been blocked. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on a number of cases this week, including those concerning church funding, immigration and President Trump'... The justices have a range of options. They could immediately allow the administration to stop travel from the six countries and hear arguments on the administration's broader appeal in October. That's the path the administration has urged. But those who oppose the travel ban say it was only supposed to be temporary, about 90 days, and by the time it actually gets to the court it would have been long past it's actual purpose, Reid says. ? ? Meanwhile, there are rumors swirling that Justice Anthony Kennedy, age 80, could announce his retirement. Kennedy is often the ""swing vote"" on the court, and if he retires, Mr. Trump could push the court toward a conservative direction for decades to come.? But it's far from certain that any announcement is coming. Sources tell CBS News the White House and the other justices are in the dark about Kennedy's plans.? Retirement announcements do tend to come last day of the term, Reid says, but with Kennedy, you never know what he is going to do. ?

"?President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump were among the guests as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin married a Scottish actress. Mnuchin exchanged vows Saturday night with Louise Linton at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington. Mrs. Trump wore a pink blush dress and the president was in a tux. Vice President Mike Pence also attended and officiated the ceremony.? The 54-year-old Mnuchin worked for the Goldman Sachs investment firm for nearly two decades before founding a hedge fund. He also ran a company that invested in Hollywood movies and was finance chairman of Trump's presidential campaign. The 36-year-old Linton has appeared in movies and TV shows. Mnuchin also produced movies before joining the government.

"Following the release of Senate Republicans' draft of the House GOP-passed health care bill, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, said the focus remains on Medicaid expansion while noting there are indeed challenges that remain. ""It's going to be a challenge, but I have to strongly disagree with the characterization that we are somehow ending the Medicaid expansion. In fact, quite the contrary. The Senate bill will codify and make permanent the Medicaid expansion, and in fact we'll have the federal government pay the lion share of the cost,"" said Toomey.? He added, ""Obamacare created a new category of eligibility: working-aged, able-bodied adults with no dependents for the first time became eligible for Medicaid if their income is below 138 percent of the poverty level. We're going to continue that eligibility. No one loses coverage."" Toomey, a member of the Senate Republican working group that wrote the bill, said that government spending on Medicaid will continue to grow every year and will ""never"" be cut. ""It will eventually be growing at a slightly slower rate, and we need that to make the program viable and to deal with these massive deficits and the mounting debt that we have,"" added Toomey. Under the current draft, Medicaid would be phased out under the bill beginning in 2021, with gradual reductions until 2024 in the amount of federal Obamacare funds that have financed the entitlement program's expansion. The Senate bill would also slash funding to Medicaid from what Republicans call ""gimmicks that drive up federal costs."" President Trump repeatedly promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would not cut Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana echoed Toomey's comments, saying people will move off the Medicaid expansion into the private health insurance market. ""It isn't so much whether we are spending lots of money on Medicaid, it's whether or not people are covered,"" said Cassidy. He added that Medicaid in its current form is not sustainable.? ""If we can put Medicaid on a sustainable path where the state is receiving a certain amount of money and can budget for that and the state in turn gives it to managed care organizations, federal, state, managed care, the patient will have certainty as to their access."" But Cassidy, a physician, says he still has concerns about the bill in its current form. ? ""Right now I am undecided. There are things in this bill that adversely affect my state, that are peculiar to my state. A couple of the things I am concerned about, but if those can be addressed I will. And if they can't be addressed, I won't,"" said Cassidy.? When Cassidy was asked why there was such a rush to have a vote before the July Fourth recess, Cassidy said he would like more days to consider the bill.? ""I think a few more days to consider would be helpful,"" Cassidy said.																																																																																																																					"
"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that he's willing to negotiate on the ""repair"" of the Affordable Care Act, but not a total repeal. ""(Sen.) Bill Cassidy and I have spoken about it. And I told him. I said, ""If you can take repeal off the table, sit down, and talk about repair, and fixing what we have, and how to make it better, I'm in with you."" He added, ""Let's sit down and start working toward repairing the basic concept of what we have in the Affordable Care Act. We're willing to do that."" When asked if the White House had reached out directly to Manchin during the ongoing health care debate, Manchin said ""no, not yet"", ?but added that some of his colleagues had been involved. Manchin's comments come as Senate Republicans released their draft of the House GOP-passed American Health Care Act, a draft that was crafted during closed-door meetings and without Democratic input. Manchin noted the lack of insight from Senate Democrats, saying Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky should expand to a ""bipartisan working group"" to have a path forward. ""There's an awful lot that can be done to improve it. And we've identified-- let's sit down. But we can't even get in the room."" He added, ""I think we could fix it. There are some good people on both sides of the aisle that know it needs to be fixed."" Manchin said Senate Republicans have proven they are going to need the support of the Democrats to pass the measure?and urged McConnell to call off the bill if he lacks the support.? ""Work with me. Don't work against us,"" said Manchin. Five GOP holdouts are currently in the way of the bill passing in the Senate, including Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and, most recently, Dean Heller of Nevada. ""We cannot support the current bill,"" said Paul. He added, ""I just didn't run on 'Obamacare lite.' I didn't run on replacing it with more government programs."" Despite President Trump's criticism that the House bill was ""mean,"" he tweeted on Thursday following the draft's release?saying he was ""very supportive"" of the Senate bill and looked forward to ""making it really special."" But even with Mr. Trump's support, if three of the five senators continue to oppose the bill and no Democrats support the legislation, the measure will not pass. Manchin said that the bill in its current form lacks compassion, saying ""I'm sure there are synergies. But not just throwing them off. Why does it have to be so mean-spirited? Why can't there be some compassion?"" He added, ""This is about our country. And it's about you have to have a policy to get your people healthier, get them in a productive workforce if you will. And we can do that by intervening.""																																																																																																																					"
"Senate Republicans will release a ""discussion draft"" of their health care bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. ""I expect to have a discussion draft on Thursday, and we will go to the bill obviously once we get a CBO score -- likely next week,"" the Kentucky Republican told reporters after Republicans discussed the process behind closed doors over lunch. CBO stands for the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan organization that scores legislation and estimates its budgetary and economic effects. McConnell said he thinks ""it'll be about as transparent as it can be"" and claimed that the measure would be ""a profound positive improvement over the status quo,"" which he called unsustainable. Asked how long the public will have to review to the legislation before the Senate holds a vote, McConnell said, ""Oh, they'll have plenty of time."" McConnell rejected the idea of Democrats being invited into negotiations and said ""they are not interested in what we're trying to achieve, which is to change Obamacare and make it better."" Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, said at the press conference that Republicans' top two priorities in the measure will be to bring stability to the marketplace and to address the issue of skyrocketing premiums. McConnell has said he wants the Senate to vote on the bill before they leave at the end of next week for their week-long July 4 recess. The House narrowly passed its version in early May. Republicans are relying on the budget reconciliation process to get the bill passed in the Senate, which only requires a simple majority -- 51 votes -- instead of a supermajority and they may have to rely on Vice President Mike Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote. The Senate currently has 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That means if all Democrats vote against the bill, it would take three Republicans to torpedo it.

"Last Updated Jun 20, 2017 4:32 PM EDT President Trump referred several times to the death of American student Otto Warmbier, who was detained in North Korea until last week, as a ""disgrace."" ""It's a total disgrace what happened to Otto and it should never ever be allowed to happen,"" the president said Tuesday. Speaking at an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Mr. Trump responded to reporters' questions about Warmbier, who died on Monday. Although he didn't mention former President Obama by name, Mr. Trump seemed to be placing some of the blame on the Obama administration for Warmbier's death. ""Frankly, if he was brought home sooner, I think the result would have been a lot different,"" the president said. He added that Warmbier ""should have been brought home that same day.""? Mr. Trump told reporters that he spoke with the Warmbier family, saying ""his family is incredible what they've gone through, and he should have been brought home a long time ago.""? The Warmbier family released a statement on Monday following their son's death. ""It would be easy at a moment like this to focus on all that we lost -- future time that won't be spent with a warm, engaging, brilliant young man whose curiosity and enthusiasm for life knew no bounds. But we choose to focus on the time we were given to be with this remarkable person,"" the family said in a statement. Mr. Trump later tweeted his thanks to Chinese President Xi Jinping for his country's efforts in attempting to establish dialogue with North Korea, saying ""at least I know China tried."" While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried! CBS News' Margaret Brennan reports that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James?Mattis are meeting on Wednesday in D.C. with two of China's top officials - the State Councilor & the People's Liberation Army Group Chief of Staff.? Ramping up pressure on North Korea is going to be a major focus as are other flash points during the discussions, as the Trump administration has not been completely satisfied with the pressure applied by China on the North and believes more is possible. Warmbier had been visiting the North and was about to leave after a five-day tour, when he was detained at the airport for allegedly stealing a propaganda banner from his hotel. North Korea?sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor.? Earlier in the White House meeting, Mr. Trump welcomed Poroshenko to the White house, saying the two leaders had ""very good discussions"" and that would continue throughout the day. Poroshenko called the U.S. a ""most reliable supporter"" and a ""strategic partner"" to Ukraine, commending Mr. Trump for his leadership. He thanked the U.S. for supporting Ukrainian defense and reforms, calling his home country a ""story of success.""

"WASHINGTON?-- The Trump administration is leaving out half the equation when it argues President Barack Obama's health care law is in a ""death spiral."" Vice President Mike Pence offered accurate but only partial statistics when he made that case Tuesday in remarks to federal health employees. ""Back when Obamacare was first passed, just over seven years ago, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 23 million Americans would be covered by now,"" Pence told Health and Human Services Department workers. ""That's the blue line on the far left,"" he added, referring to a chart. ""It quickly became apparent that this was farfetched - to put it mildly."" True, only 10.3 million people are enrolled this year in the subsidized health insurance markets, not the 23 million projected by the budget office for 2017. But Pence - and the chart - omitted any mention of the other major coverage arm of Obama's law, a Medicaid expansion estimated to cover 12 million low-income people this year. More would be covered, but 19 states have refused the expansion because of opposition from Republicans. Together, the Medicaid expansion and subsidized private health insurance have reduced the number of uninsured by about 20 million people, bringing the uninsured rate to a historic low of about 9 percent, according to the government. Republican legislation that's before Congress would phase out enhanced federal financing for Medicaid expansion and trim subsidies for private insurance. Progress reducing the number of uninsured could be lost. To be sure, subsidized private insurance markets like HealthCare.gov have serious problems in many states. Premiums have gone up sharply and some major insurers have pulled out. About one-third of U.S. counties currently have only one insurer in the subsidized markets. Next year areas of Washington state, Ohio and Missouri face having no participating carrier, unless other insurers step in. More states could find themselves in that predicament. In other states, officials say the markets are working reasonably well. Pence is not alone in the administration in emphasizing the underperformance of the subsidized markets while glossing over how the Medicaid expansion has contributed to the decline in the uninsured. The administration shares some of the blame for the market turmoil. Insurers have complained that the failure of the White House to send a clear signal on the future of $7 billion in subsidies is driving up premiums and undermining confidence. Those cost-sharing subsidies help insurers reduce deductibles and copayments for people of modest incomes. If Obamacare ultimately goes into a death spiral, the Trump administration's dismissive approach will be seen by many as part of the reason.

"Last Updated Jun 14, 2017 3:14 PM EDT Following reports of a shooting at an Alexandria, Virginia YMCA baseball field being used for practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity.

"WASHINGTON?-- There's no sign of foot-dragging at the Office of Government Ethics despite President Donald Trump's complaint that it has ""become very difficult to deal with"" as he tries to fill vacancies on his team. It's actually moving faster on Trump's nominations than it did under President Barack Obama, data from the office show. Trump voiced his complaint at a portion of a Cabinet meeting that was opened to news coverage this week. The ethics office director says there's no holdup at his end. ""OGE is not the cause of any delays,"" Walter Shaub said. ""We're moving nominee reports faster during this transition than we did during the last transition, but we can't review reports the White House hasn't sent to us."" Ethics office data show it is giving guidance on nominees in an average of 26 days, compared with 32 days in Obama's first year. That quicker pace comes even though the Trump appointees have generally had more complex financial entanglements and potential conflicts of interest than those under Obama. The slowness, the data suggest, is on Trump's end. As of June 9, the Trump administration had forwarded 331 nominees for ethics vetting, compared with 483 nominees in the same period under Obama, the numbers show. The ethics office said Trump originally took an unusual approach to picking his nominees - one that did not loop in the ethics office for vetting until after the employees were announced. The office flagged the dangers in that practice in a letter to the incoming president's transition team in November. Making announcements before the ethics process led to some embarrassing departures when a few Trump picks could not adequately resolve their conflicts of interest. Among them was Todd Ricketts, son of the billionaire TD Ameritrade founder, who had been tapped as deputy commerce secretary. Ricketts chose to bow out of the position rather than divest enough of his financial interests to rid himself of conflicts of interest. By April, the Trump administration adopted the traditional process of waiting until the ethics office had finished its work before announcing picks. Trump's dig at the office is the latest volley in a long-running tussle between government ethics workers and Trump's lawyers and White House aides. In late April, the ethics office demanded information from the White House and other executive-branch agencies about what, if any, waivers they had granted to lobbyists and other top officials who are working on government matters similar to what they'd handled in the private sector. The administration initially said it needed more time to comply - and questioned the office's authority to make the request in the first place. But in the end, all of the federal agencies turned over the waiver information at the beginning of this month as the ethics officials had requested.

"Last Updated Jun 14, 2017 5:56 PM EDT ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- A rifle-wielding attacker opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice Wednesday, wounding House GOP Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and several others as congressmen and aides dove for cover. The assailant, prepared with ""a lot of ammo,"" fought a gun battle with police before he, too, was shot and later died. ""This is a stable situation,"" Michael Brown, chief of police for Alexandria, Virginia, told reporters. ""At this point, there's no additional threat. We consider this incident to be a closed incident under investigation."" Authorities identified the gunman as James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois. James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois, is seen in a photo obtained by CBS News. Late Wednesday, the FBI Special Agent-In-Charge Timothy Slater held a joint press conference with Alexandria police to update its on-going investigation. He said the D.C. medical examiner determined Hodgkinson's cause of death as multiple gunshot wounds to the torso. ""While the subject is deceased, we continue to actively investigate the shooter's motives, acquaintances and whereabouts that led to today's incident,"" Slater said. The FBI is asking the public to come forward with any information about the gunman by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI. Deputy Fred Rogers said the chief commends the special agents who stepped in during the shooting. ""Today we saw our our officers' extensive training was put into action.""

A player is seen frantically running off of the field as two men ask aloud whether anyone has notified authorities of the shooting. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, said on the Senate floor that the gunman apparently volunteered on his presidential campaign. Sanders said he was ""sickened by this despicable act."" Hodgkinson praised Sanders on social media, CBS News has learned. The FBI is going through his posts, mainly on Facebook, where he was highly critical of President Trump, calling him a traitor. The social media company said his two profiles have been removed from its platform. Sen. Bernie Sanders said he was ""sickened"" to learn the gunman in Wednesday's shooting at a congressional baseball practice had volunteered on hi... A law enforcement source said based on an initial assessment it appears the gunman was increasingly frustrated over the political direction of the country, CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. There was no indication that the shooting was inspired by a terrorist group or ideology. The gunman was believed to have driven to the baseball field in a large white van, Milton reports. The van with Illinois license plates was parked in a nearby parking lot. Investigators are trying to determine if Hodgkinson was living out of the van. Witnesses have told investigators Hodgkinson was showering at a YMCA adjacent to the baseball field. On Wednesday President Trump called the Alexandria baseball field shooting a ""very, very brutal assault"" and commended the U.S. Capitol and Alexa... Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-South Carolina, told reporters that he had interacted with the gunman Wednesday morning right before the shooting happened. ""I did have an interaction with someone in the parking lot who asked me if the team practicing was a Democrat or Republican team,"" Duncan told reporters. ""I told him they were Republicans. He said, 'K, thanks,' turned around. I got in the car and left, find out that my Republican colleagues were targeted by an active shooter today."" Duncan said that he believes the Republicans were targeted because of their political affiliation. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, who was at the practice, said he got a quick look at the gunman behind a dugout. ""Then when I realized he had a line of sight into the dugout with all the members there then we obviously went back down quickly,"" Flake said. Lawmakers and congressional staffers were practicing for a charity baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia, when a shooter opened fired Wednesday m... The gunman's weapon was similar to an M-4 assault rifle, CBS News has learned. The gunman had a rifle and ""a lot of ammo,"" Flake said. Scalise dragged himself off the infield leaving a trail of blood as colleagues rushed to his assistance. Capitol Police officers who were in Scalise's security detail wounded the shooter, who was taken into custody. In all, five people were taken to area hospitals, including the gunman, Alexandria police said. The shooter later died of his injuries, Mr. Trump told the nation from the White House. ""Everyone on that field is a public servant,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Their sacrifice makes democracy possible."" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was among the Republican lawmakers who were practicing for a charity baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia, before a gunm... Scalise, 51, the No. 3 House Republican leader first elected to the House in 2008, was shot in the hip, his office said in a statement. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that Scalise was out of surgery. MedStar Washington Hospital Center said on Twitter that Scalise was in critical condition. Scalise's office told CBS News that his family was coming from Louisiana to Washington. Before surgery, Scalise spoke to his wife on the phone and was in good spirits, his office said. Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Scalise ""was badly injured but will fully recover."" Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover. Our thoughts and prayers are with him. The other people shot include the gunman, Capitol Police Special Agent Crystal Griner, lobbyist Matt Mika and Zack Barth, a staffer for Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas. George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., said one patient it was treating from the shooting had died. The hospital didn't identify the patient, but the announcement came after Mr. Trump said the shooter had died. The hospital said another patient it was treating was in critical condition. CBS News has identified that patient as Mika, who sustained two gunshot wounds to the chest striking the lung. A former congressional staffer who now lobbies for Tyson Foods, Mika was at the practice as a volunteer coach, CBS News correspondent Kris Van Cleave reports.

U.S. Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa said in a statement that Griner was shot in the ankle and was in good condition. Special Agent David Bailey suffered a minor injury and was treated and released, Verderosa said. Authorities said in a joint statement that a second congressman sustained minor injuries during the incident. The congressman wasn't identified. Williams coaches the GOP team, his office said in a statement. He said that Barth ""is doing well"" and has since been released from the hospital. Rep. Roger Williams' (R-Texas) injured foot is seen as he speaks about the recent attack against the Republican Congressional baseball team in Alexandria, Virginia, during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Wed., June 14, 2017. In a Wednesday evening press briefing, Rep. Williams entered the room on crutches with an ankle injury. He described the shooting as something he will never forget and ""there were a lot of heroes out there today."" He was on the ballfield when the incident unfolded Wednesday morning. ""I was on the third base side hitting ground balls ... little did I know that the perpetrator was about 20 yards from me,"" he said. Williams dived into the first base dugout for cover when shots rang out and when Barth was struck in the leg. Rep. Roger Williams recounts the shooting and immediate aftermath on Wed., June 14, 2017, during a press conference. ""Zack had came running in from the outfield ... we landed in each other's arms. He held me, I held him. Jeff Flake took his belt off and made a tourniquet around Zack's leg to stop the bleeding."" ""But without our Capitol Police -- who literally took a step forward -- they saved all of us out there. There is no question about it. We had no arms ... we just had bats ... and the shooter,"" Williams said. ""It took the second shot to understand what was happening. We were sitting ducks,"" he added. The shocking event left the Capitol horrified and stunned. The House canceled proceedings for the day. Lawmakers were practicing for a charity baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia, when a shooter opened fired Wednesday morning. Nancy Cordes speaks... The shooting occurred at a popular park and baseball complex in Alexandria, Virginia, where Republican lawmakers and others were gathered for a morning practice about 7 a.m. They were in good spirits despite the heat and humidity as they prepared for the congressional baseball match that pits Republicans against Democrats. The popular annual face-off, which raises money for charity, was scheduled for Thursday evening at Nationals Park across the Potomac River in Washington. The team was taking batting practice when gunshots rang out and chaos erupted. Scalise was fielding balls on second base when he was shot, according to lawmakers present, then dragged himself into the outfield to get away from the gunman. Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, said his colleague ""crawled into the outfield, leaving a trail of blood."" Florida Congressman Tom Rooney had left the Alexandria baseball field just minutes before a shooter opened fire. House Majority Whip Steve Scalis... ""We started giving him the liquids, I put pressure on his wound in his hip,"" Brooks said. Texas Rep. Joe Barton, still in his baseball uniform, told reporters a shooter came out to the practice and opened fire, shooting at Rep. Trent Kelly, R-Miss., who plays third base. ""He shot at Steve Scalise, our second baseman. He hit Steve Scalise,"" Barton said, ""Scalise's security detail and the Capitol Hill police immediately returned fire, and Alexandria Police also immediately came and began to return fire. They shot the shooter. The security detail saved a lot of lives because they attacked the shooter."" Barton said the shooting lasted 5-10 minutes, and there were dozens if not hundreds of shots fired. After a shooting during a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, Senate Chaplain Barry Black opened the session with prayer on ... ""It was scary,"" Barton said. Lawmakers took cover in the dugout. Barton said his son, Jack, got under an SUV. FBI special agent in charge Tim Slater said it was ""too early to say"" whether it was an act of terrorism, or whether Scalise was targeted. After the gunfire stopped, Flake said he ran onto the field and also tried to come to Scalise's aide. After medical personnel arrived, he said he retrieved Scalise's phone and made the first call to Scalise's wife to notify her of the shooting. He said he did so to ensure that Mrs. Scalise would not find out about the shooting through the media. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was among the people shot Wednesday morning in the Del Ray section of Alexandria, Virginia, just south of Washi... Flake estimated that more than 50 shots were fired. He said the gunman was initially out in the open. ""Marty, our photographer, saw him raise the gun for the first time, the rifle, but he said he thought, 'Why in the world is somebody bird-hunting out here at this time,'"" Flake said. A spokesman for President Obama confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Obama called Flake on Wednesday. Scalise, a popular and gregarious lawmaker, is known for his love of baseball and handed out commemorative baseball bats to fellow lawmakers when he secured the No. 3 job of House whip several years ago. Falisa Peoples was just leaving the YMCA next to the ballfield when she saw the shooter open fire. ""He was just very calm. He was just walking and shooting,"" she said of the man, whom she described as white and wearing a T-shirt and shorts. She said he was using a long gun and exchanging fire with law enforcement officers, one of whom yelled for her to get down. A victim is transported at the scene of a shooting in Alexandria, Va., on Wed., June 14, 2017. According to a source, when Democratic members of Congress practicing at a different ballfield miles away heard of the shooting, they immediately stopped and said a prayer together, Milton reports. In a brief interview in a Senate hallway, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, ""I think everybody handled it well and things seem to be under control."" Other lawmakers were stunned in the aftermath of the event, which raised questions about the security of members of Congress. While the top lawmakers, including Scalise, have security details, others do not and regularly appear in public without protection. The last time a lawmaker was shot was when Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was hit in the head and grievously injured while meeting with constituents at a supermarket parking lot in 2011. Following the Giffords shooting, lawmakers have held fewer open town halls and have been advised to increase security at such events.

"Congress approved long-sought legislation Tuesday to make firing employees easier for the Department of Veterans Affairs, part of an effort urged by President Trump to fix a struggling agency serving millions of veterans. The bill will make it easier for VA employees, including executives, to be fired by lowering the standard of evidence required to ""remove, demote or suspend"" someone for poor performance or misconduct. It also gives whistleblowers more protections, including preventing the VA from removing an employee with an open whistleblower case.? The House cleared the bill, 368-55, replacing an earlier version that Democrats had criticized as overly unfair to workers. The Senate passed the bipartisan legislation by voice vote last week. It will go to Mr. Trump later this week for his signature. The measure comes after a 2014 scandal at the Phoenix VA medical center, where some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised to fire VA employees ""who let our veterans down,"" describing the government's second-largest agency and its more than 350,000 employees as ""the most corrupt"" and ""incompetent."" The passage of the @DeptVetAffairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act is GREAT news for veterans! I look forward to signing it! pic.twitter.com/xNSEW7N3zd The bill's passage ""is GREAT news for veterans!"" Mr. Trump tweeted Tuesday night. ""I look forward to signing it!"" Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tennassee, who chairs the House Veterans Affairs Committee, described the legislation as a necessary first step in overhauling the VA. Congress will soon take up legislation to give veterans expanded access to doctors outside the VA. ""For far too long, the failures of the bad actors have tarnished the good name of all VA employees,"" Roe said. ""No effort toward real, wholesale reform at the department will ever be successful absent a strong culture of accountability first."" The House vote came as investigations into possible collaboration between the Trump campaign and Russia continued to hang over much of Washington, largely stalling the administration's biggest legislative initiatives. Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified Tuesday before a Senate panel on Russia contacts as House members took up the VA bill. House leaders quickly touted progress on veterans' issues. ""We've been talking about this for about three years. And we uncovered all the scandals at the VA. Now we're making law,"" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. ""Now we're getting the veterans the kind of response and the kind of accountability they earned and deserved."" The bill was backed by VA Secretary David Shulkin, who called the employee accountability process ""clearly broken."" It would lower the burden of proof to fire employees, allowing a dismissal even if most evidence is in a worker's favor. Shulkin told CBS News back in April?that there's a ""bipartisan"" commitment to fixing the VA under Mr. Trump. Shulkin previously said his department is seeking to close perhaps more than 1,100 VA facilities nationwide as it develops plans to allow more veterans to receive medical care in the private sector. At a House hearing last month, Shulkin said the VA had identified more than 430 vacant buildings and 735 that he described as underutilized, costing the federal government $25 million a year. He said the VA would work with Congress in prioritizing buildings for closure and was considering whether to follow a process the Pentagon had used in recent decades to decide which of its underused military bases to shutter, known as Base Realignment and Closure, or BRAC. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, opposed the bill. But the Senate-passed measure was viewed as more in balance with workers' rights than a version passed by the House in March, mostly along party lines. The Senate bill calls for a longer appeal process than the House's version 〞 180 days vs. 45 days. VA executives would be held to a tougher standard than rank-and-file employees. The Senate bill also would turn a campaign promise of Trump's into law. It would create a permanent VA accountability office, established in April by executive order. The VA has been plagued for years by problems, including the 2014 scandal, where employees created secret lists to cover up delays in appointments. Critics say few employees are fired for malfeasance. Veterans' groups cheered the bill. ""Veterans across the country can look forward to a new culture of accountability and integrity at the VA,"" said Dan Caldwell, policy director of the conservative Concerned Veterans for America, which lobbied for years to pass legislation.

"President Donald Trump had an outsized effect on Virginia's primary contests for governor, but not in the ways most people expected. Democratic voters were energized in opposition to Trump and turned out in higher-than-expected numbers Tuesday. But the majority were happy to back the more moderate and establishment-favored Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam over a liberal insurgent who sought to portray his candidacy as the tip of the spear of the anti-Trump resistance. The biggest surprise was on the Republican side. Former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie, a moderate candidate who has kept his distance from Trump, squeaked out an uncomfortably close victory against a staunch Trump supporter who many viewed as a fringe candidate. Gillespie barely defeated Corey Stewart, who was fired as Trump's state campaign chairman last year and focused his gubernatorial bid on preserving Virginia's Confederate history. The general election is expected to be an early referendum on the president and a preview of what the 2018 midterm elections will look like. Virginia is one of only two states electing new governors this year, and the swing-state contest is likely to draw intense national scrutiny for signs of how voters are reacting to Trump's first year in office. In his victory speech, Gillespie tried to play peacemaker and asked Stewart supporters to get behind him for the general election. ""We want you to be part of our effort,"" Gillespie said. But Stewart, who frequently savaged Gillespie during the campaign as an out-of-touch former lobbyist, did not immediately concede the race. ""There's one word you will never hear from me and that's 'unity.' Because look, folks, we've been backing down too long ... in defense of our culture, our heritage and our country,"" Stewart said at a campaign event. The close results shocked many political watchers and shows Trump's enduring appeal among Republican voters, as well as a party still facing significant internal strife between its establishment and anti-establishment wings. It also highlights a potentially rocky road for Gillespie and other Republicans in the general election in a state where Democrats have won every statewide contest since 2009 and Hillary Clinton won easily last year. Stewart supporter Isaac Smith, 21, of Charlottesville, said the outcome was ""remarkable"" given the fact that Stewart was badly outspent. Smith viewed the results as a vindication of Trump. Smith added that he may vote for Gillespie, but won't campaign for him. ""Nobody's excited about Ed,"" he said. But Kevin Felty, a Norfolk Republican, said he voted for Gillespie because of his fundraising prowess in what's likely to be a bloody general campaign. Felty, a 48-year-old surgical assistant, said a GOP victory in Virginia would wrestle back the ""narrative being touted in the mainstream media that the Democrats are gaining traction"" under Trump. ""I see this as the midterm of the midterms,"" said Felty, who voted for Trump and remains steadfast in his support. ""I think it has bigger consequences than people imagine."" On the Democratic side, Northam wound up handily defeating former U.S. Rep. Tom Perriello, who ran as an unapologetic liberal crusader supported by prominent national Democrats like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as the best candidate to take on Trump. Northam, a usually low-key pediatric neurologist, won running as a pragmatist with the state Democratic establishment's firm support. He gave a fiery victory speech Tuesday, vowing to win over Perriello supporters and lead Democrats in retaking control of the state House of Delegates in the general election. ""It is time for us to get back on offense and stop playing so much defense,"" Northam said. More than 560,000 people voted in the Democratic primary, a more than 240,000 voter jump from the last time there was contested primary in 2009. Hyun Lee, 37, of Centreville, made calls and knocked on doors to turn out voters for Northam. ""I trust his leadership. I trust his dedication to all Virginians,"" Lee said of Northam. ""He cares for everyone."" Perriello made a surprise entrance into the race in January and faced an uphill climb from the beginning. He energized many new-to-politics voters who oppose Trump but was ultimately unable to get enough new voters to counter Northam's advantages. Northam essentially had been campaigning for years, making key contacts with influential power brokers like prominent African-American politicians and religious leaders, and building up a large cash advantage that let him outspend Perriello on TV advertising in the closing weeks of the race. Perriello pledged in his concession speech to help Northam and said his campaign had shown that a ""movement"" is ""rising up."" ""I don't know about you, but I'm inspired to keep fighting tonight,"" Perriello said.

"Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will testify before a House panel as momentum builds on Capitol Hill for a package of new Russia sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Tillerson is scheduled to appear Wednesday before the Foreign Affairs Committee, just hours ahead of a vote in the Senate on the sanctions. Tillerson has warned lawmakers the U.S. relationship with Russia is at an all-time low and deteriorating further. And he's also cautioned against taking steps that might close off promising avenues of communication between the two former Cold War foes. Tillerson was noncommittal about a package of new Russia sanctions during testimony Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He said he's still reviewing the proposed penalties that Senate Republicans and Democrats agreed upon after lengthy negotiations. But it's important, he stressed, that President Donald Trump have the flexibility ""to turn the heat up"" on Russia if necessary. A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle At the same time, he also said he doesn't want to preemptively shut down a potentially productive conversation. As an example, Tillerson said talks with Moscow on stabilizing war-ravaged Syria are progressing, but it's too early to tell if the discussions will bear fruit. Imposing more sanctions could lead the Russians to curtail the dialogue, he said. Top lawmakers on two Senate committees 〞 Banking and Foreign Relations 〞 announced the sanctions deal late Monday amid the firestorm over Russia's meddling in the presidential election and investigations into Moscow's possible collusion with members of President Donald Trump's campaign. The plan calls for strengthening current sanctions and imposing new ones on corrupt Russian actors, those involved in human rights abuses and those supplying weapons to the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad. The package also would require a congressional review if a president attempts to ease or end current penalties. And, penalties would be slapped on those responsible for malicious cyber activity on behalf of the Russian government. If the Trump administration decides to oppose the new sanctions, they could be in a bind. The package is to be added to a bill imposing penalties on Iran that the Senate is currently debating. So the White House would have to reject stricter punishments against Iran, which it favors, in order to derail the parts of the legislation it objects to. ""The amendment to the underlying Iran sanctions bill maintains and substantially expands sanctions against the government of Russia in response to the violation of the territorial integrity of the Ukraine and Crimea, its brazen cyberattacks and interference in elections, and its continuing aggression in Syria,"" said Republicans and Democrats on the committees. A vote on the Russia sanctions is scheduled for Wednesday, and the measure is expected to get strong bipartisan support. The legislation was worked out by Sens. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, of the Banking Committee, and Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Ben Cardin, D-Md., of the Foreign Relations panel. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., also participated in the negotiations and pushed for provisions that bar punished individuals from using family members to get around the sanctions. ""This amendment also takes appropriate steps to ensure that current sanctions cannot be unilaterally unwound by this administration,"" Shaheen said. The legislation also allows new penalties on key elements of the Russia economy, including mining, metals, shipping and railways. House and Senate committees are investigating Russia's meddling and potential links to the Trump campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is conducting a separate probe. Then-President Barack Obama in late December ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds and expelled 35 diplomats the U.S. said were really spies. Those penalties were on top of existing U.S. sanctions over Russia's actions in Ukraine, which have damaged Russia's economy but had only limited impact on President Vladimir Putin's behavior.

"While Washington is laser-focused on allegations about any inappropriate communications between Trump campaign associates and the Russian government, the Russians are focused on a major perk for their diplomats in the U.S.: their two Cold War-era estates in the U.S., in Maryland and New York. ? The Russians have been in regular contact with the U.S. about the two compounds, which the Obama administration shut down last year after concluding that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election. As first reported by?Buzzfeed, the Kremlin insists that the properties must be returned.? ""It is ours. We are going to get them back,"" the Russian Ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak told CBS News on Monday night. He said that the Kremlin is not interested in a U.S. government proposal that the Russians could sell the properties. The same message -- with a threat -- is coming from Moscow. ""We demand for what was taken away illegally be returned to us immediately, and we would also like to note that if it so happens that Washington does not restore the diplomatic immunity of our property, the response in regard to U.S. property in Russia will be symmetric,"" said Maria Zakharova, the spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry. If the U.S. does not re-open the doors to these compounds, it's not exactly clear what shape Russian retaliation will take. But there are a number of ways tension between Russia and the U.S. could be increased. ? ""Going after the embassy compound in Moscow or the ambassador's residence, Spaso House, would invite counter-moves by the U.S. here in D.C.,"" says a former U.S. ambassador to Russia. The official points out that the U.S. no longer has a massive compound on the outskirts of Moscow for its employees that is similar to these Russian compounds. ? The State Department would not respond to Zakharova's threat but it did acknowledge the conversations about the compounds are ""ongoing."" Heather Nauert, the State Department spokesperson, expects the conversations to continue, though she did not have details ""regarding what agreements could eventually be made."" ? U.S. diplomats recall being invited to the sprawling Russian compound on the Maryland shore for pool parties and schmoozing. These are also places that have offered Russian employees and their families a getaway. They could go there to play tennis, sail and enjoy the outdoors. The other compound is, according to U.S. officials, a 14-acre property on Long Island in New York that the Russians have owned since the 1950s. The closure of the Russian compounds took place in conjunction with new Russian sanctions that included the?expulsion of 35 Russians?who the U.S. said were spies operating under diplomatic cover. The announcement, in December 2016, also came at a time when the harassment of U.S. officials in Russia had been on the rise.? ""It had reached Soviet levels,"" says one former U.S. government official. U.S. diplomats in Russia found their car tires slashed, they experienced home break-ins, and some even faced violent attacks. The U.S. ambassador to Russia was subjected to a heightened harassment which, according to a report by the U.S. inspector general for the State Department, began creeping up to a level ""far more serious"" than U.S. diplomats had seen before in 2013. ""Unwarranted public criticism and intrusive surveillance were common,"" the IG's report read. So, closing the compounds was a specific effort to make a statement to the Russians on a personal level, the U.S. has admitted. Obama administration officials, however, also claimed the two sprawling compounds were being used for intelligence activities and did not intend to allow them to be re-opened. But some see the possibility of opening the compounds as a way to leverage U.S. interests. ""There is a kind of deal that could make sense: ?one in which the U.S. is not giving away something for nothing, and not giving away somebody else's equity,"" says Daniel Fried, who formerly worked on crafting Russian sanctions during the Obama administration. He suggested that an appropriate deal would include the Russians committing to an end of U.S. personnel harassment in Russia, as well as an agreement to give the U.S. access to property that they have wanted to use in St. Petersburg. ""If not, you look like suckers."" Some lawmakers are dubious about restoring access to the compounds to Russia. Senator Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, says that while opening these Russian compounds is not directly related to the Russian cyber hacking or activities under investigation related to Ukraine, ""in a way all of this is related"" because it all ties back to Russia's aggression against U.S. national security interests. ""If Russia continues to be aggressive, what country is next? They have already interfered with Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine in geographical integrity,"" Cardin said. ""What country is going to come next? So, we say because we are worried about them retaliating against us with our embassy in Russia, we will let them have Poland and Lithuania and maybe Estonia? The way to stop this is to be strong."" Later this month, U.S. Under Secretary Tom Shannon will travel to Moscow. Shannon is now the top U.S. diplomat to handle the U.S.-Russian irritants. Lately, U.S.-Russian relations have been worsening and could deteriorate further if any of the allegations being investigated by the U.S. intelligence community and members of Congress turn out to be true. Two Senate committees reached a bipartisan agreement Monday on expanding and strengthening sanctions against Russia over the election interference. The bill would require any changes to Russian sanctions to go through Congress, taking away Mr. Trump's ability to ease Russian sanctions on his own. Tillerson has warned that new sanctions may deter the ongoing ""positive"" conversations with the Russians regarding joint efforts in Syria. The secretary, however, has said it is too early to see if those conversations will ""bear fruit,"" and Congress wants to push sanctions sooner rather than later. ? Since his election, Mr. Trump has not yet met with Russian President Putin, though the two have talked by phone. The Trump administration has not issued any harsh retaliation for its involvement in the U.S. election. They will have their first face-to-face meeting soon, however. The White House confirms that the two will ""certainly"" see one another on the president's next foreign trip.

"WASHINGTON -- Democratic lawmakers are suing President Trump over foreign money flowing into his global business empire. Almost 200 senators and representatives are plaintiffs in a lawsuit alleging Trump is violating the so-called emoluments clause of the Constitution. It's being filed early Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the lawmakers said. The plaintiffs argue they have standing to sue because the clause says only Congress may approve foreign gifts and payments. ""The framers gave Congress a unique role, a unique right and responsibility,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who helped organize the lawsuit. Although Mr. Trump turned over control of his real estate development, management and marketing company to his adult sons and a senior executive, he did not divest from it. That means he stands to benefit financially from the Trump Organization's profits, including from foreign governments. Since he's become president, the Trump Organization has secured dozens of potentially valuable patents, including in China, and collected fees from lobbyists working for Saudi Arabia and other countries using his properties. The new suit - the third of its kind - says the full scope of foreign payments to the Trump Organization cannot be known because the president has not made his tax returns public. Earlier this week, two Democratic attorneys general filed a similar claim. Days after Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, a liberal-funded government watchdog group filed an emoluments lawsuit. A restaurant group and two individuals in the hotel industry later joined as co-plaintiffs. Mr. Trump and the Justice Department have called these lawsuits baseless. They argue the clause isn't intended to prevent normal business such as hotel payments and real estate transactions. ""The President's business interests do not violate the Emoluments Clause, for reasons explained at length in DOJ's filing on Friday night in the CREW case. ?This lawsuit appears to be just another politically motivated iteration of that case,"" said a senior White House official. ""The White House will review the Complaint, but we expect that DOJ will move to dismiss this case in the ordinary course. This is another example of the Democrats playing political games instead of working for the American people they were elected to serve."" Rep. John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat, said he and Blumenthal have amassed the ""greatest number of congressional plaintiffs on any lawsuit against a president."" He said they're taking the action ""not out of any sense of pleasure or partisanship but because President Trump has left us with no other option."" Ahead of the filing, only Democrats were asked to sign on, but Blumenthal and Conyers plan to send letters to their Republican colleagues Wednesday asking them to join the effort. The Washington Post points out that, ""The 37-page congressional complaint contends that the nation's founders were concerned that foreign powers could interfere with American affairs. The suit says that the founders were particularly worried that 'foreign states would give benefits and rewards to the nation's chief executive to subvert his loyalty.' ""As a result, they wrote the emoluments clause of the Constitution with language 'both sweeping and unqualified,""' the lawmakers' lawsuit says.""

"The White House has given Defense Secretary Jim Mattis the authority to set the troop levels in Afghanistan, two months after being given similar authority in Iraq and Syria, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News' David Martin. The move gives Mattis the ability to send more troops in, although it's unclear if Mattis intends to do so. Mattis told Congress on Tuesday that the U.S. is ""not winning in Afghanistan right now,"" and the enemy is surging. ""We need to correct this as soon as possible,"" Mattis said, but he said the U.S. would not have a new strategy until mid-July. Mattis said he would take steps to minimize the impact of the delay. The U.S. has about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan. Army Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, has told Congress that he could use an infusion of U.S. and allied troops to bolster support for the Afghan army. President Trump said on the campaign trail that NATO is obsolete because it doesn't fight terrorism, but the truth is, NATO alliance has been in ... Earlier this year, the Pentagon was considering a request for roughly 3,000 more troops, mainly for training and advising. That decision, however, has been stalled by the broader administration review of Afghan policy and a push for NATO to contribute more troops. Three U.S. soldiers were killed and another wounded Saturday when they were attacked by an Afghan soldier, who was then killed. And two U.S. Army Rangers died in a April 27 raid on an IS compound in eastern Afghanistan. Officials were investigating whether they were killed by friendly fire in the opening minutes of the three-hour battle. Their deaths came just days after a U.S. Army special forces soldier was also killed in the region. The Afghanistan war has been dragging on since October 2001, and the U.S.-led coalition ended their combat mission against the Taliban in 2014 but they are increasingly involved in backing up Afghan forces on the battlefield. Asked what he hoped the situation in Afghanistan would look like a year from now, Mattis said violence would be down, government corruption would be reduced and the Taliban would be ""rolled back,"" with less freedom of movement on the battlefield. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added that he hoped Afghan troop casualties would be lower a year from now. And he said a key to that will be the need for the U.S. to assist the Afghans in planning operations and providing aviation support while Kabul works to increase its combat air power. McCain, however, listed the names of the three 101st Airborne Division soldiers who were killed Saturday and said, ""Let's not ask these families to sacrifice any further without a strategy which we can then take and implement and help you. I'm fighting as hard as I can to increase defense spending. It's hard when we have no strategy to pursue."" On separate issues, Mattis and Dunford were asked about the Mideast diplomatic rift and alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election. On Russia, Mattis said, ""This sort of misbehavior has got to face consequences, and not just by the United States but more broadly."" He added that the Trump administration is working on a comprehensive cyber defense strategy, but in the meantime the U.S. has enough understanding of Russia's cyber actions to defend against them. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asked Dunford whether the diplomatic rift between Qatar and several of its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, is impeding U.S. military operations, given that the U.S. uses Qatar's al-Udeid air base as a critical air operations center for the wars. ""It is not,"" Dunford said.																																																																																																																					"

"COLUMBIA, S.C.?-- U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has been accused of a violating a law limiting government employees' political activity by voicing support for a South Carolina congressional candidate. The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. says she and the president are ""on the same team"" when it comes to human rights and humanitarian issues. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) wrote to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel on Tuesday, accusing the former South Carolina governor of violating the Hatch Act. The group says Haley shouldn't have retweeted one of President Donald Trump's Twitter?messages?earlier this month supporting Republican Ralph Norman. Ralph Norman, who is running for Congress in SC's 5th District, will be a fantastic help to me in cutting taxes, and.... CREW's complaint noted that Haley appeared to have deleted her tweet ""after two journalists pointed out that it might constitute a violation of the Hatch Act."" The group said in its letter that Haley deleted the tweet but should still be investigated and disciplined. Her retweet, the complaint says, occurred on the day before polls opened in Norman's race and was aimed at her followers, many of whom are likely to be South Carolina voters who would be voting in that election.? ""Ambassador Haley used her office to support Mr. Norman's special election campaign,"" the complaint reads. A Haley spokeswoman didn't immediately return a message. The group is asking OSC to investigate and then to recommend appropriate disciplinary action against Haley.? Norman went on to win a special election for the seat formerly occupied by Trump budget director Mick Mulvaney.

"Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, says lawmakers shouldn't ""over-promise"" on fixing America's health care system, saying it was ""broken"" before the Affordable Care Act and will still will be broken if the Senate passes the latest GOP health bill. ""It was broken before Obamacare, I don't think Obamacare fixed it, but it's still going to be broken after this Republican bill, mainly because there's not a marketplace, the consumer doesn't make decisions based on price. Until you connect the consumer to price, until you have real competition and capitalism, the marketplace will be broken,"" said Paul said on ""CBS This Morning"" Wednesday. ?? Paul said the current bill ""placates moderates"" by keeping parts of Obamacare, including Medicaid expansion and tax subsidies, but creates issues for those who ran on campaign promises to deliver a repeal of the health law. Hours after the bill's text was released last Thursday, Paul released a joint statement?with Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, arguing that the bill didn't go far enough in delivering a total repeal of Obamacare. ? Paul acknowledged on Wednesday that the costs of health care are a major sticking point for his lack of support, pointing out the costly impacts of keeping Medicaid expansion while cutting taxes. ""We have people squawking we're not keeping enough Medicaid expansion when in fact we keep the Medicaid expansion for seven years. We let the expansion states to continue to expand, and it never has really been an honest accounting of Medicaid,"" said Paul. He added, ""Our government, if you look at our budget, we're $500 billion in the hole, we spend more than $500 billion than comes in. They play games with the baseline 〞 'Oh, this is saving money.' Nobody believes this is saving money."" Paul suggested that once Republicans add additional repeal provisions to the bill 〞 a bill he said will ""still never be completely fixed"" 〞 they should sit down with Senate Democrats in a bipartisan fashion. He believes they could find common ground on ideas like voluntary buying groups to help bring down prices.? Paul's comments come just one day after Republican leaders announced they would be delaying the vote on their health care plan following a struggle to convince a majority of their own members to back the bill. The Senate now plans to take up the vote sometime after the July 4th recess. Paul met with President Trump Tuesday afternoon just before Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the decision to delay the vote. Paul said Mr. Trump appeared sympathetic to the argument and that he wants to get the bill through to repeal Obamacare. ""I tried to make sure that he understood that many of us don't think that the current bill is repeal,"" Paul said. ""We voted 60 times to repeal it, all of it, or as much as we thought we could repeal, and here we are now, actually keeping quite a bit of it.""

"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, said that as the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election continue, it's important to note that Russia is not an ally. ""Russia is not our friend. And to treat Putin as an ally and a friend is wrong. I don't look at him as a friend. I don't look at Russia. And I am very skeptical of what they're doing, their intentions. There are a lot of good people in Russia that don't have any say whatsoever,"" Manchin said on ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. Manchin's comments come in the wake of a Washington Post report that detailed the Obama administration's approach to punishing the Russian government for its hacking and influence campaign intended to politically damage Hillary Clinton and swing the election in Donald Trump's favor. President Trump addressed those reports on Twitter, appearing to acknowledge that Russia did indeed meddle in the election, but placing blame on the Obama administration for not doing enough to counter Russia's impact. Adam Entous, David Ignatius, and Michael Morrell join Face the Nation moderator John Dickerson to discuss the Washington Post's report detailing ... In a tweet Friday night, Mr. Trump wrote that Mr. Obama ""knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia"" and ""did nothing about it."" The tweets came after Mr. Trump expressed similar criticism of his predecessor in an interview with Fox News. ""I just heard today for the first time that Obama knew about Russia a long time before the election, and he did nothing about it,"" Mr. Trump said in the interview broadcast Sunday. ""But nobody wants to talk about that."" The West Virginian Senator, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, weighs in on the new revelations of Russian efforts to meddle in the 2...

He added, ""They took action basically on December the 29th and?closed down two compounds, threw out 35 diplomats. We knew there was a serious problem. And it was verified."" Manchin applauded the work by the Senate in passing a bipartisan measure to impose further sanctions against the Russians, saying ""we've got to make sure that we put the hurt on the oligarchs, all the money, the way the money flows through Russia, and the people that benefit by it."" Senator Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, details his concerns with the Senate health care bill. Manchin, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, says he continues to feel confident in the U.S. intelligence community.

"This week, President Trump said that there was no White House taping system. It ended a mystery he had created. Former FBI director James Comey described an Oval Office encounter where the president encouraged him to wrap up his investigation into Michael Flynn. The president said it didn't happen and warned tapes might contradict Comey. Well, there are no tapes and in making this announcement this week, the president was celebrating an anniversary. 44 years ago on June 23rd, Richard Nixon recorded what would become known as the ""smoking gun"" tape-- where he told his staff to have the CIA tell the FBI to stop investigating the Watergate break-in. It sealed Nixon's fate. Why would President Trump encourage Nixon obstruction of justice comparisons by talking about tapes? On Fox and Friends Friday, the president offered insight into his gambit. He was trying to keep James Comey honest. As a private citizen, Donald Trump also reportedly hinted at having made recordings-- and maybe sometimes did-- as a way to keep people honest. The press and the president are in agreement on this: a recording keeps people honest. That's why it was a mistake for the White House this week to further limit televised or audio recordings of press briefings. A sketch artist rendering of the audio and video-free briefing makes it look like a court room. But it's not a court. The briefing is a place where an administration explains in real time what it is doing on behalf of the people who pay their salaries. There may not be a taping system in the Oval Office, but there is one in the press room. No installation required. The cameras are there and they are on. It's designed to keep people honest.																																																																																																																					"
"Senate Republicans rolled out on Thursday their alternative to Obamacare and the health care plan that's been approved by the House. A small group of GOP senators have come out against the bill in its current form. With universal opposition from Democrats, just three Republican no votes would kill it. ""Face the Nation"" sat down on Sunday with Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, who is a member of the working group that wrote the bill, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, who is a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and has described parts of the bill as ""positive."" Toomey and Cassidy discussed the Republicans' health care plan. A transcript of the interview, which aired Sunday, June 25, 2017, on ""Face the Nation,"" is below. PART ONE: JOHN DICKERSON: We're joined now by Republican Senator Pat Toomey who is in Bethlehem Pennsylvania and Louisiana's Bill Cassidy who is in New York this morning. Senator Toomey I want to start with you. There seems to be two criticisms of the bill, we just heard Senator Manchin on the Democratic side, but on the Republican side there are two criticisms, that too much Obamacare left in place and then criticism from say Senator Heller which is that these Medicaid cuts are too big. How do those get solved? ? PAT TOOMEY: Yeah. Listen, it's going to be a challenge but I have to strongly disagree with the characterization that we are somehow ending the Medicaid expansion. In fact, quite the contrary. The Senate bill will codify and make permanent the Medicaid expansion and in fact we'll have the federal government pay the lion share of the cost. Remember, Obamacare created a new category of eligibility: working aged, able bodied adults with no dependents for the first time became eligible for Medicaid if their income is below 138 percent of the poverty level. We're going to continue that eligibility. No one loses coverage. What we are going to do, gradually over 7 years, is transition from the 90 percent federal share that Obamacare created and transition that to where the federal government is still paying a majority, but the state's are kicking in their fair share, an amount equivalent to what they pay for all the other categories of eligibility. ?Some of my conservative friends who are concerned ?that the bill doesn't go far enough. I am sympathetic about the kinds of reforms they would like to make to lower premiums through more market forces ?and greater freedom on the part of consumers, but I see this bill as a first step. An important step in the direction of repealing those portions of Obamacare that we can. Stabilizing the individual market which is collapsing and making important reforms to Medicaid. It's not the last step. JOHN DICKERSON; Alright, let me ask, Senator Cassidy you served in a low-income hospital with a lot of folks when you were practicing as a doctor. Picking up on what Senator Toomey said, the worry is on Medicaid is that, as the amount of money shrinks, states just won't be able to cover all the people that need to be covered. What's your sense of that and is that something that can be solved? BILL CASSIDY: People will move off the Medicaid expansion onto the private health insurance market and that can be a good thing. It isn't so much whether we are spending lots of money on Medicaid, it's whether or not people are covered. Now I have concerns about the bill, but let's acknowledge that as folks would move off Medicaid, they would go on private insurance, coverage would continue, and in some cases that actually gives the patient more options for for doctors that they can see then does Medicaid. So I think coverage could continue. JOHN DICKERSON: Will you support this bill Senator? BILL CASSIDY: Right now I am undecided. There are things in this bill that adversely affect my state, that are peculiar to my state. A couple of the things I am concerned about, but if those can be addressed I will. And if they can't be addressed, I won't. So right now I am undecided. ? ? ? JOHN DICKERSON: Senator Toomey, on this question of people moving off Medicaid and into the private market, the concern from critics is that moving them off into the private market puts them into a market where they will be unable because the subsidies are going away or are lowered in this bill or the tax credits are shrunk in this bill, and because -- basically people will be in a market where they can not afford - if the premiums are low the deductibles will be too high, or both premiums are high and deductibles are high. PAT TOOMEY: Yeah John. Obviously we have thought about that and this bill provides very generous tax credits. It's considerably more generous than the House. They are more oriented toward more low income people, and those are the people who obviously need it. And I would also point out, I think it's important to note, the federal government spending on Medicaid is going to grow every year. It's never going to be cut. It's never going to shrink. It will eventually be growing at a slightly slower rate and we need that to make the program viable and to deal with these massive deficits and the mounting debt that we have. JOHN DICKERSON: Alright Senator Toomey, Senator Cassidy we're going to be right back in a moment. We've got a hard break here. So we'll take that break and we'll be back with more on healthcare in a moment. PART TWO: JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to Face the nation. We're back with more from Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey and Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy. Senator Cassidy, I want to start with you. In reporting on this and talking to Republicans, two things they really like in this bill are that it changes the Medicaid entitlement, something Republicans have been trying to do for a while to shrink costs, and it repeals a lot of the tax increases that are part of Obamacare. How do those two big items make people healthier? BILL CASSIDY: First, Medicaid in its current form is not sustainable. If you look even under the Affordable Care Act, the state's portion of the Medicaid expansion cannot be sustained. In my state it'll be 310 million dollars a year, in California 2.2 billion dollars a year just for the state's portion. Now, I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured and saw many Medicaid. Why was I seeing Medicaid at a hospital for the uninsured? Because states could not afford their match, paid doctors so poorly that patients could not go see a private physician. if we can put Medicaid on a sustainable path where the state is receiving a certain amount of money and can budget for that and the state in turn gives it to managed care organizations, federal, state, managed care, ? the patient will have certainty as to their access. I actually think that's better for patients. I think that can improve outcomes and it's certainly better for the state and the federal taxpayer. JOHN DICKERSON: Senator Toomey you mentioned that there won't be cuts just there will just be the rate of growth will be slowing. On the specific question of Medicaid, but Governor John ?Kasich knows about budgeting, he was a former budget chairman of the House, so he knows the difference between cuts and slowing the rate of growth. And he said that in talking about this plan that he worries that it cuts resources needed to help our most vulnerable. That's a republican governor. Another Republican governor, Brian Sandoval says, "" There are our friends, these are our families and these are our neighbors,"" who he worries will get hurt as the rate of growth slows because they just don't think that that will be able to cover future Medicaid participants. So, they know the issues here. Why are they wrong? PAT TOOMEY: Well, Senator Kasich was very much in favor of this very approach when he was a chairman of the Budget Committee in the House. Look, I get that governors like having a lot of federal money come in and spent when they don't have to even raise it. But the reality is this is going to grow. This is going to grow for the permanent future. We're going to fund the lion's share of even this new population within Medicaid that most Republicans didn't support in the first place. But you know there's another fundamental aspect to this. What we're trying to do is free the states and free the marketplace to discover ever better ways to deliver services. There's wonderful innovation that's happening all across the country. In Pennsylvania, whether its ?Independence Blue or Geisinger, you know, an insurer and a healthcare provider. They are finding great new ways to deliver ever better care at lower costs, but there are constraints on the ability of insurance companies and providers to do that. ?We want to diminish those constraints, so that we can continue through a creative process, discover better ways to do this and this legislation at least takes us in that direction. JOHN DICKERSON: Senator Cassidy, 20 seconds, Majority Leader wants this done by July 4th, why the rush? BILL CASSIDY: I don't know quite why the rush. I frankly would like more days to consider this, that will probably be a discussion coming back. I think a few more days to consider would be helpful. JOHN DICKERSON: Alright, Senators we are very grateful. Thank you both for being here.																																																																																																																					"
"On Capitol Hill Wednesday, a Department of Homeland Security official said Russian hackers have targeted 21 state voter databases. Sources have told CBS News that nearly twice that many states showed evidence of a breach. CBS News has confirmed that congressional investigators are looking into whether Trump campaign associates obtained information from hacked voter databases during the election. So far there is no evidence of that, but it is a sign that the congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the election are expanding. ""Face the Nation"" sat down on Sunday with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, who is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting one of the investigations. Manchin discussed the latest on the Russian efforts to undermine the U.S. election system and Senate Republicans' alternative to Obamacare and the health care plan that's been approved by the House. A transcript of the interview, which aired Sunday, June 25, 2017, on ""Face the Nation,"" is below. PART ONE JOHN DICKERSON: We turn now to Democratic Senator Joe Manchin who sits on the Senate intelligence committee and he joins us from Charleston West Virginia. Senator, you've read the Washington Post. You've heard this discussion. Give the Obama administration your grade on how they handled this. The West Virginian Senator, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, weighs in on the new revelations of Russian efforts to meddle in the 2... JOE MANCHIN: Well, hindsight being 20/20, I guess we can grade any way person says politically. First of all, John, you have to have confidence that the intelligence community that we have, that you trust them, and they're accurate, and they do their job. And I believe that. I feel very confident that our intelligence community's the best in the world. You have to spend some time with them to understand what they're doing, the job they're doing, and how well they're doing it. So if you don't have confidence in the intelligence community, if the gang of eight, which is a higher lever-- which is a little higher level than what we on intelligence are getting briefed on, then there's a concern. There's a concern there. I don't have that concern. When they come and tell me something, whether it's the C.I.A., F.B.I., N.S.A., I take it as gospel truth because they're doing their job. And they have cross-checked it before they give it to us. I have never detected one ounce of politicism. I can't tell one side or the other how they're favoring, if they're Democrats, Republicans, or whatever. So I don't know why there's so much skepticism, not believing what the intelligence community is telling you. I do, and I have found it to be extremely beneficial to me to make decisions with. JOHN DICKERSON: Do you see the skepticism - as you look at the administration, do you see skepticism simply from the president? Or do you see it from other members of the administration in terms of what we know now? Not necessarily, as Michael Morell mentioned, the building of a case. But what now seems to be the case what was now known in total about what the Russians tried to do? JOE MANCHIN: Well, what was known back in August and once it was verified and cross-checked should have been made public. It should have been made public, okay? That wasn't done. I can't second guess that. But I know that when-- at that time President Obama and his administration took action. And they took action basically on December the 29th ?and closed down two compounds, threw out 35 diplomats. We knew there was a serious problem. And it was verified. So I just can't understand why we don't go forward and put more sanctions. We've done that. Do you know we voted 97-2 to enforce more sanctions against Russia? 97-2. I've not seen that happen in any type of scenario in the Senate in a long time. So we're committed-- JOHN DICKERSON: Is that enough, senator? JOE MANCHIN: --to getting this done. You mean the sanctions? JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. Is that enough in response to-- JOE MANCHIN: We've got to - John, here is the thing. We've got oligarchs. There are certain people that benefit in the Russian sphere if you will. The oligarchs who basically feed Putin, they've got to be hurt without hurting the people. The people are hurting bad enough in Russia, and they're very skeptical of what's going on and all of the corruption goes on in Russia. Russia is not our ally. Russia is not our friend. And to treat Putin as an ally and a friend is wrong. I don't look at him as a friend. I don't look at Russia. And I am very skeptical of what they're doing, their intentions. There are a lot of good people in Russia that don't have any say whatsoever. And they're starting to basically express their frustration, and starting marching, and hopefully getting their point across. So we've got to make sure that we put the hurt on the oligarchs, all the money, the way the money flows through Russia, and the people that benefit by it. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator Manchin, we're going to take a very quick break, but stay there. When we come back, we want to talk about the Republican health care bill-- JOE MANCHIN: Of course. JOHN DICKERSON: --that is scheduled for vote next week. Stay with us. PART TWO JOHN DICKERSON: Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he'll bring the Senate Republican health care bill to the floor this week, just days after it was unveiled. The bill would end the individual mandate to buy health insurance and would reduce and eventually eliminate federal funding for the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, leaving it up to states to fill in that gap. It allows states to seek waivers so they can drop services currently required like maternity care, substance abuse benefits, and mental health treatment. It repeals taxes put in place to pay for Obamacare and also rolls back some tax credits currently given to help individuals by insurance. Senator Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, details his concerns with the Senate health care bill. Republicans need 51 votes to pass the bill or 50 if Vice President Mike Pence casts the tie-breaking vote. But five GOP senators say they can't vote for the bill in its current form, which is more than enough to kill it. Kentucky's Rand Paul summed up one side of the GOP opposition. VIDEO: RAND PAUL: I just didn't run on Obamacar-elite. JOHN DICKERSON: While Nevada's Dean Heller voiced another. VIDEO: DEAN HELLER: I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes insurance away from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans. JOHN DICKERSON: That means leader McConnell is going to have to find a way to change the bill to attract more votes from conservative members without losing too many moderates. Senator Manchin, I want to get your response just first to the bill and whether you think there's anything you can do to improve it. JOE MANCHIN: Oh John, there's an awful lot that can be done to improve it. And we've identified-- let's sit down. But we can't even get in the room. You know, if Mitch would just expand to a bipartisan working group to repair it and quit talking about repealing it, we'd have a pathway forward. I think we could fix it. There are some good people on both sides of the aisle that know it needs to be fixed. There is not one person in West Virginia that's not been touched by the bill that was sent by the House, which was horrible, and the bill they have now, which makes it even worse. So I've said, ""Work with me. Don't work against us."" They've proven they're going to need Democrats to pass this. And if Mitch doesn't have the votes, call off this bill right now. And let's sit down and start working toward repairing the basic concept of what we have in the Affordable Care Act. We're willing to do that, John. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you specifically, senator, though. On this bill and the theory that perhaps Senator McConnell is not likely to call the whole thing off. What in it do you think needs improvement? And is there any chance that it could be improved? JOE MANCHIN: Well, sure. First of all, the private market, John. You can't force people to buy a product, and then if they don't buy it, you fine them. And I knew that was a mistake from the get-go. I wasn't there in 2010 when they passed it. They did go through an orderly process. Everybody had input. At the end of the day, not one Republican voted for it. There should have been a way for us to sit down on, say, major pieces of policy such as this. And that's the reason for the purpose of the Senate having 60 votes for cloture, is to get bipartisan buy-in. Now they're going to get rid of it with not one Democrat. And, John, if they don't have me sitting down, someone who's in the middle, who wants to work with them to get good policy, they're in serious problems. The private sector needs to be fixed. The product and the market need to match up. John-- JOHN DICKERSON: Hast the-- JOE MANCHIN: --they expanded 20-- go ahead. I'm sorry. JOHN DICKERSON: Has the White House reached out to you at all in this process or Senator McConnell? JOE MANCHIN: No. Not yet. No. Some of my colleagues have. Susan Collins and I have been speaking about it. Bill Cassidy and I have spoken about it. And I told him. I said, ""If you can take repeal off the table, sit down, and talk about repair, and fixing what we have, and how to make it better, I'm in with you."" I said, ""We'll get more Democrats that will sit down."" And Chuck Schumer says if we can get a repair organization, a repair group sitting down, that's fine. So we're not hindered from our side whatsoever. But this is about our country. And it's about you have to have a policy to get your people healthier, get them in a productive workforce if you will. And we can do that by intervening. We've given 20 million people health care without one word of instructions. The people in West Virginia, the only health care they had before, the 175,000, John, was they had to go to the emergency room. Well, if you gave them now a health care card and they're still practicing the same procedures they did before, they're using at the highest cost. Can we help them be more and better as far as in tune to how to use it, better educated on how to use it? I'm sure there are synergies. But not just throwing them off. Why does it have to be so mean spirited? Why can't there be some compassion? Saying, ""Listen. Here's how you can keep it. Here's how you're going to use your health care. It's going to make you a better person. It's going to give you opportunities."" JOHN DICKERSON: All right. JOE MANCHIN: That's what we should be doing. JOHN DICKERSON: Okay, senator. We're going to have to leave it there. And we'll be back with two Senate Republicans to get their thoughts about the bill.

"WASHINGTON -- CIA Director Mike Pompeo says he thinks disclosure of America's secret intelligence is on the rise, fueled partly by the ""worship"" of leakers like Edward Snowden. ""In some ways, I do think it's accelerated,"" the former Kansas congressman told MSNBC in an interview that aired Saturday. ""I think there is a phenomenon, the worship of Edward Snowden, and those who steal American secrets for the purpose of self-aggrandizement or money or for whatever their motivation may be, does seem to be on the increase."" Pompeo said the United States needs to redouble its efforts to stem leaks of classified information. ""It's tough,"" Pompeo said. ""You now have not only nation states trying to steal our stuff, but non-state, hostile intelligence services, well-funded -- folks like WikiLeaks, out there trying to steal American secrets for the sole purpose of undermining the United States and democracy."" Besides Snowden, who leaked documents revealing extensive U.S. government surveillance, WikiLeaks recently released nearly 8,000 documents that it says reveal secrets about the CIA's cyber-espionage tools for breaking into computers. WikiLeaks previously published 250,000 State Department cables and embarrassed the U.S. military with hundreds of thousands of logs from Iraq and Afghanistan. There are several other recent cases, including Chelsea Manning, the Army private formerly known as Bradley Manning. She was convicted in a 2013 court-martial of leaking more than 700,000 secret military and State Department documents to WikiLeaks while working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. Manning said she leaked the documents to raise awareness about the war's impact on innocent civilians. Last year, former NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, of Glen Burnie, Maryland, was accused of removing highly classified information, storing it in an unlocked shed and in his car and home. Court documents say investigators seized, conservatively, 50 terabytes of information, or enough to fill roughly 200 laptop computers. Pompeo said the Trump administration is focused on stopping leaks of any kind from any agency and pursuing perpetrators.? ""I think we'll have some successes both on the deterrence side - that is stopping them from happening - as well as on punishing those who we catch who have done it,"" Pompeo said. In his first public remarks as CIA director, Mike Pompeo came out swinging at WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, accusing them of working... On other issues, Pompeo said: - North Korea poses a ""very real danger"" to U.S. national security. ""I hardly ever escape a day at the White House without the president asking me about North Korea and how it is that the United States is responding to that threat. It's very much at the top of his mind."" He said the North Koreans are ""ever-closer to having the capacity to hold America at risk with a nuclear weapon."" -Pompeo said U.S. national security also is threatened by Iran, which he described as the world's largest state sponsor of terror. ""Today, we find it with enormous influence, influence that far outstrips where it was six or seven years ago,"" said Pompeo, a former Republican congressman from Kansas. ""Whether it's the influence they have over the government in Baghdad, whether it's the increasing strength of Hezbollah and Lebanon, their work alongside the Houthis in Iran, the Iraqi Shias that are fighting along now the border in Syria -- certainly the Shia forces that are engaged in Syria. Iran is everywhere throughout the Middle East.""																																																																																																																					"
"Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, says Americans who are ""stupid"" enough to want to visit North Korea should be required to sign a waiver absolving the U.S. government of any blame if they're harmed while they are in the country. ""There should at least be a form for them to fill out that says, 'If I go to North Korea, I understand I am taking great risk, and I do not hold the American government responsible,'"" McCain said, a day after the death of American student Otto Warmbier. He says ""if people are that stupid that they still want to go to that country, then at least they assume the responsibility for their welfare."" U.S. college student Otto Warmbier died Monday, days after his release from North Korea. His parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, said in a statement that he died surrounded by loved ones at 2:20 p.m. on Monday. ""It would be easy at a moment like this to focus on all that we lost -- future time that won't be spent with a warm, engaging, brilliant young man whose curiosity and enthusiasm for life knew no bounds. But we choose to focus on the time we were given to be with this remarkable person,"" the family said in a statement. Warmbier was detained in January 2016 while visiting North Korea at the end of a five-day tour. He was later?sentenced to 15 years hard labor?for allegedly stealing a propaganda banner at his hotel. McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement on Monday that Warmbier ""lived the nightmare in which the North Korean people have been trapped for 70 years: forced labor, mass starvation, systematic cruelty, torture, and murder."" His statement also said?that the U.S. ""cannot and should not tolerate the murder of its citizens by hostile powers.""?

"Last Updated Jun 20, 2017 12:54 PM EDT North Korea will be at the top of the agenda next week when President Trump welcomes new South Korean President Moon Jae-in for a White House summit. In his first one-on-one interview since being elected, President Moon spoke to ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Norah O'Donnell and promised historic change.? ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Norah O'Donnell and South Korean President Moon Jae-in Here are the top takeaways from the interview: ""President Trump has called Kim Jong Un a madman with nuclear weapons. Do you believe that he is a madman? And why do you wanna talk to a madman?"" O'Donnell asked. ""Yes, I have already mentioned that I believe that Kim Jong Un is not a rational person. But I would like to also note that President Trump once even mentioned that he is willing to talk with Kim Jong Un over a burger. And he has another point, he mentioned that it would be an honor to be able to meet Kim Jong Un. So I believe President Trump went much further than I did."" ""So I believe what Kim Jong Un would want the most is to have a security guarantee for his regime,"" Moon added. ""So in the case if we can establish a peace regime on the Korean peninsula and if the relationship between the United States and North Korea can be normalized, then I believe that Kim Jong Un would not evade to coming out on such a path. So there is a possibility that Kim Jong Un continues to make the bluff with his nuclear weapons programs. But deep inside he is actually yearning or wanting dialogue. But in the end the only way to find out is to have a dialogue with North Korea."" ""I know you believe that the strategy of President Obama, which was strategic patience with North Korea, was a failure, yes?"" O'Donnell asked. ""Yes, I believe in in the end, you cannot deny the fact that strategic patience has failed,"" Moon said. ""And on the same note, I believe that we have no choice but to that we cannot deny the fact that the policies of the Lee Myung-bak administration and the Park Geun-hye administration had failed as well.""  ""I had the opportunity to have a telephone conversation with President Trump, and through that call I believe that I have been able to sufficiently build up a relationship of trust and friendship. And during the upcoming summit meeting, I would like to place an emphasis on further strengthening the friendship and trust with President Trump through frank and open discussions,"" Moon said. ""The two of us will be both in office and working together for the next five years. And the two of us also share the common goals of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, establishing a peace regime on the Korean peninsula, and building peace and security in Northeast Asia. So, if the two of us could pull together and accomplish these common goals, then I believe that this will be the most fruitful achievements that we can achieve during our terms in office. And I also believe that this will be the greatest diplomatic achievements for President Trump as well."" ""You believe that his greatest diplomatic achievement will be what happens here on the Korean Peninsula?"" O'Donnell asked. ""Yes, that is because President Trump has mentioned that North Korea was on the top of his priority list,"" Moon said. ""And also because this is something that all of the former U.S. administrations could not achieve. And so, I place a 每 I highly commend President Trump's placing such great importance on the North Korean nuclear issue, and I also believe that thanks to President Trump's approach and attitude, there is a possibility of resolving this issue."" ""One of your top advisers was just in Washington suggesting that you are considering scaling back South Korea's joint military exercises with United States. Is that true?"" O'Donnell asked. ""So I have seen through media reports that my special adviser made such comments,"" Moon said. ""Professor Moon, who is my special adviser, is not a permanent adviser. So my relationship with Professor Moon is rather informal. Professor Moon is an academic. And he continues to freely 每 be freely active as an academic. And sometimes when I need his assistance, I will ask him for his opinion on certain issues. And what he mentioned in Washington was his personal view."" ""And so I believe that there can be many opinions on how we will draw North Korea out to dialogue,"" he added. ""And regarding this I believe the professionals of both Korea and the United States have many differing views on how we will achieve this. But I believe that when it comes to the detailed strategy and tactics on how we will achieve this, this will be 每 have to be discussed and agreed upon during the summit meeting with President Trump. And I believe that we will need a very strong, close collaboration between Korea and the United States for this 每 for us to be able to achieve this with any effect."" ""Dialogue in itself is not the end. And I believe that we do not need dialogue for the sake of dialogue. And I have never mentioned a dialogue with no preconditions whatsoever. What I did say was that indicates that North Korea stops its provocations, its nuclear missile provocations, and shows enough will to freeze its nuclear and missile program, then we can begin dialogue -- yes,"" Moon said. ""Since we last had the six-party talks and since the September 19th agreement, a lot has changed. In particular, North Korea has further advanced its nuclear and missile capabilities. Therefore that I believe that it is realistically-- today it is very difficult for to achieve the complete dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear program in one shot. Therefore, I believe that first we must we must vie for a freeze of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. And then, as a second phase try to achieve the complete dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear program.

"A majority of Americans view both former Presidents Obama and George W. Bush favorably, according to a Gallup survey released Tuesday. How do the presidents of our era compare with those who came before? The poll found that 63 percent view Obama favorably and 59 percent view Bush in the same way, with Bush's favorability rating rising 7 percentage points over the last year. Just a few months after he left office in 2009, only 35 percent of the public viewed Bush favorably. Obama's current rating mirrors the rating Gallup measured for him during the last leg of his presidency -- from November of last year through this past January. The poll found that Obama is viewed favorably among all major demographic groups -- whites, nonwhites, men, women people of all ages. This comes as President Trump's approval rating takes a dip. A CBS News poll released Tuesday finds that 36 percent of the public approve of his job, down from 41 percent in late April. The poll surveyed 1,009 adults between June 7 and 11 with a 4 percentage point margin of error.?

"In the wake of Wednesday's shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Friday that politicians should take responsibility for their divisive rhetoric, but she emphasized that lawmakers strive for bipartisanship. In an interview on ""CBS This Morning,"" the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if the dialogue in Washington should be toned down and whether heated rhetoric contributed to the shooting. ""I think that we all have to take responsibility for what we say,"" she said. ""But do understand there's a lot where we try to continue to work together. It doesn't catch the headlines in the same way."" Warren, who's out with a new book called ""This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America's Middle Class,"" said she introduced three bills this week. She said she unveiled one of them with Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, which aims to increase pay for enlisted military servicemembers, and another one was introduced with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, which aims to give domestic victims of terrorism access to military hospitals. The Democrat, who's been rumored to be a possible 2020 presidential contender, slammed the Senate Republican leadership for having 13 of her male Republican colleagues meeting behind closed doors, without Democrats, to craft their health care bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. ""This is a bill that's going to touch every American family,"" Warren said. Senate Republicans have not yet released the text of their health care plan.

"Last Updated Jun 16, 2017 12:02 PM EDT WASHINGTON?-- The Pentagon is making plans to send additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan. While the number is currently expected to be between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, the number is still being worked on, reports CBS News' national security correspondent David Martin.? The decision by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis could be announced in the next several days or couple of weeks. It follows Trump's move to give Mattis the authority to set troop levels and seeks to address assertions by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan that he doesn't have enough forces to help Afghanistan's army against a resurgent Taliban insurgency. The rising threat posed by Islamic State extremists, evidenced in a rash of deadly attacks in the capital city of Kabul, has only fueled calls for a stronger U.S. presence, as have several recent American combat deaths. The bulk of the additional troops will train and advise Afghan forces, according to the administration official, who wasn't authorized to discuss details of the decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. A smaller number would be assigned to counterterror operations against the Taliban and IS, the official said. Chief Pentagon spokesperson Dana W. White said no decisions have been made.? ""Secretary Mattis has made no decisions on a troop increase for Afghanistan,"" White told CBS News in a statement. ""As he said throughout the week in testimony, the revised Afghanistan strategy will be presented to the president for his approval in the coming weeks. The president has delegated force management authority for Afghanistan to the secretary. The secretary will continue to follow the president's guidance on our overall strategy. Any decisions about troop numbers will be made only after consultation with the interagency, the Afghan government, NATO allies and coalition partners."" The Trump administration's strategy for Afghanistan was supposed to be finalized before the NATO meeting in Brussels, Belgium, last month. The Trump strategy is now expected to be complete by mid-July, as Mattis testified before Congress earlier this week. But the justification to lift the cap on troop numbers ahead of an actual strategy was that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's government was shaken by recent bombings in the country, and additional U.S. support will help stabilize the situation. The White House has dismissed the idea that U.S. domestic politics play a role in the timing of the timing of additional troops. President Trump was presented with the idea of allowing additional trainers on Monday, and signed off on it on Tuesday, in efforts to help out Ghani sooner rather than later. The president met with Ghani briefly in Saudi Arabia last month. There are currently no scheduled visits for Ghani to visit the White House, considered a snub by many Afghan officials, given that there are more than 8,400 U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan. Daulat Waziri, spokesman for Afghanistan's defense ministry was reluctant to comment on specifics Friday but said the Afghan government supports the U.S. decision to send more troops. ""The United States knows we are in the fight against terrorism, "" he said. ""We want to finish this war in Afghanistan with the help of the NATO alliance."" An Afghan lawmaker, Nasrullah Sadeqizada, however, was skeptical about additional troops and cautioned that the troop surge should be coordinated with the Afghan government and should not be done unilaterally by the United States. ""The security situation continues to deteriorate in Afghanistan and the foreign troops who are here are not making it better,"" he said. Although Trump has delegated authority for U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan, the responsibility for America's wars and the men and women who fight in them rests on his shoulders. Trump has inherited America's longest conflict with no clear endpoint or a defined strategy for American success, though U.S. troop levels are far lower than they were under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. In 2009, Obama authorized a surge of 30,000 troops into Afghanistan, bringing the total there to more than 100,000, before drawing down over the rest of his presidency. Trump has barely spoken about Afghanistan as a candidate or president, concentrating instead on crushing the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. His predecessors both had hoped to win the war. Bush scored a quick success, helping allied militant groups oust the Taliban shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, before seeing the gains slip away as America's focus shifted to the Iraq war. In refocusing attention on Afghanistan, Obama eliminated much of the country's al-Qaida network and authorized the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, but failed to snuff out the Taliban's rebellion. Mattis' deployment of more troops will be far smaller than Obama's. While military leaders have consistently said more forces are needed, a decision had been tied up in a lengthy, wider debate about America's long-term military, diplomatic and economic strategy for ending the war. Gen. John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander there, has said the troops are necessary to properly train and advise the Afghan military and perform work handled at greater cost by contractors. Afghan leaders endorse the idea of more U.S. troops, having lost significant ground to the Taliban in recent months. But despite repeated questions from Congress this week, Mattis wouldn't reveal his thinking on a troop increase. He said that while counterterrorism efforts in Afghanistan are making progress in weakening al-Qaida and IS, ""their defeat will come about only by giving our men and women on the ground the support and the authorities they need to win."" Obama set a cap a year ago of 8,400 troops in Afghanistan after slowing the pace of what he hoped would be a U.S. withdrawal. Nevertheless, there are at least another 2,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan not included in the official count. These include forces that are technically considered temporary even if they've been in the war zone for months. Trump's decision Tuesday to give Mattis authority to set force levels in Afghanistan mirrored similar powers he handed over earlier this year for U.S. fights in Iraq and Syria. The change was made public hours after Sen. John McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee's Republican chairman, blasted Mattis for the administration's failure to present an overarching strategy for Afghanistan. McCain said the U.S. is ""not winning"" in Afghanistan, and Mattis agreed. The finality of the decision isn't entirely clear. While Trump has handed over the troop level decision-making, there is nothing preventing him from taking it back. Mattis has repeatedly stressed that increasing the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan would take place within a broader, long-term strategy for stabilizing Afghanistan. In congressional testimony this week, he said the strategy will take into account regional influences, such as Pakistan's role as a Taliban sanctuary. Regional powers Iran, India and China, which all have political stakes in the fate of Afghanistan, also must be considered. While the new troops could raise fears of mission creep, Mattis told lawmakers this week he didn't envision returning to the force levels of 2010-11, when Obama thought he could pressure the Taliban into peace talks. Despite heavy losses, the Taliban fought on. ""Reconciliation"" remains the goal, Mattis told a House Appropriations panel Thursday, along with reducing Afghan government corruption. ""We're not looking at a purely military strategy,"" he said. ""All wars come to an end. Our job is to end it as quickly as possible without losing the very mission that we've recognized, through several administrations, that was worth putting those young Americans on the line for."" There have been almost 2,400 U.S. military deaths in Afghanistan since 2001. Three U.S. soldiers were killed and another was wounded in eastern Afghanistan this weekend in an attack claimed by the Taliban. CBS News' White House and Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Margaret Brennan contributed to this report.?

"Speaker Paul Ryan is claiming that it's ""easier"" having a Republican in the White House rather than a Democrat, despite some of the legislative challenges his party has faced so far this year. In a new interview on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends,"" the Wisconsin Republican was asked if it's not necessarily easier having President Trump in the White House. ""Oh, I think it's easier,"" Ryan said. ""It's easier but also it's exciting and it gives you optimism because you have a chance of doing things.""

"SALT LAKE CITY?-- Native American tribes and environmental groups preparing for a legal battle to stop President Donald Trump from dismantling Utah's new national monument face a tougher challenge than anticipated. Republican officials in the state who oppose Bears Ears National Monument asked Trump to rescind the designation. But U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended the monument be downsized instead, noting past presidents have tinkered with the boundaries of lands protected under federal law. Legal experts disagree on whether the 1906 Antiquities Act allows a president to reduce a monument, and it's something that has never been challenged in court. Environmentalists and Indian tribes were ready to pounce at the notion Zinke would recommend Bears Ears be abolished, armed with their belief that no president may undo the work of another by rescinding a monument, and the fact that no president has tried. But past presidents have trimmed national monuments and redrawn their boundaries - 18 times, according to the National Park Service. Bears Ears, established by President Barack Obama in December, is about the size of Delaware, covering roughly 2,000 square miles (5,300 square kilometers). It protects more than 100,000 archaeological sites on what's considered sacred tribal land in southeastern Utah. A largely GOP group of Utah officials wants the monument repealed and see it as an overly broad, unnecessary layer of federal control that closes off the area to energy development and other access. Republican state Rep. Mike Noel said shrinking a monument is politically and legally much easier to defend than attempting to undo one. ""There's been enough history of downsizing, even fairly large areas, significantly large areas,"" Noel said. Many times, past presidents reduced monuments only slightly, like when Franklin Roosevelt removed about 52 acres from Arizona's Wupatki National Monument in 1941 to make way for a dam. But occasionally the changes were drastic, like President Woodrow Wilson's move in 1915 to cut Mount Olympus National Monument roughly in half to open more land for logging. Environmental groups and others gearing up for a fight note that no president has tried to downsize a monument since the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act, which they say restricts a president's ability to do so. The groups also contend past presidents never faced court challenges for shrinking monuments. ""Whatever this administration does will certainly not go unchallenged,"" said Kristen Boyles, an attorney with the environmental group Earthjustice. Legal experts disagree on whether the environmental groups are right, but the court battle that's expected if Trump tries to cut down Bears Ears could significantly alter what's generally been a lasting protection from presidents. The 1906 Antiquities Act that gives presidents the power to declare monuments does not explicitly say whether a president can nullify a monument proclamation or shrink its boundaries. Donald J. Kochan, a professor of natural resources, property and administrative law at Chapman University in Orange, California, said the president's broad power to create a monument comes with an inherent ability to change a monument or undo it, just as presidents regularly undo other policies or regulations from past administrations. Mark Squillace, professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado-Boulder, disagreed. He said Congress controls public lands and it's significant that in passing the Antiquities Act, lawmakers spelled out only that the president can create a monument. Congress took care in other laws passed around that time, more than a century ago, to explicitly give the president powers to both act and undo acts, Squillace noted. He said the 1976 land policy law and congressional records of the law's drafting also make it clear that Congress didn't want to give presidents the authority to shrink or undo monuments. The question about whether the president has the power to shrink a monument ""is one of these big, lingering issues that's been out there for a long time,"" Squillace said. ""I think there's a very strong case against the president's authority to do this."" Lawsuits are expected from the Navajo Nation, groups like the Wilderness Society and Earthjustice, and even outdoor gear company Patagonia once Trump takes action on Bears Ears. That's not likely to happen until at least August, when Zinke finishes the president's request that he review 26 other monuments. Noel said he's working on legislation that will commit the state of Utah to intervening in the lawsuit to help defend the Trump administration's action. Representatives for Gov. Gary Herbert and Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, both Republicans, declined to say whether they'd join a lawsuit. Messages seeking comment from the Interior Department were not returned.																																																																																																																					"

The privately funded Arkansas monument had been in place outside the state Capitol in Little Rock for less than 24 hours before it was knocked from its plinth and smashed to pieces. Michael Tate Reed, 32, of Van Buren, Arkansas, was booked in the Pulaski County jail shortly after 7:30 a.m. on preliminary charges of defacing objects of public interest, criminal trespass and first-degree criminal mischief. An arrest report lists his occupation as ""unemployed/disabled."" Authorities did not know whether he had an attorney who could speak on his behalf, and a video arraignment was set for Thursday morning, a Pulaski County sheriff's spokesman said. A call to the number listed for Reed on a police report went straight to voicemail. Michael Tate Reed is seen in a police booking photo taken June 28, 2017, and provided by the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office in Arkansas. Arkansas Secretary of State's Office spokesman Chris Powell said a man drove through the statue around 5:15 a.m. on Wednesday while filming on his cellphone, CBS Little Rock affiliate KTHV-TV reports. Officials believe a Facebook Live video posted on a Michael Reed's Facebook account that depicted the destruction is authentic, Powell said. In the video, the sky is dark and the Arkansas Capitol's dome is visible. Music is heard followed by a female voice, likely on the radio, saying, ""Where do you go when you're faced with adversity and trials and challenges?"" The driver is then heard growling, ""Oh my goodness. Freedom!"" before accelerating into the monument. The vehicle's speedometer is last shown at 21 mph and then a collision can be heard. Arkansas' monument fell from its plinth and broke into multiple pieces as it hit the ground. The debris had been cleaned up by midmorning Wednesday. In an earlier video posted to the same account on Wednesday, a man who identifies himself as Reed discussed his religious beliefs. ""But one thing I do not support is the violation of our constitutional right to have the freedom that guarantees us the separation of church and state because no one religion should the government represent,"" the man says. A vehicle destroyed a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of Arkansas' Capitol on June 28, 2017, less than 24 hours after it was installed in Little Rock, Arkansas. Oklahoma County Sheriff's spokesman Mark Opgrande told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Reed was arrested in October 2014 in the destruction of Oklahoma's Ten Commandments monument at the state Capitol. Opgrande confirmed that the suspect arrested Wednesday in Arkansas was the same person arrested in the Oklahoma case. In a 2015 email to the Tulsa World, Reed apologized for wrecking Oklahoma's monument and said he suffered from mental health issues. ""I am so sorry that this all happening (sic) and wished I could take it all back,"" Reed said. The damaged remains of a Ten Commandments monument are gathered on the Oklahoma State Capitol grounds Friday, Oct. 24, 2014, in Oklahoma City. Arkansas' granite monument weighed 6,000 pounds. It was installed Tuesday morning on the southwest lawn of the Capitol with little fanfare and no advance notice. A 2015 law required the state to allow the display near the Capitol, and a state panel last month gave final approval to its design and location. ""Obviously, I'm very disappointed that someone would carry out an act of violence that's actually against the people of Arkansas,"" said Republican Sen. Jason Rapert, the state lawmaker who led the push for the monument. Rapert said he was confident he could quickly raise funds for a replacement. Travis Story, the general counsel of the American History and Heritage Foundation, which raised money for the monument, said the group has already ordered a replacement but that it would take a couple months. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who signed the legislation requiring the monument's installation, called its destruction ""very troubling."" ""Resorting to property destruction is never the answer to a policy disagreement,"" he wrote in a tweet. Resorting to property destruction is never the answer to a policy disagreement. Very troubling that a Capitol monument is destroyed. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee also took to Twitter after hearing about the incident. ""Some idiot in my home state broke all 10 commandments at the same time,"" Huckabee said. ""He wasn't Moses and it wasn't Mt. Sinai."" Some idiot in my home state broke all 10 commandments at the same time. He wasn't Moses and it wasn't Mt. Sinai. https://t.co/r8hXrJ32JZ The American Civil Liberties Union said Tuesday that it planned to file a federal lawsuit challenging the monument, calling it an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. Plans for Arkansas' monument sparked a push by the Satanic Temple for a competing statue of Baphomet, a goat-headed, angel-winged creature accompanied by two children smiling at it. Efforts to install that display, however, were blocked by a law enacted this year requiring legislative approval before the commission could consider a monument proposal. The Satanic Temple has vowed a lawsuit over the measure, and said it didn't believe the law should be applied retroactively to its proposal. Arkansas' monument is a replica of a display at the Texas Capitol that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005. After Oklahoma's monument was destroyed in 2014, a replacement was erected but then ordered removed by that state's Supreme Court, which determined its location on state property violated a constitutional prohibition on the use of state funds to support a religion. A statue of the Ten Commandments is seen after it was installed on the grounds of the state Capitol in Little Rock, Arkansas, June 27, 2017.

"Senate Republicans unveiled a ""discussion draft"" of their version of health care reform legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare Thursday morning, after setting aside the version of the bill the House passed last month.? With only a slim Republican majority in the Senate, any dissent in the GOP could lead to the failure of the legislation, known as the Better Care Act. Five Republican senators have already said they cannot vote for the legislation as it stands. The Senate bill appeared shortly after White House press secretary Sean Spicer and President Trump himself said the administration?wants a bill with ""heart."" Mr. Trump on Thursday said the bill will need ""a little negotiation, but it's going to be very good."" He said he is ""very supportive"" of the bill. Here is how the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, differs from the House's American Health Care Act?and how they both differ from what the Senate is offering.?																																																																																																																					"
"Democrats and left-leaning think tanks say Senate Republicans'?health care bill?would be disastrous for individuals and families on Medicaid, the federal program that provides health coverage to low-income Americans. But White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Friday said President Trump is ""committed to making sure that no one who currently is in the Medicaid program is affected in any way, which is reflected in the Senate bill, and he's pleased with that."" So, who is right? How would the Senate bill actually affect Medicaid and those who rely on the program for coverage? The Senate proposal wouldn't cut Medicaid spending in real dollars -- spending would continue to grow -- but it would slow the rate of spending for the program, phase out extra money the federal government has given to states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) and leave states to pick up more of the tab. One in five Tennesseans rely on Medicaid, including half of Tennessee children living in small towns and rural areas. One estimate says 37 more T... Medicaid -- not to be confused with Medicare, the health insurance program for older Americans -- covers roughly 70 million low-income people, pregnant women, disabled people and the elderly. The program is run by the states, which split the costs with the federal government roughly evenly. In 2016, Medicaid spending accounted for $368 billion out of $3.9 trillion in total federal spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Before Obamacare, the program did not cover able-bodied, childless adults. In the more than 30 states that opted to expand Medicaid under the ACA, eligibility for coverage became based solely on income, expanding eligibility to all Americans earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal poverty line for a family of four in 2017 is $24,600, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, meaning families earning up to $33,948 qualify for coverage in the states that expanded Medicaid. Under Obamacare, the federal government pledged to cover 100 percent of the costs for new enrollees in Medicaid expansion states until 2019, and 90 percent of costs after that.? The Republican bill in the Senate would completely phase out additional federal subsidies for those enrollees by 2024, reverting to the regular, federal-state matching rate applied to the traditional Medicaid population. But some states expanded Medicaid on the condition that they would rescind coverage for recent enrollees if the federal government decreased funding for the new population. This means that able-bodied, childless adults in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Washington could lose coverage much earlier under the Senate bill. A reduction in federal funding for newly qualified Medicaid recipients would leave expansion states with a difficult decision: drop new enrollees entirely, or pay a much larger share of the bill for their coverage. But the Senate bill, like the version of the legislation passed by the House in May, also fundamentally transforms the structure of Medicaid spending going forward. Currently, there is no cap on Medicaid spending -- states are guaranteed at least $1 in federal funding for every $1 they spend, and increases in federal funding are considered mandatory spending, rising automatically. Senate Republicans have unveiled a new health care plan that has some differences from the House version. The Senate bill would remove some taxes... The Senate proposal would cap annual increases on per-person Medicaid spending using the consumer price index for health care, or ""m-CPI,"" as a metric until 2025. Then, the annual per-person spending increases would be tied to the general consumer price index (""CPI-U""), which has a lower average rate of increase. The m-CPI is expected to increase about 3.7 percent per year over the next decade, compared to an expected annual increase of 2.4 percent per year for the general inflation rate. The difference may not seem like much, but the left-of-center?Urban Institute?estimates the difference between the two CPI rates could mean a $467 billion difference over 10 years. ? From a budget perspective, conservative think tanks?like the Heritage Foundation?say the cap in the Senate bill helps reform one of the federal government's fastest-growing programs. ? Instead of the per-person capita, states could also opt to receive Medicaid in block grants, or a set amount of annual spending that would also increase at the CPI-U rate. States would also be allowed -- not required -- to impose work requirements for Medicaid, although those requirements would not apply to pregnant women, the elderly or the disabled. The reduced federal funding for the new Medicaid population, and the restructuring of Medicaid funding entirely, will leave states to find a way to foot a larger proportion of the costs, or find ways to decrease coverage for recipients. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that, in the long run, the Senate bill would mean even lower federal spending on Medicaid than the bill passed by the House. Reducing Medicaid reimbursement rates for providers could also limit access to care. Many doctors already refuse to accept new Medicaid patients because the program's reimbursement rates are generally lower than private insurers and Medicare. In short, Medicaid funding under the Senate bill would still increase, but at a slower rate, and with states carrying a heavier burden. The bill would almost certainly mean reduced or no coverage for able-bodied, childless adults who are new to the program.? The Senate proposal would affect those currently on Medicaid, contradicting what Spicer said, although the full extent of the bill's effects may not be clear for years.

"WASHINGTON -- President Trump will host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday for his first dinner at the White House with a foreign head of state, rolling out the red carpet as the administration seeks to strengthen ties with India, a major defense partner and ally. The dinner will be the first meeting between Mr. Trump and Modi. Both are flamboyant, combative leaders who came into office promising economic reforms on a wave of nationalist support. ""I think these two leaders have a lot in common. For one, they are the world's two most followed political leaders on social media,"" a senior White House official said on Friday ahead of the meeting. ""They are both innovators and businessmen and committed to bringing greater prosperity to their people and thinking about innovative ways to do that. I think they are going to find a lot of common ground in their discussions.""? Just weeks ago, Mr. Trump hammered India when announcing the U.S. withdrawal from the?Paris climate agreement, slamming the country's participation in the accord as being ""contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.""? With the upcoming dinner, the White House says it hopes to restate its commitment to working with India on counterterrorism efforts, trade, and global cooperation in North Korea and Afghanistan. President Trump announced his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. Watch the CBS News Special Report. ""This visit is an opportunity to advance that trade dialogue that will enhance prosperity and create jobs for both countries,"" the official said. ""We believe a strong India is good for the United States."" The administration official would not comment on a $2-billion pending arms deal that would provide 22 naval surveillance drones to India. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., the company that makes the aircraft, announced Friday that the administration had approved of the sale, the first of its kind between the U.S. and a non-NATO country. ""We do take into account the regional situation,"" the official said of potential defense deals, adding that the administration wants to ""avoid a situation that escalates tensions"" between India and neighboring rival Pakistan.? ""Some of the defense systems we're talking about, we don't believe that they represent a threat to Pakistan,"" the official said. ? The official said the White House hopes to encourage a ""normalization of ties"" between the India and Pakistan through bilateral dialogue. The official also praised India's financial support for war-torn Afghanistan?-- Pakistan's neighbor to the west -- where India has pledged over $3 billion in aid and funded various infrastructure projects. The White House, which has deemed the final week of June as ""Energy Week,"" will also highlight the energy partnership between the U.S. and India, citing $42 billion in long-term contracts for the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Louisiana and Maryland. Energy Secretary?Rick Perry has prioritized efforts to review and approve LNG export terminals in the U.S.? American workers are losing jobs because of a law designed to help the job market. The H-1B visa lets companies recruit foreign talent for emergi... There are no plans to discuss the issue of H-1B visas, the skilled-worker program popular among many Silicon Valley companies. The official tried to downplay the likelihood the visas would be curbed, a move that could damage India's technology sector. ""There have been no immediate changes to visa applications and procedures, so we're not in position to prejudge what the outcome of that might be,"" the official said. ""There have been no changes as such and no specific changes that target any country or sector as of yet."" During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to end the H-1B program. In April, he signed an executive order directing federal agencies to review the program, saying H-1B visas ""should never, ever be used to replace American [workers]."" Ahead of Modi's visit, the White House dismissed the idea of a drifting relationship between India and the U.S. over Mr. Trump's budding relationship China, India's neighboring economic super power.

"Last Updated Jun 24, 2017 4:46 PM EDT President Trump appeared to acknowledge Russian involvement in the 2016 campaign while criticizing the Obama administration's response to a Russian interference campaign he has repeatedly denied took place. In a tweet Friday night, Mr. Trump wrote that President Obama ""knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia"" and ""did nothing about it."" Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY? Later in the day, after spending a few hours at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, Mr. Trump reiterated that sentiment.? Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T! Obama Administration official said they ""choked"" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary? The tweets came after Mr. Trump expressed similar criticism of his predecessor in an interview with Fox News. ""I just heard today for the first time that Obama knew about Russia a long time before the election, and he did nothing about it,"" Mr. Trump said in an excerpt of the interview, airing in full on Sunday. ""But nobody wants to talk about that."" The comments marked a rare admission by Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly declined to say definitively that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign. Asked on Friday whether Mr. Trump believes the Russians interfered in the election, White House press secretary Sean Spicer referred reporters to a January press conference in which Mr. Trump said ""I think it was Russia"" when asked about hacking. Congressional investigators and special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating possible collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials, inquiries the president has called a ""total scam,"" a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax."" ?? In an opening statement before his first press conference as president-elect, Donald Trump spoke about his ties to Russia, the upcoming inaugurat... The Washington Post reported in early December that the CIA had concluded that Russia's efforts were intended to boost Mr. Trump. On Friday, the Post reported the CIA arrived at that conclusion in August 2016 and presented its findings to Mr. Obama and a handful of senior aides. The agency determined Russian President Vladimir Putin had?personally directed Russian intelligence to ""defeat or at least damage"" Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, the Post said. However, Mr. Obama was wary of publicly accusing Russia of aiding Mr. Trump, fearing such an accusation would be seen as the White House trying to bolster Clinton's chances. The Post also revealed new details about the Obama administration's response to the Russian interference campaign prior to the election. ?Following the CIA's August report, Mr. Obama authorized ""planting cyber weapons in Russia's infrastructure, the digital equivalent of bombs that could be detonated if the United States found itself in an escalating exchange with Moscow,"" the Post reported. Administration officials briefed top members of Congress of both parties about Russia's actions in the weeks leading up to the election. Republican leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, questioned the underlying intelligence and warned against accusing the Russian government of aiding Mr. Trump in the weeks leading up to Election Day. Top intelligence chiefs released a statement in October 2016?publicly blaming Russia for an array of cyber attacks, including the release of stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee in July. The statement asserted the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that the efforts were ""intended to interfere with the U.S. election process,"" but stopped short of accusing the Russians of trying to help Mr. Trump win the election. U.S. intelligence agencies officially accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering Russian spies to help Donald Trump's presidential camp... The U.S. did not publicly accuse Russia of trying to aid Mr. Trump until January 2017, when U.S. intelligence agencies?released a declassified assessment on the Russian interference campaign. Before taking office in January, Mr. Trump received a classified briefing on the assessment from then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers. The briefing included classified details of Russian efforts to harm the Clinton campaign and bolster Mr. Trump. Following that briefing, Mr. Trump said Russia's efforts had ""absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election."" Current and former officials have repeatedly said the U.S. has no evidence of voting machines being compromised or tallies being altered.

"Last Updated Jun 23, 2017 8:03 PM EDT Last November, in addition to casting their votes for president, Maine voters considered a question proposing a three-percent surtax on income above $200,000. The revenue from this surtax would be earmarked specifically for supporting public education in the state. Maine voted yes on the question. However, in the state legislature, opposition to the surtax has left the Maine state budget in limbo, in standoff over the surtax. The Maine constitution allows for debate over ballot measures, and such a practice is not unheard of. If the legislature fails to come to an agreement on its budget before June 30 -- the end of Maine's fiscal year -- the state government will be forced to shut down. On June 21, the legislature voted to extend its session by five days to continue negotiating. Without the funding provided by the surtax, Maine would have to find another way to pay for education. It is unclear where such money would come from.? Education funding has long been an issue in the state. In 2003, Maine voters passed a referendum which required that the state provide 55 percent of operating costs for public education, but state lawmakers never appropriated the money.? ""Way back in 2003 was the first time a referendum came forward. The people voted and passed it but we never did get to it,"" says Senate Democratic Leader Troy Jackson. ""It's a long time frustration for the people in the state of Maine that education wasn't fully funded."" The 2016 measure passed with a small but present margin, 50.4 percent in favor and 49.6 percent opposed. But Republicans in the legislature, and even the state's governor, show no indication they'll honor the outcome of the referendum. Maine Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, said in April he'd start a campaign to convince voters that the measure was not in the best interest of the state, arguing the funds would be better used elsewhere. Since the election, Republicans and Democrats in the state have been unable to move beyond their stalemate. Both parties have expressed concerns over how the other side is confronting the budget crisis. Maine Senate President Michael Thibodeau, a Republican, was unavailable for comment. However, in an editorial published in May, he wrote ""It is clear that Maine voters want the state to spend more resources on education, but I refuse to believe that in doing so they wanted to punish Maine's small businesses and discourage investment in our state."" ""Republicans have been flat out they won't support a budget with that 3 percent in it,"" Jackson said. ""They just expect we're going to roll over and say, 'To hell with the people.'"" House Speaker Sara Gideon, a Democrat, assembled a six-member committee to try to bring the parties together. LePage joined the negotiations last week, but after a meeting on Tuesday, little progress had been made. Asked where things stood, Gideon replied ""The same."" Still, some progress appears to have been made. On Thursday, Maine House Minority Leader Ken Fredette, a Republican, said Republicans would offer $125 million to fund education, a step toward avoiding a shutdown. At the close of the legislative session, on July 1, Maine faces two possibilities: an agreement on a budget including some form of education funding or a shutdown. The only prior shutdown in the state occurred in 1991 and lasted for sixteen days. Only time will tell if this summer has a sequel in store.?																																																																																																																					"

"White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer is seeking a more strategic role that would give him a limited presence in the daily press briefings that have made him a prominent face of the Trump administration. A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle A senior administration official and three people familiar with the potential changes said Monday that Spicer has discussed taking a more senior communications role at the White House. The three people said he has reached out to possible successors at the podium and as communications director. The people spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations before a final decision is made. ""We have sought input from many people as we look to expand our communications operation. As he did in the beginning, Sean Spicer is managing both the communications and press office,"" said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a deputy White House press secretary. She declined further comment on the potential changes. Discussions about overhauling the White House communications office have been ongoing for several weeks, according to the senior administration official. Spicer's preference is to step away from the press briefings entirely, though other configurations have also been discussed. The White House has consulted an array of Republicans and Trump allies, including Laura Ingraham, the conservative radio host and political commentator. However, Ingraham is not expected to take the press secretary position. David Martosko, the U.S. political editor of London's Daily Mail, who covered the president's campaign, has also interviewed for senior communications jobs, according to a person familiar with the interviews who spoke on condition of anonymity. The possible changes for Spicer were first reported by Bloomberg News and Politico. Spicer's public role has already diminished in recent weeks. The White House has increasingly tapped Cabinet officials and other White House advisers to address reporters on camera and moved to take some of the daily briefings off cable television to keep the focus on Mr. Trump, who makes a habit of watching the televised performances. Spicer spoke Monday from the podium at an off-camera gaggle that barred broadcast outlets from using the audio of the question-and-answer session. Asked about the changes, Spicer said Mr. Trump had spoken before cameras during an Oval Office meeting with the president of Panama and would later make remarks in front of the media at an event with technology leaders. ""There are days that I'll decide that the president's voice should be the one that speaks and iterate his priorities,"" Spicer said. The White House has generally only used that rationale on days that the president has held a press conference or delivered a major speech. Spicer's briefings have been must-see TV during the start of the Trump era, beginning with his fiery, inaccurate claim that journalists wrongly portrayed the size of Mr. Trump's inauguration audience. He has been the subject of recurring skits by comic Melissa McCarthy on ""Saturday Night Live"" and his afternoon briefings have garnered strong ratings. In April the former Republican National Committee strategist apologized for making an ""inappropriate and insensitive"" statement comparing Adolf Hitler to Syrian President Bashar Assad by suggesting Hitler ""didn't even sink to using chemical weapons.""? Mr. Trump threatened in May to shut down daily press briefings and told Fox News Channel at the time that Spicer was ""doing a good job, but he gets beat up."" The possibility to further shake up the communications staff comes after?White House Communications Director Mike Dubke?announced his departure from the administration in early June.? Dubke wrote in a memo colleagues that his reasons for leaving were ""personal"" but that it had been a ""great honor"" to serve the Trump White House. ""It has also been my distinct pleasure to work side-by-side, day-by-day with the staff of the communications and press departments. This White House is filled with some of the finest and hardest working men and women in the American Government,"" Dubke said in a memo to staffers. CBS News' Major Garrett previously reported?that a change in the communications team was coming amid Mr. Trump's growing frustrations over the direction of his agenda and growing scrutiny over the ongoing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and Trump associates.? ""Things can't keep going the way they are,"" a senior Trump administration official told Garrett. As part of the White House's efforts to recalibrate,?Sanders took on a more visible role at the daily briefings the past few months.? Sanders acknowledged Spicer's less-frequent appearances in the briefing room following Dubke's exit, saying he would be ""taking on a little bit of extra duty.""

""The defenders of the status quo, and there are many of them, they're counting on us to lose our nerve, to fall back or to put this off altogether,"" cautioned Ryan. ""The cynics and naysayers are going to be out in full force. Do not be surprised."" Trump's tax overhaul at risk from pushback on import tax Tuesday's remarks built on themes raised the ""Confident America"" speech he delivered shortly after taking the role as House Speaker, where he made the case for permanent tax reform 〞 rather than a temporary tax cut. ""Temporary reforms will only have a negligible impact on wages and growth,"" said Ryan. He added that businesses need the ""certainty of permanent tax cuts"" to help plan for the future. Ryan supports a new tax on imports to help finance a lower overall tax rate for corporations, and to encourage U.S. companies to stay in the United States. The tax, however, has no support in the Senate and is vigorously opposed by retailers who worry that it will increase the cost of consumer goods. Moving toward a territorial system, Ryan argued, would help enable businesses to bring back cash ""stranded overseas"" without imposing a tax. Ryan said the current tax code has remained ""stuck in neutral,"" but applauded President Trump's principles for tax reform, which he says the House and Senate are currently working to turn into a ""transformational tax reform plan."" The Speaker chose the National Association of Manufacturers as the venue for the speech because, Ryan said, ""Few industries have demonstrated so much resilience or have as much stake in our economic debate as American manufacturing."" Republicans are planning to move a tax package using a procedural tactic that will require only a simple majority in the Senate 〞 preventing Democrats from blocking it. Under the procedure, the tax package cannot add to long-term budget deficits. That means that for every tax cut, there has to be an offset, at least over the long term. In order to take advantage of the procedure, Republicans in the House and Senate must pass a budget resolution. That won't be easy because Republicans disagree among themselves about spending levels for the military and for domestic programs. ""These are anxious times, we all feel it,"" noted Ryan. ""We are being tested, our capacity to come together and always move forward toward a better stronger nation is being tested."" The legislative calendar is also crowded with other challenging initiatives, among them, repealing and replacing Obamacare. The House has already passed a bill, but it was not well-received in the Senate. Ryan addressed the ongoing health care debate in Tuesday's remarks, saying lawmakers are currently engaged in ""nothing short of a rescue mission to bring relief to Americans struggling"" under the Affordable Care Act.? Congress is facing an Oct. 1 deadline to fund the government, and some time this fall, lawmakers will have to raise the debt ceiling or risk an unprecedented default.

"By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto President Trump's job approval rating has dipped in recent weeks, pushed down by negative reaction to his handling of the Russia investigations, and he's seen some slippage among Republicans as well. A third of Americans say his approach to the issue has made their opinion of him worse, and his handling of that matter gets lower marks than any of his others, like the economy or terrorism, for which he rates higher. Americans of all stripes do seem inclined to want to get to the bottom of things: most believe that the Special Counsel Mueller's investigation will be impartial, and that the president should not do anything to try to stop it -- a view that also runs across partisan lines. But divisions remain not only over what happened in the Russia matter, but whether it is serious or not. Most who approve of the President say it is not serious. Most Republicans feel the President is being criticized more than his predecessors and for some of them, that just makes them back the President even more.? At 36 percent, Mr. Trump's approval rating is now his lowest in CBS News Polls since becoming president. Fifty-seven percent now disapprove. The drop in the President's approval rating is partially due to ebbing support among Republicans. Seventy-two percent approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, a decline of eleven points since April. Historically, a drop-off in support among a president's own party is not unusual at times. There were points in Barack Obama's presidency when his support among Democrats dipped to a similar level. Of the issues on which Americans evaluated President Trump for this poll, they give the president his most negative marks on his handling of the Russia matter -- just 28 percent approve, while 63 percent disapprove. A third say the president's approach to this issue has made them think worse of him. Republicans approve of how Mr. Trump is handling the Russia issue, but in far lower numbers (at 57 percent) than their support for the job he's doing on the issues of the economy (80 percent) and terrorism (77 percent). Even as some in their ranks disapprove of how the President is handling the investigation, most Republicans don't think the issue is serious.? Just one in five Republicans thinks it is a critical security matter, and more than half call the investigations a political distraction that should be put aside. Even among Republicans who think it at least somewhat likely the Trump campaign had improper communications with Russia, just a third view the issue as critical to national security. More Americans say their opinion of Mr. Trump has grown worse, not better, because of his handling of the Russia investigations. Still, for most (including majorities of Republicans and independents), his approach to the issue hasn't caused their view of him to change. Most Americans (56 percent) believe that the special counsel's investigation will be impartial, rejecting any assertions to the contrary, and think that the president should not do anything to try to stop it. That view runs across partisan lines, as most Democrats and Independents think so, and Republicans are more likely to believe it will be impartial than not. Americans overwhelmingly feel the president should not try to stop that probe, with large majorities of Republicans, Democrats, and independents all in agreement. The percentage of Americans who thinks it is at least somewhat likely that Mr. Trump's campaign associates had improper contact with the Russian government has also risen a bit in recent months -- from 59 percent in March to 65 percent today. Movement here is driven primarily by Republicans: 40 percent now think it is at least somewhat likely that Trump associates had improper contact with the Russian government, up from just a quarter in March. More than six in 10 Americans now believe Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, an increase from March when only half believed this, but less than half think this interference was in order to help Donald Trump get elected.? Republicans are also more likely now than they were in March to think Russia interfered in the 2016 election (though most remain skeptical that it was in order to help the Trump campaign). By a margin of more than two-to-one, Americans think Donald Trump is more interested in protecting his administration from investigation (64 percent) than protecting the United States from Russian interference (30 percent).? Here, most Republicans break with Democrats and independents in defending the President, but one-third do feel the President is more concerned about his own Administration. The President disputed former FBI Director James Comey's account of their private meetings, and who Americans believe is driven by partisanship. Overall, most Americans (57 percent) believe Comey more.? Most Republicans (64 percent) believe the president -- though a quarter do not -- while Democrats (84 percent) and Independents (55 percent) believe Comey. A majority of Americans think at least something improper occurred in those meetings with James Comey, though just over a quarter think his actions rise to the level of illegality.? Most Republicans don't think the president did anything wrong at all. Majorities across the political spectrum are in agreement that President Trump has received more criticism than recent presidents. For most Republicans, that criticism doesn't lead them to question President Trump. A third of Republicans say it actually makes them more likely to support him, and for about half the criticism has had no effect on their views. ?This poll was conducted by telephone June 15-18, 2017 among a random sample of 1,117 adults nationwide.? Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA.? Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.

"By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto The public is unhappy with the performance of both parties in Congress. And the midterms are a long way off, but the Democratic Party has not persuaded Americans that things in the country would be any better if they were in control, instead of the Republicans who hold the majority now. Independents split on this idea, most Republicans (65 percent) not surprisingly think things would become worse, and even a third of Democrats don't think things would change. CBS News Poll, June 15-18, Margin of error: 4 pts. Republicans are only a little more positive about how their party in Congress is doing than Democrats are about their members. Neither side gets high marks from independents, or Americans on the whole. Some of Democrats' dissatisfaction with their own party is due to the feeling that congressional Democrats are not standing up to the president enough. Among Democrats overall, 45 percent disapprove of how Democrats in Congress are doing their job. But among Democrats who think Congressional Democrats aren't opposing Trump enough, 57 percent disapprove. Across the aisle, six in ten Republicans want to see congressional Republicans do more to help President Trump, but one-third say they're already doing the right amount.

"By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto As Republican leaders push forward to repeal and replace Obamacare, most Americans would prefer a public discussion take place in the Senate, feeling they don't have a good understanding of what the plans would do. From what they do know, or anticipate, by two to one, more believe the plans will hurt them rather than help them. And the bill passed recently by the House gets majority disapproval. Almost three quarters -- including most Republicans --?feel that Senate Republicans should discuss their health care plans publicly as they work on the bill. Republicans are, however, twice as likely as both Democrats and independents to endorse a private approach. Perhaps this is because most Republicans, Democrats, and independents agree they haven't heard enough to feel they have a good understanding of the Republicans' plans yet. Still looking for information, many start off as skeptical. Most Democrats and nearly a third of independents think the GOP health care plans will hurt them personally. More than half of Republicans anticipate no effect on them personally. Women and lower-income Americans are particularly likely to say they will be hurt personally by the plans. Few feel positively toward the bill recently passed by the House of Representatives. Overall, 32 percent approve of the bill, while 59 percent disapprove. Views are divided by partisanship. Meanwhile, most Americans would prefer that Congress improve the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it, including half of Republicans who don't want it repealed entirely. Overall, seven in ten say the law should either be kept in place or that it has some good things but needs changes to make it work better. Fewer than three in ten say Congress should repeal and replace it entirely. This poll was conducted by telephone June 15-18, 2017 among a random sample of 1,117 adults nationwide.?

"On Tuesday, now-HHS Secretary Tom Price's seat is up for grabs in Georgia's 6th Congressional District. He cruised to victory with a 23-point margin in November. The race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel could be considerably closer. Tuesday's election is a runoff, a result of the fact that no candidate won 50 percent of the vote in the April 18 jungle primary. Ossoff received 48.1 percent and Handel came in second with 19.8 percent in the 18-candidate field, including 11 Republicans, 5 Democrats, 2 independents. The election, which has become the most expensive House race in history, is being touted as a must-win for both parties, but it's not necessarily predictive of what's to come in the 2018 midterms. Polls close at 7 p.m. ET on Tuesday, but in-person early voting was open from May 30-June 16, and?over 140,000?cast early ballots -- including 36,000 who didn't vote in the April primary -- according to the Georgia secretary of State. In the primary, 192,000 voters cast ballots, including 52,000 early voters. The district, which consists of Atlanta's northern suburbs, comprises parts of Cobb, DeKalb and Fulton counties. The seat has been in Republican hands since Newt Gingrich won in 1978. Johnny Isakson, now a senator, replaced him in 1999, and Tom Price replaced Isakson in 2005. Republicans and Democrats are claiming victory in Georgia's special election as it heads to a June runoff. CBSN political contributor and Republi... President Trump won this district, which is considered solidly Republican, by a slim 1.5 percent in 2016. In contrast, Mitt Romney won it by 23 points. The?district?is 70 percent white, 13 percent black, and 13 percent Hispanic. The Cook Political Report has described the district ""as one of the wealthiest, most urban, and best-educated districts that voted Republican last fall."" The report also called it ""an outlier and rather unrepresentative of the larger House playing field."" Republican Karen Handel, 55, served as Georgia's secretary of State from 2007-2010. She resigned in 2010 to run for governor, losing a runoff to Nathan Deal, who went on to win the general election. Handel also ran for U.S. Senate in 2014 and came in third in the GOP primary. Outside of public office, she worked as vice president of public policy for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure from 2011-2012, resigning after Komen reversed its controversial move to cut ties with Planned Parenthood, a move that happened under Handel's watch. She has also served as chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, and deputy chief of staff to former Gov. Sonny Perdue. Democrat Jon Ossoff, 30, is a documentary filmmaker and a former Capitol Hill staffer, working for five years as a legislative aide, with a focus on national security, to Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Georgia.? This is his first run for political office. He also does not live in the district, a fact seized upon by Republicans, including President Trump, who tweeted about it on the day before the election. Ossoff is a staunch opponent of the GOP efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. He has run ads with a centrist fiscal message of cutting ""wasteful spending."" Because the district is traditionally Republican and conservative, an anti-Trump message has not been much of a priority for Ossoff during his campaign. Handel hasn't shunned Mr. Trump but she's hasn't exactly emphasized him in her campaign, either.? With regard to Mr. Trump's Russia controversy, she has said let's see ""where the facts take us"" but has also called the controversy ""noise."" On health care, she's been lukewarm on the GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, saying that the House bill isn't perfect. Handel is trying to sell herself as fiscally conservative and an ""independent"" while slamming Ossoff as too liberal for the district. Mr. Trump tweeted his support Handel on Monday, slamming Democrats' efforts to ""stop tax cuts, good health care and border security."" The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security.Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P's. Vote now for Karen H Between the Ossoff and Handel campaigns and outside groups, at least $40 million has been spent so far on this race. As of May 31, Ossoff had raised $23.6 million for the primary and runoff combined, a whopping $8.3 million for the primary and $15.3 million since. Republicans are loudly criticizing the fact that the vast majority of his campaign donations are from out of state. Handel has raised a total of $4.56 million as of May 31, but she has had way more help from outside groups. It's estimated that $12 million has been spent by outside groups on behalf of Handel with $6.2 million spent on ads by the GOP super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund being the largest share of that. Ossoff has been the beneficiary of $6.7 million from outside groups with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's $5 million outlay making up the biggest chunk of that total. According to IssueOne, a pro-campaign finance reform group that looked at filings with the Federal Election Commission, $59.6 million has been invested in the race so far by all candidates and political groups, including money that was spent during the primary process of the election. If Ossoff wins, it'll give heart to Democrats that the enthusiasm among Democratic voters and activists who oppose Mr. Trump can make a difference in midterm races, even in some Republican districts. Mr. Trump's opponents around the country -- Democrats and anti-Trump independents -- will have some proof that Mr. Trump can be a political liability and they'll get a huge lift in terms of energy and enthusiasm for recruiting candidates and for fundraising. However, if Handel wins, the deep divisions within the Democratic Party about which direction the party should go will surely be amplified. An Ossoff loss would hit Democrats hard, after his candidacy was fueled by so much cash and Democratic voter enthusiasm. And it would continue the party's winless streak in the 2017 special elections. The continuing battle between progressives and establishment Democrats would likely intensify. Even if Ossoff wins, that battle within the party will continue to rage, though it may be briefly tamped down as Democrats celebrate his victory. If Handel loses, the chatter about a negative ""Trump effect"" will likely rise to a fever pitch. Republican hand-wringing about how Trump's controversies and negative ratings will affect them in future elections will be in full force. Why? Again, it's mainly because this is a Republican district that has been held by Republicans for decades -- even though Trump barely squeaked by Clinton with a mere 1.5 percent margin in November.

"Personal information for more than 198 million American voters was left exposed this month after a data analytics firm hired by the Republican National Committee stored the files on an unsecured Amazon server. Deep Root Analytics, the conservative analytics firm, confirmed in a statement Monday the files had been accessed without their knowledge. ""The data that was accessed was, to the best of our knowledge this proprietary information as well as voter data that is publicly available and readily provided by state government offices,"" the company said in a statement. ""Since this event has come to our attention, we have updated the access settings and put protocols in place to prevent further access. We take full responsibility for this situation."" Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee also issued a statement saying they have cut ties to Deep Root Analytics. ""Deep Root Analytics has taken full responsibility for this situation and the RNC has halted any further work with the company pending the conclusion of their investigation into security procedures,"" the RNC said in a statement. ""While Deep Root has confirmed the information accessed did not contain any proprietary RNC information, the RNC takes the security of voter information very seriously and we require vendors to do the same."" A top-secret NSA report first published by The Intercept shows that Russian hackers were trying to access U.S. voter registration information jus... UpGuard cyber risk analyst Chris Vickery found the exposed server on June 12, notified federal authorities, and Deep Root Analytics secured the files against public access two days after they were discovered. Vickery discovered 1.1 terabytes stored on the cloud, that was fully downloadable and not password protected, according to a report published to UpGuard's website. ""Among these files were clear indications of the repository's political importance, with file directories named for a number of high-powered and influential Republican political organizations. As such, the exposed Deep Root Analytics warehouse contained a remarkable amount of fully accessible data,"" the report says. The server also contained data from conservative research firm TargetPoint, which helps candidates understand voter behavior. UpGuard says some entries rates voters on the likelihood of what policy, political candidate, and belief they will most or least likely support. This is far from Vickery's first major discovery of unprotected voter records. He was responsible for revealing 87 million exposed Mexican voter records in 2016 and finding U.S. databases online that included 18 million voter records, ZDNet reports. Still, UpGuard predicts that the massive breach will be topped sometime in the future with a ""far more damaging effect.""

"Last Updated Jun 20, 2017 12:35 AM EDT By Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus, Kabir Khanna and Anthony Salvanto Members of Congress are getting positive ratings for the way they responded to the shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, last week. President Trump gets slightly lower -- though still net positive -- evaluations for his response to the attack, partly because Democrats are less likely to approve of his handling than of Congress'. Fifty-three percent of Americans approved of Congress' response, and 29 percent disapproved, while 46 percent approved of President Trump's response, and 36 percent disapproved. And while Congress and many observers called for a more civil tone to political debate in the wake of the events, Americans of all political leanings overwhelmingly say that the tone and level of civility in our political debates has been getting worse in recent years. These views are largely the same across ideologies, too, as about two-thirds of liberals, conservatives and even more moderates feel things have gotten worse. Three-quarters of Americans feel the current tone of politics and debate is encouraging violence among some people; Democrats are especially likely to say so. About a third of Americans consider the recent shooting of a Congressman and others a terrorist attack. But importantly, Americans draw some distinctions between the political debate they decry, and the people themselves that hold opposing views. Most Republicans do not think of Democrats as threats to their way of life, but merely as people they disagree with on politics. Likewise, most Democrats feel the same about Republicans in this regard. There is a small core in each party, who do see other Americans across the political divide as threats to their way of life -- but they are not the majority. Given this, optimism still prevails, though not by a landslide. More believe that people of different political views are capable of working together than are pessimistic about the prospects.

"Illinois residents may feel some solidarity with the likes of Puerto Rico and Detroit. A financial crunch is spiraling into a serious problem for Illinois lawmakers, prompting some observers to wonder if the state might make history by becoming the first to go bankrupt. At the moment, it's impossible for a state to file for bankruptcy protection, which is only afforded to counties and municipalities like Detroit.? Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection could be extended to states if Congress took up the issue, although Stanford Law School professor Michael McConnell noted in an article last year that he believed the precedents are iffy for extending the option to states. Nevertheless, Illinois is in a serious financial pickle, which is why radical options such as bankruptcy are being floated as potential solutions.? Ratings agency Moody's Investor Service earlier this month downgraded Illinois' general obligation bonds to its lowest investment grade rating, citing the state's growing pile of unpaid bills and its mounting pension deficit. Illinois, by the way, has the lowest credit rating of any state. Lower ratings mean higher borrowing costs, since lenders view such borrowers as riskier bets. ""Legislative gridlock has sidetracked efforts not only to address pension needs but also to achieve fiscal balance, allowing a backlog of bills to approach $15 billion, or about 40 percent of the state's operating budget,"" the agency noted.? As noted by the Fiscal Times, Illinois is the only state that's been operating without a balanced and complete budget for almost two years.? ""We're like a banana republic. We can't manage our money,"" Gov. Bruce Rauner said after the Illinois Legislature failed to produce a full 2017 budget earlier this month. The situation has prompted comparisons with Puerto Rico, which earlier this year announced a historic restructuring of some of its $70 billion in debt through courts after negotiations with bondholders failed. Like Puerto Rico, Illinois has a massive pension crisis. Its unfunded pension liability for the state's five major plans grew 25 percent alone in one year, reaching $251 billion, according to Moody's. On a per-household basis, the state's pension debt burden stands at $27,000, according to the conservative-leaning Illinois Policy Institute.? So how did the state's pensions balloon into such a crisis? First, the pension problem has been a long time in the making. The state has more than 660 government pension funds, which are sometimes called defined benefit plans because they promise workers will receive a specific pension when they retire.? Some big jackpot winners in Illinois are in lotto-limbo until the state passes a budget. Lottery officials say the money is there to pay off jack... But critics say some of those pensions carried overly optimistic assumptions, especially given periods of market turmoil like the global financial crisis, which ate into investment returns. The state's general assembly wasn't required to fully fund pensions, which meant tax money was spent on other priorities such as schools or infrastructure.? The result? Growing unfunded liabilities, or money promised to workers in their pensions when they retire that the state doesn't have. Other contributing factors include inadequate employer contributions and benefit increases, according to the Civic Federation.? Adding to the state's financial pain is a shrinking tax base. For the last three consecutive years, Illinois has lost residents. Its population is now at its lowest in a decade. Tepid wage growth on top of fewer residents puts a strain on the state's ability to grow its tax revenue.? It's not unprecedented for a state to default on its debt. Arkansas defaulted in 1933 as it struggled to repay debt during the the Great Depression. Spending on an ambitious road-building project and a series of natural disasters heightened the Southern state's problems.? Bankruptcy is often seen as a last-ditch effort, but it also can help struggling cities or companies reinvent themselves on a stronger financial footing. Detroit serves an example of how a reorganization can help, at least in the near-term. The city is now paying its bills and is keeping up with maintenance, although it still has a looming pension payment that could spell trouble in just a few years, according to the Detroit Free-Press.? As Michigan Treasurer Nick Khouri told the publication, ""We certainly know many people were hurt during the bankruptcy, but what would have been the alternative and how would they have been hurt under the alternative?""? As for Illinois, Rauner on Thursday called state legislators to a 10-day special session starting next week to hammer out a budget deal and end an unprecedented impasse that could soon enter a third year. The Republican announced the news in a Facebook video and statement, accusing majority Democrats of ""ignoring"" his recommendations. ""We have tough, urgent choices to make, and the Legislature must be present to make them,"" he said. Lawmakers adjourned last month without a deal before a critical May 31 deadline, triggering the need for a three-fifths majority vote instead of a majority on a budget agreement. The new fiscal year begins July 1. Rauner has called for a special session running from June 21 to July 30.																																																																																																																					"
"Top Trump administration officials are affirming America's commitment to advancing Central America's economic prosperity -- despite a proposed budget that would cut U.S. efforts in the region by between 30 - 40 percent. ""Your success is our success,"" Vice President Pence told Central American leaders at a conference in Miami Thursday, which also included Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Tillerson echoed those sentiments, and said that what happens in the Northern Triangle directly impacts the security and economic interests of the U.S., and the region on the whole. Airlines may have overestimated Americans' desire to travel to Cuba after the Obama administration relaxed travel restrictions. In 2016, flights ... Tillerson described the leaders of the northern triangle countries -- Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras -- as committed and proactive. Direct U.S. aid was not a big topic of discussion. He praised them for their independence, for not approaching the U.S. ""with their hands out,"" asking the U.S. for government investment. Instead, the secretary said, they took a ""how do we act"" and"" what do we do"" approach to the discussions. The secretary of State also encouraged the countries to continue trying to curb corruption, minimize red tape that deters investment, and streamline tax codes. Doing so, Tillerson said, ""will improve the overall economic competitiveness of the Northern Triangle countries, and boost the willingness of private companies to invest in Central America."" Tillerson asked these governments to consider more private sector partnerships -- for instance, welcoming private companies' help in building up infrastructure in cities as urban populations grow. The conference was taking place just a day before President Trump was to make his own visit to Miami -- he's slated to talk about his Cuba policy, which is expected to roll back at least in part the Obama administration's opening of U.S. relations with Cuba. This U.S.-Central America conference, which was an idea generated by Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly during their trip to Mexico City, is an effort to further develop the relationship between the U.S. and the Central American countries. The Trump administration also hopes that this will also help mend the fractured U.S.-Mexico relationship. At the end of the day, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray commended the U.S. for putting together the gathering so quickly. This differs from circumstances of their last meeting, during Tillerson's and Kelly's first visit to Mexico. At that time, the relationship between Mexico and the U.S. was under strain. In the same week as their visit came an administration announcement that the U.S. immigration enforcement would be a ""military operation,"" threatening all illegal immigrants with deportation across the Mexican border. U.S. leaders are still stressing the need to secure the U.S. border. Pence promised that the U.S. ""will make sure our borders are closed to those who do us harm and the drugs who ruin our families."" Tillerson also referenced the need to drive down illegal migration when he spoke about the region's immense informal working sector -- reaching 70 percent of the labor force in 2016 -- and its repercussions. ""An important enabler is the support and the means for children to stay in school and continue their education, gain the basic skills that are necessary to participate in a more productive employment, thus providing a real alternative to stay home in their home country, rather than seeking their future through irregular migration,"" Tillerson said. Tillerson also sounded a theme he has mentioned before: the need for Americans to own the drug problem. Last month, he stood with Kelly, as they spoke about the need to propel forward a ""comprehensive drug reduction program in the U.S."" He explained that Americans are the reason for the high demand. The details of this commitment to driving down demand have yet to be announced but the effort is likely to have a positive impact on the U.S. relations with these countries who have often felt that they receive the full blame. The Northern Triangle leaders were focused on taking the opportunity to improve their countries' economic development prospects and developing their friendship with the U.S. The leaders also talked about the threats and opportunities in their region -- both of which would have repercussions for the U.S. ""A convulsing Central America, faced with a lack of opportunities and with violence, is a tremendous risk for the United States, Mexico and the region,"" said Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez. ""On the contrary, a prosperous and peaceful Central America is America's best investment in support of its people and, of course, a great investment for us.""? But some also wanted to demonstrate that their efforts are ongoing and preceded the conference. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said that his country has dismantled 92 criminal gangs in the last year, and he asked for support to continue taking Guatemala in the right direction. ""If we remain united, no one is going to devour us,"" Morales said.																																																																																																																					"
"James T. Hodgkinson, the man who opened fire Wednesday on members of Congress and aides practicing baseball, had preached his politics online but rarely in his public life, a longtime friend of Hodgkinson told CBS News' Dean Reynolds. Ray Page, who has known Hodgkinson for more than 30 years, said his friend didn't agree with the Republican party but that he never heard Hodgkinson make any specific threats. ""He was what I would call a staunch Democrat, but I never heard him say he was going to do any harm to anybody,"" Page said. ""It was his opinion -- it was a strong opinion and I knew better than to argue with him about it."" On Wednesday morning, Hodgkinson approached U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan near the baseball field and asked if the team playing was Republicans or Democrats, Duncan said. Duncan said he told him they were Republicans, and Hodginkson continued toward the field. Ray Page had known James Hodgkinson for more than 30 years. According to witnesses, Hodgkinson approached the fence by the third-base line and began firing, hitting U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, who was standing on second base. Teammates say Scalise dragged himself across the field leaving a trail of blood. Witnesses say it soon became a gun battle between the shooter and police.

"Last Updated Jun 16, 2017 2:53 PM EDT President Trump is expected to announce sweeping changes to U.S.-Cuba relations Friday, rolling back some key provisions in the Obama-era decision to open ease diplomatic and business restraints on the communist country.? The new Cuba policy will prohibit transactions with businesses controlled by the Cuban regime and will mean some Americans will now have to travel to Cuba as part of an organized tour group if they wish to visit, although many other categories of travel remain. All categories of travel to the island will be subject to an audit. The new policy will reiterate the importance of extraditing fugitives, according to senior administration officials who briefed members of the press Thursday. The changes won't end diplomatic relations with Cuba, re-establish the controversial ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy, or change the policy on how much rum, cigars and other popular products Americans can take from Cuba. It also won't change the status of the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay.? The changes won't go into effect until regulations are issued. That process will take about 30 days to initiate, and then, an unforeseen amount of time from there.? ""The president vowed to reverse the Obama administration policies towards Cuba that have enriched the Cuban military regime and increased the repression on the island -- it is a promise that President Trump made and it is a promise that President Trump is keeping,"" one senior administration official said during the briefing.? The administration argues restricting transactions with Cuban regime-controlled businesses, including many hotels Americans would normally stay in, will allow money to go directly to the Cuban people and not the regime. The State Department will create a list of hotels that don't violate that ban, although it's unclear how the ban will be enforced.? Nearly 300,000 Americans visited Cuba last year, but that's not as high as many expected. U.S. air carriers rushed to launch service to Cuba in A... The most significant change under the new policy, CBS News foreign affairs analyst Pamela Falk says, would be the end of the permitted individual travel called ""people to people,"" which Trump advisors, including Senator Marco Rubio, believe has been used to allow tourist travel. Falk says that by prohibiting transactions with businesses and hotels controlled by the Cuban military and security services, Mr. Trump is looking to economically squeeze the Castro government into reforms -- months before Cuban President Raul Castro is set to retire and at a time when human rights groups and dissidents in Cuba have reported a rise in arrests and abuses. ? The administration will consider benchmarks -- free elections, the release of political prisoners and direct pay for Cuban workers -- as progress that could eventually lead to the easing of the restrictions, according to the senior administration officials.? ""The president has made clear that he will look toward repressive regimes in this hemisphere,"" the same senior administration official said.?

"NEW YORK -- Former vice presidential nominee and Alaska governor Sarah Palin is accusing The New York Times of defamation over an editorial that linked one of her political action committee ads to the mass shooting that severely wounded then-Arizona Congressman Gabby Giffords. In the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court Tuesday, Palin's lawyers say the Times ""violated the law and its own policies"" when it accused her of inciting the 2011 attack that killed six people. The lawsuit refers to a June editorial in the Times on the recent shooting of Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise. The editorial was later corrected. Palin is seeking damages to be determined by a jury. A spokeswoman for the Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, says they haven't seen the lawsuit but will defend against any claim vigorously. Fact checkers backed up Palin's claim that the editorial was factually incorrect. ""We're glad to see this fixed in the editorial, but it's not a good sign that the debunked talking point was included as fact in the editorial of a major media outlet,"" the?Washington Post Fact Checker?wrote earlier this month.?

"Former President Barack Obama and his family wrapped up their five-day vacation on Indonesia's resort island of Bali and headed to the historic city of Yogyakarta on Wednesday during a nostalgic trip to the country where Obama lived for several years as a child. Obama, his wife Michele and daughters Malia and Sasha drove to a luxury hotel in downtown Yogyakarta after arriving on a private jet at the city's military airport, said Indonesian air force base commander Air Vice Marshal Novyan Samyoga. Samyoga was among local officials who greeted the Obamas at the tarmac. He said the family looked relaxed and was smiling in response to onlookers who greeted them with cheers. He said that Secret Service agents did not have special requests for the Obamas' activities on the main Java island, but about 650 Indonesian security forces were deployed to secure the family in Yogyakarta, an ancient city where Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, spent years on her anthropological research. Obama moved to Indonesia in 1967 at age 6 after his divorced mother remarried an Indonesian man. She stayed on after the marriage broke up, working as an anthropologist and development aid worker, but Obama returned to Hawaii when he was 10 to live with his grandparents. Obama and his family were seen on a river rafting as they vacationed in Bali on Monday. Local media reported that they also visited several tourist attractions, including a museum and rice terraces in Ubud, an arts and culture center amid hills and rice paddies. In Yogjakarta, the Obamas are planning to visit Borobudur, the 9th century Buddhist temple, as well as the Hindu temple of Prambanan during their two-day holiday, Samyoga said. President Joko ""Jokowi"" Widodo has invited the Obamas to visit the Bogor Palace in West Java during their nine-day trip in Indonesia. Obama is also scheduled to speak at an Indonesian Diaspora Congress in Jakarta on July 1.

"The White House has made the decision to keep the press briefings off-camera with increasing frequency, which means streaming and cable networks can't always show them live. This comes after months of high ratings for the briefings, usually conducted by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, or sometimes, his deputy Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Some networks, including CBS News, have since begun sending professional sketch artists to cover the briefings. This has lead to a series of courtroom-style sketches of Spicer addressing reporters, often in front of cameras that the White House forbids from being turned on. The press conferences are still on-the-record, which means reporters can quote from them freely once they are over. Tuesday was the first day in over a week that cameras were allowed to broadcast the briefing.? For the first time in eight days, press secretary Sean Spicer allowed cameras to record the White House press briefing. But Spicer couldn't answe... That's something of a matter of speculation, although Spicer has had some noteworthy bad days on the podium, such as the time he mistakenly insisted Adolf Hitler hadn't used chemical weapons. When asked by The Atlantic last week why the on-camera briefings were becoming less frequent, senior White House strategist Steve Bannon replied ""Sean got fatter"" -- presumably in jest. Yes and no. On camera press briefings only started in the 1990s, when Mike McCurry, President Bill Clinton's press secretary, started letting the networks televise them live. For what it's worth, McCurry now says this was a bad idea. ""The daily briefing has become less than helpful, and I bear responsibility for that because I let it become a televised event. It should not be,"" he told Politico late last year. Until the 20th century, presidential administrations tended to keep the press, which was often overtly partisan, at arm's length, and the position of press secretary didn't really exist until Herbert Hoover's presidency. Before that, relations with the media were a more informal affair, with one of the president's top aides tending to reporters, in addition to performing other duties. White House reporters themselves didn't really exist until The Washington Evening Post's William ""Fatty"" Price started hanging around the building in Grover Cleveland's second term. Other papers soon followed suit, sending their own reporters, who eventually had their questions fielded by a presidential aide. A look at President Donald Trump's cabinet and inner circle Theodore Roosevelt became the first president to really embrace a working relationship with the press, according to Time Magazine, regularly talking with reporters during his daily afternoon shave. The more reserved Woodrow Wilson, on the other hand, initially welcomed questions from the press only to find them ""irrelevant"" and ""tiresome,"" according to the White House Correspondents' Association. Wilson also held the first modern press conferences, although he would only answer questions off-the-record and refused to be quoted. Oddly enough, the famously taciturn Calvin Coolidge was much more accessible, holding 521 press conferences over his six years in office. ""I regard it as rather necessary to the carrying on of our republican institution that the people should have a fairly accurate report of what the president is trying to do, and it is for that purpose, of course, that those intimate conferences are held,"" Coolidge said in 1926, according to the White House Historical Association. Franklin Roosevelt loved talking to reporters, who were made readily available to him by press secretary Stephen Early. Roosevelt held over a thousand press conferences, according to the White House Historical Association 每 a record that stands to this day -- in a sense doing part of the job that we associate today with press secretaries. But it wasn't until Dwight Eisenhower took office that they were shown on television, albeit in packages -- essentially produced by the White House -- that edited out questions Ike's press handlers disliked, as Time Magazine wrote at the time. If anything, the opposite happened. Richard Nixon loathed the press, a feeling he made clear during his concession speech after losing the race for California governor in 1962, in which he lambasted the reporters in the room. And he's the reason we have a special press briefing room in its own separate building, which was once the White House pool. Nixon, who toyed with the idea of just abolishing the position of press secretary altogether, didn't like reporters hanging around the West Wing. So he just put a floor over the pool and had his spokesman, Ron Ziegler, deal with them there. The briefing room would later be named after James Brady, who was Ronald Reagan's press secretary until he was gravely wounded when a gunman opened fire on the president in 1981. Gerald Ford would later install another pool on the White House grounds, while the original press briefing room is now the office of the national security adviser.? Today, presidential press conferences are less common then they have been in the past, in part due to the more adversarial relationship between media entities and the White House. According to presidential scholar Martha Joynt Kumar, Barack Obama held only 79 press conferences, while George W. Bush did 89, Bill Clinton did 133, and George H.W. Bush did 143.?																																																																																																																					"

"INDIANAPOLIS -- A promise made before Christmas is fizzling before the Fourth of July. In December, then-President-elect Trump told hundreds of workers at the Carrier manufacturing plant that he had worked out a deal to save their jobs. But it's not working out that way. A steady downpour today did little to wash away the fact that the jobs of 600 union employees are going south. ""They're going to Monterrey, Mexico,"" said Robert James, president of the local union. Reynolds said he felt betrayed, since Mr. Trump told workers during his December visit to the plant that 1,100 jobs would be saved. President-elect Donald Trump celebrated the deal to keep jobs at a U.S. Carrier factory during a rally Wednesday night in Cincinnati. At the rall... ""And by the way, that number is going to go up very substantially as they expand this area, this plant,"" Mr. Trump said. ""So the 1,100 is going to be a minimum number."" Blasting companies for moving American jobs abroad was a feature of the Trump campaign, and saving the Carrier jobs was touted as a sign of Mr. Trump's bargaining prowess. ""You're going to have a good Christmas,"" he said at the plant. But the truth is that 400 of the 1,100 jobs Mr. Trump mentioned were white-collar positions that were never going away.? Only 700 union jobs were saved. Six hundred others will be lost, and Carrier is not paying a price. The company actually received a $7 million incentive package from Indiana to keep the plant open with a reduced work force. ""That is what he said was not going to happen,"" James said. ""That's what he told all of us."" ""And a lot of these people voted for Mr. Trump"" with the understanding that he would save their jobs, James added. Duane Oreskovic voted for the president, and is among those losing their jobs. ""I liked this job. This was a job that I actually wanted to retire from,"" Oreskovic said. ""It's not going to happen any more."" At the White House Friday, press secretary Sean Spicer said the job cuts here were long-planned and nothing new.?

"Unlike many of the larger-than-life characters who populate the world of professional sports, New York Jets owner Robert ""Woody"" Johnson IV avoids the media spotlight. That will be harder to do if the Senate confirms him as?U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, a post President Donald Trump nominated him for this week.? The 70-year-old billionaire, who has been active in Republican politics for years, will face many?challenges in his new job, including getting a trade deal with the U.K. done, which President Trump has called a priority. British Prime Minister Theresa May also faces pressure to cancel a state visit from the president following his criticism of London's mayor in the hours after the June 3 terror attack.? According to the American Foreign Service Association, to date the Trump Administration has named 15 ambassadors; of that number, 12 are political supporters of the president, and three are career foreign service officers.? One reason why deep-pocketed donors are often given plumb assignments in London, Rome and Paris is that the State Department's budget doesn't adequately fund the facilities and the gatherings they are expected to host. And Johnson certainly fits the bill. According to Forbes, his family fortune tops $6 billion. Here are five things to know about Johnson. He comes from money. Johnson is the great-grandson of one the founders of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), who also was named Robert Wood Johnson, though he has no role in the company's day-to-day management. When he was 18 in 1965, his father Robert Wood Johnson III was fired by his grandfather Robert Wood Johnson II. Within five years, both men were dead. Woody Johnson has also been active in the management of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. He's not exactly beloved by Jets fans. In 2001, Johnson bought the New York Jets for $635 million, outbidding fellow tycoon James Dolan for the once-storied NFL franchise that had fallen on hard times. The team hasn't fared much better in the years under his ownership, although Forbes now pegs the team's value at $2.75 billion. Johnson's effort to build a new stadium on the west side of Manhattan failed a few years ago following political opposition. According to the Jets, Johnson's brother Christopher will take over management of the team. ""The reactions I've been observing from fans has mostly been they are OK with him leaving,"" said Sean Deegan, founder and publisher of JetsInsider.com, in an email to CBSNews.com. ""He's owned the team for 17 years without a championship, so most fans are far from enamored with Woody Johnson. Maybe his brother can do better. I haven't seen anyone sad about this."" In this Jan. 5, 2017, file photo, New York Jets NFL football owner Woody Johnson speaks at the team's training facility, in Florham Park, N.J.? He's not afraid to show his quirky side. According to a 2010 New York magazine story, he likes to travel around New York on a scooter. ?He also once went on a cross-country motorcycle trip with Rolling Stone magazine founder Jann Wenner and actor Michael Douglas wearing a helmet with fake black hair streaming out the back. He's been an enthusiastic backer of Republicans for years. Especially Mr. Trump -- Johnson?contributed $100,000 to the president's Victory Fund and hosted a fundraiser at his East Hampton estate -- one of at least six fundraisers that he co-hosted. He's not the first NFL owner to land an ambassadorship.?If confirmed, Johnson would be the second NFL owner to serve as a U.S. ambassador.

"Last Updated Jun 24, 2017 6:21 PM EDT Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and his wife, Jane Sanders have hired prominent defense attorneys amid an FBI investigation into a loan Jane Sanders obtained to expand Burlington College while she was its president, CBS News confirms. Politico Magazine first reported the Sanders had hired lawyers to defend them in the probe. Sanders' top adviser Jeff Weaver told CBS News the couple has sought legal protection over federal agents' allegations from a January 2016 complaint accusing then-President of Burlington College, Ms. Sanders, of distorting donor levels in a 2010 loan application for $10 million from People's United Bank to purchase 33 acres of land for the institution. According to Politico, prosecutors might also be looking into allegations that Sen. Sanders' office inappropriately urged the bank to approve the loan. Burlington attorney and Sanders supporter Rich Cassidy has reportedly been hired to represent Sen. Sanders. And high-profile Washington defense attorney Larry Robbins, who counseled I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, is protecting Jane Sanders. Ms. Sanders' push for the liberal arts college's costly land acquisition was cited in a press release by the college when it shut down in 2016. Sen. Bernie Sanders delivered a commencement address to the 2017 graduating class at Brooklyn College, where he commented on the state of America... Brady Toensing of Burlington, the man responsible for the claims filed to the U.S. attorney for Vermont, was a chairman for the Trump campaign in his state. ""I filed a request for an investigation in January 2016 and an investigation appears to have been started right away,"" he said in an email to CBS News. ""It was started under President Obama, his Attorney General, and his U.S. Attorney, all of whom are Democrats."" ""My only hope is for a fair, impartial, and thorough investigation,"" Toensing added. Weaver told CBS News that Toensing's claim that Sen. Sanders used his influence to lobby for the loan is a ""political charge"" that is ""baseless"" and ""false."" And as for the claim that Ms. Sanders manipulated the loan application, Weaver ?said, ""The loan was approved by the financial board at the college."" Sen. Sanders, formerly mayor of Burlington, Vermont's largest city, regards the claims as a political game levied against him after his run for president in the 2016 primary election, a platform which has transformed the small-state senator into an influential voice in American liberal politics.

"WASHINGTON --?When U.S. officials entered shuttered Russian compounds in Maryland and New York last December, they found damaged materials that could have been used in intelligence gathering and that former officials say could have been useful in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.? The compounds, which had been used for decades as retreats for Russian diplomats, were shut down by the Obama administration as part of a package of punitive measures in response to Russia's meddling in the election. The White House expelled 35 diplomats, saying at the time they were targeted because of ongoing harassment of U.S. personnel in Russia.? But at least some of the 35 diplomats were kicked out because they were suspected of being involved in election-interference operations, according to one of the former officials. The Russians were given 24 hours to get out of the compound and 72 hours to leave the country. Current U.S. officials tell CBS News they vacated the compounds before the 24-hour deadline, striking some as odd and raising the question of whether the diplomats had been tipped off about their expulsion. New reports suggest President Trump could give Russian compounds back to Russia -- even though President Obama had ordered them closed because of... Among the destroyed materials discovered at the compounds were antennas, electronics, computers, file cabinets and other gear, according to a former official. Other material was missing. While the Russians would have been expected to destroy intelligence and equipment before leaving the country, the revelation raises the significance of the compounds in connection with Russia's election-interference operations.? In December, President Barack Obama said the compounds were ""used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes."" Current and former officials describe the facilities as significant listening posts and centers of intelligence gathering, backing up concerns that they were part of the election interference infrastructure. Last month, the Washington Post reported that the Trump administration was moving toward handing back the compounds. The Senate last week passed a bill in a 98-2 vote that would impose additional sanctions on Russia for its election activities. The measure includes a provision requiring congressional approval over any move by the administration to return the compounds back to the Russians.

My husband and I know he will be successful in this vital role within the White House.""

"WASHINGTON?-- Military chiefs will seek a six-month delay before letting transgender people enlist in their services, officials said Friday. After meetings this week, the service leaders hammered out an agreement that rejected Army and Air Force requests for a two-year wait and reflected broader concerns that a longer delay would trigger criticism on Capitol Hill, officials familiar with the talks told The Associated Press. The new request for a delay will go to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a final decision, said the officials, who weren't authorized to discuss the internal deliberations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Transgender servicemembers have been able to serve openly in the military since last year, when former Defense Secretary Ash Carter ended the ban, declaring it the right thing to do. Since Oct. 1, transgender troops have been able to receive medical care and start formally changing their gender identifications in the Pentagon's personnel system. Transgender people can now serve openly in the armed forces after a historic decision. Defense Secretary Ash Carter made the announcement Thursda... But Carter also gave the services until July 1 to develop policies to allow people already identifying as transgender to newly join the military, if they meet physical, medical and other standards, and have been stable in their identified genders for 18 months. The military chiefs had said they needed time to study the issue and its effects on the readiness of the force before taking that step. Officials said Friday that the chiefs believe the extra half-year would give the four military services time to gauge if currently serving transgender troops are facing problems and what necessary changes the military bases might have to make. The chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps discussed the matter with Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work on Thursday, officials said. Stephen Peters, spokesman for Human Rights Campaign, said the group is disappointed with the delay request. ""Each day that passes without implementing the final piece of this important policy harms our military readiness and restricts the Armed Forces' ability to recruit the best and the brightest,"" said Peters, a Marine veteran. ""There are thousands of transgender service members openly and proudly serving our nation today, and as they've proven time and time again, what matters is the ability to get the job done - not their gender identity."" Already, there are as many as 250 servicemembers in the process of transitioning to their preferred genders or who have been approved to formally change gender within the Pentagon's personnel system, according to several defense officials. According to several officials familiar with the matter, three of the four services wanted more time. In recent weeks, Navy officials suggested they would be ready to begin enlistment in July but asked for a one-year delay, largely to accommodate a request from the Marine Corps for more time, officials said. The Navy secretary also oversees the Marine Corps. The Army and Air Force wanted a two-year delay to further study the issue, said the officials, who were not authorized to talk about the internal discussion publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Officials said there was a broad recognition that allowing transgender individuals to enlist affects each service differently. They described the biggest challenge as the infantry. They said the discussions aimed at a solution that would give recruits the best chance of succeeding, while ensuring the services maintain the best standards for entry into the military. Service chiefs will also require that transgender recruits be stable in their preferred genders for at least two years, an increase from Carter's earlier plan to allow 18 months, the officials said. The chiefs also want to review the policy in a year to see how things are working, the officials said. Key concerns are whether currently enlisted troops have had medical or other issues that cause delays or problems with their ability to deploy or meet physical or other standards for their jobs. Military leaders also want to review how transgender troops are treated, if they're discriminated against or have had disciplinary problems, the officials said. Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate committee last week there have been some issues identified with recruiting transgender individuals that ""some of the service chiefs believe need to be resolved before we move forward."" He said Mattis is reviewing the matter. The military services have various ways of counting the number of transgender troops currently serving. The Pentagon has refused to release any data. But officials said there are 42 servicemembers across the Army, including the National Guard and Reserve, who have been approved to change their gender identities in the personnel system. At least 40 more are in the process of transitioning, they said. Officials said there are about 160 sailors in the Navy who are somewhere in the process of gender transition. That could include counseling, hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery. And about ""a handful"" of Marines have come forward to seek medical care involving gender transition, and there are possibly others going through the process with their commanders, officials said. The Air Force refused to release any numbers, and other officials did not know those details. A RAND study found that there are between 2,500 and 7,000 transgender service members in the active duty military, and another 1,500 to 4,000 in the reserves.

"Last Updated Jun 26, 2017 1:31 PM EDT More than a dozen leading health and medical organizations are speaking out in opposition to?the Senate's new health care plan to replace Obamacare. Those calling for the rejection of the bill include groups that represent doctors in a number of medical specialties who say it would harm their patients. The American Academy of Pediatrics says it opposes?the Republican plan because the youngest Americans would suffer, especially the poorest. AAP President Dr. Fernando Stein said in a statement, ""The bill fails all children by leaving more families uninsured, or without insurance they can afford or that meets their basic needs."" The Senate plan would dismantle the Medicaid programs that protect children's health, he said. ""This bill fails children living in or near poverty, children in foster care and children with complex health care needs whose parents have private insurance 每 all of these children depend on Medicaid, and if this bill passes, Medicaid will no longer be there for them."" The new health care bill will roll back the expansion of Medicaid, matching the House bill. CBS News chief congressional correspondent Nancy Cord... The American Medical Association, which has about a quarter-million members, issued a statement Monday opposing the legislation. In an open letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the physicians' group wrote:? ""Medicine has long operated under the precept of?Primum non nocere, or 'first, do no harm.' The draft legislation violates that standard on many levels. ... Though we await additional analysis of the proposal, it seems highly likely that a combination of smaller subsidies resulting from lower benchmarks and the increased likelihood of waivers of important protections such as required benefits, actuarial value standards, and out of pocket spending limits will expose low and middle income patients to higher costs and greater difficulty in affording care."" In an earlier statement Friday, AMA president Dr. David O. Barbe raised particular concerns about Medicaid cuts, saying, ""The AMA strongly opposes Medicaid spending caps, and we have grave concern with a formula that will not cover needed care for vulnerable patients."" American Lung Association national president and CEO Harold P. Wimmer said the bill falls ""woefully short of providing health care for the 32 million Americans living with lung disease,"" and that it should be rejected. ""The Senate bill will slash funding for our nation's Medicaid program, which provides coverage for 20 percent of Americans and 39 percent of children 〞 many of whom have asthma, COPD and other lung diseases,"" Wimmer said. Women's health would be at risk too, said Dr. Haywood Brown, president of The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Among other things, the bill would defund Planned Parenthood. ""ACOG is deeply disappointed,"" said Brown, warning that the Senate plan ""deliberately strips"" gains made in women's health under the Affordable Care Act and that it would severely limit access to care. ""If enacted, this legislation will turn back the clock on women's health. We are disturbed by the secretive method in which this bill was crafted, and by the Senate's exclusion of clinical and expert opinion from ACOG and other peer medical and health organizations. Despite numerous efforts to collaborate and provide input throughout this process, women's health expertise was rejected,"" said Brown, calling it ""reckless."" The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) said today it has ""grave concerns"" about the Senate's draft legislation. ACEP president Dr. Rebecca Parker said the bill ""makes sweeping changes to the health care system that directly contradict ACEP's principles and endanger patient safety and patients' lives."" The ""gutting"" of Medicaid will lead to millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans, she said. ""The inevitable consequence of people losing their insurance is increases in patient loads and crowding at emergency departments, which are already seeing record numbers of patients."" She added, ""We also have grave concerns that this bill does nothing to address the epidemic of opioid and drug dependence in the country, which led to a 99 percent increase in emergency department visits between 2005 and 2014."" The American Psychiatric Association (APA) also urged lawmakers to reject the legislation, which the Senate is expected to vote on before members head off for the July 4 recess. The Senate plan to replace Obamacare is already in danger. Right now Republicans do not have the 50 votes needed to pass their bill. Four of the ... ""The Senate proposal represents a significant move in the wrong direction, resulting in fewer people having access to insurance, fewer patient protections, and less coverage for essential behavioral health care,"" APA CEO and medical director Dr. Saul Levin said in a press statement. He urged the Senate to ""start again on a health care bill that puts patients first."" The Association of American Medical Colleges said it's ""extremely disappointed"" by the Senate bill, which it said would leave only skeletal health care plans for many. ""Despite promises to the contrary, it will leave millions of people without health coverage, and others with only bare bones plans that will be insufficient to properly address their needs. As the nation's medical schools and teaching hospitals see every day, people without sufficient coverage often delay getting the care they need. This can turn a manageable condition into a life-threatening and expensive emergency,"" the group said in a statement Thursday. AARP, the nonprofit interest group for older Americans which claims 38 million members, called on senators to reject the new bill, which analysts say would jack up insurance prices for seniors. AARP called it an ""Age Tax."" ""AARP is adamantly opposed to the Age Tax, which would allow insurance companies to charge older Americans five times more for coverage than everyone else while reducing tax credits that help make insurance more affordable,"" AARP executive vice president Nancy LeaMond in a statement. The group also decried cuts to Medicaid and Medicare, and took umbrage at the way it was crafted out of the public eye. ""This new Senate bill was crafted in secrecy behind closed doors without a single hearing or open debate 〞 and it shows,"" LeaMond said.

"Last Updated Jun 23, 2017 4:49 PM EDT Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada became the fifth Senate Republican on Friday to announce opposition to the Senate Republican health care plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, putting the legislation's passage in jeopardy ahead of a vote next week. ""This bill, that's currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer. It's simply not the answer,"" Heller said at a press conference in Las Vegas with Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican. ""I'm announcing today that in this form, I will not support it."" Heller said he can't support a piece of legislation that likely would take away health care coverage from millions of Americans and tens of thousands of Nevadans. As a result of his opposition, pro-Trump organization America First Policies is launching a TV ad against Heller, CBS News has learned. Heller is up for re-election in 2018. He is considered the most vulnerable Republican senator running next year, and a high-profile Democrat is reportedly set to challenge him: Nevada Rep. Jacky Rosen. ""It's going to be very difficult to get me to a yes,"" Heller said Friday. He added, ""You have to protect Medicaid expansion states. That's what I want,"" however, he acknowledged that changing the bill in order to do that is ""going to be a very difficult lift"" because of the conservative senators who are against the Medicaid expansion. Sandoval agreed with Heller, saying, ""The current bill as written is something that needs to change."" Sandoval was among a number of Republican governors who opted into a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Before he made that decision, Sandoval said Friday that his state's uninsured rate stood at 24 percent. Now, he says that only 11 or 12 percent of Nevadans are uninsured. Before the expansion, he said 18 percent of children were without health insurance. ""We're now at 8 percent,"" Sandoval said Friday. Hours after text was revealed Thursday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, announced with three other Senate Republicans that they opposed the bill in its current form because it doesn't go far enough in repealing President Obama's health care law. Three ""no"" votes would put the bill's passage in jeopardy. Republicans actually need 51 votes to pass the legislation, but one of them can be Vice President Mike Pence's tie-breaking vote. Taking that into consideration, and assuming all Democrats vote against it, Republicans can only afford two defections. The Senate currently has 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats.

"Last Updated Jun 19, 2017 9:26 PM EDT CBS News has learned that U.S. officials are increasingly concerned about the possibility of terrorists targeting commercial airliners. An official with knowledge of the threat says it is evolving rapidly, and more terrorists are gaining the knowledge necessary to build a laptop bomb. U.S. intelligence officials tell CBS News that terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and ISIS have been perfecting and testing a bomb small enough to... In March, CBS News confirmed that terrorist groups have been perfecting and testing a bomb that can be hidden in a laptop computer and can evade security scanners. Since March, those concerns have not diminished. ?In fact, it's just the opposite. With the pace of terrorist attacks picking up pace in Europe, U.S. law enforcement officials grow increasingly worried about the capabilities of terrorist organizations to carry out attacks on what al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) see as one of their top targets -- commercial aviation. CBS News has learned that DHS efforts to reach out to airlines and airports globally about a possible laptop ban may be leading to enhanced security. A source with knowledge of the negotiations with stakeholders says the possibility of a laptop ban is already prompting new airport security measures in some places, while others are now considering changes. Publicly, U.S. officials insist the possibility of a laptop ban is very real. DHS Secretary John Kelly is still said to be leaning in that direction, while pressing for other upgrades to security. ?A lot hinges on the evolving threat. The Trump administration is watching developments in Europe closely, knowing that as ISIS is ""squeezed"" in Syria and in other and in other places, it is at the same time sending trained individuals to countries where travel to the U.S. is easier.

"It's time to ask whether the attack on the United States Congress Wednesday was foreseeable, predictable and, to some degree, self-inflicted. Too many leaders, and political commentators, who set an example for us to follow have led us into an abyss of violent rhetoric which, it should be no surprise, has led to violence. Wednesday was not the first time. In December last year, a man with an assault rifle stormed into a Washington-area pizzeria to free child sex slaves whom Hillary Clinton was holding there -- or at least that's what political blog sites had said. He fired into a locked door to discover no children in chains. Sen. Bernie Sanders has called the president the ""most dangerous in history."" The shooter on Wednesday was a Sanders volunteer. You might think that no sane person would act on political hate speech, and you'd be right. Trouble is, there are a lot of Americans who struggle with mental illness. In February, the president tweeted that the news media were the ""enemy of the American people."" The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! Later, at a lunch for reporters, President Trump was asked whether he worried that language would incite violence. His pause indicated it had never crossed his mind. Then he said, ""No, that doesn't worry me."" As children we're taught, ""Words will never hurt me."" But when you think about it, violence almost always begins with words. In ""Twitter world,"" we've come to believe that our first thought is our best thought. It's past time for all of us -- presidents, politicians, reporters, citizens, all of us -- to pause to think again.

"Last Updated Jun 16, 2017 7:24 AM EDT The Democratic and Republican congressional baseball teams proceeded with their annual game to benefit charity Thursday night under the lights at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., only 36 hours after a shooter unleashed gunfire at a GOP team practice. The Democrats won the game, 11-2. Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania, his team's manager, accepted the trophy, then gave it to his GOP counterpart, Rep. Joe Barton of Texas, to put in Scalise's office on behalf of the Democrats. After accepting it gracefully, Barton cracked, ""Next year we won't be so nice."" The Congressional Baseball Game for Charity -- usually a low-key event that draws about 10,000 people -- had sold more than 20,000 tickets and raised more than $1 million for charity as of Thursday afternoon, according to organizers. That's about twice much as the event raised last year. The stadium projected a rare sense of unity in Washington, as members of both parties rallied together after the shocking shooting that left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) in critical condition. U.S. Capitol Police officer David Bailey, who was wounded in the shooting while protecting members of Congress, threw the first pitch. Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) greets Director of the Office of Management Mick Mulvaney before Democrats and Republicans face off in the annual Congressional Baseball Game at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., on June 15, 2017. A huge ovation came from the crowd, which swelled to a record 24,959, when Special Agent David Bailey, one of the Capitol Police officers injured in the attack on Republicans at their ball practice in Virginia, threw out the first pitch. ""ONE FAMILY,"" proclaimed a sign in the crowd. The announcer's mention of Scalise, the House majority whip who was critically wounded in the attack Wednesday, brought the masses to their feet. Scalise remained listed in critical condition Thursday night after multiple surgeries, though word came from the hospital during the game that he had improved. ""In Washington we have our disagreements, but we all agree that we are here to serve this nation we love, and the people who call it home,"" President Trump said in a video address to the crowd. The?annual congressional baseball game?dates back to 1909, and Republicans and Democrats since then have each won an equal number of games -- 39. The event has always been a chance for Democrats and Republicans to put partisan politics aside for one night -- but especially so on Thursday. Tonight's #CongressionalBaseballGame is about standing together against violence. I'll be thinking about my wounded colleagues as we play. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that on Thursday night, everyone will be ""Team Scalise."" Scalise has always taken the game very seriously, according to his Capitol Hill colleagues. U.S. Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-Louisiana), who visited Scalise in the hospital Thursday, said that on a recent foreign trip he and Scalise took, 90 percent of their conversations were about the game.

"Last Updated Jun 15, 2017 5:12 PM EDT MOSCOW (AP) -- Wading into the furor surrounding the investigations of the Trump White House, Russian President Vladimir Putin used a national call-in show Thursday to disparage what he called U.S. ""political infighting"" that is blocking better relations with Russia. The Russian leader even sarcastically offered political asylum to fired FBI Director James Comey. Putin reaffirmed his denial of allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that the Kremlin meddled in the 2016 U.S. election, saying that Russia has openly expressed its views and hasn't engaged in any covert activities. He also tried to turn the tables on the U.S., saying it has sought to influence Russian elections by funding nongovernmental organizations as part of its aspirations for world domination. ""Turn a globe and point your finger anywhere, you will find American interests and interference there,"" he said. Putin also likened Comey to Edward Snowden, a contractor who leaked thousands of secret documents from the National Security Agency and has been living in Russia since being granted asylum in 2013. ""It sounds and looks very weird when the chief of a security agency records his conversation with the commander-in-chief and then hands it over to media via his friend,"" Putin said. ""What's the difference then between the FBI director and Mr. Snowden?"" he asked. ""In that case, he's more of a rights campaigner defending a certain position than the security agency chief."" On an acerbic note, he added that if Comey ""faces some sort of persecution in connection with that, we are ready to offer political asylum in Russia to him as well."" The remarks reflected Putin's frustration with the investigations into alleged links between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia. The inquiries have dogged the White House, shattering Moscow's hopes for improving ties with Washington. CBS News chief Washington correspondent and ""Face the Nation"" anchor John Dickerson joins CBSN to discuss the next steps in the Russia investigat... He called the allegations a reflection of ""exacerbating political infighting."" On a conciliatory note, Putin added that Russia still hopes for normalization of ties with the U.S. ""We don't see America as our enemy,"" he said. He said Moscow and Washington could cooperate to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and pool efforts to tackle the North Korean nuclear and missile problem. The two countries also could cooperate on global poverty and preventing climate change, he said, adding that the U.S. remains the essential player on climate despite Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris accord. Moscow also hopes that the U.S. could play a ""constructive role"" in helping settle the Ukrainian crisis, he said. During the tightly choreographed show, Putin said the country has climbed out of recession despite ongoing Western sanctions, adding that the restrictions have forced Russians to ""switch on our brains"" to reduce dependence on energy exports. He deplored the U.S. Senate's decision Wednesday to impose new sanctions as yet another attempt to ""contain"" Russia, but he insisted that such measures have only made the country stronger. The Senate voted to punish Moscow for the alleged election meddling by approving a wide-ranging package of sanctions that target key sectors of Russia's economy and individuals who carried out cyberattacks. The bill follows several rounds of other sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the European Union over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its support for pro-Russia insurgents in eastern Ukraine. Putin argued that Russia has done nothing to warrant the Senate move, calling it an ""evidence of a continuing internal political struggle in the U.S."" Tens of thousands rallied Monday across Russia to protest official corruption, heeding a call by opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He was detained outside his home in Moscow before the protest and was sentenced to 30 days in jail for staging an unsanctioned rally. More than 1,750 were detained nationwide and scores received jail terms and fines.

"WASHINGTON -- President Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for political consulting work he did for a Ukrainian political party, acknowledging that he coached party members on how to interact with U.S. government officials. Manafort says in a Justice Department filing Tuesday that his firm, DMP International, received more than $17 million from the Party of Regions, the former pro-Russian ruling party in Ukraine, for consulting work from 2012 through 2014. Manafort is the second member of the Trump campaign to register as a foreign agent. In March, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn registered with the Justice Department for work his consulting firm performed for a Turkish businessman that he said could have aided the Turkish government. Both registrations came after the work had been completed. Manafort helmed Trump's campaign for about five months until August and resigned from the campaign immediately after The Associated Press reported on his firm's covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's ruling political party. He is one of several people linked to the Trump campaign who are under scrutiny by a special counsel and congressional committees investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign and potential coordination with Trump associates. House Intelligence Committee members are arguing over President Trump's unproven claim that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Mr. Tr... Manafort has denied any coordination with Russia and has said his work in Ukraine was not related to the campaign. The Washington Post first reported Manafort's registration and posted a copy of his filing online Tuesday. The filing does not bear the date and time stamps showing that it has been formally received by the Justice Department's FARA unit. But Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni confirmed to several news outlets that Manafort had gone through with the registration. Maloni did not respond to phone calls or emails from the AP seeking comment. His registration came more than two months after Maloni told the AP that Manafort would be registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Maloni later backed off that statement, saying in late April that Manafort was still considering his options after receiving guidance from the Justice Department. Under federal law, people who represent foreign political interests and seek to influence U.S. public opinion and policy are required to register with the Justice Department before they perform any work. Manafort's registration comes more than three years after he completed his work. The Justice Department rarely prosecutes violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Instead, as in Manafort's case, the department often work with lobbyists to get in compliance. Manafort deputy, Rick Gates also registered for the Ukrainian political work. Gates also served in the Trump campaign. He could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday evening. In the filing, Manafort said that his company's work was mostly focused on domestic Ukrainian politics as part of its work for the Party of Regions, which was led at the time by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The filing repeatedly states that Manafort's firm worked ""to advance the goal of greater political and economic integration between Ukraine and the West."" Manafort's firm also acknowledged that it had some involvement with a Brussels-based nonprofit called the European Centre for Modern Ukraine, saying that it provided ""advice"" to the entity. Last August, the AP reported that emails show that Manafort's firm and Gates directed the efforts of Washington lobbying firms that were working on behalf of the center. The emails show Gates directing lobbyists from Washington firm Mercury LLC to set up meetings between a top Ukrainian official and senators and congressmen on influential committees involving Ukrainian interests. Gates also had the firms gather information in the U.S. on a rival lobbying operation and directed efforts to undercut sympathy for Yulia Tymoshenko, an imprisoned rival of Yanukovych. Both of the lobbying firms involved in the work- Mercury and The Podesta Group - have since registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents.

""If, however, Mr. Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price."" The Pentagon gave more details Tuesday about its warning to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, saying the U.S. had spotted activity in Syria at an aircraft shelter at Shayrat airfield known to be associated with chemical weapons, as CBS News' David Martin has reported. Shayrat airbase is where U.S military struck with cruise missiles earlier this year, after Assad -- U.S. officials believe -- unleashed a deadly chemical weapons assault from the base.? Macron and Mr. Trump have differed on some areas of international policy and intervention -- such as the Paris climate agreement -- but the two are keeping communications lines open, as Tuesday's call evidenced.

"WASHINGTON -- President Trump tried to make nice with the press Tuesday afternoon, hours after assailing CNN on Twitter. ""So I'll ask the press to leave. I greatly appreciate you folks being here. We love you very much. You're very kind and very understanding,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Wow, CNN had to retract big story on 'Russia,'"" Mr. Trump wrote early Tuesday. ""What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!"" Wow, CNN had to retract big story on ""Russia,"" with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS! CNN retracted and apologized for an online story linking former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci with a Russian bank. The network also announced the resignations of three employees. Scaramucci accepted the network's apology, but deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders pounced. ""We've been going on this Russia-Trump hoax for the better part for a year now with no evidence of anything,"" Sanders said Tuesday. ""America is frankly looking for something better. They're looking for something more, and I think they deserve something better from our news media."" Last year a Gallup poll found that only 32 percent of Americans had a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. Among Republicans, the number was 14 percent. But the White House has credibility issues of its own. The New York Times has accused Mr. Trump of saying something false every day for the first 40 days of his administration. ""There is simply no precedent for an American president to spend so much time telling untruth,"" the Times reported last week. ""He is trying to create an atmosphere in which reality is irrelevant."" Brian Karem Brian Karem of Sentinal newspapers vented his frustrations with the Trump press team on Tuesday. ""What you just did is inflammatory for people all over the country who look at it and say see once again the president is right and everybody else out there is fake media, and everybody in this room is trying to do their job."" The White House tried to use the CNN story to brand all Russia-related news as phony. But, what's not phony: two congressional investigations and a special counsel probe into the matter.

"China is now ranked as one of the worst offenders of human trafficking in the world, according to the State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, which was unveiled by Secretary Rex Tillerson and Ivanka Trump on Tuesday. Tillerson called China out for not taking ""serious steps to end its own complicity in trafficking."" In past years, China has been labeled with tier-2 status, but now they have the lowest tier-3 rank, alongside countries like Syria, Russia and Iran. This happened partially because of their reluctance to clamp down on North Korea's forced labor enterprises, which feed the regime's illicit funds. Tillerson noted that there are 50,000 to 80,000 North Korean workers worldwide, and many are in China and Russia.? But the State Department also says that ""forced labor in China is not one-dimensional,"" noting that the Chinese government has been complicit human trafficking in cases where drug rehabilitation facilities are detaining people. It also said Chinese men and women have been forced into labor, and that children are working in factories. The tier system is based on a government's handling of human trafficking, and tier 3 countries can be subject to sanctions, although the White House has not yet made a determination about whether sanctions would be put on China. Tillerson and Ms. Trump both emphasized the necessity of combatting human trafficking for national security reasons. Tillerson said that when state actors or non-state actors use human trafficking it can ""become a threat to our national security,"" specifically in the case of North Korea being able to collect illicit funds from human trafficking. He also noted that trafficking ""breeds corruption, undermines rule of law, erodes the core values that underpin a civil society."" Advocates combating prostitution and human trafficking have called for a more enlightened, modern approach to addressing the issue: arresting cus... Tillerson and Ms. Trump rolled both emphasized the necessity of combatting human trafficking for America's national security interests. Tillerson said that when state actors or non-state actors use human trafficking it can ""become a threat to our national security"" because it ""breeds corruption, undermines rule of law, erodes the core values that underpin a civil society."" Ms. Trump echoed that sentiment in saying that taking on human trafficking is in America's moral and strategic interest. ""Ending human trafficking is among the top priorities of the Trump administration,"" Ms. Trump said. She also commended activists who have worked to combat the issue worldwide. Ms. Trump called human trafficking a ""profoundly secret crime,"" and noted a personal connection to the cause because she is a mother. She referenced meeting with victims in Rome earlier this year and the need to keep the victims at the table. Ms. Trump spoke about eight individuals that State who honored Tuesday as part of the unveiling, calling them heroes and sources of inspiration. Boom Mosby, an advocate for child victims of sexual abuse in Thailand who founded Hope Understanding and Grace (HUG) Project, was one of the individuals recognized for their work by the State Department. In an interview with CBS news she explained that her organization has done significant work with the FBI and US Department of Homeland Security to drive down child sex tourism. Being honored by the State Department gave her even more credibility in being the ""light and the voice for victims,"" Mosby said. On the job for less than six months, Tillerson started off the event in showing that he has done his due diligence on this issue. This is now the 17th annual State Depatment report on human trafficking, and he held up the first report from 2000. He read a portion from its preamble and noted that with these reports the hope to serve as a tool with the ultimate goal of preventing individual victimization. ""It is our hope that the 21st century will be the last century of human trafficking,"" Mr. Tillerson said. ? Tillerson also noted a few success stories, such as a Philippines' investigation into 500 trafficking cases that led to 272 arrests. The theme of the report this year is increasing criminal accountability of human traffickers. In a letter at the top of the report, Susan Coppedge, the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, writes of the importance of protecting victims that are forced to take criminal acts as a result of being trafficked. ""Victims should not be further punished by the very system meant to protect them; and when they are, their convictions should be expunged and they should receive support and the comprehensive services to which they are entitled,"" she writes. The report also looks at countries that recruit children soldiers. This year's report adds Mali to the list of and takes off Iraq, Burma and Rwanda. It says that the Malian government provided ""some in-kind support"" and in some cases collaborated with a militia that uses child soldiers. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch pushed back on the removal of Iraq and Burma. ""Tillerson?reportedly overruled?his own staff and US diplomats to take Burma and Iraq off the list this year. His decision flies in the face of evidence that both governments are still complicit in child soldier use, and undermines US leverage to influence change. The US provides Iraq with billions of dollars of military assistance each year; in exchange, it should insist the government put an end to child recruitment by its units. Instead, the State Department isn't even acknowledging Iraq has a child soldier problem,"" wrote Joe Becker, the advocacy director of the children's rights division at Human Rights Watch. The State Department stood by their decision in noting that the countries have made strides towards removing children from service.? The countries that remain on the list of child soldier enablers are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Everyone who spoke at the event encouraged continued work. ""Everyone has a role to play and an obligation to act. We must choose to do something to end modern slavery,"" said Ambassador Coppedge.																																																																																																																					"
"Since taking office in January, President Trump's actions and policies have had an impact on opinions of the United States around the world. In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center among 37 countries, a median of just 22 percent are confident that Mr. Trump will do the right thing regarding international affairs. The international community had greater trust in his predecessor -- 64 percent expressed confidence in former President Barack Obama's global diplomacy capabilities. Of the nations polled, trust in Mr. Trump's leadership has declined sharply among allied nations in particular. The survey shows that Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands have lost the most confidence of any countries in the president's ability to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs. The only two countries to gain confidence in this area were?Russia and Israel. Not only has the world stage become increasingly critical of Mr. Trump himself, but its opinion of the United States as a whole has shifted as well. At the end of the Obama era, 64 percent held a positive view of the United States. After the early days of Mr. Trump's time in office, this number has dipped to just 49 percent favorability. Although there is a clear shift in international opinion, the majority of the 37 countries surveyed do not believe that the relationship between their own country and the United States will change during the Trump presidency. The survey also focused on five key policy promises made by Mr. Trump during his campaign for the White House: pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, a travel ban on people immigrating from majority-Muslim nations, removing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord, withdrawing support from major trade agreements and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. ? Of these policy proposals, the border wall received the least approval among the countries surveyed-- an overwhelming 76 percent disapprove of the physical barrier between the United States and Mexico. Those surveyed also had a strong response to his personality. The most popular character trait used to describe Mr. Trump personally was ""arrogant,"" with 75 percent choosing this word to label him. The second most popular characteristic was ""intolerant"" at 65 percent. The least selected characteristic for the president was ""caring about ordinary people,"" which came in at 23 percent.?

"A New Jersey mom says she posted her 3-year-old son's heart surgery bill online to show how potential changes in the health care law could drastically increase out-of-pocket costs for those with life-threatening conditions. Ethan Chandra in the hospital Ali Chandra's son, Ethan, was born with a congenital heart defect known as heterotaxy. He's already had multiple surgeries which have been covered by health insurance. ? ?? Chandra is concerned that the existing ban on lifetime benefits caps 〞 meaning insurers can stop paying expenses once medical bills reach a specified limit 〞 may be eliminated as part of the ongoing health care law overhaul. ? ?? ""A lifetime cap on benefits is the same as saying, 'Sorry, you're not worth keeping alive anymore. You're just too expensive,"" she wrote in a Twitter post on Friday. Many on Twitter responded empathetically to her post. Chandra, a married registered nurse who also has a young daughter, recently posted the bill for Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. The family's share was $500, but she said it would have cost them $231,115 if they didn't have insurance. It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. pic.twitter.com/pyUE2UxbWW ? ?? Chandra wrote that her son has undergone four heart surgeries overall and will need more going forward. They also make regular visits to numerous doctors and must make emergency room trips for sepsis workups if his temperature rises above 100.4 degrees. Ethan also takes five different prescription medications multiple times a day. ""I'm not sitting here telling you that the ACA [Affordable Care Act] is perfect; it's not,"" Chandra told CBS News. ""When I say, 'I'm thankful for Obamacare,' what I mean is＃ I'm thankful that there's a set of laws that tell the insurance companies, 'Look, this is what you need to cover.

"Ohio Governor John Kasich and Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper joined forces on Tuesday to urge Senate Democrats to call for a re-write of the Republican health care bill before they come to a vote by the end of this week. ""The bill the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) did an analysis of is really not acceptable to me in terms of being governor,"" said Kasich at the National Press Club. Kasich said while he feels the bill is ""inadequate"" in addressing the needs of millions of Americans who stand to lose coverage under the Better Care Reconciliation Act, he called on Democrats to work constructively with Republicans to come with a sustainable solution. ""They can improve this bill even if they have to start over again, these Democrats should stand and challenge Republicans to negotiate with them,"" said Kasich. He added, ""People of good intent can sit down and fashion a solution and begin a discussion on rising health care, it can be done and should be done in a bipartisan way. This is not good enough to shove this in a closet somewhere because there are big challenges."" Kasich said when encountering criticism over his lack of party loyalty on the issue, ""No one should think I have any joy in working against the leadership of my party."" He added, ""My job is to be intellectually honest and that's what intend to do."" Meanwhile, Democrat Hickenlooper applauded Kasich's ""courage"" to stand up to Republicans, saying the health care debate ""isn't a political discussion, it's a moral issue."" ""The fact that the Senate is going to do a bill in secret in a short period of time and try to sell the notion that this is an improvement of health care is a bad joke,"" said Hickenlooper. The governor said in his state alone, 188,000 people, more than half in rural areas, would see negative impacts by the bill, many losing coverage as a result. ""Governor Kasich and I won't agree on everything, but agree we've got to control the rise in health care costs on all levels,"" said Hickenlooper. Hickenlooper echoed Kasich's suggestions for bipartisan action on a new version of the bill, which he recommended would take 6-8 months to complete.?

"WASHINGTON?-- The Supreme Court has almost certainly decided what to do about President Donald Trump's travel ban affecting citizens of six mostly Muslim countries. The country is waiting for the court to make its decision public about the biggest legal controversy in the first five months of Trump's presidency. The issue has been tied up in the courts since Trump's original order in January sparked widespread protests just days after he took office. The justices met Thursday morning for their last regularly scheduled private conference in June and probably took a vote about whether to let the Trump administration immediately enforce the ban and hear the administration's appeal of lower court rulings blocking the ban. The court's decision could come any time and is expected no later than late next week, after which the justices will scatter for speeches, teaching gigs and vacations. Exactly when could depend on whether there are justices who disagree with the outcome and want to say so publicly. It might take time for such an opinion to be written - and perhaps responded to by someone in the majority. It takes five votes to reinstate the ban, but only four to set the case for argument. Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's nominee who was confirmed in April, is taking part in the highest-profile issue yet in his three months on the court. The case is at the Supreme Court because two federal appellate courts have ruled against the Trump travel policy, which would impose a 90-day pause in travel from citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, said the ban was ""rooted in religious animus"" toward Muslims and pointed to Trump's campaign promise to impose a ban on Muslims entering the country as well as tweets and remarks he has made since becoming president. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the travel policy does not comply with federal immigration law, including a prohibition on nationality-based discrimination. That court also put a hold on separate aspects of the policy that would keep all refugees out of the United States for 120 days and cut by more than half, from 110,000 to 50,000, the cap on refugees in the current government spending year that ends Sept. 30. Trump's first executive order on travel applied to travelers from the six countries as well as Iraq, and took effect immediately, causing chaos and panic at airports over the last weekend in January as the Homeland Security Department scrambled to figure out who the order covered and how it was to be implemented. A federal judge blocked it eight days later, an order that was upheld by a 9th circuit panel. Rather than pursue an appeal, the administration said it would revise the policy. In March, Trump issued a narrower order, but it too has been blocked. The justices have a range of options. They could immediately allow the administration to stop travel from the six countries and hear arguments on the administration's broader appeal in October. That's the path the administration has urged. But the 90-day ban will have run its course by then, and there might be little left for the court to rule on. The government has said the ban was needed to allow for an internal review of the screening procedures for visa applicants from the six countries. That too should be complete before the Supreme Court reconvenes for its new term on October 2. The administration also could issue a new ban that includes more countries or is permanent, or both. That might make the current case go away and also could give rise to new legal challenges. The high court also might keep the ban on hold, but set the case for argument in October. This course might be palatable both to justices who object to the ban and those who don't like the breadth of the lower court rulings against the president. But it also could mean that a new policy is in effect before the court ever hears the case. The justices also could keep the ban from being reinstated and, at the same time, decline to review the lower court rulings. That outcome would essentially end the case. One barrier to that option could be that the court usually likes to have the last word when a lower court strikes down a federal law or presidential action.

It also includes new protections against retaliation for workers who file complaints with the VA general counsel's office, and shortens the process for hiring new employees to fill a workforce shortage at the VA. ""Our veterans have fulfilled our duty to this nation and now we must fulfill our duty to them,"" Mr. Trump said.? ""Many veterans died waiting for a simple doctor's appointment,"" the president added, bringing up the VA wait time scandal that emerged in 2014. ""What happened was a national disgrace, and yet some of the employees involved in these scandals remained on the payrolls. Our dated laws kept the government from holding those who failed our veterans accountable. Today we are changing those laws."" Mr. Trump in April signed an executive order to create the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within the VA, intended to weed out bad employees and outdated policies that keep them there. This legislation empowers that office, Mr. Trump said. The Trump administration has also launched a website that shows wait times at VA facilities.? Retired Marine Sgt. Maj. Ray Mackey lost both legs in Afghanistan and has spent years battling to get proper care from the VA. He finally got so ... The VA has been a particularly scrutinized department ever since 2014, when reports -- made possible by whistleblowers within the VA -- revealed some veterans died after being placed on long and hushed-up waiting lists. But the increased focus on the VA has also revealed a number of misbehaving VA employees, as well as insufficient laws and policies in place to reprimand or remove them for violating ethical or legal standards.? ""There's nothing more demoralizing to our workforce and to our veterans than when the VA is forced to take employees back who have deviated from those values,"" Shulkin said.? Last month in a press briefing, Shulkin said that under the current process, it takes a minimum of 51 days for an action by a manager to suspend, demote or remove an employee to take effect. In recent years, employees accused or convicted of misconduct who return to work have made splashy headlines.? An employee at a VA facility in Memphis, Tennessee, returned to work after three DUI convictions, Shulkin noted.? Another employee at a VA facility in Puerto Rico was involved in an armed robbery, but returned to work as a clerk at the facility after pleading guilty to two misdemeanors.? Shulkin also referred to a psychiatrist at a facility in Puerto Rico who was seen on video watching pornography while with a patient and a top administrator.? The bipartisan legislation Mr. Trump signed Friday was introduced by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Florida), Jon Tester (D-Montana), and Johnny Isakson (R-Georgia).? ""We will not rest until the job is 100 percent complete for our great veterans,"" Mr. Trump said.?

"The House is reviewing options that would provide for greater security for lawmakers following last week's shooting at the congressional baseball game practice. Leadership laid out various ideas to members of the House Republican Conference Friday morning. Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, a chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee, said a proposal is being crafted that would contain multiple layers of security. ""They said that House Administration is looking at that and making a proposal at three different levels--one at district offices, one for individual members and the possibility of using campaign funds to defend your home,"" he told reporters after the closed-door meeting. As for using campaign funds, Carter said that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would first have to ""decide whether [using those funds] that would be appropriate"" before approving any of the proposals. Under a fiscal 2018 House measure unveiled Thursday, Capitol Police would receive more than $422 million, an increase of more than $29 million above the current funding level. The appropriations panel said it would ""fund critical safety and enhanced security functions for all Members, staff, and visitors of the Capitol Complex, and maintain public access to the Capitol and its office buildings."" ""Increased funding is included to address concerns related to security and protection traumatic shooting earlier this month. This includes $7.5 million to enhance protection for increased training, equipment and technology-related support items,"" the committee said in a release. A number of lawmakers who were at the scene of last week's shooting have said they'd like to study the extent of security that's needed. If it weren't for the presence of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, at the practice, lawmakers would not have had security to monitor them on the field in Alexandria, Virginia. Many of the players credited Scalise's security detail with saving their lives. Scalise was among five people shot, and his condition has since improved. He was upgraded to fair condition at MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday.?

"In an earthquake, having the latest information could be key to survival. At the ""quake cottage"" in Burbank, California, scientists are working to warn people before earthquakes hit. The facility is home to a state-of-the-art quake simulator where you know exactly when the shaking is going to start. But what if you could get a warning before the real thing? Well, it does exist. It's called ShakeAlert, reports CBS News' Carter Evans. ?? Its rollout had been set for next year. Now, those plans, and the lives it could save, could be in jeopardy. In an earthquake zone every second counts. Early warning systems are already operational in Mexico and Japan. Prior to a massive 9.0 quake in 2011 people in Tokyo got a quake warning of more than 60 seconds. Now the Los Angeles rail system is, literally, on track with its own early warning program. When an alert sounds during a simulation at the rail operations center, supervisors immediately bring all 83 trains in the system to a stop and then take cover themselves. In a real world scenario this all would have happened before the shaking began. ""When it takes about 12 seconds to stop a commuter train or about 10 seconds to take an elevator to the closest floor, or even just three seconds to get underneath a desk, you can save a lot of lives,"" said Josh Bashioum, founder of Early Warning Labs, one of just a few companies approved by the U.S. government to send out advance earthquake alerts. During an earthquake, seismic waves radiate from the epicenter like waves on a pond. Currently more than 700 sensors - most of them in Southern California - detect those waves, passing along data that can be used to predict when shaking will start in nearby cities. Seismologist Lucy Jones helped develop the early warning system for the U.S. Geological Survey. It still needs nearly a thousand more seismic sensors across the West. But that plan is now in jeopardy. ""If the president's budget is passed by Congress, the program will be stopped because this is one of the things being eliminated,"" Jones said. Jones and others hope it doesn't take a disaster to convince lawmakers to keep the program alive. ""Japan started their program after 5,000 people died in Kobe. Mexico started their program after 10,000 people died in Mexico City,"" Jones said. ""We are trying to be the first country to do it without killing the people first."" If the budget is cut, that means large parts of Northern California, Oregon and Washington, where more sensors still need to be installed, will not get an early warning when an earthquake hits. Ultimately, the goal is to send an earthquake alert to every cellphone in a quake zone.

"On the day before Georgia's highly-anticipated 6th Congressional District Special Election between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel, President Trump took to Twitter to weigh in on the race. Mr. Trump, initially referring to the Republican candidate as ""Handle"" which he later amended in a corrected tweet, called out Ossoff for living outside the district, pointing out correctly that he ""can't even vote in the district he wants to represent."" Karen Handel's opponent in #GA06 can't even vote in the district he wants to represent.... Ossoff says that he was born and raised in Georgia and grew up in the Sixth District, but he does not live there. He lives just outside the district with his girlfriend, who is a medical student at Emory.?Candidates running for Congress do not have live in the exact district they are seeking to represent.? Mr. Trump continued to hit Ossoff's campaign, saying ""he wants to raise taxes and kill healthcare."" ....because he doesn't even live there! He wants to raise taxes and kill healthcare. On Tuesday, #VoteKarenHandel. Ossoff will face off against Handel to fill the vacant seat left by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. The race has now become the most expensive House race in U.S. history with a price tag exceeding $50 million. According to IssueOne, a pro-campaign finance reform group that looked at filings with the Federal Election Commission, $59.6 million has been invested in the race so far by all candidates and political groups, including money that was spent during the primary portion of the election. While the election does not offer a crystal clear window into 2018, Democrats are eager to show that voter enthusiasm can give them a shot at flipping Republican-held seats during the midterm elections.?

"Almost half a year into his presidency, voters who cast their ballots for?President Trump are calling him ""honest,"" ""determined,"" ""effective,"" ""true,"" ""productive,"" ""authentic"" and ""a tough S.O.B."" Though the president's?approval rating is stuck near a record low, many of his supporters are sticking by him. Republican strategist and CBS News contributor Frank Luntz spoke with a group of Trump supporters -- 13 men and seven women, ranging in age from 20 to 63. All of them voted for Mr. Trump in November, and their opinions of the president today range from somewhat unfavorable to extremely favorable. Mr. Trump said the investigation into Russia's influence in the 2016 election is not interfering with his agenda. He tweeted Sunday: ""The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt."" The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt. Many new jobs, high business enthusiasm,.. ""Did the Russians intervene in this election?"" Luntz asked the group. ""No, I mean, they didn't get into the voting machines and change votes. It wouldn't have made any difference one way or the other. Now, did they try to hack the election? We found out from the leaker 每 that woman, that yes, they did. But they weren't successful,"" one woman said. ""Should we be investigating this?"" Luntz asked. ""It's already been investigated,"" a man responded. ""So you think we're done. There's nothing more to learn?"" Luntz asked. ""Why not learn more. But don't do it for the purpose of overturning an election. Do it for the purpose of learning how we can put walls up, how we can keep security,"" one woman said. ""If the Russians affected the election, then that means they changed the minds of the American people. And that's not what happened,"" a man responded. ? ""The whole purpose of this is to have an investigation to see if there's specifics. Do you want to shut that investigation down?"" Luntz asked. ""I do. Because it's a giant, huge waste of time,"" a man responded. ""If there's an investigation into this whole Russian thing, then it needs to be on, 'well, they physically went into our machines, hacked our machines, this whole hacking thing, and actually changed the election results.' People read fake stuff on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram all day. Anybody could put that up. I could put it up. You could put it up."" Asked whether it's appropriate for a president to tweet as Mr. Trump does, the group's responses varied. ""It could be better,"" one man said. Another agreed. ""It could be better. He needs to tone down the language a little bit. But the bottom line is it's his way to get the message out,"" another man said. ""I would argue that Donald Trump shouldn't tone it down. This brash brand that he has is what got him elected,"" one man said. ""You know, I'm so tired of people beatin' on Donald Trump. Donald Trump made us promises. He kept them. And that's the type of new leadership that we need,"" one man interjected. ? ""And what has he accomplished?"" Luntz asked. ""He's done more in the last hundred days than President Obama done in the last eight years,"" he responded. ""Such as?"" ""Such as keepin' his promises,"" he said. ""I wanna know what promises he kept,"" Luntz said. ""One promise I can say that he did keep is he elected a conservative to the Supreme Court,"" the man responded. ""And you know what, that's the best promise that he's kept so far.""? ""By this point George W. Bush already had his tax cut done,"" Luntz pointed out. ""Trump is not getting much help from Congress. He is not getting a lot of help,"" one man said. ""It's a Republican Congress,"" Luntz countered. ? ""He talks about draining the swamp. And I think what we're finding real quick in the first 100 days is the swamp is not just the Democrats,"" a man said. ""There's more fighting among the Republicans than there is between the Republicans and Democrats on his agenda. And if they don't get it figured out, 2018's gonna be ugly for the Republican's,"" another man said. ""Let's say he doesn't get health care. Let's say he doesn't get tax reform. Let's say he doesn't get the investment in infrastructure. Those are three key commitments that he made. Who here would consider not voting for him in that situation? Raise your hands,"" Luntz said. About half the room raised their hands. ""So you're voting for him no matter what?"" Luntz asked. ""Absolutely,"" one woman said. ""No matter what he does. No matter what he says,"" Luntz said. ""Absolutely."" Some of his supporters also had messages for Mr. Trump:? ""Listen to your Cabinet, and Democrats aren't your enemies,"" one man said. ""Stay focused on the big picture issues and get that legislative agenda passed through on the economy. And things'll get a lot better,"" another said. ""Remember what got you to the office.

"HAVANA -- Cuba's foreign minister rejected President Donald Trump's new policy toward the island, saying Monday that ""we will never negotiate under pressure or under threat"" and refusing to return U.S. fugitives who have received asylum in Cuba. In a hard-edged response to the policy announced Friday, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said from Vienna that Mr. Trump's restrictions on transactions with the Cuban military would not achieve their objective of weakening the government. He said they would instead create unity behind the communist leadership. President Trump rolled back another Obama-era policy Friday -- this time, restricting travel and business with Cuba. CBSN political contributor a... He described fugitives such as Joanne Chesimard, a black militant convicted in 1977 of the murder of a New Jersey state trooper, as political refugees who had received asylum from the Cuban government and would not be returned because the U.S. has no ""legal or moral basis"" to demand their return. Surrounded by Cuban-American exiles and Cuban dissidents, Mr. Trump announced from a theater in Miami that the U.S. would impose new limits on U.S. travelers to the island and ban any payments to the military-linked conglomerate that controls much of the island's tourism industry. Trump also declared that, ""the harboring of criminals and fugitives will end. You have no choice. It will end."" He said the U.S. would consider lifting those and other restrictions only after Cuba returned fugitives and made a series of other internal changes including freeing political prisoners, allowing freedom of assembly and holding free elections. ""When Cuba is ready to take concrete steps to these ends, we will be ready, willing, and able to come to the table to negotiate that much better deal for Cubans, for Americans,"" Mr. Trump said. Rodriguez' response Monday was a clear signal that there could be very little, if any, high-level U.S.-Cuba negotiation during Mr. Trump's time in office. Already, while working-level meeting on topics such as search-and-rescue have taken place since Mr. Trump took office, no meetings between top diplomats have occurred. It's a sharp contrast to Obama's last year, during which top U.S. and Cuban diplomats met regularly to discuss topics including law-enforcement cooperation and compensation for Americans whose property was taken during the 1959 Cuban revolution. ""Cuba will not make concessions that harm its sovereignty,"" Rodriguez said. ""We have never done in the history of the revolution.""																																																																																																																					"
"Sen. John McCain on Monday blasted the Trump administration for lacking a strategy in Afghanistan where there are 8,400 U.S. troops stationed. ""Defense Secretary Mattis testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that we are not winning in Afghanistan. And yet, six months into the new administration, it still has not delivered a strategy,"" the Arizona Republican said in a statement. McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that if the administration fails to develop a strategy for success, ""Congress will need to play a greater role."" ""After nearly 16 years of war, we are at a stalemate in Afghanistan. Worse, we have no strategy to end that stalemate and achieve victory. The recent deaths of three brave American soldiers underscore the urgency for a new strategy to turn the situation around in Afghanistan,"" McCain added. He was referring to?three U.S. soldiers who were killed by an Afghan soldier last week?in eastern Nangarhar province. A?second insider attack unfolded on Sunday?in which an Afghan soldier opening fire on U.S. troops, wounding at least seven. In response to McCain, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford said at the National Press Club Monday that the administration will have a strategic review complete on Afghanistan sometimes in mid-July. Dunford also indicated that lawmakers should pass a new authorization for the use of military force (AUMF), but Congress has been deadlocked for years over how much authority it should offer. The Pentagon, meanwhile, has been making plans to send additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan. While the number is currently expected to be between 3,000 and 5,000 troops, the number is still being worked out, CBS News' national security correspondent David Martin reported on Friday. The decision by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis could be announced in the next several days or couple of weeks and it follows Mr. Trump's move to give Mattis the authority to set troop levels. During the Obama administration, McCain blamed Obama for the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), as a result of his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq, and he?warned Obama against taking similar action in Afghanistan.?

"In rare public remarks, President Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, welcomed top technology company executives for a brainstorming session at the White House on Monday. ? Kushner kicked off the White House ""Technology Week"" as part of the administration's ongoing efforts to make progress on campaign promises. The event was hosted by the White House Office of American Innovation and the American Technology Council, which is led by Kushner. Monday's event was billed as a brainstorming session to help modernize the federal government's technology infrastructure and, according to Kushner, help bring ""business sensibility"" to the government.? ""Many warned me bureaucracy would resist any change we tried to implement. So far I've found exactly the opposite,"" said Kushner. He added, ""The goal is simple here, to improve the day-to-day lives of average citizens. That's a core promise and we are keeping it."" Technology giants like Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty were on hand to help ""work on the country's biggest challenges."" Kushner applauded the work already done by some agencies to modernize decades-old federal systems by making the government ""more transparent and responsive to citizens needs,"" including Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin's work in moving the agency to electronic health records. Shulkin said the VA would adopt a commercial product used by the Pentagon, part of an effort to improve care for veterans and reduce wait times for medical appointments. ""Despite 16 years of failed efforts, the Trump administration got it done in less than five months,"" Kushner bragged. He added that the federal government's problems are ""more than simply technical.""? ""By modernizing systems, we will meaningfully improve the lives of Americans,"" Kushner predicted.? Kushner's remarks come amid scrutiny over his financial ties to the Russian government and meetings he held in December with Russia's ambassador. Kushner is also reportedly considering a new lawyer to represent him in the federal investigation into Russian meddling of the 2016 election. His current lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller worked at the same firm before Mueller was named special counsel. Kushner is now expected to depart for the Middle East?after Monday's events, traveling to Jerusalem and Ramallah to help advance peace talks in the region. He's scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to talk about next steps in negotiating peace.?

"WASHINGTON -- Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is set to testify in public before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday about Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The hearing, scheduled for 10 a.m., comes after testimony from Attorney General Jeff Sessions this week and former FBI Director James Comey last week before the Senate. Both hearings touched on the federal investigation into Russian interference and possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials. Johnson led the Department of Homeland Security amid Russian cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta, as well as attacks against state election databases last year. He advised states on how to protect themselves ahead of the election on Nov. 8. During the last open hearing held by the House Intelligence panel, former CIA Director John Brennan told lawmakers that Russia may have successfully tried to recruit U.S. persons to influence the election. Brennan also said he was aware of intelligence and information that revealed contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign. He couldn't say, however, whether or not the activities amounted to collusion. At its earlier Russia hearing in March, Comey testified alongside National Security Agency (NSA) Director Admiral Mike Rogers. During the hearing, the former FBI director confirmed that his agency was running an investigation into possible connections or coordination between Trump's associates and the Russian government. Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, is expected to chair Wednesday's hearing since the panel's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, recused himself from the Russia probe a few months ago. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, is the committee's ranking member.																																																																																																																					"

"Last Updated Jun 27, 2017 2:53 PM EDT House Republicans are proposing that the Pentagon receive more than $584 billion in discretionary funding for 2018, more than $18 billion above President Trump's request, according to a summary provided by the House Appropriations Committee.? The House Appropriations Defense subcommittee approved the measure Monday evening, advancing it to the full committee. The funding covers the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The bill appears to assume that Congress will raise spending caps set by a 2011 law before lawmakers approve a 2018 funding package. If Congress doesn't pass another bipartisan budget deal raising those spending limits, the defense spending cap for 2018 is $549 billion. For overseas military operations such as those against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the bill would provide $73.9 billion for the overseas contingency operations (OCO) fund and the Global War on Terrorism fund. A summary of the measure said that the OCO funding also ""provides critical support to our key allies, such as Israel, Ukraine and Jordan, to resist aggression."" The legislation covers funding for military personnel and pay, operations and maintenance projects, research and development and equipment procurement. The bill would provide funding for the Pentagon to acquire 11 Navy ships, two guided missile destroyers, 56 Black Hawk helicopter and 12 unmanned aerial vehicles, among other things. It would provide $282 million for cancer research, $125 million for research on traumatic brain injury and psychological health and $277 million for efforts to prevent and respond to sexual assaults. President Trump's 2018 budget blueprint from May requested that Congress increase defense spending for 2018 by $54 billion and call for the same amount in cuts to non-defense domestic programs.?

The Kentucky Republican will meet with Mr. Trump at the White House around noon, CBS News confirmed. Paul is among six Senate Republicans who have come out against the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA). Republicans can only afford two defections to pass the measure, assuming all Democrats oppose it. Hours after bill text was released last Thursday, Paul released a joint statement with Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, Ted Cruz, R-Texas and Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin arguing that the legislation doesn't go far enough in delivering an Obamacare repeal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has been aiming for a vote this week before lawmakers leave for their week-long July 4 recess, but that could potentially change if leaders fail to secure enough support to advance the bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its cost estimate of the bill Monday, which projects that 22 million more people will be without health insurance than Obamacare over the next 10 years.

Kim, 34, is running primarily on stopping what he calls ""Trumpcare 2.0,"" GOP efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. He has directly criticized MacArthur for his role in crafting amendments to the AHCA. In a written statement announcing his run, Kim said that MacArthur is ""hopelessly out of touch"" with New Jersey families. MacAthur's amendment to the House GOP healthcare plan would allow states to obtain a federal waivers to the ACA rule requiring sick and healthy people to be charged the same premiums. If the House GOP version passes, the change could have a significant impact on consumers who live in states where the waivers are granted. While consumers would still have to be covered under the AHCA, those with pre-existing conditions could see their premium costs rise if they don't have continuous health coverage. MacArthur has said those consumers with pre-existing conditions would be covered by high-risk pools. The American Healthcare Act would give states $100 billion over the next decade to help with high-risk pools. Kim told CBS News he decided to explore a run for Congress the day MacArthur released his amendment. ""In New Jersey, we have an estimated 3.8 million non-elderly people who have pre-existing conditions, over 300,000 just in the Jersey 3rd District. MacArthur didn't just vote for TrumpCare, he wrote it. He needs to be held accountable,"" said Kim. While Republicans celebrated after the bill's House passage at a White House ceremony with Mr. Trump, MacArthur faced a very different crowd back home. In May,?a group of protesters outside a MacArthur town hall in New Jersey lay on the ground with tombstones during a die-in, while inside, MacArthur answered heated questions about the health bill and President Trump. Some Kim supporters chanted ""goodbye"" to MacArthur, referring to his 2018 race against Kim. ""I hear people calling their congressman an idiot,"" MacArthur said. ""I wonder, really wonder, how any one of you would perform in Congress."" MacArthur said he came to the Democratic part of the 3rd Congressional District for his first town hall since the health care bill passed because he wants to represent both sides and he's aware of the ""anxiety"" over health care. MacArthur has since resigned as the co-chair of the moderate Tuesday Group, citing division with the group, saying many members were unwilling to compromise over the most recent health care debate. ""More than half of the no votes for the AHCA came from Tuesday Group members, despite almost every one of our members voting numerous times to repeal the ACA,"" MacArthur said in the letter announcing he was stepping down. ""Arguably we have a Congressional majority because of this very issue. Frankly, inaction on healthcare was a non-starter for me, and it should be for our entire party. We owe it to the American people who elected us to fix the Obamacare mess. Just because it's hard cannot become an excuse to do nothing."" Kim said that while he doubts the health care bill will successfully pass in the Senate, the focus should remain on whether more Americans are covered, as well as out-of-pocket costs for Americans ""We need an open and deliberate process that gives the American people information, CBO scores, expert testimony in public hearings,"" said Kim in response to Republicans closed-doors meetings on the health bill. ""The rushed process of the House vote and the MacArthur Amendment goes against what is best for the American people."" When asked what was his biggest challenge was in facing MacArthur, Kim said ""I just want to make sure I have the opportunity to connect with as many people as I can in the district to talk to them about my to growing up in the Jersey 3rd, my work as a public servant, and how I want to work with them going forward.""? He added, ""It's a large district and I want to make sure my message is getting across and I have the opportunity to define myself."" According to the New York Times, Kim is hoping to use fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff's run in Georgia's special election for the state's 6th Congressional District as a model for his own race, hoping to harness the same energy Ossoff and the party is projecting behind the candidate. ? Kim believes the 3rd District, which voted twice for Mr. Obama, is ""looking for someone who will represent them specifically."" ""MacArthur isn't from the District and moved there when he saw a political opportunity,"" Kim said. ""He sees the Jersey 3rd as a stepping stone. I see it as home. I want to represent everyone in the District.""																																																																																																																					"
"President Trump says the United States has a ""very strong"" relationship with Panama, and in a meeting with the Panamanian president, he noted the U.S. role in building the Panama Canal. Mr. Trump was meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela to discuss organized crime, immigration, fighting drug trafficking along with economic issues. After the president and first lady Melania Trump escorted Varela and his wife, Lorena Castillo, to the Oval Office, the president quickly noted their historic ties. ? ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well. I think we did a good job building it, right?"" Trump told Varela, who responded, ""Very good job."" ? Opened in 1914, the Panama Canal was built by the United States between 1904 and 1913 and revolutionized sea traffic travel in the region. The canal was under U.S. control until a 1977 agreement led to its transfer to Panama in 1999. The canal recently expanded its locks as part of a $5.25 billion expansion project.? Varela noted the U.S. and Panama face many of the same challenges in the region, and he said that ""the idea of this visit is to work closely together."" The two leaders were also expected to address unrest in nearby Venezuela, which has been grappling with anti-government protests and calls for new presidential elections amid major inflation, crime and food and medical shortages. During the meeting, Mr. Trump ignored reporters' questions about whether he is under investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, after a member of his legal team vehemently denied that he was. President Trump says the investigation into Russia's influence in the 2016 election is not interfering with his agenda. Republican strategist and... Top Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow told CBS News' John Dickerson on ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that the president is not and has not been under investigation."" Sekulow's comments came after?Mr. Trump slammed reports?that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is reviewing whether or not Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice amid ongoing investigations into any ties between his presidential campaign's or transition's associates and the Russian government. The Washington Post first reported the story.? ""They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice,"" Mr. Trump tweeted on Thursday. A day later,?Mr. Trump said in a tweet, ""I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt."" He appeared to be referring to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Sekulow told CBS News that the legal team has ""received no notice of investigation.""

"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Monday struck down part of a law that bans offensive trademarks in a ruling that is expected to help the Washington Redskins in their legal fight over the team name. The justices ruled that the 71-year-old trademark law barring disparaging terms infringes free speech rights. The ruling is a victory for the Asian-American rock band called the Slants, but the case was closely watched for the impact it would have on the separate dispute involving the Washington football team. Slants founder Simon Tam tried to trademark the band name in 2011, but the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied the request on the grounds that it disparages Asians. A federal appeals court in Washington later said the law barring offensive trademarks is unconstitutional. ""I was ridiculed as a kid for having slanted eyes,"" Tam told CBS News correspondent Jan Crawford in an interview broadcast before justices heard oral arguments in the case in January. ""Now I'm saying it's something that I can be proud of, not something to be ashamed of."" Asian-American rock band the Slants perform in a segment broadcast on ""CBS This Morning"" on Jan. 18, 2017. The Redskins made similar arguments after the trademark office ruled in 2014 that the name offends American Indians and canceled the team's trademark. A federal appeals court in Richmond put the team's case on hold while waiting for the Supreme Court to rule in the Slants case. In his opinion for the court, Justice Samuel Alito rejected arguments that trademarks are government speech, not private speech. Alito also said trademarks are not immune from First Amendment protection as part of a government program or subsidy. Tam insisted he was not trying to be offensive, but wanted to transform a derisive term into a statement of pride. The Redskins also contend their name honors American Indians, but the team has faced decades of legal challenges from Indian groups that say the name is racist. Despite intense public pressure to change the name, Redskins owner Dan Snyder has refused, saying it ""represents honor, respect and pride."" In the Slants case, government officials argued that the law did not infringe on free speech rights because the band was still free to use the name even without trademark protection. The same is true for the Redskins, but the team did not want to lose the legal protections that go along with a registered trademark. The protections include blocking the sale of counterfeit merchandise, and working to pursue a brand development strategy. A federal appeals court had sided with the Slants in 2015, saying the First Amendment protects ""even hurtful speech that harms members of oft-stigmatized communities.""

"Senate Democrats plan to slow down work in the upper chamber in an effort aimed at drawing attention to Republicans' secret negotiations to craft legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. A senior aide told CBS News' Steven Portnoy that Democrats will begin a series of parliamentary moves at 4 p.m. ET Monday in an effort to slow the Senate agenda. Democrats plan to object to all requests for unanimous consent and they plan to make their own consent requests to move the health care negotiations into committee where the conversation can take place publicly. Democrats intend to hold the floor until late into the evening Monday, making a series of speeches condemning the closed-door GOP talks. ""Republicans are drafting this bill in secret because they're ashamed of it, plain and simple,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said through an aide, calling the actions tonight ""merely the first steps we're prepared to take in order to shine a light on this shameful Trumpcare bill."" ""If Republicans won't relent and debate their health care bill in the open for the American people to see, then they shouldn't expect business as usual in the Senate,"" Schumer added. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has said he'd like a vote on health care by Congress's July 4 recess, but Senate Republicans have yet to release language. On Monday, Schumer, along with Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, Patty Murray, D-Washington and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, sent a letter to top Republicans asking that they schedule hearing to discuss, debate and hear testimony about ""the health care bill that you are currently drafting in secret."" They then listed all of the rooms available in Senate Office buildings for them to schedule a health care hearing. Meanwhile, President Trump last week told GOP senators that the House health care bill is ""mean"" and that the Senate version should be ""more generous,"" CBS News' John Nolen confirmed, citing a congressional source. Mr. Trump held a celebratory event in the Rose Garden when the House narrowly passed its version.?

"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is wading into the thicket of partisan redistricting in a case from Wisconsin. The justices said Monday that they will decide whether Republican lawmakers drew electoral districts so out of whack with the state's political breakdown that they violated the constitutional rights of Democratic voters. It's the high court's first case on what's known as partisan gerrymandering in more than a decade, and the outcome could affect elections across the country. The case will be argued in the fall. A three-judge court struck down Wisconsin's legislative districts in November and ordered new maps drawn in time for the 2018 elections. That work is proceeding.																																																																																																																					"
"Last Updated Jun 15, 2017 2:46 PM EDT Authorities say there is ""no evidence to suggest"" James Hodgkinson, the gunman in the Alexandria, Virginia, shooting at a congressional baseball practice that left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise?and a lobbyist in critical condition, obtained his weapons illegally. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) traced the two weapons recovered at the scene -- a 9 mm handgun and a 7.62 caliber rifle. The shooting was reported shortly after 7 a.m. Wednesday from a field where GOP members of Congress were practicing for Thursday night's baseball game against congressional Democrats.? ""ATF has conducted traces on these weapons and has determined that both were purchased by the shooter from federal firearms licensees,"" a joint statement from ATF, the FBI, the Alexandria Police Department and U.S. Capitol Police released Thursday said. ""We currently have no evidence to suggest that the purchases were not lawful."" The statement did not indicate where Hodgkinson -- whom the FBI believes moved from Illinois to Alexandria and was living in his van in recent months -- purchased or obtained the guns.? The gun debate has been reigited after Wednesday's shooting at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia. CBSNews.com political reporter Rebecca S...

Federal authorities are investigating Hodgkinson's motive in the incident.? Facebook profiles that the FBI confirmed are Hodgkinson's show he was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders who expressed intense disapproval of President Trump. Sanders on Wednesday condemned any act of violence and said he was ""sickened"" to learn the man apparently volunteered on his campaign.
