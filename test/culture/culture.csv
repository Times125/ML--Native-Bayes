"azo Dharejo had barely mastered the alphabet when her father, Haji Khuda Buksh, first showed her how to load a gun. The kalashnikov would be kept on the wall, hung above the living quarters of the family＊s two-storey home, where she grew up with her two sisters, and their older brother Sikander in rural Sindh, . They were comfortable, but not extravagantly well off; Khuda Buksh worked as a farmer and had inherited a few dozen acres of land from his own father. His wife, Waderi Jamzadi, raised their children and, once the girls left school, aged seven, taught them what she could at home.The girls were moulded to be tough and resilient. Their father would dress them in trousers and shirts 每 ※boy＊s clothes§ 每 instead of more feminine, traditional shalwar kameez. Nazo, the eldest daughter, was given the male nickname Mukthiar and was the first to be taught how to shoot, when she was 16. Two years later, with her brother murdered and her father in prison, the fierce but waif-like teenager was armed and leading a gunfight against a criminal army of bandits sent to steal her family＊s home and land. Now 41, she has been dubbed ※§ by the Pakistani press, and the story of that night has become local legend 每 one that British Pakistani film-maker Sarmad Masud has beautifully rendered in his debut feature, .※I originally wanted to make a film in Pakistan about police corruption, like ,§ says Masud, in an East Midlands accent. ※Then in 2013, I came across a story of this woman who had defended her home and land from 200 bandits. That＊s much better than a Pakistani Cop Land so I contacted [the journalist] who wrote the piece and through that, rang Nazo.§Their first chat set the tone for their relationship: to the point and with minimal conversational faff. ※She asked if there would be song and dance in the film and I said no. She asked if it would be a documentary; I said no. She asked if she would be in the film and I said: ＆No, we＊ll get someone to play you.＊ We stayed in touch on Skype; quite quickly she signed her life-rights agreement but refused 每 and still refuses 每 to take money for it. She just said: ＆Tell my story.＊§ And so Masud has.My Pure Land has, in many ways, the elements of a : a long, dramatic standoff, where Nazo, her sister, her mother and brother＊s friend, Zulfiqar, are under siege for 24 hours in a dusty fortress-like building, exaggeratedly outnumbered by flinty-eyed, grimy villains sent by her father＊s brother. Yet, Masud＊s tiny-budget film has stripped the scenes and most importantly the dialogue to a minimal, naturalistic rhythm. Yes, there is lush cinematography 每 the country＊s unique light and landscape is an obvious gift to film-makers 每 but the atmosphere is deliberately toned down with an ambition to do ※Paul Greengrass meets Ken Loach in Pakistan§.Family disputes over land are many and complex in south Asia; there are an estimated 1m cases pending in Pakistan alone, and deeply savage feuds can sometimes tip into violence when honour is at risk. In Nazo＊s case, her family＊s honour was the land itself, and protecting it was more important than her life: once it was left to the women of the household to hold tight and keep fighting, they decided surrender wasn＊t remotely an option 每 the only way their bodies would leave the land would be together, dead.In a romantic, albeit sweetly optimistic, move, Zulfiqar asked Nazo that night if she would marry him 每 if they ever made it out. She said yes under three conditions: that she would carry on working, she wouldn＊t live with her in-laws, and that she would be free to travel where she wanted.※I wasn＊t scared,§ says Zulfiqar, over the phone. ※At that point, fear runs away. Nazo was the same.§ The couple went on to have four children, to whom they have told the story countless times. Their son ※has been holding a gun since he was three years old, but the girls aren＊t interested§. And Nazo, headstrong and independent, has travelled over the years 每 going on religious pilgrimages to, typically, some of the toughest places in the region: Iraq, Iran and Syria. At this point, the couple have yet to see the film; Masud wants to try and get them over to watch it together on a proper cinema screen. That it even got made and is complete, 16 years after he graduated in television and film design at the Hull School of Art and Design, is still something of a revelation to him. Everything that could have gone wrong with the shoot, he says, did. The majority of funds were raised from family and friends and he had a six-week filming schedule to get it all wrapped up.※A week before we started filming, we still hadn＊t found the actress to play Nazo. My wife [Caroline Bailey, the film＊s production designer] was hospitalised with carbon monoxide poisoning, working on the prison set we＊d built, the first day of shooting. And after scouting Google Earth and having an absolutely useless fixer, we only managed to find the house we made the whole film in because of my Uncle Riaz. He took us to a property, a few miles outside of Lahore that my grandfather had built himself decades before.§Masud is animated about the perils of filming in Pakistan, where ※anything is possible but everything is impossible§, but he is sentimental about the experience, too. ※I want to make more films from there. This is a universal story. It＊s not just Pakistani, or a western, or a feminist film.§ He tries to explain the emotional pull he feels towards the country. ※I＊m from Nottingham and I＊m proud of that. I moved to London in 2012, but I won＊t wear a scarf and I won＊t drink coffee. I don＊t know where I＊m going and I＊ve still got a Nokia. But Pakistan ...§We consider the romanticising that we, as diaspora kids, can be guilty of, but still, Masud says he feels an innate urge to make work that rejects the cliches about Pakistan. ※The only real request that Nazo and Zulfiqar made was that I didn＊t portray them as terrorists.§ He laughs. ※But for me, it＊s like my dad says, Pakistan to him isn＊t just the people and the noise and the language 每 it＊s the soil itself."
"hen  broke in July 2012, it had all the ingredients of a thriller. A man had hidden his wife＊s body under a tarpaulin in their bedroom for three months and sealed the room with duct tape. On arrival, the police encountered a drug den, littered with heroin and its paraphernalia, which stank of decaying flesh. What was more, we didn＊t need to feel sorry for them because they were so rich. Hans Kristian Rausing was the heir to the multibillion Tetra Pak fortune; the drug den was a bedroom in a well-staffed ?70m Chelsea mansion. It was a story too ghoulish to feel your way inside, yet now Hans＊s sister, the  publisher Sigrid Rausing, has written a book that sets out to do so. ※Can a book about this story ever be framed by anything other than tabloid headlines?§ she asks.In seeking an alternative to the headlines, Rausing offers thoughtfulness and introspection. She also provides a lot of self-flagellation. She was there in Hans＊s 20s when he first became a drug addict, yet she failed to notice what was happening. She was there in 2000 when Hans and Eva first relapsed, after a happy seven-year marriage that produced four children. She intervened by writing emails pleading with them to return to rehab, and now she blames herself for the priggish tone of these messages and for their inevitable ineffectualness. Encouraged by social workers who told her that otherwise the children would be taken into care, she took legal measures to gain custody of their four children, and she blames herself for bringing them up too strictly. ※I see my complicity, my guilt. I see my tiredness, my hopelessness; my false moral superiority, my finger wagging, wagging. I regret everything.§Given Rausing＊s own privilege, this seems a sensible tactic. But what gives this book its astonishing power is not the guilt, but the intelligence and literary skill. As a narrative, it＊s beautifully structured, weaving its way from the family＊s childhood holidays in rural Sweden to their lives in London, returning always to the hideous image of Hans and Eva＊s bedroom as the dark centre of the story. Rausing sets the scene with painterly delicacy and then steps back to analyse the implications of what she＊s revealed, alternating between her knowledge at the time and her subsequent understanding.This is an effective approach, particularly because it leaves the reader moving between accepting and questioning the narrator＊s point of view. When it comes to scrutinising her own motivation, Rausing doesn＊t always seem a reliable witness. Eva claimed that Rausing and her husband Eric had seized the children because they wanted more children themselves; Rausing maintains that she was doing it solely out of the urge to protect. Presumably the answer is somewhere in between. In the self-flagellating passages, Rausing implies that there is more she could have done, but elsewhere she＊s clear that she did all she could. She appears in these contradictions still not to have decided the extent of her responsibility or guilt. However, she seems at least partially aware of this, and what makes the approach effective is that when it comes to opening up wider questions of culpability or the nature of addiction, she is consistently more subtle than we would expect in a memoir of this kind.At the heart of the book is the question of addiction, and its place in the medical and the social framework. ※Of all the self-inflicted wounds of humanity, addiction, it seems to me, is one of the most tragic,§ Rausing writes. It＊s tragic because the addict＊s individuality is erased by the predictability of the progress of the disease and because addicts place themselves beyond help. There is no medicine except the  that destroy them, and help from those who love them manifests itself as an exercise of power.To what extent do we see the addict as responsible for the condition and the pain inflicted? Rausing does an impressive job of weaving between possible interpretations. ※We haven＊t agreed, as a society, how far drug addicts are guilty of their many and varied trespasses against the law, their families and social norms. You can＊t be found both insane and guilty 每 you are one or the other.§She seems right that the addict sits somewhere between culpability and insanity. There is a point where we can blame him for failing to restrain himself and a point beyond this. Hans, hiding Eva＊s body because he couldn＊t face the reality of her death and was sufficiently drugged to be capable of deluding himself, was clearly beyond this point. But were he and Eva culpable when they first sipped their fateful glasses of champagne at a party on the eve of the millennium? Were they to blame when, despite knowing where drugs had led them in the past, they allowed this first contact with alcohol to lead so swiftly into a cocktail of drugs and lies?Behind this is the question of what causes addiction in the first place. According to DSM-5, the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the US, 40-60% of the risk of alcoholism is genetic, though drug addiction is less quantifiable. Is it a genetic mutation, a psychological condition, or a culture of rebellion? As children of the 1960s, the Rausings grew up in a culture of freedom and Hans＊s initial forays into drugs were a part of this. ※Some families are overprotective,§ Rausing observes, but others, ※like ours, take a secret pride in the wild§. Perhaps Hans was rebelling; perhaps Eva wanted to be free of the order she＊d created in her London life. But the same can＊t be said of the desperate figures Rausing encountered when watching a TV programme about drug addiction in Mombasa.She describes an entire generation wiped out by the heroin that is plentifully available because the country lies on the smuggling route east from Afghanistan and Pakistan. A woman called Roshana sits crying in a squalid room, showing the camera photographs of the four sons who have been ※taken away by drugs§. Her remaining son is so addled by heroin that he can＊t remember his mother＊s name. ※Did Roshana fail them in some fundamental way?... Or were they in the wrong place at the wrong time, falling into something so sweet, so delicious; so soft and loving that they didn＊t even see their mother＊s pain?§Roshana, surrounded by drugs and fake doctors prepared to inject their patients, could not, it seems, have done more. But what of the privileged Rausings, with access to addiction specialists and every form of rehab? The biggest unanswerable question here concerns the limits of responsibility 每 when does taking responsibility for someone else＊s mental state become an unacceptable form of coercive control? Perhaps, Rausing wonders at one point, Hans and Eva were content in their bubble of drugs, whatever destruction it was causing to those around them. Perhaps this was their right, and we must accept this if we believe in freedom? It＊s not surprising that Rausing turned to  and  in the weeks after learning about Eva＊s death. She was seeking a moral universe tidier than her own. Lara Feigel＊s  is published by Bloomsbury.  is published by Penguin. To order a copy for ?14.44 (RRP ?18.99) go to  or call 0330 333 6846.

"fter the end of the cold war and the various extremely warm ones that followed it, the classic spy novel 每and what other kind is there? 每 came to seem increasingly an anachronism. There is a generation of people approaching middle age who never knew what it was to live with the always astounding yet incontrovertible fact that life on earth could and might well be obliterated at any moment, not by the action of God or the gods, but by the handiwork of humankind itself. The international conflict that began in the wake of?the attack on the twin towers is random and internecine, and our fear of it is febrile and unfocused; cold war fear was not worse, just different, a concentrated, dull, ashen sensation that one could almost feel between the lips, like?a coating of radioactive dust. was a connoisseur of that brand of terror; all his spies lived with it at every moment, waking and sleeping; it was the kind of grit that caused pain but produced no pearl.Indeed, one of the main sources of Le Carr谷＊s enduring popularity 每 he has been a bestselling author for more than half a century 每 was the palpable grittiness of his books. No matter how entertaining they were, they purveyed harsh truths about the world, insisting we face up to the fact that behind the facade of quotidian reality, forces are at work that are more real than the majority of us wish to acknowledge. As Alec Leamas (the spy who came in from the cold) explains to his lover, the naive communist Liz Gold, the dirty game of espionage is carried on ※so that the great moronic mass that you admire can sleep soundly in their beds at night§.With the collapse of European communism and the delusional period of peace that followed 每 we did not know what was slouching towards us out of the desert lands that had been the cradle of civilisation 每 a number of foolish book-chatterers predicted the end of Le Carr谷＊s career as a novelist, since his great subject had collapsed overnight, like the tumbling down of a once seemingly permanent concrete wall. Of course, he went on to prove the pundits to have been wrong, as usual, with richly inventive works such as  and . However, many readers pined for the good old days of the Circus, with its moles and lamplighters, its joes and?scalp-hunters, its tinkers, tailors, soldiers and spies; its, above all, George Smiley. Well, they can stop pining.  brings it all back, as fresh and as rancid as ever, in a tale that shows the master in the full vigour of his old mastery.From the start 每 even before , Le Carr谷＊s third novel 每 he displayed a genius for plotting. With most crime or spy stories, we come to the end of the book and the plot with an anticlimactic thud, and the same feeling of dull vacancy we have when we complete a crossword and are overcome with the guilty sense of having squandered precious time and taxed our brain cells wastefully in pursuit of a trivial end. In the case of a?Le Carr谷 novel, even though plot is central to the book＊s effectiveness and a?main component of the aesthetic pleasure it offers us, we are aware of being addressed 每 admittedly in prose that is rarely more than workmanlike 每 by a real writer, one with a formidable intelligence and a highly developed moral sensibility. Although Le Carr谷 would probably not claim to be an artist, his work, at its best, operates at?a?high literary level. 每 the title suggests more than one meaning 每 satisfies not only by being vintage Le Carr谷, which it is, but in the way in which it so neatly and ingeniously closes the circle of the author＊s long career.Peter Guillam, Smiley＊s former right-hand man, is long out of the Service and enjoying a bucolic retirement in Brittany, in the village where he was born to a Breton mother and an English father who fought bravely behind the lines in France before D-day, and died a hero＊s death at the?hands of the Gestapo. Peter was brought up in England, but never lost his Breton French, or his love for his native place. One day his peaceful idyll is disturbed by the arrival of?a?terse letter, ostensibly from one A?Butterfield at 1 Artillery Buildings, London SE14, summoning him immediately to England in connection with ※a matter in?which you appear to have played a?significant role some years back§.In London, Guillam presents himself dutifully, and apprehensively, at the Secret Service＊s ※shockingly ostentatious new headquarters§ on the Thames. Here he is greeted by a pair of?lawyers, the bouncing Bunny, ※a?fresh-faced, bespectacled English public schoolboy of indefinable age in?shirt sleeves and braces§, and Laura, short-haired, 40?odd and menacingly businesslike.This long early scene, in which the veteran Guillam spars and feints with the pair of latter-day technocrats, is Le?Carr谷 at?his gleefully contemptuous best. Not?the least of the pleasures here?is the accuracy with which Bunny＊s Essex accent is captured with?its steely, fake chumminess and random emphases: ※Peter! Gosh! You look positively jaunty! And half your age! You travelled well? Coffee? Tea? Honestly not? Really, really good of you to come. A?huge help.§What has happened, we learn, is that the grown-up offspring, a son and?a daughter, of, respectively, Leamas and Gold, have emerged from the shadows threatening a profoundly embarrassing and ruinously costly joint court action against the Service for having been responsible for the deaths of their parents. In its defence, the Service must go back?and delve into the operation that formed the plot of , and which ended with the deaths of Leamas and his lover on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. Guillam, as a surviving key player in the ostensibly lost chess game, is required to tell all he knows about the affair, and give a plausible account of his involvement in it, or else: Guillam, we are reminded, in one of Le Carr谷＊s typically laconic and chilling throwaway lines, ※draws full pension and [is] therefore torturable§.The plot of the new book is derived from and intricately woven into that of its predecessor. This is an immensely clever piece of novelistic engineering, of which its deviser can be justifiably proud. The ingenuity and skill with which the thing is brought off is breathtaking 每 really, not since  has Le Carr谷 exercised his gift as a storyteller so powerfully and to such thrilling effect. He has had to make a few tiny tweaks to the original narrative to ensure a plausible fit for?the new one. For instance, Karl Riemeck, the agent who dies at Checkpoint Charlie in , undergoes some adjustments here; also, the time-frame in which plays out is necessarily vague, since Smiley, who was already a spy in the second world war, is still alive 每 though mum＊s?the word on that, so as not to?spoil the sport.Smiley still uses the end of his tie to wipe his spectacles, through which he still stares at people owlishly 每 true,?he is?a bit of a cliche, but it is a?pity that the cliche was set in stone by the television portrayal of him by?Alec Guinness, an actor who by strenuously underplaying managed to?overplay wildly. Smiley is ※Le Carr谷 man§ in essence: a reluctant ※cold warrior§, impossibly clever, wise to the world＊s wickedness yet unshakeably decent at heart. And since?this is probably the last 每 brief 每 encounter we?shall have with him, he?should be accorded the last word.It is a particularly apposite word, in these increasingly isolationist, chauvinistic times. Wondering what it?was they fought for, he declares a?sort of enduring faith: ※I＊m a European,?Peter. If I had a mission 每 if I?were ever aware of one beyond our?business with the enemy, it was to?Europe. If I?was heartless, I was heartless for Europe. If?I had an unattainable ideal, it was of?leading Europe out of her darkness towards a?new age of reason. I have it still.§Is he an anachronism? Perhaps: but affirmatively, gloriously so.

"he good thing about this film, and its subject, is that no one mentions the words ※national treasure§. Labour MP Dennis Skinner hasn＊t mellowed much. He＊s as difficult and bloody-minded as ever 每 and just as opaque.  of Skinner is affectionate and respectful; it takes us back to Skinner＊s Derbyshire roots, showing us the ex-miner of granite integrity, still an MP at 85, still working hard in the Commons long after the likes of  and  have flounced.Skinner fought fierce and wounding battles in the 80s: the sword did not sleep in his hand throughout the miners＊ strike of 1984-85, and the film rightly dwells on that 每 though dealing rather more quickly with the inglorious infighting over Militant in the Kinnock years. Skinner＊s finest hour was arguably to prevent a ban on stem-cell research: a glorious triumph which perfectly combined his talent for anarchy, love of mischief and knowledge of Commons lore. This movie is silent on many subjects. For understandable, high-minded reasons, it does not talk about Skinner＊s marriage and how that came to an end. Asking him about that might be tabloid prurience, although it would have shed light on Skinner the human being. Elsewhere, despite a brief admission that like most on the Labour left, he voted against Europe in 1975, there is nothing on Brexit, the most important UK political issue of our times. And weirdly, little or nothing on what he thinks about . Surely he is excited to have a real socialist as party leader 每 and the prospect of a socialist government, the first of his lifetime? Skinner won＊t be drawn, perhaps because of his reluctance to endorse the over-dogs and the bigwigs, even on his own side. Draper＊s film is at its most tender when it shows Skinner＊s love of nature, a figure of almost Buddha-like serenity as he contemplates a tree.																																											"
"t midnight in Manchester, blue neon bathes the bricks of a former air-raid shelter under Piccadilly station. The floor is sardined with young clubbers and ageing, ecstatic ravers, all heralding a band currently at No 1 in the US.Their whiskery frontman is concerned about considerate dancing (the venue is packed to nerve-racking levels) and ticking off people about taking pictures on their phones. ※We＊re OK, right?§ asks , smiling nervously as the crowd twists and heaves, every inch the concerned 47-year-old dad he is as well as a creator of punishingly good pop music.Recently reunited six years after a farewell tour that took in a four-hour show at Madison Square Garden, New York, and a quintuple live LP, it makes sense for LCD Soundsystem to launch their UK tour here. This is the city of New Order and Factory Records, the group＊s spiritual ancestors in terms of emotional, intellectual dance music, and in ongoing influences, if new album American Dream is anything to go by. (Talking Heads, Suicide and David Bowie are also stirred into that mix, the latter someone with whom Murphy worked on his last album, .) But they＊re also topping the Billboard charts for the first time. Maybe it＊s understandable that a group long preoccupied with anxiety, ageing and failure fed through ambitious, euphoric dancefloor pop have met their moment now.They sound fantastic. Every two-note synth riff and oscillator-tweak (many from the undersung Nancy Whang) ricochets through the room. New tracks such as I Used To and Tonite (※The future＊s a nightmare / And there＊s nothing I can do / Nothing anyone can do about it§) hold their own against old classics such as Get Innocuous! and Someone Great. The latter, an affecting disco-banger about death, becomes a singalong tonight, which is testament to Murphy＊s way with a glittering melody, and a phrase to match it. ※When someone great has gone§ the crowd hollers back at him. Murphy is mesmerising and powerful throughout, backlit in white light like a friendly hulking bear, singing with a greater richness and warmth than ever before. Even a moment of antsiness about a keyboard malfunction before set closer All My Friends can＊t spoil the night. He stands there under a glitterball, like the one that graced the cover of his debut album 15 years ago, surrounded by the people who know him best, and it works. In our uneasy times, this incongruous everyman feels absolutely right.																																											"
"Parents who look disappointedly at their children, glued to their phones refusing to engage with real life, would do well to remember the . For a few years, Britain was gripped by hobbyists in their garage or car, having stilted chatroom-like conversations with strangers over unused AM radio, mostly in their area but occasionally hundreds of miles away. It was basically like an early version of , but with no chance of having to look at someone＊s genitals.In the US, , but in the UK there was more of a social element. People talking into the abyss, waiting for a response. There would be local meet-ups where CB enthusiasts could finally put faces to muffled, interferency names. When they did, they wanted to leave a calling card so they could be identified back on the airwaves, so they would make ※Eyeball cards§: photocopied business cards, to be collected like .CB was dominated by impenetrable slang and code names, so these cards would often bear names like ※Little Bo Peep§ and ※Randy Andy§. The cards also told others which area you were broadcasting from, but since it was illegal to broadcast on CB radio until the early 80s, these had to be disguised. ※Dyfed in Wales was ＆Sausage Town＊, Bexhill was ＆Foggy Town＊, Diss in Norfolk was ＆Dodge City＊,§ explains William Hogan in his new book, , which includes hundreds of images of the cards.Different regions adopted different styles of cards, and illustrators set up small businesses to satisfy demand. Most cards adopted a Viz-like style: Porcupine and Jinx, the code name for a romantically involved couple with a CB, had a cartoon couple with animal faces making love. Others were more literal 每 an enthusiast who used the handle ※Snowberry§ simply depicted a berry ski-ing down the mountainside 每 but most bore the slogan, ※You have just eyeballed ...§ After broadcasting on CB radios became legal, they lost much of their appeal and when mobile phones became popular, most were consigned to the attic. But the cards live on, little cardboard symbols of Britain＊s first social media revolution.  by William Hogan and David Titlow will be published by Four Corners Books (RRP ?14) on 15 September.

"ack in the 1990s, there was a major pop culture war in which it was impossible to not take sides, and the side you took revealed what kind of person you were. What? 每 Blur v Oasis? Friends v Frasier? Get out of town. We＊re talking, of course, about the 1998 asteroid-disaster-movie war, in which you were either lovely emosh Deep Impact (yay!) or loud explodey Armageddon (boo!). Nineteen years later, and we＊re all going to get the chance to relive those thrilling times as the world readies itself for not one, but two battle-rap films in quick succession.The filmic dust-up is also a transatlantic affair. In the red corner, there is , produced by Eminem, written by  and directed by . And in the blue, the BBC-backed VS, which stars the UK＊s most successful rap battler, -collaborator , and boasts Brit battle bigwig  as its chief?consultant.Rap battle, for the uninitiated, is an artform in which , in rhyme and almost always a capella, and at the moment it is insanely popular, both in English-speaking countries and, oddly, in the Philippines, where the top battlers routinely rack up tens of millions of YouTube views. Lyrically, no angles of attack are off limits 每 battles may frequently be offensive but they are egalitarian as well.Bodied has already harvested  after it debuted at the Toronto international film festival, but is still awaiting distribution in the UK. Its story, about a middle-class student (Calum Worthy) discovering an unexpected talent for battling, has been hailed for its subversive streak, as it makes points about race relations, cultural appropriation and, above all, white privilege, while featuring a who＊s who of US and Canadian battlers.VS, meanwhile, seems on first glance to be a rather more straightforward tale: newcomer Connor Swindells plays an angst-stricken teenager who battles his demons by becoming a?battling demon.Interestingly, the films have arrived while the UK battle scene is in something of a tailspin, with  in a cloud of recriminations, allegations of staff non-payment and general social-media four-letter abuse. While it may seem uniquely British that an organisation founded on horrific insults should end because staff fell out with each other, it does at least pave the way for a new generation of battlers inspired by Bodied and VS, ensuring that mothers everywhere need not fear .

"he announcement of an autopsy by  of the 2016 election raised a distressing possibility: the defeated candidate was back. After 25 years in the public eye, she simply could not leave the political arena, and her campaign memoir would play prelude to the next phase, no matter how badly US politics needed new blood. We needn＊t have worried.  is quite different from Clinton＊s careful, tedious autobiographies. Those books tried to sell a wise and relatable candidate to the public, while playing down controversies. Her new book is more gossipy, it is meaner, more entertaining and more wrong-headed than anything she or her speechwriters have written before.The book begins with a recounting of , which she attended, smiling. I remember wanting a dose of whatever she was on. (The book does not reveal.) She recalls attending Trump＊s wedding in 2005, back when he was just ※like a lot of big-shot real estate guys in the city, only more flamboyant and self-promoting§. At the inauguration, she shakes hands with US Republican politician Jason Chaffetz, thinking he is the new White House chief of staff, . When Chaffetz tweets the photo with a nasty caption, Clinton responds: ※I came this close to tweeting back, ＆To be honest, thought you were Reince.＊§The congressman Ryan Zinke, who had called her the antichrist in 2014, says hello; she reminds him of his comments and he blanches. ※One thing I＊ve learned over the years is how easy it is for some people to say horrible things about me when I＊m not around, but how hard it is for them to look me in the eye and say it to my face.§ The book is off to a bracing start, to be followed by swipes at former vice-president , TV journalist Matt Lauer, Vladimir Putin and more. None of the score-settling sheds much light on the big questions of Clinton＊s candidacy, but it＊s fun to watch terrible people being called terrible.The tone of the book is often quippy, and Clinton seems to have adopted the public persona crafted by her fans. You remember the memes from the campaign: Hillary texting tough and witty things in dark glasses from her campaign plane, or the one where she looks exasperated while giving . There were also her campaign＊s YAASSS HILLARY T-shirts, and star turns from self-declared feminist stars Katy Perry, Beyonc谷, Lena Dunham and the comedians from . All of this functioned to turn Clinton into a pop-feminist icon for the first time in her long career, a role that she occupied happily if awkwardly. Many critics (including me) argued at the time that this winking, ※§ persona obscured Clinton＊s more substantial problems and anti-feminist attributes, like being a war hawk and supporting disastrous welfare-to-work programmes.In her chapter on being a woman in politics, she writes: ※When it comes to my more controversial actions 每 like giving President Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq 每 I was far from alone ＃ Why am I seen as such a divisive figure and, say, Joe Biden and John Kerry aren＊t?§ Clinton has survived egregious sexism in public for decades, yet her Iraq war vote seems like a poor thing to hide behind feminism. And let＊s not forget that Kerry was savaged by the right throughout his campaign, and ignored by an attenuated left.Meanwhile, Clinton recounts retiring to her home in Chappaqua, New York to read , drink Chardonnay and catch Broadway shows. This is meme Hillary, relatable as hell. (For what it＊s worth, I preferred the parts of the book that were wildly unrelatable, as when she settles on running for president while going on holiday with  in the Dominican Republic or goes to dinner at musician Jimmy Buffett＊s house or sits around with her husband debating whether she should run for president for a second time.)The quippy shtick doesn＊t always work, because Clinton fails to grasp basic criticisms levelled at her from a populist perspective to a degree that can＊t be winked away. After returning to private life in 2013, ※I spoke to audiences from a wide range of fields: travel agents and auto dealers, doctors and tech entrepreneurs, grocers and summer camp counselors. I also spoke to bankers,§ she writes.※Many of the organizations wanted the speeches to be private, and I respected that: they were paying for a unique experience. That allowed me to be candid about my impressions of world leaders who might have been offended if they heard. (I＊m talking about you, Vladimir.)§ She explains that her legislative record should have been enough to prove to critics that she was not unduly influenced by Wall Street, and says, perhaps rather petulantly, of the criticism: ※Just because many former government officials have been paid large fees to give speeches, I shouldn＊t have assumed it would be okay for me to do it.§It feels tiresome to explain this, but many Americans consider bankers the enemy, and voters wanted her to pick a side. The fact that she couldn＊t see that reveals a fundamental problem with her politics. And it isn＊t symbolic 每 America＊s particular form of political corruption is rarely a simple exchange of cash for laws. Instead, as a famous Princeton study has shown, wealthy institutions like banks exercise substantial influence over legislative outcomes through the softer power of lobbying and campaign donations, while average people and their institutions exercise almost none. It is laughable that an American politician would be indignant about her right to accept money from banks.But the worse error of interpretation comes when Clinton begins to analyse What Went Wrong. She is frustrated that  didn＊t drop out earlier, that he promised what she considers utopian policies, and that he made accusations that Trump adopted later 每 but her critiques are pretty light stuff. (Sanders responded that ※Secretary Clinton ran against the most unpopular candidate in the history of this country and she lost. She＊s upset about that and I understand ＃§) She primarily attributes her loss to what she calls ※tribal politics§ 每 a blend of racism, sexism and economic discontent 每 and FBI director ＊s press conference days before the election. She may be right about Comey shifting enough white swing voters to ultimately cost her the race. But Clinton＊s relationship to populism is more complicated.She repeatedly calls the populist discontent evident in America and Europe ※tribal politics§. In the American case, she＊s referring to Trump＊s base, which offered an abundance of reactionary nationalism, even though his base in the end was primarily the same old Republican party. What was more surprising were the populist politics coming from the left, a swath of young voters who could hardly be called ※tribal§, and who mirrored the behaviour of young voters supporting  in the UK,  in Spain,  in France, or  in Greece. Instead of really grappling with the new populist politics, she sounds frustrated, saying that she was talking about economics, citing her platform, her , and even a chart showing how many times she mentioned ※jobs§.This reluctance to engage with the growing populism in the US is endemic to the Democratic party, which, for example, rejected the Sanders-endorsed populist candidate  to head the Democratic National Committee after the election. But in the last few years, young Americans have been radicalised in greater numbers, leading police reform efforts and adopting socialist ideas, pushing the ※Overton window§ 每 the ideas people will accept 每 further open.Lots of things that Clinton says she wants, such as universal health care, have a new young constituency inspired by Sanders, which must be hard to swallow. What I see as promising, Clinton doesn＊t mention or regards, in the guise of Sanders followers, as a threat. As a result, organisations to the left of the Democratic party have grown, and it is losing the young people who should be its future. Clinton＊s memoir surely won＊t be the end of parsing what happened in 2016. But one thing is certain: what happens next will be up to somebody else.Sarah Leonard is a senior editor at The Nation. is published by Simon & Schuster.

"The public body responsible for looking after some of England＊s most historic places has issued a stern warning to people who indulge the art of stone stacking in protected spots. said that in some circumstances people who balance or stack stones may be breaking the law and could even face jail. Stacking or balancing stones is a pleasing pastime for some lovers of the outdoors and a precarious natural sculpture is a familiar sight on mountain, riverside and beach. But Historic England said stone stackers should not tamper with spots classified as ancient monuments. The warning followed concern that stone stacking was putting the neolithic site Stowe＊s Pound on Stowe＊s Hill in  at risk. and called for the registration plates of anyone seen piling stones to be taken and reported.The post said: ※Stowe＊s Hill is a 6,000-year-old settlement, built by our neolithic forebears. It is a protected, scheduled monument.※This practice is not only vandalism; it is illegal, and carries with it a possible prison sentence. If anyone sees anyone attempting to move stones please warn them of this and message us. Or try and get their registration number and message it to us.§Stuart Dow, 67, from Launceston, Cornwall, one of those concerned about Stowe＊s Hill, said he liked stone stacks in the right place. ※But a neolithic site is not the right place. It＊s disrespectful.§ Historic England said: ※Monuments scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 are of national importance. ※Permission is needed from Historic England if anybody wishes to make any changes to these protected monuments, including the moving of objects that belong to them. ※Any action that is potentially damaging to a scheduled monument will be investigated by Historic England in partnership with the local police and local landowner.§ The organisation added: ※Together we can use a range of interventions to deal with an incident in order to protect England＊s historic environment. These interventions include restorative resolution, formal warnings and in some cases, prosecution. In some instances offences are imprisonable.§Stowe＊s Pound on Bodmin Moor is one of a number of tor enclosures found in Cornwall where prominent hilltops were enclosed with substantial banks and ditches. It is believed to have been an important site for gathering and exchanging goods and ideas at a time when a lifestyle based on farming was replacing one of hunting and gathering. Daniel Ratcliffe, inspector of ancient monuments at Historic England South West, said: ※Two circuits of stone-built ramparts survive at Stowe＊s Pound within which there are remains of house platforms and cairns, and it is from these ancient archaeological features that many of the stones are being taken to construct the inevitably temporary ＆fairy castles＊, an increasingly common sight at beaches around the world.※This movement of stones, whilst it may seem benign, is eroding the nationally protected archaeological features of the site as well as its local distinctiveness. We would encourage visitors to take only photographs of, and to leave only footprints at, this very precious and unique site.§																																											"

"s everyone knows,  is a poem about a ※traditional§ family. A wife waits anxiously at home for her absent husband; a?man-child son, still living at home, dreams of his father and snaps irritably at his mother. The husband and father himself spends 10 years away at war, and another 10 making his?meandering way back home. The institution of marriage seems to lie at the heart of the poem, along with an accompanying set of double standards about gender. Odysseus spends seven years on the island of Ogygia, and in the bed of the beautiful, devoted goddess Calypso, plus another year with the sexy witch Circe. He suffers no negative repercussions, while ※faithful Penelope§ has to?ward off all her suitors as long as she?possibly can; doing nothing and nobody is the only way for a mortal woman to avoid the bad reputation of the oft-mentioned adulterers Helen and .So far, so predictably androcentric and heteronormative. It＊s easy enough to assume that the ancient and archaic Greeks, since they lived a long time ago, must have espoused values that we regard as ※traditional§ because they were the norms of Victorian or Edwardian England. But  is surprisingly complex in its account of the ideals and realities of family life, identity and home. As Daniel Mendelsohn shows in his brilliant new memoir/lit-crit essay, the trio of husband, wife and son is complicated by a vast array of other familial or quasi-familial relationships. Telemachus, Odysseus＊s son, is taught about masculinity and the elite norms of marriage by alternative father figures, Nestor and Menelaus, and by a?pair of marvellously intelligent and seductive alternative mother figures, Athena and Helen. Meanwhile, Penelope searches for escape in her weaving and her dreams, and Odysseus seems to find a series of alternative, albeit temporary homes with Calypso and Circe and the nubile Nausicaa. I would note, although Mendelsohn does not say this, that the protagonist has his most intimate and longest-running relationship not with Penelope but with the goddess Athena.Ancient Greek has no term exactly corresponding to our ※family§: the word  suggests lineage, while  means ※house§ or ※household§, including all the people in the house 每 whether or not they are related. The  to which Odysseus returns includes not only his biological father and son, but also the many other members of his household: his decrepit old dog, his resident poet and his multitude of slaves (including the pig keeper and other farm workers, the old wet nurse and the many minions kept to bathe and feed their owners). Mendelsohn sets an account of the Homeric  alongside a nuanced portrait of his own complicated familial and quasi-familial relationships, with his non-biological sons and their mother (who is neither a sexual nor a romantic partner), with his students, and with the many substitute parents (uncles, aunts, professors, teachers and friends) who have taught, mentored or inspired him during his life.Mendelsohn is a perceptive literary critic and a self-consciously elegant writer. His previous memoir, , explored the binaries of his double life, cruising the corners of Manhattan for pretty boys, and taking care of his son in the suburbs of?New Jersey. But his well-honed, authoritative sentences in that book seemed to come from a quite different third person: a master narrator, who is?certain of the ※truth§ about Greek myth and male sexual desire. The new memoir, which is a richer, deeper work, sheds keen light on this third identity: Mendelsohn the writer, the public intellectual and professor. The book shows us how his desire to become a?classicist was shaped in part by the desire to please his difficult father (who regretted abandoning his high school study of Latin), and how he shares some of his father＊s need to be always right. Most powerfully, Mendelsohn contrasts his account of Homer with his father＊s more critical response.The book tells how the 81-year-old Jay Mendelsohn, who had been a professor of mathematics, enrols in his son＊s class on  (taught in translation). Later, the two men take a?Mediterranean cruise, retracing the mythical journeys of Odysseus. As they travel, Daniel is surprised to see a sociable, personable side of his father, which had been barely visible in the aloof man who lived in the family home. Jay is, like Odysseus and perhaps all of us, : ※many-sided§ or ※much-turning§.Not all teachers would be eager to let a parent sit in on a class, let alone write about it afterwards. Daniel＊s courage is all the more admirable because Jay is a?disruptive presence, though he turns out to be a source of comic drama in the book. Having promised to sit at the back and say nothing, Jay becomes extremely vocal, expressing opinions about the poem that are opposed to those of his son. Daniel claims that Odysseus is presented as fully admirable and heroic, a claim he backs up by?resorting to desperate historicising (※Remember, this book represents the?product of a different culture§). Similarly, he makes the conventional but debatable claim that the marriage of Penelope and Odysseus is ※good§ or?※ideal§; it is, he says, an example of?※like-mindedness§ ( 每 a?term that Odysseus brings up in a self-interested attempt to chat up the?helpful foreign princess Nausicaa).Jay, however, repeatedly points out that there are many ways in which the lying, adulterous, boastful, violent, weepy and self-pitying Odysseus does not seem like much of a role model. To Daniel＊s great credit, he acknowledges that the students often seem to learn more from Jay＊s interpretations than from his own, and the meeting of the two perspectives leads to a far richer reading of the poem. The fault-lines mapped in the disagreements of?father and son correspond to some of the most fascinating interpretative questions of  itself, such as?whether people ever can or should be self-sufficient, whether you have a?single ※true§ identity and whether you can ever really know another person. The book also explores how?stories and shared memories help?people to form deep connections with?one another across time.It gives a vivid picture of Mendelsohn＊s anger, anxieties and embarrassments about his father 每 a man wary of hugs, reluctant to praise and stubbornly set in his ways. The dapper, urbane, New York intellectual son is?ashamed of Jay＊s brown polyester shirts, and frustrated by what seems like a limiting view of the world. But this is also a relationship of enormous affection. The book ends with the father＊s death, and it can be read as a kind of Kaddish: an act of mourning that involves making peace with the dead.There is a touching scene in which Daniel, who suffers from claustrophobia, has a panic attack while visiting the cave of Calypso on the cruise; Jay, who usually avoids all physical contact, takes his son＊s hand to comfort him in this moment of intense fear, as if he were still a little boy. Later, when the hand-holding comes up?in conversation with the other travellers on the cruise, Jay saves his son from embarrassment by claiming to have clutched at Daniel for stability on the steep climb. The sequence is surprising, not least because Jay is described as an obsessive adherent to the literal truth. His resistance to any kind of falsehood lies at the heart of his hostility to Odysseus and his scepticism about literary study in general. Jay＊s white lie is a beautiful moment, which speaks volumes about the fluidity of human identity, and the fluid relationship of parent and child, where each takes turns in caring for the other.Memoirs about reading are an interesting hybrid, located somewhere between criticism and personal recollection.  is a stellar contribution to the genre 每 literary analysis and the personal stories are woven together in a way that feels both artful and natural. The melding of craft with nature is represented, in the original , by one of its most famous scenes: the recognition of Odysseus by Penelope, when she pushes him into telling the story of how he built their marriage bed out of the olive tree that was growing through their house. Mendelsohn＊s book is framed by the story of another bed, made from an old door by Jay for his son as a child, which Daniel uses as a spare bed in his campus home. Jay mentions the door-bed when he sits in on the  seminar, and speaks of it for the last time on his deathbed, as a final way to forge a link with his son.The olive tree connects the house and bed, by its roots, to a particular place in the Ithacan earth. A door, by contrast, is made to open, hinting at Mendelsohn＊s growing awareness, traced in the memoir, that his relationship with his?father can change. The bed also suggests the father＊s care for his son, forged from whatever unpromising materials were to hand.  is?a?thoughtful book from which non-classicists will learn a great deal about Homer.

"I initially read George Monibot＊s somewhat utopian vision of a better world, based on a ※politics of belonging＃ rooted in community§?(, Review, 9 September)?with eager anticipation. But then I realised that he had not addressed the question of what ※belonging§ and ※community§ mean in the increasingly globalised, mobile, interconnected and multicultural realities that make up our world in the 21st century. As Zygmunt Bauman explained so well in his insightful books on ※liquid modernity§, more and more people (including me) are finding it difficult if not impossible to figure out where and with whom they belong in this contemporary reality.I have owned a house in a small town in the West Midlands for the last 11 years, but have only lived in it for five of those, because during the other six I＊ve lived and pursued my career in two other countries. And although I was born and grew up in?England, I have spent half my life living and working in another country, of which I am also a (dual) citizen. My families are scattered across the world. Now that I am back living in my house here, I cannot credibly claim that I belong in this community, and I suspect that it will be a long time, if at all, before those who have lived here all their lives will consider that I do. So what does a ※politics of belonging§ mean for me and millions of others like me? Although neoliberalism and social democracy might be seen as conflicting economic doctrines, their similarity is where our attention should be focused. Whether discussing nationalisation or international corporations the crucial point is they are both products of a ※boss system§. An injection of industrial democracy is needed if we are to achieve the kind of cooperative decentralised society George Monbiot seeks. History is full of failed utopias. But there are many successful ventures around the world that fit George Monbiot＊s values: co-operative movements, stakeholder organisations, ?shared ownership and not-for-profit businesses. These are documented in , which I commend to all who share Monbiot＊s altruism.																																											"

"The developers hoping to build a luxury hotel in one of Edinburgh＊s most famous buildings have asked Scottish ministers to intervene after their plans were rejected by councillors.Urbanist Hotels and Duddingston House Properties want to build a ※six-star§ hotel in and around the former Royal High School, a grade A-listed neoclassical building on Calton Hill regarded as a jewel of Edinburgh＊s world heritage site landscape. After their proposals to erect two large modern wings on either side of the old school were rejected unanimously by city councillors in late August, the developers confirmed on Tuesday they had asked ministers to order a full planning inquiry.David Orr, the co-founder of Urbanist Hotels, said: ※We remain wholly committed to delivering an outstanding scheme for the old Royal High School, reviving a building which has been allowed to slip into a state of disrepair and neglect for nearly 50 years.§Their appeal sets the scene for a battle between Edinburgh＊s powerful conservation lobby and developers over the integrity and preservation of the city＊s world heritage site, which was granted by the UN in 1995 in part because of the school. The developers, who have teamed up with Rosewood Hotels and Resorts, claim there is an unmet need in  for a luxury hotel catering for rich visitors. The city＊s other luxury hotels are full during high season and the festivals.They claim the 127-room hotel will generate ?35m a year for the Scottish economy, and provide as many as 850 jobs. Their opponents accuse the developers of exaggerating its economic value in an attempt to strong-arm ministers into over-riding objections.The scheme is being opposed by architecture and conservation bodies, including Edinburgh World  Trust (EWHT), the official guardian of its UN listing, the government agency Historic Scotland, the Cockburn Association and the Scottish Civic Trust.Cliff Hague, chair of the Cockburn Association and professor emeritus of planning at Heriot-Watt University, said the hotel proposal breached planning and local development policies designed to protect the world heritage site.※Probably more than any other building, it symbolises the Edinburgh Enlightenment. It is a neo-Grecian school and it was designed as a school; it is a temple to learning,§ Hague said. ※So to diminish that for a building which could be in Croydon 每 no offence to Croydon 每 but which is not definitive of that tradition but definitive of a global hotel brand, is just not appropriate.§ Designed by Thomas Hamilton, the Royal High School was opened in 1829 and occupied by the school for 130 years, but after it relocated to a new greenfield site on the city＊s western outskirts in 1968 the building fell into disuse.Close to the Scottish government＊s grade A-listed headquarters at St Andrew＊s House, the Royal High was mooted as the ideal home for the new Scottish parliament. After the site was deemed unsuitable, in 2009 the council granted Duddingston House Properties a long lease to take over and develop it after an open competition.Under intense pressure from objectors, city councillors and the council＊s planning officials have effectively reversed that 2009 decision by opposing both the consortium＊s original hotels plans and the scaled-down proposals rejected earlier this month. To the consortium＊s alarm, councillors, city planners and conservationists have meanwhile backed a rival scheme for the site to house St Mary＊s music school, one of the most prestigious in , with ?20m in funding from a wealthy trust, the Dunard Fund, which has received planning consent.Adam Wilkinson, the director of EWHT, said that was a powerful reason for the Scottish government to reject the hotel application. ※We objected to the hotel scheme because the proposal was entirely inappropriate for a building and landscape of such cultural and historical significance, and represented a threat to the outstanding universal value of the world heritage site,§ he said. ※There is now a fully funded viable alternative for the whole site, which this authority has given planning and listed building consent to, and which we judged to have no negative impact on the world heritage site.§Conservationists fear they will be out-spent by the hotel＊s developers, who plan to spend ?75m on the site, but are considering public funding appeals to help meet the legal costs of the planning inquiry. In 2015, they lost a battle against a luxury retail centre on the site of the St James＊s centre being built on the opposite side of Calton Hill, a short distance away, which features  due to its dramatic, bronze-coloured, bulbous and spiralling design. Hague said money should not be allowed to win this time. The Hamilton building ※is so exceptional you can＊t judge it against any other normal measure§, he said, even the promise of ※high rollers who wouldn＊t come otherwise and who will spend, spend, spend§.

"The real face concealed by a clay mask on the mummified head of a Scythian warrior has been revealed for the first time in almost 2,000 years. The head is on display in an  this week along with the scan, made in a St Petersburg hospital, which reveals that he had fine teeth, a ginger moustache, a pierced ear, a hole in his skull where his brains had been removed, and a savage wound, beautifully stitched and healed, which originally ran from the corner of his eye socket to the point of his jaw.Since the real head closely resembles the painted mask, the curator St John Simpson assumes that the faintly smiling mask of a young woman beside him, which has yet to be scanned, is also based on her appearance in life.Her body was found lying beside his in a timber-lined tomb chamber, and she almost certainly did not die a natural death.The Greek historian Herodotus left vivid accounts of the nomadic Scythian horsemen and archers who terrorised their neighbours from an empire stretching for centuries from the Black Sea to the borders of China. His stories, often doubted, have been vindicated by recent archaeological finds, and he wrote that when a princely warrior died, a concubine was often chosen to accompany him to the grave, along with servants and horses.※Herodotus says garrotting was used, so that would have been relatively quick and merciful,§ Simpson said. ※The horses we find in tombs were usually killed by a single blow between the eyes from a pointed battle axe 每 quite humane, like a captive bolt for a fallen race horse 每 so that could be another consideration.§ He added hopefully: ※We do also have to remember that people really do die of a broken heart.§ The scans were completed and processed so recently that they were seen for the first time in London by the Russian curators who accompanied the spectacular loans from the Hermitage museum in St Petersburg, including some of the first superb golden belt buckles and dress ornaments collected in the 17th century by Peter the Great. The exhibition, , also has loans from the new National Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and the Ashmolean and the Royal Collection in the UK. The nomads had no writing and built nothing permanent except their tombs, but fortunately buried everything from their world for the dead to use in the next. The displays include not just the superb golden ornaments and metal work including weapons and utensils, but, astonishingly preserved by the permafrost of Siberia, furs, textiles, wooden furniture and containers, tattooed human skin, horse harnesses and saddles, the oldest pair of chopsticks ever found outside China, and two lumps of cheese.Their luxury imports from China included beautiful silks so precious that even scraps were carefully kept and re-used, including a piece used to trim a child＊s quiver of arrows, found with the masked mummies in the Oklakhty burial ground in southern Siberia. There was also a tiny sheepskin coat, on which the man＊s head was pillowed.The same tomb held two even more eerie objects, which Simpson hoped to borrow for the exhibition: literally straw men, two life-size stuffed effigies, with clay masks similar to those on the real heads. They were too fragile to travel, and are still being studied 每 but the first x-rays suggest they contain cloth bags of cremated human remains, presumably carried on horseback across the plains until they could be added to the bodies lying in the family tomb.※When I saw them lying in a dimly lit room in St Petersburg, and one of the curators lifted the head 每 shedding bits of straw 每 to look at me, it was an image straight out of some Hollywood horror movie,§ Simpson recalled. ※I put the photograph on my office door as a way of saying ＆keep away from here＊ in the last three weeks I was working flat out trying to get the catalogue finished 每 it was very effective.§																																											"
"The UK＊s bookshops pay 11 times what Amazon does in corporation tax, according to a report from .The Bookselling Britain report was unveiled at the  Association＊s annual conference in Birmingham on Tuesday, revealing that bookshops contribute an estimated ?540m to the UK economy, and pay an estimated ?131m in tax, including ?12m in corporation tax. This equates to 91p per ?100 of turnover, the report said, which is 11 times the 8p rate that Amazon pays, according to the CEBR. Amazon＊s most recent accounts show that Amazon UK Services saw turnover rise to almost ?1.5bn in 2016, while corporation tax payments dropped from ?15.8m to ?7.4m year on year.The discrepancy was condemned by the Booksellers Association＊s Giles Clifton, head of corporate affairs. ※The BA has already highlighted the unequal treatment meted out by the business-rates system to British booksellers, the staggering 17 times differential between what the Waterstones on Bedford High Street pays in comparison with the  business unit a short distance away,§ said Clifton.※However, this report helps the BA take this to the next level and to confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt [that] an enormous financial gap exists between what UK booksellers put into the UK, and what Amazon does. At a time when the UK needs to be making the most of her own talents, and utilising all her resources, both cultural, economic, and other, why on earth are we persisting with a policy that is an act of gross self-harm? This stupidity must end.§The association＊s chief executive Tim Godfray added that bookshops were ※making an incredible contribution to the UK despite the many obstacles that they currently, and increasingly, face§. But the contribution was ※not sustainable unless decisive action is taken by the government to protect them from closure§, he said.Godfray added: ※Bookshops are currently closing at a rate of 3% per year, and 275 towns across the UK can expect to lose their bookshop completely due to changes to business rates if nothing is done. We hope that CEBR＊s report encourages our government to act to protect the nation＊s bookshops, and enable them to flourish.§Figures from the BA show that there are currently 867 independent booksellers in the UK, almost half the number that existed 11 years ago. According to the CEBR report, bookshops support 24,400 jobs in the UK, and pay ?416m in wages. But they are facing an ※increasingly challenging trading environment§, said the report, citing Amazon＊s market power and advantages, business rates and corporate taxation as issues that threaten the very existence of Britain＊s local and national booksellers.Speaking at the BA conference, CEBR director Oliver Hogan said that bricks-and-mortar bookshops had a range of advantages that Amazon did not offer, from involvement ※with more reluctant readers, helping them to find books they might enjoy§, to the events they put on and the ※physical interface§ that ※can trigger different and unpredictable exploration of themes and topics beyond what was intended§.Hogan continued: ※The Bookselling Britain report highlights the significant direct and multiplier impacts that bookshops have on the UK economy, despite facing numerous challenges. But the benefits to UK communities of local booksellers stretch beyond these monetary impacts, encompassing education, literacy and the provision of an informational and cultural conduit to society at large. All of this feeds technological progress and innovation, the key ingredients in achieving long-term economic growth.§Clifton added: ※It is high time the policymakers in this country woke up and smelt the coffee.§ 																																											"
"Jonathan Jones is wrong to say: ※It is not true that you can cut off a source of money to museums without harming art§ (, theguardian.com, 8?September). When that money comes from an unethical oil company such as BP, we have already harmed that art by putting our values up for sale. And that is what the National Portrait Gallery did last year. By turning a blind eye to BP＊s close ties to regimes that violate human rights 每 something that breaches the gallery＊s ethical fundraising policy 每 it was able to renew its BP sponsorship and clean up the company＊s tarnished reputation.What value is our?enjoyment?of art when it comes at the expense of those on the frontlines of climate change and the destructive impacts of the fossil fuel industry? We need art and our cultural institutions to expose injustice, promote debate and create change in society.?Denying  the social legitimacy of a sponsorship deal would allow the gallery to rescue its reputation before it is damaged any further, and be part of the shift to a fossil-free culture.

"y the end of his life, Senator Edward M Kennedy was ※the lion of the Senate§, a sturdy marble column of American liberalism for close to 50 years. His final substantive act was giving the Obama daughters their pet dog. But in 1969, though he was a powerful man on paper and next in line for the presidency, family insiders knew he was a joke.Joe Kennedy Jr, who died a war hero, was the favorite. John F Kennedy, the martyred president, had the charm. Robert Kennedy, who was supposed to be president, was the brilliant one. All this landed on the shoulders of Ted, the last living Kennedy son. He never had the respect of his father, but still lived in the glow reflected by admirers of his brothers, especially after the death of Bobby.This is all mapped out in Chappaquiddick, directed by John Curran and written by Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan. The screenplay is not adapted from any specific researched book, and when one of the themes is deception it＊s hard to know just how much of this actually happened. Maybe that＊s part of the point. One leaves Chappaquiddick, , awash in ambiguity. It＊s never a question of whether Kennedy＊s behavior was wrong, it＊s: how much are we supposed to hate him? Put bluntly, if you had immediate access to the most powerful network of political fixers at your disposal, just what would you do?Jason Clarke is strong as the weak senator, and he wisely goes easy on replicating . We meet him just as he＊s to take off for the weekend, an important one for the family legacy, with Apollo 11 about to land on the moon. This is framed as John F Kennedy＊s final action here on Earth and beyond. But it＊s also a weekend in which a party with the ※boiler room girls§ (young women who worked on the Kennedy campaigns) is planned on Martha＊s Vineyard.Among them is Kopechne (Kate Mara), a brilliant and loyal young woman who the Kennedy cousin/confidant/lawyer Joe Gargan (Ed Helms) is hoping will return for Ted＊s inevitable presidential bid in 1972. Ted and Kopechne pair off for a drive and the rest is history, even if we＊ll never know what really happened.Over the years, there have been plenty of conspiracy theories, from Ted being set up by Richard Nixon＊s CIA to Ted intentionally murdering the young woman to keep her quiet. What probably happened is what we see in the film: an accident caused by booze and a panicked man hoping it would all go away.The push and pull of this movie is really between the lead character and the audience. One moment we feel compassionate: he wants to do the right thing. The next moment he＊s gone down the cover-up rabbit hole and is an irredeemable swine. John Curran has a light touch, though. Even when we most hate Ted, we don＊t hate the film. Indeed, the cruelest scenes are when things really kick into gear, as when the handlers at the Kennedy Compound start talking about securing this poor young woman＊s body.The most repulsive moment comes when one of the Kennedy team schemers pulls in a favor from someone whom he knows to be ※loyal to the cause§. One is reminded that the cause, and everything the Kennedys are supposed to stand for, is righteousness. Ted Kennedy could do the honorable thing and resign, but that＊s certainly not what his wheelchair-bound father would want. (Bruce Dern plays Kennedy Sr, whose locked-in facial expression after his stroke is one of eternal disappointment.) One can debate if this is means the movie has a happy ending just as one can endlessly debate the morality of Ted Kennedy and power structures in general.																																											"
"ven in the hardest of horror films, there＊s still an understandable reticence to depict the graphic death of a child on screen. If it happens, it＊s usually as the result of some unavoidable tragedy but rarely at the hands of a villainous force. It＊s one of the many reasons that Stephen King＊s It endures. As an audience, we＊re gripped by a sick fascination and a staggering incredulity at seeing a clown rip the arm of a young child with its teeth, the knowledge that if happens then nothing is out of the realm of possibility.The first scene of nutty B-movie Mom and Dad sees a mother driving her baby onto train tracks before promptly walking away, car seat not in tow, as it all gets smashed to pieces by an oncoming train. It＊s a very clear message that for the next 83 minutes, anything goes. In an anonymous middle class community, something terrible is happening. A strange plague is affecting parents and it＊s making them want to kill their offspring as soon as humanly possible. A bored housewife (Selma Blair) and her disillusioned husband (Nicolas Cage) slowly succumb to this bloodthirsty rage as their two children are forced into defending their lives from the two people they thought would always protect them.There＊s something refreshingly upfront about Mom and Dad. Not only is the nasty opener a clear indication of its amorality but there＊s also a set of throwback credits to clue us in on the film＊s grindhouse leanings. This is an unrepentant midnight movie, dirty and violent and best enjoyed with a steady supply of alcohol. Director Brian Taylor is entirely aware of what he＊s making and who his audience is 每 and watched at just the right time, with just the right audience, it will prove to be a crowd-pleasing roof-raiser for many hardcore genre fetishists.Taylor is the man behind both Crank movies and he has a well-trained eye for confidently staged chaos, an underappreciated skill. Taylor joyfully upends our deep-rooted expectation of parental protection with a number of wildly perverse sequences: the crowd of baying parents bloodlusting after their kids outside the school gates; the creepily eager fathers watching their newborns behind hospital glass; and the woman casually pushing her stroller into the path of an oncoming car. There＊s also a jaw-dropper of a scene involving a mother in labor that will test the resilience of some (Roxette＊s It Must Have Been Love playing in the background is a delicious touch).Mom and Dad recalls the sadistic sourness of Nicolas Roeg＊s adaptation of Roald Dahl＊s The Witches, a strange, grim pleasure in watching adults turn against kids, and also The Purge, a film which equally benefits from the concept of widespread murderous madness. But like the latter, after we＊ve been given a brief peek at the ramifications for the world at large (there＊s even a cameo for Dr. Oz, who compares the plague to the ethological practice of savaging), the film turns into a home invasion thriller. There are still pleasures to be had but they＊re mixed up within more familiar territory. There＊s a half-decent, if shallow, stab at satire too, with flashbacks revealing a couple bemoaning their dull suburban lives and wistfully remembering a time when opportunities seemed more fruitful. Kids have become an unwanted presence for many parents before the rage has even arrived, adding another sly layer of cruelty to the later violence.Cage＊s natural inclination to turn his performances all the way up to, and past, 11 is exploited here to its full extent. He relishes every nutso second, whether it be destroying a pool table with a sledgehammer while singing the Hokey Cokey, or barking at his son while swinging an electric saw. He＊s almost neither good or bad but transfixing nonetheless. Mom and Dad is a short, mean-spirited film, a toxic antidote to scrolling through the cooing Instagram feeds of child-obsessed friends. There＊s a regrettably abrupt ending which feels rather like a cop-out but the infanticidal imagery will linger, whether you like it or not.																																											"
"rom the opening minutes of Chef: Come Dine With Us, the audience members know that they are unlikely to get away with sitting quietly in their seats. A chef in a green apron is looking for a ※beautiful lady§ and he is determined to find her in the crowd.When the lucky (or unlucky, depending on how you view audience interaction at the theatre) young woman is found, she is sat on a chair in the centre of the stage in front of five currently unmanned cooking stations, at which point the chef proceeds to serenade her with a heavily accented rendition of Only You while fashioning a rose out of a napkin. This is only the first of many moments in which the audience will be called upon to play a role in this ludicrous and hilarious South Korean production from Persona Inc and Atobiz Ltd, showing at Brisbane＊s Powerhouse arts centre as part of .Insofar as a plot exists, it is this: Green Chef (Taemin Jung) and his older, fatter, moustachioed rival Red Chef (Seongmin Oh) are in a culinary showdown. After taking orders for various cuisine from the audience 每 chicken noodle soup, pizza, bibimbap 每 the chefs compete with each other to concoct the tastiest and most impressive version of each dish. Red Chef and Green Chef are assisted in their ostentatious, absurd and increasingly dramatic efforts by the lace-clad Sexy Chef (Minyoung Lim), perpetually flatulent Rookie Chef (Jaehong Park) and Cutie Chef (Jooha Song), whose frilly dress and giant pink bows belie the murderous rage that she occasionally unleashes on the hapless object of her affections, the bicep-flexing Iron Chef (Seungkoo Baek). This cast of caricatures has a video-game quality about it, which is only amplified by the cartoonish and exaggerated manner in which everything on stage occurs. The assistant chefs have other talents too 每 mainly in the realm of singing and dancing, puppetry and slapstick. Audience involvement is required to stage everything from awkward first dates to a noodle-dough-pillow assault 每 a clear favourite with the large number of children in the audience for the Saturday night show I attended. One particularly memorable sequence involving glow-in-the-dark sock-puppet fish is a reminder of just how effective simple visual tricks can be when done with slick professionalism. The stagecraft on show here is not particularly complex 每 there are a lot of swift prop substitutions under tables and so on 每 but the smoothness of the delivery and the sharply timed slapstick takes the performance to another level.Two beatboxers, Rhythm Chef (Seongjun Park) and MC Chef (Daehan Wii), provide the vast majority of the sound effects for what is essentially one long musical food fight. They are both extremely talented 每 they are the glue that holds this top-notch ensemble performance together 每 and their encore solo is a satisfying indulgence for the pair. In spite of all the on-stage chaos, Chef: Come Dine With Us runs at a lean 75 minutes 每 which is just enough utterly meaningless, totally absurd and thoroughly entertaining fun for one evening.

"The Children Act is a high-minded, stately and rather  drama, directed by Richard Eyre and adapted by  from his 2014 novel; it stars  as a brilliant and widely admired judge, Fiona Maye, on whose decisions the fate of various barristers and clients depend. Her name could be a playful pun. Fiona＊s ruling in a uniquely painful case concerning a desperately sick teenage boy coincides with her own marital crisis, which we are given to understand is crucially bound up with her childlessness. This is the second McEwan adaptation of the Toronto festival in fact, the other being his , and rather like that movie this is bracingly intelligent and civilised, with very good actors directed with clarity and care. There is at all times an elegant exposition of detail. But just as with Chesil Beach, I felt that there is something a little desiccated about the action, something self-conscious and pedagogic in its address to the audience. This is a world of successful, well-off people working late at night in tastefully furnished homes listening to classical music while their quizzical spouses ask if they are coming to bed. We see a semi-breakdown in public, a climactic private scene with tears, but never a real explosion of energy. For me, The Children Act comes to life most passionately in a relatively unimportant montage early on in the movie: Fiona is smartly despatching a series of lazy and dodgy lawyers and plaintiffs appearing in front of her. There is great wit and style here, and of course no lack of wit and style in Emma Thompson＊s performance 每 it is a cousin, perhaps, to her radical lawyer Gareth Peirce in Jim Sheridan＊s 1993 film In the Name of the Father. The case itself could hardly be more contemporary and urgent, with parallels to the  case. Fiona is asked to rule on the matter of the married parents (played by Ben Chaplin and Eileen Walsh) of a boy, Adam (Fionn Whitehead) just shy of 18 years old and adulthood, who is suffering from cancer. They are Jehovah＊s Witnesses and will not permit him the simple blood transfusion which would save his life. But because Adam is a legal minor, Fiona can make decisions in his interests which would go against the parents＊ religious scruples 每 which Adam appears to share. Almost every week, Fiona has to deal with some Solomonic dilemma and she does so with enormous professionalism and conscientiousness. But it has taken a terrible toll on her marriage and her academic husband Jack 每 a slightly sketchily written role with which  does his best 每 candidly tells her he＊s thinking of having an affair. He moves out and as Fiona grapples with the crushing ethical dilemma, she must also think what her life has been about. It is a highly watchable drama of the highly educated public-servant class 每 it would make a good stage-play 每 and the film is put together with an intelligence which saves it from being preposterous, although that＊s a bit of a close thing. There＊s a shrewd eye here for the pageantry and complacency of the English law: Jason Watkins has a nice role as Fiona＊s simpering clerk. As for Fiona＊s fraught relationship with Adam itself, it stems from her sensational and irregular decision to leave the courtroom and talk to Adam himself on his hospital bed. (Wouldn＊t Adam be required to be on oath somehow, the way a courtroom witness would? Wouldn＊t someone insist on an official court record of their conversation? Well, perhaps not 每 or perhaps the flouting of rules at this stage is the point. The film is impeccably researched.) Yet the drama suggests that this is all driven at some level by the fact that Fiona has no children, and some may not agree with the implication that childlessness is obviously problematic psychologically, and therefore serves as a dramatic explanation for her behaviour. Well, in fact it is not the sole explanation 每 there is Jack＊s own behaviour and the happenstance of Adam＊s interest in some certain poignant writings of Yeats. The Children Act is concerned with love, intimacy and moral responsibility and it is refreshing to see a movie which sets itself standards of this sort. But there is also something a little too neat in the way all these things are wrapped up. Emma Thompson＊s performance, so elegant and vulnerable, carries the picture.																																											"

"If a podcast can be at once disturbing and relaxing, Within the Wires (Night Vale Presents/iTunes) falls right between the two. A new season of the audio drama has just started, and it is as immersive as storytelling gets.Last season comprised 10 relaxation tapes that were sinister and surreal. They quietly laid a bloody trail of horror. The new season is an equally unnerving take on museum audio guides. The first instalment is set in the  and narrated by Rima Te Wiata, who plays an artist talking about the work of her mentor, the mysterious Claudia Atiero, who disappeared suddenly. She paints a picture of a parallel world, after ※the great reckoning§ 每 a revolution that changed the way people lived. There are so many intriguing threads and, within half an hour, Atiero has hooked you. Te Wiata may ostensibly be describing imaginary paintings, but she also unravels the story of her disastrous interview with the artist, which ended abruptly when Atiero threw a plate against the wall in a cafe. ※It broke into three large pieces and each shard was possibly worth more than I make in a year,§ she says, in her soporific tour-guide voice. Like other Night Vale podcasts Alice Isn＊t Dead and The Orbiting Human Circus (of the Air), this is a series that demands a second listen. What happened to the artist? And what happened to society after the revolution? It＊s a world so absorbing that the click of the tape recorder at the end brings you back to reality with a bump.Researcher and music educator Anita Collins takes you through the science behind the lullabies we sing to our children. I discovered this podcast at just the right time 每 after weeks of ※I can sing a rainbow§ I was beginning to lose my mind, but this podcast saved me. Not only does it sound beautiful but it＊s so informative. It is fascinating when science backs up ancient cultural traditions and the series really explores the benefits of singing lullabies, even to unborn children, and the deep connection it creates. The best thing I learned was that each culture has its own lullaby versions, so it turns out I wasn＊t the only one singing the same tune night after night. The whole experience is captivating. My Home Planet is a podcast ※for seekers of planet heroes§. It＊s about people who do everything they can to take care of our planet. Host Natasha Milne interviews everyone from ocean warriors to explorers, conservationists and CEOs, and it amazes me that there are so many different jobs out there. Particular favourites are Kartick Satyanarayan of Wildlife SOS and Joanna Young, a glaciologist in Alaska 每 they＊re really fascinating interviewees. Natasha understands that all issues are interrelated and that if we want to care for our planet we need to be informed about not just climate change but animal welfare, conservation, business leadership, environmental justice and everything in between. My Home Planet is a beautiful passion project, one that we all need to listen to. There is something raw and magical about We Still Like You. It＊s a live show where people talk about what they＊re ashamed of, and it＊s incredibly intimate 每 you almost feel like you＊re listening to something contraband. You＊re not just hearing a story, you＊re witnessing people reveal the worst thing about themselves while a room full of strangers reacts in real time. And boy do they react. The audience cringe and squeal and cuss. Sometimes they literally scream. It＊s always empathetic but never squeamish when covering taboo topics. People will love the show for being this vulnerable but also consistently funny and punk rock as hell. There＊s a back-to-school feel to the return of Politics Weekly as MPs trickle back into parliament to compare suntans, resume plotting and re-engage with the reality of Brexit. Our political editor Heather Stewart kicks off the new term, which began with a major Guardian scoop: a leaked document outlining a government plan to restrict EU migration. With London and Brussels continuing an increasingly tetchy set of exchanges, the coming weeks and months in British politics are unlikely to be dull. Can the government make any progress in Brussels? Will its minority in parliament manage to get anything done at home? Could Labour find itself in government sooner than expected? And how on earth did Jacob Rees-Mogg become the favourite to succeed Theresa May? Not all these questions have simple answers. 																																											"
"he expert British post-bop saxophonist  has toured with stars from Frank Sinatra and Ray Charles to Cleo Laine, is an eloquent interpreter of Dave Brubeck classics in pianist  and has led a raft of his own album sessions down the years 每 but with eight originals on the album, this is perhaps his most personal venture, aided by long-term partners Graham Harvey on keys, Geoff Gascoyne on bass and Sebastiaan de Krom on drums. The title track, with its sly and sidelong cool-bop theme and walking bassline, could have come straight off a 1960s Blue Note session, as could O＊Higgins＊ masterful tenor solo of hard-accented runs and warbling blues wails. His tenor sound is forceful on the  Nothing to Lose and his soprano playfully graceful on One for Big G. But the four covers are the standouts, with O＊Higgins＊ sense of improv form at its most secure on Chico Chagas＊s film-noiresque Brixton, the late  staccato Timelessness, and a patiently lyrical, blues-infused Easy Living.

"s dab hands go at brooding with a banjo on an album cover,  is your dabbest. On his first album in four years (his 35th or so, if you＊re scanning his long, lush career), travel and nature are his subjects, flexing like sinews through his chosen songs. Our guide is a warm and comforting soul, catching a boat with us to England on Jackson C Frank＊s Blues Run the Game, stripping away the unease from a journey through town on Emily Portman＊s Bones and Feathers, charming us with old ballads such as Rufford Park Poachers, and luring us up mountains with the sly, bold Reynardine. Simpson＊s playing, as ever, is technically stunning, intricate and exquisite, but it also lulls the listener with its loveliness, rather than directing ears to the meat and muscle of his stories. One for those who like their journeys cosseted and steady, rather than rough-and-ready.																																											"
"What would happen if you put two estranged people in a room together and told them to maintain eye contact for five minutes without speaking?Would it break the impasse? Would there be a release of tenderness without a word being uttered? Or would anger and resentment resurface?And what about the experience for the viewer? Surely watching people looking at each other without speaking would make for terrible television?This is the premise of . According to the show, around 3 million people in Australia are estranged from a loved one. The show seeks to put people in the same place so they can make a decision: either cut the cord and move on, or reconnect with each other.This show is compelling perhaps in spite of its premise (it calls to mind ), it is beautifully shot and unsentimental in its way, yet I challenge you to watch it without crying. Ray Martin＊s hosting is restrained and careful: it is the stories of the participants that are allowed to shine.The first story is incredible, partly because it does not go down the route of reuniting estranged loved ones, although many of the other stories in the series do.Ayik Chut is a South Sudanese man now living in Australia with his young family. Growing up as a child soldier, Ayik tried to escape his compound many times. When he was caught, he was whipped and tortured by a guard.Fast-forward 20 years and Ayik is worshipping at his church in Brisbane when suddenly he sees the guard in the congregation. His first impulse is to kill him. He flees the church.Ten years pass, but Ayik can＊t stop thinking about the guard. ※If I don＊t talk to him, if I don＊t face him, then I can＊t forgive him,§ he says. ※And that will be in my mind and that will hurt me.§To forgive is to be released. It＊s not like the dreaded American self-help term of ※closure§ 每 it＊s some impulse that＊s much older and deeper. Then the experiment: Ayik is greeted by host Ray Martin outside a big warehouse. He＊s about to go in and meet his torturer. The tension and emotion are sky high, yet nothing about this scenario feels exploitative. We, the audience, are deeply invested: we want Ayik to see it through and will stick by him until he does.In this episode we also meet Sue and Gary 每 a long-married couple who have drifted apart and separated.※When you don＊t look after something you lose it, and that＊s what happened,§ says Sue, in tears.She realised she still loves Gary and wants him back: ※And even if he doesn＊t love me, that＊s OK. I just have to say it.§The experiment she and Gary are about to undertake reminds me of a passage in Helen Garner＊s Tower Diary essay: ※Couldn＊t there be a room somewhere, where ex-couples might briefly meet from time to time, just to sit at a table and laugh together or cry 每 to tell the small stories and the big, to remind each other of the things they learnt together ＃ ?§Watching this couple sit together in silence and just look at each other is unexpectedly moving and intimate.  shows for so long have tried to create similar tension by creating false or heightened realities. A contestant has their cake judged by a celebrity chef for example, and there is dramatic music, her bottom lip wobbles as the cake is eviscerated, and the tears fall.Look Me in the Eye is in a different league. The emotions and situations these people are dealing with don＊t have to be artificially enhanced or given the TV steroids of a swelling soundtrack and close-up shot of tears (although there is that too).It is in some ways the emo cousin of True Story with Hamish & Andy: so-called everyday people have inner lives and stories of incredible depth and richness, and by telling those stories, Look Me in the Eye shines with authenticity and truth.

"othing is ever enough 每 I couldn＊t create if it was!§ You have to admire writer-director Darren Aronofsky＊s almost religious devotion to the parable-like possibilities of hyperventilating, surrealist cinema. Having caught critics＊ attention with the cult low-budget sci-fi oddity  and proved his gritty mettle with , Aronofsky gave us time-straddling cosmic madness in , combined ballet with metamorphic fantasy in , and conjured gigantic rock-monsters in the quasi-biblical babble-fest . Now with , a paranoid nightmare that starts out like Polanski＊s  and winds up closer to , he has stretched the envelope of outrageous mainstream cinema to breaking point 每 and beyond.We start and end in flames, with an image of a fiery face giving way to a mysterious crystal, which breathes life and light into a charred, blackened house. This is the home of Javier Bardem＊s ※Him§ (all characters are unnamed), nurtured anew by Jennifer Lawrence＊s devoted wife. Octagonal in shape, the house variously resembles a vast temple and a panopticon prison, with a sinister hint of the haunted lair from . It is a living presence, with a heartbeat that thrums through its walls and floorboards, umbilically linked to Lawrence＊s barefoot ※Mother§ who harbours as-yet-unrealised dreams of parenthood.Within this Edenic idyll, Bardem＊s jaded poet is failing to write his masterpiece 每 until the arrival of a mysterious stranger (Ed Harris) and his glamorous, garrulous spouse (Michelle Pfeiffer) tickles his egotistical fancy. Seemingly blind to his wife＊s nesting instincts, the poet revels in the adoring chaos these outsiders bring. Gradually, ＊s anxieties about breach of privacy turn to something closer to home invasion horror, with the narrative straying into the territory of Graham Greene＊s short story . And then things start getting wild at heart and crazy on top.Aronofsky has said that the first draft of  poured out of him in a five-day ※fever dream§ and it＊s tempting to review the result in similarly spontaneous fashion. Yet more than any other of Aronofsky＊s works, this is a film that demands distance and decompression. In the screening room I found  an increasingly exasperating experience 每 a claustrophobic exercise in ghastly black comedy; relentless, ridiculous, and occasionally panic-inducing. Yet give it time to settle, and the labour pains of watching  produce something that you could grow to love.The narrative can be read in any number of ways: as a -style expression of antenatal paranoia; as a war-of-the-sexes fable about older men feeding upon the support of younger women; even as a simple tale of marital breakdown. Yet there＊s clearly an overarching allegory here about impending eco-catastrophe and the mistreatment of Mother Earth. Aronofsky is understandably cagey about specific meanings, but he＊s spoken of the film as  threatened by overpopulation, climate change, poisonous politics and war. For him, this is a tale of ※a woman who is asked to give and give and give until she can give nothing more§.This is familiar territory for Aronofsky, who cast Russell Crowe as a fundamentalist eco-warrior in , but then left it up to Jennifer Connelly＊s nurturing Naameh to lend an engaging human face to his antihero＊s swivel-eyed ravings. Indeed, one might see  as a sister movie to ＊s ※Father!§, a revisiting of the Genesis myth with its own Cain and Abel in the shape of Domhnall and Brian Gleeson, and featuring Bardem as an insufferably smug divinity. It＊s certainly a tale of false messiahs, evoking the recurrent chant from the third act of  (※there＊s more at the door§) with the declaration that ※The poet says it＊s everyone＊s house!§Throughout this escalating madness, cinematographer Matthew Libatique keeps his widescreen lens close to Lawrence, peering over her shoulder, pushing into her face, capturing her singular point of view in long takes that echo Maryse Alberti＊s pursuit of Mickey Rourke in . This is first-person cinema, a subjective sensory experience, part waking dream, part walking nightmare. Unsurprisingly, Aronofsky cites Bu?uel＊s  as influential, although horror fans may find themselves recalling the insane grotesqueries of , along with the pulsating plastic realities of David Cronenberg＊s .As for me, the further away I get from , the closer it moves to my heart. It＊s a delirious, disgraceful experience 每 just make sure you give it space to breathe.																																											"
"eople leave gigs early for many reasons: nicotine withdrawal, trains, the high cost of babysitters. And having lost fluids and a few personal items cavorting around to a full-on rendition of  tonight, Killers fans could be forgiven for thinking that, with the band＊s signature tune out of the way, there couldn＊t be much left to see in the encore＃Not many bands would think of this venue as intimate. But the Las Vegas outfit are warming up 每 sort of 每 for a colossal November run through UK arenas: that＊s 14 of them, all sold out. The faithful have already been given a rare airing of Andy, You＊re a Star, which singer Brandon Flowers says the Killers haven＊t played live for 11 years. It is a little incongruous, hearing a relatively underfed early song flushed with the girth of the Killers＊ success. If anything, tonight＊s set suffers a touch from this oversaturation and Brixton＊s muddy sound. Songs that should sound lean and hungry sound sated and portly (the indie disco thrash of ). Everything has an epic lean. It＊s a small gripe 每 the Killers＊ cover of Joy Division＊s Shadowplay still manages a little minimalism 每 but light and shade are perhaps sacrificed to the mistaken belief that the Killers have to pile anthem upon anthem.They have them, of course. Mr Brightside unleashes a collective frenzy in both crowd and band, as glorious a treatment of sexual jealousy as you could wish for.  paces the stage, whipped into a state, channelling his narrator＊s nauseated misery, as animated as he has been all evening.The band then stalk off for an agonisingly long time. A lot of people need to pee: Flowers, whose keyboard is bedecked with a light-up neon pink male symbol, probably a reference to their recent single, The Man; drummer Ronnie Vannucci, and guitarist Ted Sablay (a longtime associate, filling in for the absent Dave Keuning). Then there＊s bassist Jake Blanton (filling in for bassist Mark Stoermer, who has retired from touring), multi-instrumentalist Taylor Milne, and three backing vocalists, who stand behind neon female symbols, adding a classy coo to proceedings.People stream out. Then suddenly, ※The illustrious, praiseworthy Dr Woody Harrelson§ is on stage, and introducing a brand new Killers song, The Calling, on its live debut. Like a river suddenly reversing its course, people stream back. In his mesmeric drawl, the gangly Harrelson quotes electrically from the Bible 每 Matthew 9:11 每 where Jesus sits down to eat with ※publicans and senators§ (sinners, in short). The actor does this very reading on the new Killers album,  每 the band＊s fifth, due out on 22 September. Happily, kismet found Harrelson in London this week. He turns what has been a solid enough Killers gig, full of hits and Andy, into a much more memorable one.The Calling, too, is striking. It＊s not a Bruce Springsteen tribute, one of the Killers＊ favourite modes since 2006＊s . Instead, it packs a sleazy, Depeche Mode swing. Flowers, though, is singing about having ※the last two chapters of Matthew in my hand§. The band have long bounced between faith 每 Flowers is a Mormon 每 and their formative experiences in Vegas: Sin City, as it＊s known. Pretty much all of human nature lies in between, so it＊s fertile ground. ※Lean into the light,§ urges Flowers here, as Vannucci thumps like a caveman.The new album is set to be a departure for the Killers, not least because of the decision of two founding members not to tour (it＊s weird not seeing the right faces on stage). Flowers has put his storytelling bent on hold to write more personal songs.

A strutting pastiche of masculinity, it borrows from David Bowie 每 a clever wink, as the artist was not known for his aggressive manliness 每 and, unexpectedly, sounds a little like Arcade Fire. Best of all, it gives the Killers lashings of funk.																																											"
"ennis addicts can rest easy 每 in the sense of staying up all night to watch tennis. Somewhere in the world an important tournament is under way and on subscription TV. The less seriously committed are faced with the long inter-slam drought between the US and Australian Opens. Fortunately palliatives are at hand in the form of two movies,  and .The first film is about the  between Billie Jean King and the self-proclaimed male chauvinist pig and former world No 1 Bobby Riggs; the second focuses on the 1980 Wimbledon final. They are linked by the way that in 2000 Donald Trump offered John McEnroe a million dollars to play either of the Williams sisters at one of his hotels. As McEnroe recounted in his 2002 autobiography , the sisters＊ claim that ※they could beat ranked male players§ prompted him to respond that ※any respectable male player, be it a top college competitor, a senior player, or a professional, could beat them§. Trump stumped up the money but the Williamses ※came to their senses and put out a statement that they didn＊t want to play against ＆an old man＊§.That was the end of that until this summer when McEnroe published a sequel,  每 a book even well-disposed critics had trouble taking seriously 每 and, possibly as a controversy-provoking way to nudge it up the rankings, ventured the opinion that Serena would be ranked around 700 on the men＊s tour. She volleyed back that he should respect her privacy 每 at about the time that she had appeared naked and pregnant on the cover of . History has a way of repeating itself, first as farce and then as farce.The difference is that the first time around, when 29-year-old King played the 55-year-old Riggs, it was precisely the farcical nature of the encounter that made it so serious. Riggs, as King understood, was a clown and a hustler, and the more ridiculous his antics the more demeaning it would be if she lost. Especially since he had already beaten  who, exactly as predicted, wilted under the pressure of the occasion. So while Riggs did everything he could to publicise the forthcoming bout, King trained for it.Since all of this 每 build-up, match and aftermath 每 was filmed, recut and retold in an excellent , the question is whether there was any need to re-enact the story in a biopic. Perhaps the fact that there was no need freed the film-makers Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris to come up with a striking piece of cinema in a way that the similarly superfluous  never managed. is wonderful as Billie Jean (so wonderful as to make one wonder: was she quite so charming in real life?) and Steve Carell＊s Riggs is a far more nuanced 每 and tormented 每 character than the cartoon sexist he gleefully set himself up to be. As BJK realises, Riggs is both a colourful manifestation of and an energetic distraction from the blazered patriarchy at work behind the scenes. More subtly, camerawork and design do not just capture the colours and textures of the early 1970s 每 how can one not adore the sun-swept, traffic-less freeways of California? 每 but also a broader sense of historic convergence.An altogether less dramatic moment in the vexed history of the sexes occurs in Rebecca West＊s immense book about Yugoslavia,  The author is in a restaurant in Pristina in the 1930s, when a man and a woman enter, the woman carrying ※the better part of a plough on her back§. The sight of ※unrestricted masculinism§ of this kind is ※disgusting§ to West, less because of the effect on women ※who are always taught something by the work they do, but because of the nullification of the men§. In a hectic schedule of publicising matches, flogging tickets, looking pretty and playing tennis with each other 每 plus, in BJK＊s case, having her first lesbian love affair 每 the rebellious women on the tour are seen having a high old time. With the exception of Billie Jean＊s devoted dude of a husband 每 the most poignant scenes in the film show him taping ice to her aching knees 每 and the gay costumiers on the women＊s nascent tour, the men remain imprisoned by what they unthinkingly thought they were preserving.If anything the fact that the result was so clear-cut 每 Riggs got his ass royally kicked in straight sets 每 makes the waters seem less turbulent than they were. Contrast the well-orchestrated hoopla of the match in Houston with a debate on feminism in New York two years earlier, as preserved in the documentary. Holding the fort in the name of＃ well, himself really, Norman Mailer struggles manfully to fend off a gang of marauding brainy women including Susan Sontag, Germaine Greer and Diana Trilling. It＊s all just talk but the anarchic swirl and passion of the event make the Houston contest seem as decorous as a mixed-doubles match at Wimbledon. In  Stone/King recalls how, as a little girl, she was excluded from a team photograph because she was wearing shorts. At that moment she decided to take up her racket-cudgel on behalf of womankind. This stand casts her as an infant Jeanne d＊Arc, predestined for saintly and bespectacled greatness. That, I suppose, is part of the attraction of politically symbolic sporting events such as Jack Johnson v James J Jeffries or  v the Nazis in Berlin in 1936. They make everything simple, while life proves stubbornly resistant to resolution by knockout or tie-break.Still, better King v Riggs than Borg v McEnroe which seems entirely 每 and for a tennis film fatally 每 pointless. The outcome of the match is known in advance and nothing except that result is at stake 每 unless you buy into the idea that somehow McEnroe, ※the kid from Queens§, as the lawyer＊s son never tires of describing himself, was somehow trying to bring down the English ruling elite as symbolised by the lawns of SW19 and the umpires who were their myopic custodians. The film retains vestiges of interest, only if one attends to everything except its titular match-up.Waiting to come on court for the final, Bj?rn and John sit on a bench beneath the famous lines from Kipling: ※If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster / ?And treat those two impostors just the same＃§ It＊s as if the audience＊s doubts have been projected on screen! The film is really a  contest, but it＊s impossible to treat the contestants in the same way. Sverrir Gudnason looks so like Borg it makes one conscious of how unlike McEnroe Shia LaBeouf looks. Method-wise,  would seem to have had the advantage in that he has acted like a jerk in real life, and McEnroe＊s inner life has been demonstrably and repeatedly expressed on court and off. With McEnroe forever acting up 每 contractually obliged, it seems, to reprise the role of his tantrum-prone younger self even on the senior circuit 每 LaBeouf is left with little to do except brood on how his hair looks more like Bob Dylan＊s than Johnny Mac＊s. Borg, meanwhile, remains a mystery.McEnroe/LaBeouf suspects that the reason his opponent sleeps in a hotel room with the AC turned up to arctic frigidity is not that he＊s an ice-borg; he＊s really a volcano about to erupt. We know this is true because of the scenes from Borg＊s adolescence where he seems to be getting in character for the racket-smashing role of forever-young McEnroe/Dylan. His trainer persuades him to harness those tears of rage and express them solely through forehands and backhands.Where, to rephrase ＊s moving speech in , does the rage come from? Partly because he＊s been told tennis is not for certain classes of person. More generally 每 and the film is necessarily vague on this score 每 from some non-specific Scandinavian malaise: an all-court rumble of Hamlet, Kierkegaard, Ibsen and Strindberg, barely held in check by a sweaty headband. (Or could it be caused by the headband?) So while LaBeouf is playing superbrat in a tennis flick, Gudnason wanders around as if marooned in an Ingmar Bergman film directed neither by Bergman nor his acolyte Woody Allen but by Janus Metz. ※What＊s going on in that head of yours?§ people keep asking. No one knows and nothing in the script rivals the way the question was framed by the poet William Scammell when he wondered whether it was ※chess against a breaking wave / or just some corny Abba tune§.Which leaves us, as always, with the tennis. In this regard the critical heart of the matter was articulated years ago by my dad. I was watching a Woody Allen film on TV, a sequence in which Allen＊s character plays squash. My dad had no idea who Allen was but after watching for a few minutes said, ※The li＊l un＊s not up to much is he!§ It＊s as simple as that. Can the tennis players in these films play tennis? Yes they can. I assume that this is a product of technology whereby the heads of the actors can be grafted on to the bodies of their doubles. But the issue is not only whether they can play tennis well enough. They have also to be able to play  enough. Compared with today, tennis of the 1970s looks a leisurely, almost sub-aqua affair, but any difference in overall  is also a technologically induced illusion. Only pole-vaulting has been as thoroughly reconfigured by advances in equipment as tennis.Stone＊s last big hit, , negotiated a similar problem. Can she and Ryan Gosling dance like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers? No they can＊t. The solution is to let the camera do the dancing. In the battle to replicate the actual tennis,  is more effective than  for exactly the opposite reason. Whereas in the latter the camera is down there on court, moving in close and scampering after the ball, the former opts for viewing the match as though on TV: a reminder that although as a tennis match it was pretty silly, it was the spectacle 每 seeing Riggs make a spectacle of himself in front of a television audience of 90 million 每 that mattered. Aesthetically it also takes us back to the 1970s when cameras were not able to immerse us in every-angle HD closeups of the shifting narrative increments of a match.Ironies abound. The celebration of women＊s tennis being taken seriously comes at a time when women＊s tennis is in danger of becoming seriously boring, as endless players from eastern Europe and beyond 每 ※all these new -ovas§, as Venus Williams wittily put it 每 thump the ball into the middle of the second week. There have been quite a few one-sided semis and finals in recent years but the close-fought conclusion to this year＊s tournament at Indian Wells between Svetlana Kuznetsova and Elena Vesnina was a prolonged exercise in endurance 每 for anyone watching. The problem is not a lack of personalities; it is the surfeit of women whose games are all but indistinguishable from each other. Qualities traditionally identified as feminine 每 grace, delicacy and beauty 每 have become the exclusive preserve of the men＊s game. (The dudes even cry more than the chicks!)I say ※preserve§ because those qualities have long been endangered in the men＊s game too. Watching John Isner, Kevin Anderson and Sam Querrey remains one of the less edifying sporting experiences available. We have become used to dads like Mike Agassi and Richard Williams pushing their kids to become players from infancy. The next move might well be to breed monstrously tall, big-servers in a laboratory. In spite of this, the men＊s game is presently more pleasing to the eye than the women＊s. This was not always the case.  is lauded as a throwback to the serve-and-volley heyday of Wimbledon 每 but hey, that day often comprised serve minus volley. To go from Ivan Lendl plying his joyless trade to watching Steffi Graf play was like seeing the covers coming off after a rain delay had somehow assumed human form. And then 每 to cut a long story short 每 along came Roger Federer, who was blessed with power, subtlety and grace. David Foster Wallace famously described Federer as ※Mozart and Metallica at the same time§.Women＊s matches these days often resemble a mashup between Metallica and a Metallica tribute act. Lacking equivalents of the unpredictable Ga?l Monfils or the dreadlocked Dustin Brown, the women＊s game remains deadlocked in the power phase. Let＊s put it as simply as possible. Since the retirement of the glorious Justine Henin-Hardenne none of the top women play with a single-handed backhand. Without single-handed backhands the potential for beauty in tennis is severely cramped.The final irony is that one emerges from  fascinated not by the rivalry, but by the legendary tie-break after which, as Tim Adams memorably put it in his book , Borg came out for the fifth set ※as if nothing had happened§. That, as Adams writes, was one of the great moments in sport. But a great film could potentially be made about the nothing that  happen, after Borg retired at the precocious age of 26, after he turned his back on everything that gave his life meaning, or kept the lack of meaning at bay: a film, that is, about what happens to volcanoes after they opt for extinction. It could be so boring. It could be Bergmanesque.																																											"

"Mother!, the title of ＊s new film, is guaranteed to make horror fans sit up and take notice. Motherhood is almost as endemic a theme in the genre as the Big Two 每 sex and death. Indeed, in its most horrific manifestations, it co-opts those as well.Most horror-movie mothers are very, very bad: either sexually repressed, over-possessive, insanely jealous, overbearing or 每 in the worst-case scenario 每 all of these things at once.  mothers are Freudian nightmares made flesh or, in some cases, ectoplasm. But  horror mothers come in all shapes, sizes and dispositions. They don＊t even necessarily have to be female, as the mother of all horror mothers reminds us. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde: all women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does, unless his name is Norman Bates.In many ways, Mrs Bates is the blueprint for many a horror mother to come: domineering, possessive, jealous, homicidal and dead. In horror movies, mothers are the root of all evil. Even when they don＊t actually get blood on their own hands, their bad mothering ensures that blood will be spilt, often by the children whose psyches they＊ve twisted out of shape.Freud reminds us that mythological mother goddesses were invariably creators and destroyers. Echoing Nyx and Echidna, who inflict all manner of monstrous and sinister offspring on the world in Greek mythology, Nola Carveth (Samantha Eggar) in ＊s The Brood undergoes experimental psychotherapy that enables her to vent her inner rage by giving birth to homicidal mutant dwarves. They enact her subconscious desires, which basically means killing everyone that annoys her.Horror mothers are nearly always angry 每 either about betrayal, or a failure to appreciate the sacrifices they＊ve made 每 or, especially, when their evil children are harmed. And if there is anything more dangerous than a monster, it＊s the monster＊s mother, especially if she＊s played by a scary mo-cap  with snakily braided tail, gold stilettos and uncanny valley features as Grendel＊s mother in . Smash those eggs in Aliens and you risk drawing the ire of the egg-laying xenomorph, who will get her own back by trying to co-opt your own surrogate child as an incubator.Werecat Charles Brady (Brian Krause) dismembers a teacher in Sleepwalkers, but he＊s a rank amateur compared to his mother (also his lover, since female werecats are apparently thin on the ground). Mary Brady (Alice Krige) outdoes Angelina by cutting a bloody swath through local law enforcement (stabbing one cop through the head with a corn-cob and a ※no vegetables, no dessert§ wisecrack) before dragging the town virgin (Madch?n Amick) back to her house so Charles can suck out the girl＊s purple essence, the ultimate gesture of motherly love.But even when morphed into a reptilian-looking werecat, Mary cannot match Vera Cosgrove (Elizabeth Moody) in ＊s Braindead for perverse un-maternal grotesquerie. Vera is a jealous and domineering Mrs Bates-type with a homicidal backstory even before she gets bitten by a Sumatran rat-monkey and turns into a zombie. Eventually, she mutates into a humungous mumzilla with pendulous breasts, who sucks her zombie-killing son Lionel back into her womb with the words, ※No one will ever love you like your mother!§ Which is true; even his girlfriend can＊t do that. Lionel＊s only recourse is to slice his way free of smothering motherliness with a DIY caesarean.While real-life mothers valiantly struggle to assimilate the conflicting advice of parenting experts, the mothering instinct in horror films is all too easily perverted by tragedy into a biblical lust for vengeance. Bereavement, whether of husband or child, is a recurring motif that transforms women into vengeful slasher-movie furies. Sometimes they set their sights on the foetus in another woman＊s uterus, such as B谷atrice Dalle in Inside, slicing up everyone who gets between her and the embryo she has decided will replace the one she lost. Or they inveigle their way into a family, like Rebecca De Mornay in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, who gets a job as evil nanny to the woman she blames for her own triple trauma of bereavement, miscarriage and hysterectomy.De Mornay also deserves to win a Bad Mother of the Millennium award for Mother＊s Day, in which she appears to be modelling herself on Tamora, Queen of the Goths, from Shakespeare＊s Titus Andronicus, who revels in her sons＊ atrocities. De Mornay has raised her boys to be bank robbers, rapists and killers and, possibly deferring to some vague idea that a mother should help shape her children＊s hobbies, presides in person over their torture-happy home invasions. As the advertising for another movie had it, ※The family that slays together stays together,§ a tagline that could also apply to 1974＊s Frightmare, in which mumsy Dorothy (Sheila Keith) encourages her daughter Debbie to join her in her favourite pastime, which happens to be cannibalism. Shakespeare＊s Tamora was tricked into eating her own sons, baked in a pie, but Dorothy isn＊t fussy and just chows down on everyone who calls on her.The bond between mother and child is one of the strongest emotional ties in human nature, so it is hardly surprising that it＊s such a regular element in the work of (mostly) male film-makers seeking relatable motivation for their female protagonists without having to think too deeply about metaphysics. Sometimes, though, it makes you wonder about the directors＊ own relationships with their mothers. Psycho is not the only  film to feature a domineering mother; Hitchcock himself admitted to having been traumatised by his own mum, who famously punished him by forcing him stand for hours at the foot of the bed, a personal memory he assigned to Norman Bates in Psycho.In horror movies, maternal grief or jealousy is so amplified it can persist beyond the grave, particularly when it comes to ghosts whose very femaleness is judged (by men) to make them more emotionally unstable than their male counterparts, as though death has stopped their body clocks at the wrong time of the month in perpetuity. There is a monstrousness to motherly urges, which have a malevolent disregard for fairness or justice. Like Medea, who butchered her own babies to get back at her ex, all they want is revenge. And in their primal rage they don＊t care who gets it in the neck.In The Woman in Black, the phantom of Jennet Humfrye avenges the accidental death of her child by claiming the lives of children or lawyers who stray into her district. Likewise, the ghost mother in Mama is mourning her dead baby and doesn＊t find it at all inappropriate that she should salve her grief by luring a couple of living kiddies off the edge of a cliff. Maybe she didn＊t love her dead baby as dearly as she thinks if she＊s prepared to swap it for the very next child she lays eyes on.Another mother driven homicidal by bereavement is Mrs Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) in Friday the 13th, who hacks her way through a bunch of randy camp counsellors she blames for the accidental death of her son Jason (even though he＊s not actually dead, since in the sequel he＊s revived to inherit his mother＊s love for slashing and hacking, and carries on doing it for another 10 films). If only Mrs Voorhees had been told of her error and reunited with her child in that first film, the whole thrust of the franchise might have turned out a sight less ＃ stabby.Horror mothers do not necessarily start out as monsters. Motherhood is one of the most taxing responsibilities any woman can be faced with, and even the most saintly real-life mum can be driven to distraction by sleep deprivation, financial worries and wilful toddlers. Horror movies simply amp up the pressure to an intolerable degree. Insecurity, guilt and resentment open a doorway to stressed mothers being possessed by the spirits of baby-killing witches, photosensitive ghosts or bogeymen from the pages of children＊s books.But, for all their susceptibility to the forces of darkness, possessed mothers do essentially have their children＊s best interests at heart. One can also sympathise with the oblivious mothers, those workaholic grownups who fail to understand or even notice their children＊s grim ordeals in films such as  or It Follows. At least their neglect stays on the acceptable side of child abuse, unlike Victoria Tennant in Flowers in the Attic, who doesn＊t just keep her kids locked up but feeds them arsenic-laced cookies so she can deny their existence and collect her inheritance.Stir religion and sexual repression into the mum-mix, and you have an even more poisonous recipe for murderous mayhem. Tallulah Bankhead as Mrs Trefoile in Die! Die! My Darling! doesn＊t just hold her dead son＊s ex-fiancee Pat (Stefanie Powers) prisoner in her mansion but blathers on about ※vile bodies§, pelts her with endless Bible readings and throws a wobbly when Pat asks her to pass the salt. ※God＊s food should be eaten unadorned!§ rants Mrs Trefoile. ※We are vegetarian. For instance, this meat loaf is synthetic, compounded of bread, oatmeal and wheatgerm.§ Which sounds almost as unappetising as the arsenic-laced cookies of Flowers in the Attic.But a blind love of Jesus can be enough to turn horror mothers into child-abusing harridans even without bereavement. Poor Carrie is not half as scary as her mother, Mrs White (Piper Laurie), whose festering guilt about once having had sex makes her lock the fruit of that copulation in a cupboard and harangue her with deluded nonsense about sin, dirty pillows and the evil colour red (a trait she shares with Mrs Trefoile in Die! Die! My Darling!).Mrs White may not be directly accountable for her daughter killing half her classmates with her deadly telekinetic abilities, but she sure as hell is responsible for warping Carrie＊s character out of shape by withholding vital sex education and insisting everyone will laugh at her. If only Carrie had been more conversant with the facts of life she wouldn＊t have been so traumatised by her period, and having pig＊s blood tipped all over her at the prom might not have triggered that catastrophic psychic meltdown.In the end, Mrs White is fully prepared to kill her own daughter for being, as she imagines, an evil witch 每 though by any standards it＊s the mother who is the real monster here. Medea had nothing on these mums, whose attitude to sex has been so deformed by guilt they are prepared to sacrifice their own progeny rather than face up to their own tortured consciences.In , the mother＊s unquestioning embrace of a misogynistic belief system redirects her own sexual shame towards her daughter, whom she tries to strangle: ※The devil is in thee and hath had thee. You are smeared of his sin. You reek of evil!§ It＊s little wonder the daughter prefers the company of a horny goat and wanders off into the woods, where she can likely find herself a more supportive matriarchal figure among the baby-eating witches.Possessive or neglectful, encouraging or abusive, horror mothers invariably get it wrong, even more so than their real-life counterparts. But it is hard not to feel sorry for genuinely well-meaning parents such as Chris MacNeil in The Exorcist, who does the best she can when Pazuzu makes her daughter puke pea soup. And there is at least one other horror movie mother who does everything right, in theory, but still ends up with the short end of the stick. When Rosemary (Mia Farrow) learns the truth about her pregnancy in Rosemary＊s Baby, her maternal instincts trump her understandable squeamishness at having been forced to give birth to the spawn of Satan.Rosemary is clearly a good horror mother. Who knows, maybe she can even raise her devil baby to be a good kid, though the history of horror mothers suggests it will be an uphill struggle, and that she＊ll probably end up with a son who＊ll make Norman Bates, Jason Voorhees and Carrie seem like paragons of selfless humanitarian benevolence.  																																											"
"en Burns surveyed the audience at the Kennedy Center in Washington and asked that anyone who served in the Vietnam war stand up. To prolonged applause dozens rose,  and former secretary of state John Kerry.Then Burns asked everyone who had protested against the war to stand up too. Veterans including McCain joined the applause as they did so.Then, spontaneously, some members of the two groups reached across the stalls and shook hands. Burns said he ※couldn＊t tell the difference§ between them and expressed hope that this is how reconciliation begins.※I thought that was kind of nice,§ said Jim Greene, 72, who went to Vietnam in 1966 as a tank commander in the 2nd marine division. ※Time heals most wounds.§The gathering last Tuesday night went on to watch a 45-minute preview of  a 10-part,  about what Burns and his co-director Lynn Novick call the most important event in American history since the second world war.The audience was gripped by a montage of clips played backwards 每 explosions imploding, missiles and parachutists spiralling upwards, flames leaping from thatched homes back into a weapon, a man shot at point blank range leaping magically back to life 每 and the thunderous clatter of helicopter blades and music from the era. But perhaps most potent was a vignette on the Vietnam war memorial in Washington, which included veterans breaking down in tears and an anti-war protester expressing regret for the way returning soldiers were abused. ※I＊m sorry,§ she sobbed, softly.No one understands the divided states of America better than Burns, whose 1990 breakout series vividly exhumed the civil war through contemporary photography, music and letters. A century after that conflict, the Vietnam war left more than 58,000 Americans dead, triggered deep social unrest and sowed the seeds of the country＊s present polarisation. The new film ※offers an uncannily well-timed reflection of our current societal fractures§,  ※a kind of origin story for the culture wars that still have us asking: Which side are you on?§The culture wars are such that what you watch is  For Donald Trump supporters, it＊s Duck Dynasty; for Hillary Clinton voters, it＊s Modern Family. But Burns＊s work 每 from The Civil War to Baseball, from Jazz to The Statue of Liberty, from The War (about the second world war) to The National Parks: America＊s Best Idea 每 has always had crossover appeal.※It＊s good to sing songs together or have your epic verses sung around an electronic campfire,§ he told the Guardian. ※That＊s what I＊ve tried to do and I＊ve been fortunate in my professional life that we get good ratings in the supposedly red states as well as the supposedly blue states, but it never crosses my mind when I＊m making it that I＊m not just making it for everybody.§Vietnam, however, still contentious and contested, is a risky scab to pick. When Burns told Barack Obama he was working on a history of the war, the then president replied: ※Oh, that＊ll be your most controversial work.§ Burns shot back: ※Yes, but only among those who don＊t watch it.§ Obama laughed and said: ※You need to remember that.§ Burns replied: ※Oh, believe you me, I will.§He reflected this week: ※It＊s really true. I think it＊s been borne out by the screenings we＊ve done all around the country, 50 or 60 different screenings that no matter the audience 每 conservative, military, liberal, whatever 每 it＊s been this cathartic experience and one that feels potentially healing.§A decade of work and a thousand interviews 每 boiled down to nearly 80 on-screen 每have gone into trying to make  balanced, bipartisan and 360-degree in perspective. On Tuesday, McCain called it ※magnificent work§ with lessons for the present. Burns said he and Novick have no political axe to grind but rather are ※umpires calling balls and strikes§ in the series, which premieres on America＊s Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) on Sunday and He added: ※I＊m so interested in reaching across and I think this film has the ability to speak to experiences of people who voted, how ever much the intelligentsia might want to dismiss their intelligence, for the kinds of things that Trump appealed to. We＊ve told their stories in an honourable fashion and we haven＊t made them wrong, even though we＊ve been able to contain many other perhaps even dialectically opposed positions.※We can just honour a variety of perspectives and perhaps allow other people＊s certainty to dissolve a little bit in the fact that more than one truth can obtain. As  said in my jazz series, sometimes a thing and the opposite of a thing can be true at the same time. Well, in war it may be dozens and dozens of things can be true at the same time.§That includes the start of a conflict now perhaps best known to a younger generation through US-centric films such as Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket and Platoon. Vietnam was partitioned in a 1950s ceasefire between a communist north and anti-communist south. Washington supported a series of corrupt regimes against the communist-led Vietcong in the south and their allies in the north who sought to reunite the country.This rapidly escalated in the mid-1960s when the US sent in thousands of air and ground forces. But as the draft deepened and casualties mounted, anti-war demonstrators took to the streets. Richard Nixon expanded the war into Cambodia and Laos but the quagmire continued. In 1973, US forces quit Vietnam, and in 1975 the south fell to the communists.The PR-savvy Burns can reel off by rote the parallels with today: mass protests taking place across the country against the sitting administration; a White House in disarray, obsessed with leaks, and a president certain the press is lying and making up stories about him; asymmetrical warfare; a country divided over basic issues; big document drops of purloined stolen classified material that destabilise the public conversation; accusations that a political campaign reached out during the time of a national election to a foreign power to affect that election.The office of the presidency has arguably never quite recovered or  McCain, who spent five and a half years as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down on a bombing mission, recalled: ※Leaders didn＊t lead, whether they were military or civilian. By telling the American people one thing, which was not true, about the progress in the war and the body counts, it caused a wave of pessimism to go across this country, which bolstered the anti-war movement.§McCain and Kerry had input into the film, although they do not appear on camera, and production involved several trips to Vietnam to include an unprecedented number of Vietnamese voices. Burns explained: ※We wanted to place a fresh face on that and a human face on that and to understand. What is I think so interesting is that our North Vietnamese soldiers and Vietcong guerrillas sound awfully like our American marines and GIs. They feel that about us and and our guys feel that about them.§Based in , New Hampshire, Burns describes The Vietnam War as his most challenging and therefore most satisfying work. At 64, his status as a chronicler of the age through its most popular medium is assured. The historian Stephen Ambrose argued: ※More Americans get their history from Ken Burns than any other source.§ A 2002 poll by Real Screen Magazine ranked him and Robert Flaherty, of Nanook of the North fame, as the ※most influential documentary makers of all time§. He has won dozens of awards including 15 Emmys.In May last year, also at the Kennedy Center, Burns  for the National Endowment for the Humanities. He acknowledged his lifelong interest in the subject of race in America, manifest in series including The Cvil War, Baseball and Jazz. ※Slavery and its consequences, including the Civil War,  our original sin,§ he told the audience. At the time, Trump was surging but the notion of him as president was still widely unthinkable.※There is no contextual relationship in which you can put him,§ he said. ※I have always delved deep into race as the sort of central sub-theme of American life and I have received a lot of criticism even from friends and colleagues who just say enough already. And when Barack Obama was elected they said, ＆Now, will you finally shut up?＊ and I held up The Onion which said, and said, ＆Just watch.＊※And they＊ve all come back and talked to me as the  and  have piled up and the treatment of Obama has been hysterically racist. So then I thought that Trump wouldn＊t get traction but I also know that these things are deep seated and that we can appeal to the common denominator often a lot quicker than we can appeal to those better angels.※It is not unlawful that a reaction to Barack Obama might be Donald Trump and it＊s too bad that＊s the case because it basically puts the United States on pause and doesn＊t permit us what we have always done to move forward to understand our history  as George Will characterised Franklin Roosevelt＊s uber-optimistic view of things.§Writing in the Atlantic, Ta-Nehisi Coates argues that Trump had made the negation of Obama＊s legacy the foundation of his own. It often seems that the people least surprised by Trump＊s victory were African Americans. Burns said: ※I have enough African American friends who at the end of ＊15 and early ＊16 were saying, ＆Oh, he can win.＊ I tend to listen to them 每 scholars that I respect who are kind of bellwethers, almost canaries in the mine 每 and when they said he could win at that point I never let down my guard. African Americans occupy a unique place in American history and they are often privy to secrets that the rest of us can＊t often hear.§Trump has attacked the media as ※damned dishonest§ and ※the enemy of the American people§ and, according to Clinton,  But Burns remains a trusted voice of authority to millions. He said: ※I think that people are less and less interested in facts now, which suggests to me that facts are more and more important. So we didn＊t spend 10 years on this to not try to get it right.§Trump is an anomaly, Burns acknowledges, quite unlike any US president who has gone before. But the long view of history armours him against the hyperbole of the present and insists on a sense of proportion: the financial crisis of 2007-08 was not a catastrophe on the scale of the great depression; the present cleavage is hardly comparable with the civil war. This too shall pass.※Vietnam, and the experience of doing that, and what I know about history, gives me a strange kind of optimism that this might in fact be some magnificent test of institutions, whether it＊s judicial or intelligence or even Congress,§ he said. ※Certainly the press is undergoing a magnificent renaissance in the face of the assault on them. ※It＊s all right to worry and be Chicken Little but I think the magnificence and the fearlessness of the response has been incredibly inspiring and will be incredibly helpful for our republic.§																																											"
"he Art Institute of Chicago is one of the world＊s great galleries. Visitors flock to see  and , two of the most recognisable images in modern American art. But what has stunned art collectors is that a photograph of visitors to the Art Institute, taken in 1990 by Thomas Struth, fetched more at auction than any other photograph last year, . And it＊s not even the only one in existence 每 Struth produced 10 prints.As bankers to the wealthy Coutts revealed in a recent report, Old Masters have fallen from favour, with prices down 40% from their peak a decade ago. Oriental carpets and rugs are completely out of fashion, with prices back to where they were in 2005. Even the boom in classic cars has stalled, with Ferrari prices in reverse by 10% last year. But Coutts said photography has emerged as the hottest new investment for the very well-off. Photos by Gilbert and George,  and Andreas Gursky all fetched more than $400,000 at auctions in 2016. has until now had an ambivalent status in the art collecting world, and for good reason: collectors value scarcity. There is only one Nighthawks, whereas Struth could have reproduced thousands, indeed millions, of his image of visitors to the gallery.Photographers have responded by limiting their reproductions to just a few signed images. At the Photographers＊ Gallery in London, the first public gallery devoted solely to photography and which has championed up-and-coming photographers since opening in 1971, Anthony Hartley says: ※The assumption among the general public is that the supply is endless, but that is not the case any longer. Editions tend to be limited, and dramatically so. Just five or 10 prints are standard and the negatives kept by the photographer. All the prints in the edition are produced at the same time, so buyers know that there will never be, say, another 25 produced.§But what＊s to stop a photographer cashing in later with more editions? ※Generally it is a self-regulating market. If photographers produce a new edition then they are simply shooting themselves in the foot,§ says Hartley.Provenance is crucial. At Sotheby＊s, head of photographs Brandei Estes says: ※The most important thing is for there to be a signature or the artist＊s stamp. If there＊s not one, then just forget it.§So what should the budding collector be buying, and how much should they pay? Sotheby＊s has a reputation for dealing with multimillionaires, but Estes says: ※We start from ?3,000, with the average around ?10,000-?15,000. Compared to traditional art auctions it＊s relatively accessible. You＊ll pay an arm and a leg for an original print of Robert Doisneau＊s Kiss 每 they＊ll go for ?250,000 upwards 每 but he produced many, many other photographs. You can find them in galleries from ?2,000. No one seems to want his other ones.§The top end of the British photography market is dominated by what might be called ※decorative§ photography 每 in other words what looks nice on the walls of rich people＊s houses. That often means fashion photography, Estes says, such as the original print of a young Kate Moss by Albert Watson that . ※, Helmut Newton and Michel Comte are fashion photographers who all sell well. These are images you can live with every day of your life. What＊s notable is that Watson has other photos just as good as the Moss one for a fraction of the price. We had a beautiful one of Christy Turlington which sold for ?5,000, which is cheap compared to a Kate Moss at ?20,000. I firmly believe that if you buy photos such as these now, they will be fetching more in the future.§ She also namechecks the wildlife photography of  as immensely popular among collectors.At the Atlas Photography Gallery in London, which deals in 20th-century and contemporary photography, Ben Burdett says collecting appeals to a new demographic. ※Photography is more relevant and more understandable to a lot of people who aren＊t art professionals, and prices are very much lower than buying a comparable work by a contemporary artist. A lot of contemporary art has priced itself out of buyers＊ incomes.§Finding young, emerging photographers that are more affordable is central to the work of the Photographers＊ Gallery, says Hartley. ※These are the photographers who are too young to have a secondary market yet. Our job is to get them to that level. In the past we have represented photographers who have sold in the low hundreds, but who now sell in the big galleries for 10 times what we were selling them for. But we always caution about investment. There is never a guarantee. Crucially, buy first of all what you love.§Some of the gallery＊s most popular sellers are works by  that capture a magical realism in Siberia (above), and the painterly images of  (left) that feature the derelict landscapes of post-communist eastern Europe. Their work starts from ?1,200 for a 20x24-inch photo from an edition of 10, but after that prices escalate, with large-scale prints priced at ?6,500-plus.For the vast majority of people, dropping a few thousand on a photograph is in the realm of the outlandish. , the Guardian＊s former picture editor and photographer, who recently presented a BBC4 TV series on the history of photography, is mildy sceptical about the boom in collecting. ※A lot of dead photographers will make a living; I＊m not sure the living ones will. There is a yearning for masters such as Man Ray and Irving Penn, a clamour for a craft that is seen as disappearing. The big market is for black and white, and for nostalgia.※I ran into David Bailey the other day. He said he＊s not getting much in the way of work these days, but the art market had discovered him.§News photography commands relatively low prices, with even images by legendary war photographer Robert Capa, co-founder of Magnum, selling for significantly less than what are seen as aesthetically more pleasing fashion prints. ※Because people know the works of a photographer in a newspaper, they don＊t see the work as art. People are reluctant to pay much,§ says McCabe.The success of touring exhibitions such as the World Press Photo Awards and a growing appetite among major galleries may see photojournalism prices start to rise. Sophie Wright, Magnum＊s global cultural director, says the Tate Modern has been instrumental in broadening the acceptance of documentary photography in the art market. Meanwhile, the V&A, the first museum in the world to collect photography, is opening  that will more than double its current photography exhibition space.Most insiders admit, though, that New York and Paris outrank London in the global photography market, with demand from the Middle and Far East rising fast. Magnum recently sold a full set of vintage Werner Bischof prints described as a ※complete photojournalistic essay§ to Hong Kong＊s planned new museum of visual culture, M+. They document the influx of Chinese immigrants into the city during the 1950s.Magnum has established a Collector＊s Circle where members meet aspiring and established photographers to share their passion 每 although it costs ?10,000 to join. Wright says: ※There has been a lot written about the move to invest in art as a source of assured returns in a turbulent economy; however, you should buy what you love, as you will most likely be living with it for a long time afterwards.§You must also keep it in good condition: behind museum-quality glass is one option, and avoid direct sunlight and water damage. ※I once spoke to a billionaire on a yacht,§ says Estes. ※He said his photo was falling apart. I said what do you expect 每 you＊re keeping it at sea.§																																											"
" voice. ※Are you on the street?§ Reverberating footfall in the underpass. And an urgent call demanding acknowledgement. He hustled after me, swearing, smacking a fist into his open palm. We moved, pursuer and pursued, in steady bank holiday drizzle, down a slippery, stone-flagged ramp towards the laby-rinth of borough engineer ＊s reinforced concrete subterranea: a buried swimming pool, a vault to take cars away from the promenade, a marine walkway pressed against a wall of broken bottles. Like a reliquary for beachside drinking schools, the thirsty ones at the end of the land.Panoramic sea windows, lacking glass, are set in expectation of invasions still to come. (Between 1940 and 1944, Little had a sideline, working with the Admiralty on the construction of a concrete .) Hastings in the 1930s, in the borough engineer＊s pomp, was a punt at the better way: sanctioned leisure time for all, seasonal tourism as a benefit. And smooth rail connections to the capital, the Smoke. Open roads, carving through the humped folds of the chalk downs, beneath the outlines of mythical giants, were celebrated in collectable posters by the finest artists and designers. Cars were not yet weapons of choice, primed for mindless assault on the crowd, those who are privileged to walk freely in the city.Where did it all go wrong? When was the vision that sanctioned the spectacular amphitheatre of the West St Leonard＊s lido and the magnificent folly of the tallest block of residential flats in England, built to look like a beached cruise liner, like the newly launched Queen Mary of the Cunard White Star Line, downgraded to nostalgic flickers on a monitor screen in the little visited town museum?※Are you on the street?§ Ever since I told myself that I had done with the compulsion to write about , I felt that I had lost my centre of gravity. As if the familiar markers I ambled past every day no longer recognised me or had any use for a sleepwalker in the muzzle of elective silence. There was no longer an obligation to carry a notebook or a camera. Or to endure the madness of being overwhelmed by random voices, mendacious signage, tags and scribbles, snippets of intrusive mobile-phone babble: along with the moral imperative of shaping white noise into a coherent narrative. The rough sleepers, ranters on buses, spice zombies, station beggars I sourced as potential characters were taking their revenge by welcoming me into their survivalist sodality. Did I look like one of them now? Did my skewed, eyes-down trudge transmit a different code, a new set of pheromones?The Hastings man in the tunnel was enraged: most pressingly with uniformed enforcers who were tidying up the mid-town shopping centre, prodding him from his habitual ledge in the shadow of Lloyds Bank, away from the shelter of the padlocked public toilets now under offer as ※commercial property§. He had nowhere to go. His tormentors were tight-lipped and implacable. And, beyond these irritations, it was the world at large. Those spiteful iniquities: the way that politicians and post offices and wives and publicans singled him out as a person worthy of torment. Gulls screamed in derision. Electrified invalid carriages piloted by Hell＊s Angels grannies with a sense of fierce entitlement used him for target practice. But I was sympathetic. Or so he imagined. A fellow traveller in distress. I was on the street. Was it the clothes, the tilt in my walk? Another grizzled prospector for small brown coins gummed to tarmac. Did he sense that I had lost my project? That I was rambling without purpose, burdened with too many convenience-store bags?I underlined a quote from the paperback I was reading; a gift from a New Yorker commissioned to make films for the Discovery Channel, in which he shadowed particular writers through their special cities. The sprawl of Mexico City was entrusted to . The book, featuring a broken detective dragged back from the grave, was . ※Now more than ever he had the absurd ability to feel out of place everywhere.§Taibo＊s one-eyed, cola-swilling investigator, in his John Ford eye patch, knows that ※you can＊t return to what doesn＊t exist, but you can long for what you had.§ And that was pretty much my take on London. From the moment, cutting the grass around a Hawksmoor church in Limehouse, when I assembled an overcooked stew of poetry-reportage, work diary and speculative essay in 1974, to polemics against Olympicopolis and the imposition of CGI unreality on the corporate theme park of the , I believed that the job involved channelling aspects of the past, scratching at resistant memory traces. I＊ve never moved far from the WB Yeats quote that started it all: ※The living can assist the imagination of the dead.§I was like one of the dead myself. The invisibles of the city, the troubled ones who are not part of the general contract, began to see me as something other than a predator with a ballpoint pen or a petty-cash patron. I thought of what happened to the real writers when the crunch came. It never did for JG Ballard: notice of premature mortality was an equation to be solved with an immaculately constructed final memoir, . The earlier fictions were refined and revised into benevolent myths, all dues paid, carrying the story towards its necessary conclusion at the hands of a ※strong-minded, wise and kindly physician§. , creator of more demented surgeons, slid across his last border into a far west of dreams. After his malignant succubus 每 the will to write 每 was exorcised in a Native American sweat lodge ceremony, he was freed from the karma of composition, the penance imposed for the shooting of his wife, Joan Vollmer, in Mexico City. In Kansas exile, Burroughs humoured his superior cats and kept meticulous dream journals. The characters and sets were still in place, but now they composed their own stories. ※A long time ago,§ Burroughs wrote in one of his final entries, ※but not too far to walk.§Walking, always the favoured iteration of the dream of the city, has become, hour-by-hour, a more conflicted activity. The peripatetic vagrants, the ones who yelled at me across the blur of morning cyclists, demanding a response, were balanced by the sitters, the vegetative slab-squatters and pavement warmers who had found their place. With no intention of giving it up. Metropolitan hustlers, the monad of scurrying, dawn athletes coming out of their pristine, new-build, railside apartments, hitting the street like a treadmill, do not see the benched Buddhas. They are inoculated against empathy. Outpourings of public emotion are reserved for horrible media catastrophes: outrages on London bridges, underfunded and irresponsibly provided tower blocks that become crematorium chimneys, stealing the lives of the unregistered who live alongside stuccoed ghost terraces occupied by rumours of remote speculators.Ill prepared for many aspects of a city polarised by satellite developments, east and west, around the two Westfield retail colonies (street food from every nation), I was open to any invitation to take to the road. There would be a tent show in Brighton, at the fringe festival, inspired by . I was asked to contribute. And, being literal minded, I left London for Dover, to make my own pilgrimage, by way of Canterbury, Faversham, Sittingbourne, Rochester and Shooter＊s Hill, to the Old Kent Road and Westminster. I was getting away from London＊s karma by marching, in a fugue of absence, right into the worst of it.?I carried with me the imprint of fire and water: repeat excursions over the same ground. Fractal patterns of pondweed on which new coots have to learn to walk rather than paddle. Viridian swirls of instant derangement from tattered nitrous oxide balloons on London Fields are earthed by the heat from old bricks in the wall of the Beehive Foundry. Physical work is still going on. All the dramas of our lost London are enacted within a few yards of the railway bridge crossing the Regent＊s Canal at Mare Street, Hackney.A speculative development under one arch arranges its imported plants and cafetieres in denial of the surrounding scene. Polish builders in smart trainers and Gap T-shirts decant from Addison Lee taxis. A filthy, rat-disputed shelf under the bridge was previously occupied by a rough sleeper in a sack like a body bag. Until he was joined by others in an all too visible camp, their shelters scavenged from driftwood. These unfortunates were prodded awake and swept away by the black vans of  (sanctioned to do just the opposite). The raiders come early and defer, in whispered conversations, to a higher authority. Television crews, professional entropy tourists, revise the graffiti on the gothic ruin beside Empress Coaches for the latest episode of London noir. The narrowboat with the pirate flag is boarded and captured. The container stack, looking like a  apocalypse dumped beside the smouldering landfill dunes on Rainham Marshes, is a shared-desk hipster hive for internet startups and craft beer websites.The narrow towpath, where several cyclists came to grief as they bombed out from under the bridge and into the water, was occupied by what looked like a pile of discarded, post-disaster charity clothing. It turned out to be a young Asian man who greeted me with a friendly salute. He still hoped to find better accommodation ※over there§. He waved in the general direction of Victoria Park, before warming his back on the heated bricks of the foundry. We exchanged a few words every morning. But only after we had established terms did he indicate that he might be prepared to accept a coin or two. On days when he was still asleep, burrowed into his layers, other benefactors left fruit on his pillow. One morning I noticed a pair of fresh bananas.The wall-hugging perversity of walking beside water is a habit I am reluctant to break. Breathing space on towpaths, pavements and crossing points between highway upgrades is critical. And bridges: think of the by a jogger setting a PB in his fantasy Olympics. There are hierarchies of entitlement: the Lycra peloton fretting for respect or the headphone joggers in outfits boasting of the conspicuous charity of bankers. Pedestrians are at the bottom of the food chain, cushioned in self-righteous indignation and fondly imagining ourselves to be revenants from an earlier, better time. One evening a young man rapped imperiously on my door. He had been commissioned by the council to carry out a survey on how many steps we old folk managed in a day. Tapping white teeth with a black Biro, he suggested a properly supervised class in how to make a circuit of London Fields.I was attracted by the ever-open doors of J Hoyle & Son. And the name of that canalside building: Beehive Foundry. An intensely local spill of heat. The sanded floor of a dark cave. A lung-scouring inhalation leaving needles in the nose. Formaldehyde is used to set moulds for the casting of iron stair rods. This family business, one of many such Hackney operations, threatened or vanished, was started eight years before the Jack the Ripper murders. The Blakean furnace roars with no reference to the status struggles, nudges and shunts of the morning towpath. The Gentle Author from Spitalfields, who dropped in on the foundry one afternoon, informed us that ※no piece of railing or fence need ever be irreparable§. James Hoyle & Son cast the decorative ironwork for the Bank of England, the British Museum and 10 Downing Street.I replayed these Hackney vectors 每 fire cave, bundle of occupied rags huddled against the wall, swish of the peloton 每 when I left town for Dover. I had no good reason to return, beyond the dream of a terrace house, endured and enjoyed for almost 50 years: the nest, the base, the fixed point from which all journeys begin.Watling Street was a 14th-century branding exercise, after the Roman imperium, giving status to a series of ancient trackways, and upgrading W?celinga Street, a title derived from tribal territory around St Albans, into a premature autobahn, a contraband highway waiting impatiently for the invention of the internal combustion engine. I packed a proof copy of the lively and engaging book by John Higgs, but I realised very quickly that there was something amiss: Higgs was in a car, diverting wherever the fancy led him, making it his business to string together a yatter of counter-culturalists and embedded subversives. In form, blended the amiable eccentricities of John Aubrey＊s  with the polemic thrust of William Cobbett＊s . Higgs took his children along, the outings were informative and fun. They lent themselves very well to ※outcomes§: tent shows, blogs, itinerant performances. They travelled from now to now.The oldest trackways made the shape of a carrion crow＊s footprints in mud, starting in three landing places at once: Rutupiae (Richborough), Portus Lemanis (Lympne) and Portus Dubris (Dover). Choosing Dover and stepping out on a Sunday night was a confirmation that it was closed to hospitality and barely tolerant of passerines 每 and only if they are prepared to visit the defensive block of the castle, the Roman ruins. Professional drinkers nesting for the night around the pale glow of a cash machine are infected by a universal malaise, impotence simmering with resentment. I remembered the man I＊d heard that morning, ranting as he power jogged beside the canal. ※I bought 2,000 bottles of poppers, thinking the price would be incredible when they were made illegal. I speculated. Post-Brexit I am always angry.§We are all angry, leavers and remainers, but where to place the blame? On the peeling seawall, under the curtain of the chalk cliff on which they recently projected a monumental image of Vera Lynn, a slogan has been painted: ※NO PASARAN!§ The Spanish republican boast from the siege of Madrid. The chant of those who resisted the Mosleyite march through the East End in the Battle of Cable Street in October 1936. Heroic defiance erects a hard Brexit barrier against the procession of Channel ferries. On the promenade, buffeted by the downdraft from a caravan of sealed lorries escaping the port, I was stopped by a black tablet, lettered in gold like a freshly restored gravestone, and set ※In memory of 58 young people from China who died near here on 18th June 2000. All human life is precious§. Choked of breath as an illegitimate cargo.The only refuge, tucked hard against the cliff, is the Last Pub in the Civilised World. And so it feels. The German behind the bar, like the purser on a doomed freighter, has many sausage-based dishes on his card, but only pizza available at this time. He doesn＊t know the difference between cider and lager, but he charges a sturdy hiking couple, Indian women in shorts, just ?1 for the pot of tea they have nursed all afternoon. I know that the American in the corner, in his , is going to tell me at any moment that he is a poet who can extemporise for ※40 minutes straight§ on the Beats. He is chilling out between gigs in Chatham and Margate. He has an internet presence. He asks how long I have been on the street. A tuneful dirge in the background references ※Bridge Over Troubled Water§. ※Simon and Garfunkel,§ my new street friend says. ※Those guys are why I became a poet.§ And why I need to get back out into the weather.Next morning I meet the film-maker  at Dover Priory station. Andrew finds a pair of white flints that he twists in wire and presses against his eyes like blind spectacles. The better to see with his feet, he says. To counter dull aches with the acute pain of blood dripping from the flaps of torn ears. We reach Canterbury in good heart and dine that night at Byron on one of their riskier specials, the fat-cheeked Kimcheese burger with Korean BBQ glaze, Freddar cheese, kimchi cucumbers, ※under a dollop of gochuchang sauce and spicy ssamjang mayo§. With an optional bucket of fries. A suicide feast appropriate to these darkening days. Threat and counter-threat on screens in restaurants and Premier Inn lobbies.After enduring the dead miles of the A2 between Canterbury and Sittingbourne, we are heading home to a city that is no longer there. Andrew left Deptford years ago, at the time of Thatcher＊s ※right to buy§, but nostalgia for riverside stinks puts a bounce in his stride. Reconnecting with the putative Roman road, we find nirvana: an enterprise punting disability vehicles alongside what looks like superior road kill. Deep-frozen Euro-imported exotics are very popular, apparently, at Kentish weddings, functions and festivals. The strength of London＊s centripetal power is not felt until we reach Shooter＊s Hill and the stutter and surge of Old Kent Road.On Westminster Bridge, close to the original ford, we are processed into another reality. We are reminded, by floral tributes, shedding sunflowers and unopened yellow tulip heads, of the mindless slaughter  who came, in pain and rage, from the coast to the capital. He stayed at Preston Park Hotel on London Road in Brighton, making a final meal of takeaway kebab, before steering his Hyundai hire car into innocent walkers on the bridge. He crumpled his piloted projectile against the low wall, the decorative ironwork barrier, with its roses and spikes, outside the Houses of Parliament. This was the fence cast by the  in Andrews Road, Hackney.We parted beyond St Paul＊s, after stepping around the queue of Chinese bridal couples waiting to pose, in costume, inside a red telephone box. Andrew drifted across London Bridge, the site of the next attack, while I meandered, through reflex City passages loud with early evening drinkers, to Shoreditch and home.

"It took a German director to notice one of cinema＊s most iconic American faces: in 1984, when this actor was 58 years old. He had been there all along.After decades of supporting roles and character parts, playing opposite the big stars and loyally showcasing their grandstanding with his own calm stillness and occasionally with his own beautiful singing voice,  had become craggily gaunt in his ascetic handsomeness, like some Bergmanian pastor or the farmer in Grant Wood＊s painting American Gothic.The legend had suddenly come into focus. It was the slowest overnight success story imaginable.  and it first captivated the late Sam Shepard before the movie was conceived when the dramatist and screenwriter 每 whose own acting persona was perhaps not so far from Stanton＊s 每 saw in him and that magnificent face a gentleness, sensitivity, gallantry and painful masculinity which expressed his own poetic voice.Shepard got Stanton the part of his lifetime, playing the anguished Travis Henderson, who is blazoned on the screen as the lonely and agonised wanderer in the Texas desert, poignantly wearing a red baseball cap and a suit and tie in the blazing heat, slowly dying of thirst, walking, walking, walking, but why and where he hardly knows. Shepard and Wenders captured that face and the music of Ry Cooder＊s wailing steel guitar captured its American grandeur and loneliness, rather as for an earlier generation Ennio Morricone＊s ※coyote§ theme from The Good The Bad And The Ugly somehow captured the presence of Clint Eastwood.Harry Dean Stanton＊s face was itself the landscape: really for the first time in his career, he was allowed to be still, simply to let his mute presence impose itself on the screen. His Travis is one of the great self-destructive personalities of the modern cinema: capable of monumental acts of both self-annihilation and yet self-assertion. (I always thought he would be great in a Thomas Hardy adaptation 每 perhaps playing Michael Henchard in The Mayor Of Casterbridge.)He is lethally silent and stricken in Paris, Texas＊s opening scenes, an ambulant Mount Rushmore of personal agony as he faces his troubled brother, played by Dean Stockwell. But later he has an equally famous scene, calmly speaking to his estranged wife, played by Natassja Kinski, speaking through peep show glass behind which she is required to perform for the customers, but invisibly and with his back to her, so they are strangely facing the same way as he calmly recounts the story which she does not immediately recognise as theirs. His voice is eerily level, calm, detached 每 and yet there is something passive-aggressive in what he is doing. Stanton conveys all this tension and contradiction.Before Paris, Texas, Stanton had been a tremendous actor whose gift for comedy had been at once used and yet under-used.  (in that same year, 1984) and he was the phoney blind man for John Huston in Wise Blood (1979). He was Dustin Hoffman＊s buddy in Straight Time (1978) for Ulu Grosbard, joining him for a bungled robbery, and played opposite Jack Nicholson＊s cattle rustler in Arthur Penn＊s Missouri Breaks (1976). , he was the heating technician Brett who follows the cat into the engine room where the nightmarishly grown creature grabs him. In each and every one of these films he was a strong supporting player, the sort of natural on-camera presence who adds sinew and texture to a movie without it being obvious.After  his roles and his perception by industry and public were shaped by the uniquely potent figure of Travis, and the movies had to try to accommodate his unique character-player starpower, and that wasn＊t easy, or even entirely possible.He wasn＊t, however, always forced to be straightforwardly enigmatic and haunted. Stanton fans loved his performance as Molly Ringwald＊s dad in Pretty In Pink (1986). He did TV interviews in which he jokingly talked about his drug use, and hinted at a kind of maverick Hunter S. Thompson uncageability. But calling him a hellraiser was a caricature. There was one director he was born to work for and that was David Lynch. , the ill-fated private detective Johnnie Farragut in Wild At Heart (1990), and in Inland Empire (2006) he is Freddie Howard, the unsettling ※assistant§ to Jeremy Irons＊s oleaginous Brit movie director. , the elderly stroke victim whose plight inspires his brother to make a cross-country journey to see him on a rider-lawnmower, appears also to channel some of the mythic poignancy of Travis. But perhaps the more inspired use of Stanton was by Martin Scorsese, who cast him as Paul Of Tarsus in , portraying him not as the great proselytiser and moralist but something more like a huckster and ranter and ideologue, blandly unconcerned on being confronted by the un-crucified Jesus who is angry at his presumptuous myth-making, a character with something of the DNA of his fake blind preacher in Wise Blood: ※I created the truth out of what people needed and what they believed!§ he says to Jesus, indignantly. It would have been fascinating to see Stanton in the role of Jesus himself. He would have made of it something very sad and funny.																																											"
"?The shortcomings of the English language are never more apparent than when it is used to translate Indigenous Australian beliefs, customs and culture?. So it follows ?that English-style museums 每 which is to say, most Australian ones 每 also often fall short?.Museums of bricks and mortar are largely antithetical to Aboriginal repositories of material and lived culture 每 community, country, story (in every form) and memory.How could a museum with walls and windows and display cases even contemplate an exhibition about something as central to 60,000-plus years of Indigenous life on this continent as ※songlines§ 每 , which references paths of Indigenous knowledge and creation history that crisscross land, heaven and water? Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders have long embraced Chatwin＊s ※songlines§ (at least the word, if not his 1987 novel The Songlines). They have claimed it to describe what they also know to be  tracks or dreaming paths 每 cultural, political, spiritual, ecological, geographical, historical (and so very much more) wisdom that is etched for them in the land.Songlines embody the stories of the ancestors＊ creation of country itself. They are a belief system. But they are also akin to maps 每 stories about the land that, understood, spoken or sung, can be used to navigate on foot or even by vehicle. Given that this continent＊s Indigenous populations represent the oldest continuous civilisations on earth, the songlines can even be seen as foundation stories of the cosmos.?Now the National Museum of Australia, itself situated on an ancient corroboree ground through which runs a dreaming track, is explaining in an exhibition 每  每 that which words have failed. The verdict: a triumph of 21st century museology that the world deserves to see. It uses few English words and as many Indigenous. It is visual and experiential, featuring more than 100 paintings, photographs and other artworks, maps, video installations and a quite remarkable immersive six-metre multimedia ※DomeLab§ to tell the creationist story of the seven sisters as it appears in sections of five vast western and central desert songlines. It tells this story the way the people to whom it belongs 每 of the Martu, Ngaanyatjarra and APY (Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjara) lands 每 understand it.The Seven Sisters is a metaphor and an allegory, a story of traditional laws that imparts ways to live today. It incorporates sexual longing, danger, deception, metamorphosis, temptation and an epic battle between good and evil, as the lustful sorcerer Wati Nyiru or Yurla chases and tries to seduce the sisters. He＊s a ※shape-shifter§, this demon; he becomes a tree to tempt them with shade, and a snake who they can kill and eat. The story has its variations from songline to songline, country to country.The songline goes subterranean in places, as the women dive into a waterhole to escape Wati Nyiru. They have other tricks too. They can fly. And so, as he chases them they take off from the Earth (woven images of the women soar over the exhibition) and become one with the Orion constellation and Pleiades star cluster.You can navigate parts of the central and western deserts using those stars, walk from waterhole to waterhole where the sisters submerged and emerged ... but only if you know the songline. There is another way of thinking about it: the women created the landmarks 每 the boulders and the trees, the hillocks and the waterholes 每 that they traversed on their chase. On other songlines the country over, creationist animals 每 emus, kangaroos, snakes 每 made the land.This exhibition is as breathtaking, as wondrous, as it is at times overwhelming and confounding. As you walk around it, stretch out in the dome 每 which includes images of 3,500-year-old rock art about the seven sisters from Cave Hill in South Australia 每 and examine the art, you might think you know precisely what a songline, a dreaming or churinga track, is.But then you＊ll try to explain it in English to the person next to you and the odds are you＊ll fall short.Yes, the songlines are mind-blowing for their multi-layered, literal and allegorical meanings, and the challenges they pose to western thought constructs and linear notions of time. Just as they are also profoundly beautiful for the purity of the beliefs and the spiritual truths that underpin them. This exhibition celebrates Indigenous culture and belief, endurance and wisdom in a way I＊ve not hitherto experienced in a cultural collecting institution. It has immeasurably raised the international standard for any museum wanting to tell Indigenous stories (take note ).Significantly, this is not a top-down exhibition. Its genesis lies in a request in 2010 from Anangu elders of the APY lands who, concerned that the Seven Sisters story would be lost to new Indigenous generations, asked the museum to help track the songlines and preserve the knowledge. The museum＊s chief Indigenous curator and adviser,  has worked collaboratively with a team of elders from the lands over the past seven years to mount the exhibition and to help track the songlines visually, performatively, archaeologically and ecologically. The artworks created for the exhibition will be incorporated into the museum＊s national collection.Neale, of Aboriginal/Irish heritage, reckons the songlines are a ※master archive 每 and they really are given that they record 60,000 or more years of experience of the oldest continuous civilisation ... they record deep cultural and geographic and all sort of other knowledge in the land and then transmit it§.She continues: ※I＊ve thought about it a lot and at their simplest, the songlines are corridors or pathways of knowledge embedded in the land, that crisscross this country and which have been laid down over the millennia.§Rene Kulitja, a senior artist from Mutitjulu who sings and dances the Seven Sisters story, smiles and nods when I ask if this exhibition will help non-Indigenous people understand what songlines are.※When I was a schoolgirl, maybe 13, in 1970 or 1971, an old lady taught me the Seven Sisters,§ she says. ※I understand it. It＊s important. It＊s our law. Every single day after school I would sing and dance the Seven Sisters. Now you can see it here too.§This exhibition focuses on sections of only five songlines that deal with the same story. There are thousands of others the length and breadth of the country, extending above and below us and into the sea. And so this exhibition intrigues and impels you to ask big existential questions and, naturally, to scrutinise ever harder Australia＊s non-Indigenous creationist myths around foreign wars, continental invasion, dispossession and white settlement. It is a celebration of the wonders of this remarkable country that will introduce new generations of Indigenous and other Australians to a continental identity that stretches tens of thousands of years beyond 1770 or 1788.It may well send a new legion of readers the way of Chatwin, whose book, seminal though it remains, could have benefited from much in this exhibition. But he remains a trail-blazer, an Englishman engaging with the dreaming tracks that so much of Australia could not have cared less about just a few decades ago.Not least, Tracking the Seven Sisters puts into sharp relief recent historical spats, over statues for example, and reinforces the truth that those who were here first seeded the land with story long, long, long before the British arrived with parchment and quill to tell so many other tales.

"he BBC is often bad at defending itself. As the nation＊s crucible, upholding an idea of fair reporting in the turmoil of these bitterly divided times, its journalism comes under ferocious and unjustified attack, so it was good to hear its chairman  at the Royal Television Society convention on Wednesday.He protests at politicians who give their approval for increasingly ※explicit and aggressive§ abuse directed at BBC journalists. Politicians ※stand by and watch§, giving tacit support to hecklers at press conferences trying to intimidate BBC reporters asking tough questions. From right and left, pro- and anti-Brexiteers in the red mist of increasingly ferocious national debate, hard questioning by  journalists is taken as proof of bias.The , arriving at such a fraught time, was bound to attract most abuse, just as  and  of all stripes draw a particularly vicious strand of misogynist hate. How shocking that Laura Kuenssberg has needed a bodyguard. Despite the murder of Jo Cox and , particularly against women, this sharp and incisive questioner hasn＊t buckled.Walking the BBC line of unbiased reporting is becoming harder by the week, as both leave and remain supporters tear apart every word of every story. Nor does being attacked by both sides guarantee that they always get it right. But on Brexit questions of fact versus fantasy, how are BBC journalists supposed to balance reporting on actual bad effects happening now 每 , ,  and the medicines agency departing, , imminent chaos at the ports 每 against vanishingly few putative Brexit benefits? BBC reporters are not obliged to split the difference between flat-Earthers and round-Earthers 每 or, these days mercifully, between climate deniers and climate change evidence. Making judgments on the likely truth of what they report is part of their job.Mounting abuse of the BBC could in the end destroy it: it only survives on the trust and affection of most citizens. Those on the left joining in the attack, dismissing the BBC as part of an ※§ plot, fuel the right＊s aim to dismantle and privatise it. Murdoch and his press seize every chance to attack it, mainly for commercial reasons. He has always argued for the BBC to lose the licence fee, and to become a small subscription service. Today : if he takes over Sky, he will push next to abolish laws obliging broadcasters to be unbiased, Foxifying our news networks. Where does that leave the BBC?The political animus against the BBC runs through the right of the Tory party, indignant at the very existence of a publicly funded organisation that is phenomenally successful, its every triumph an affront to their anti-public service dogma. At every opportunity, they chip away at it: George Osborne . Its governance is frequently reinvented, its charter renewal and licence fee rattled as a threat. Successive governments lean on it politically, mainly but not exclusively Tory: Blair blasted it over the Iraq war, while Harold Wilson boycotted it. But usually the bullying comes from the right: recently Liam Fox  to protest that the BBC was putting out anti-Brexit propaganda. As a national beacon, the BBC is first to be attacked for national failings others share 每 , over-paying its managers, or on Wednesday from Ofcom for its  on and off screen. It has a tough moral duty to be best at everything, so it＊s bound to fail sometimes.All polling shows the  the BBC still commands, one of the few unifying icons of national pride, along with the NHS. The envy of the world, its news is trusted as no other. But here＊s a perplexing question: if we have this great national broadcaster, why is British political knowledge and understanding so weak? Shouldn＊t we have the best-informed democracy? Why has the BBC not had a greater measurable cultural and educational impact? Polls show consistently how little people know about the basic facts on which to make political judgments.But that may demand too much, as if the BBC could correct all the fundamental ills in the society it reports and reflects. Even now a supposedly declining press has a stronger pull on the nation＊s psyche than our national broadcaster. The BBC is still a weak voice to rebalance a political landscape grossly distorted by a dominant far-right press for the near-century of the BBC＊s existence. That＊s all the more reason to defend its journalism against raucous assault in a country more viscerally divided than ever before.

"Three of the UK＊s most important galleries have announced an unprecedented collaboration in which they will stage exhibitions devoted to different aspects of work by one living artist: .In 2018, the  will show the portrait work of Dean, while the National Gallery will show still life and the Royal Academy of Arts will show landscape.Dean, a British artist who is based in Berlin and Los Angeles, is primarily known for her film work such as her commission for , which was a loving homage to the dying medium of celluloid.The three-gallery project came about organically after the NPG began discussions with Dean for what will be its first-ever exhibition devoted to the medium of film.Its director, Nicholas Cullinan, said he became aware that the RA had also approached Dean about a show for its 250th year: ※We thought a more interesting model, rather than try to compete and say ＆you＊ve got to choose one＊, was to collaborate.§After more discussions it became clear there was a side to Dean＊s work that was missing, which is why the  came on board. ※We now have this wonderful idea of one artist, three venues, three genres,§ Cullinan said.※It has been very organic and such a great collaboration and I think more galleries in  and beyond should do this; you don＊t have to compete.§Tim Marlow, the RA＊s director of exhibitions, agreed calling it a landmark collaboration. ※Sometimes institutions are seen as being very competitive and parts of some institutions are very competitive but if, creatively, culturally and curatorially we can＊t get it together then there＊s a big problem and we should be doing more of this.§Marlow said Dean was ※one of the most important artists of her generation anywhere in the world§ and one who deserved to be even better recognised than she is.The NPG show will will include the first UK display of  of the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham, as well as films relating to the artists Claes Oldenburg, David Hockney and Julie Mehretu.At the National Gallery Dean will present historical paintings, such as  alongside still life works either by Dean or her contemporaries including Roni Horn, Wolfgang Tillmans and Thomas Demand.Both shows will run simultaneously and while dates have yet to be announced for the RA it will overlap with the other two.The reason for the date announcement delay is that Dean will be staging her show in new gallery space at the RA being created as part of its, one on Piccadilly, the other on Burlington Gardens.Dean＊s landscape show will explore the subject in its broadest sense, taking in botany, cosmography, travel and weather and culminating in a new 35mm Cinemascope film called Antigone featuring the poet Anne Carson and the actor Stephen Dillane.Dean said it was a great honour to make the exhibitions for the three galleries: ※It has been a huge pleasure developing the structure of these exhibitions with everyone involved and daring to gently nudge pre-existing orthodoxies about what constitutes a landscape, portrait and still life.§																																											"
"hen the composer Igor Stravinsky and the artist-archaeologist Nicholas Roerich sat down to create a primeval ballet of prehistory and human sacrifice in 1911, they found inspiration in the strange world of the ancient Scythians. The Rite of Spring, the ballet unleashed in Paris two years later, draws on Roerich＊s own excavations to paint its scything musical picture of the violent Scythian past. His set included paintings of their burial mounds.The contents of those mounds can be seen in all their eerily preserved barbarian splendour in the British Museum＊s resurrection of a past that feels very remote indeed. In one case, I saw a decorated animal hide 每 but no, on closer inspection, this was the tattooed skin of a Scythian warlord, preserved along with his fierce-looking head. The Scythians understood the preservative power of ice and capped their tombs with heaps of stone to keep in the cold. This exhibition abounds in the intimate relics these underground freezers preserved: leather saddles, embroidered rugs, felt clothes 每 an entire nomadic culture retrieved from time.The Scythians are not unknown to history 每 or myth. They flourished from about 900 to 200BC, ranging from their Siberian homelands to the Black Sea and China, a nomadic people who pioneered sophisticated saddles that let them fight more effectively on horseback than any of the settled civilisations they encountered. They fought off the Persians and scared the ancient Greeks. It is even possible they inspired the Greek myth of the centaur, a half-horse, half-human creature. The idea becomes much more believable when you see the elaborate armour and helmets they created for a horse to wear, to carry its owner into the afterlife. Some ancient rulers were buried with their slaves or wives, but Scythian lords were accompanied by their horses. It suggests a very close connection 每 and a Scythian riding into battle really might have looked to awestruck witnesses like a centaur.In Greek mythology, centaurs go mad when they drink wine. Objects recovered from their tombs reveal how the Scythians learned about wine from Greece and got addicted to it. If heavy drinking was big in their culture, so was smoking weed. The Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote in the 5th century BC, is often accused of making up his outlandish stories. One tale he tells about the Scythians is that they loved to smoke hemp, which they burned under a kind of tent that you could put your head into. One such device is in this exhibition, recovered from a Scythian tomb. Herodotus got this one right.I＊ve mentioned Stravinsky and Herodotus but a lot of the time this exhibition is sheer . The horse-riding nomadic Scythians menacing more settled societies in China, Greece and Persia have a lot in common with the TV fantasy world＊s Dothraki, who similarly skirt the rim of civilisation. In time, the Scythian lifestyle would produce a chain of warlords in the same part of the world, from the Huns to the Mongols, who would bring down Rome and conquer China. A primeval warrior power, dark and merciless, emanates from the most bizarre object here: a giant wooden coffin, big enough to hold about four bodies, in which a single warrior was entombed so that he would be remembered as a superhuman giant. Yet the Scythians had artistic skill as well as strength. They created golden images that are more than mere shiny things. In a famous ancient Greek sculpture, a lion attacks a horse. In Scythian gold, there are tigers fighting camels, monsters attacking horses. It was when these gold marvels started coming out of Siberia in the early 18th century that the Scythians began to emerge from legend into archaeology. Peter the Great, the westernising tsar who built St Petersburg, grabbed the finds for his royal collection. The Hermitage has since accumulated the world＊s greatest Scythian horde and has lent a stupendous array. My only quibble with this absorbing journey into the rites of the Scythians is that it doesn＊t open out enough. We get a lot about Peter the Great but why not explore modern Russia＊s obsession with the Scythians more? I＊d have liked to see Roerich＊s art and designs for The Rite of Spring. Instead this exhibition is determined to let these warriors speak for themselves, even though they left no writing. We＊re urged to put aside prejudices against ancient ※barbarians§ and see things from their point of view. The result is beguiling, but by the end it gets a bit narrow and enclosed. Perhaps that, too, is an accurate reflection of the Scythian world: horses, wine, war and good hemp to smoke 每 what else do you need?  is at the British Museum, London, from 14 September until 14 January.

"Late-night hosts on Monday addressed the administration＊s response to , the media＊s response to Trump＊s deal with Democrats to lift the debt ceiling, and Steve Bannon＊s appearance on 60 Minutes with Charlie Rose.Seth Meyers began: ※As his administration deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, President Trump is also dealing with a brewing storm within his own party over his decision to strike a funding deal with Democrats, prompting an absurd new round of punditry over whether  is actually a Republican.※For one thing, there were the heroic acts of first responders rescuing people in the storm,§ he continued. ※Now, you＊d think applauding the bravery of emergency responders like the coastguard would be one of the easiest things a president could do, but even that, it seems, was too much to ask of Donald Trump, who praised the coastguard yesterday by saying this.§Meyers then aired footage of Trump lauding its quick response, adding: ※If you talk about branding, no brand has improved more than the US Coast Guard.§※Branding? What are you talking about?,§ Meyers asked. ※The coastguard doesn＊t need to improve their brand. They＊re not Arby＊s.§※Yesterday, in the midst of the storm, president Trump＊s director of social media, Dan Scavino, who has repeatedly attacked reporters and accused them of spreading fake news, tweeted a video of what he said was flooding in Miami international airport,§ the host continued. ※Now, it was an intense scene, so the tweet had a lot of replies, including this one from Miami international airport, that said ＆This video is not from Miami international airport＊.§※You know you＊re bad at your job when even airports are correcting you,§ Meyers quipped, before moving onto the response from Republicans and journalists to Trump＊s spending deal with the Democrats.※Trump stunned Republicans last week by cutting a deal with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to lift the debt limit and keep the government funded for three months,§ he explained. ※Just to give you an idea of how unhappy Republicans were with the president＊s sudden friendship with the Democrats, look at Mitch McConnell＊s face during their meeting with Trump in the oval office last week.§Meyers showed a clip of McConnell in the meeting: ※He looks like he just saw a fellow ghost,§ Meyers added.※Trump＊s hostility to to certain Republicans in Congress, like senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, have GOP leaders worried ahead of next year＊s midterms,§ he said. ※Trump got one deal with Democrats to keep the government open to avoid financial chaos, and now all of a sudden there is a rush of praise from the media crowning him as America＊s first independent president.§Meyers then showed a slew of headlines, from publications such as the Associated Press, New York Times, and the Washington Post, that wondered whether the deal represented a new, centrist Trump.※Can we just stop with this absurd taking point?,§ Meyers said. ※Donald Trump is not an independent. The only thing he is independent of is reality.§ of Comedy Central also weighed in on the weekend＊s news, including Steve Bannon＊s interview with Charlie Rose.※It＊s been almost a month since president Trump fired , his chief strategist and human sloppy joe,§ Noah began. ※Now, during his time with Trump, Bannon operated from the shadows, but last night he braved the lights of 60 Minutes to give his first major TV interview.§Noah then showed intermittent clips from the interview, including Bannon＊s speculation about Republicans trying to ※nullify the election results,§ ※illegal aliens filling churches,§ and whether or not the Washington Monument would be the next statue removed by leftwing activists.※Wow, it＊s like Donald Trump took a dump while he was tweeting and then wished for that dump to be a real boy,§ Noah joked. ※I will name it Steve.§Noah continued: ※Bannon＊s interview wasn＊t particularly eye-opening. Mostly, he just willingly confirmed that he is who we thought he was: a radical nationalist who believes that Donald Trump will be instrumental in tearing down the establishment. But one moment really showed how all-in he is on Trump.§Noah then showed the portion of Bannon＊s interview about the infamous Access Hollywood tape showing Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. Bannon said the fiasco was a ※litmus test§ for who would stick by then-candidate Trump, adding that Chris Christie was not made part of the White House team because of his comments that weekend condemning Trump＊s language.※Man, that＊s loyalty,§ Noah said. ※Even after Trump fired Bannon, he＊s still going to fight for him from outside the White House. If Donald Trump ever killed someone, Bannon will be the guy driving the white supremacist Bronco.§※I don＊t know if you noticed this, but Bannon has a very interesting way of rebranding the infamous Donald Trump pussy-grabbing scandal,§ Noah said, showing clips from the interview in which Bannon refers to the October incident as ※Billy Bush Saturday§ and ※Billy Bush weekend.§※Billy Bush weekend?§ Noah responded. ※Poor Billy Bush. Somewhere he must have bene watching that, like, ＆come on man, I was just  the bus. You can＊t name something after someone who happened to be there. That＊s like rebranding the JFK assassination ＆Motorcade Driver＊s Bad Day＊§.※Now if there＊s one issue Bannon is known for as well, it＊s his opposition to immigration,§ Noah said, showing a clip of Bannon, in response to a question about Trump＊s controversial decision to end Daca, reiterating his stance on immigration and saying America is founded on her citizens. ※And on that front, he did not budge an inch.§※I don＊t even know why he＊s fighting about this,§ Noah said. ※We all know America is a nation of immigrants.§ The Daily Show, in fact, went into the archives to discover that Lawrence Bannon, the great-great-grandfather of the former White House adviser, immigrated to the country in the 1850s from Ireland.※So, in many way＊s, Steve Bannon＊s great grandfather was a Dreamer,§ Noah concluded. ※And his great-grandson is a fucking nightmare.§																																											"
"onald Trump, against the odds, seems determined to build his ※tall, powerful, beautiful§ wall along the Mexican border 每 although it needs to be see-through, he now thinks, so that border agents won＊t get surprised by ※§ being tossed over. , he notoriously referred to Mexicans coming to the US as ※bringing crime§ and as ※rapists§. Without doubt, Trump gives a political piquancy to the grand festival of exhibitions and events about to begin in southern California, one that has as its motto ※a celebration beyond borders§. involves more than 70 galleries and museums, all of which are addressing the theme of Latin American and Latino art in dialogue with Los Angeles. La la land for the next six months will become la la la land, as the city of dreams (if not, thanks to Trump, of ＆＊) underlines its importance as a world art capital.PST was initiated and is largely funded by the Getty Foundation, the world＊s richest visual art institution, which has provided more than $16 million in grants. When I speak to its president, Jim Cuno, he says the theme was decided some years ago, when ※borders weren＊t so sharply in our mind§. But he adds: ※We welcome the political dimension that it now has§ not least because a discussion of centuries of culture can make clear how such frontiers ※are always being renegotiated ＃ The border between the US and Mexico, say, from the perspective of hundreds of years, is always a temporary phenomenon.§, Cuno says, ※for most of its history has been a Latin American city, a Spanish-speaking city,, and before too long it will be predominantly Spanish-speaking again§. Various curators have suggested that PST artworks will challenge ideas of the United States 每 not only due to the festival＊s recognition of the huge Latino presence in the country, but also because the US will be approached, much more than is usual, as part of a constantly changing history of the Americas, not as an exceptional case.※Our job wasn＊t to direct, but to facilitate,§ Cuno says. The Getty left it up to individual institutions to ※rehearse the divisive issues§. PST is also ※not a reductive exercise§ designed to establish a canon, but a window on to a hugely varied artistic landscape. Among the vast array of shows in the next months will be  centred on a tour Walt Disney made south of the border in 1941 as part of a ※good neighbour§ exercise intended to counter Nazi propaganda. Disney was sufficiently inspired to make The Three Caballeros, which had Donald Duck dancing a samba and breaking open a pi?ata, and which later was cited in Latin America as one of countless examples of US cultural imperialism. showcases the bold and witty graphic design of Cuban film posters for US films, not least those of Charlie Chaplin, who was revered in revolutionary Cuba, as the curators underline, ※for his heroic depictions of the dispossessed worker§ struggling with capitalist exploitation. His toothbrush moustache, bowler hat and heavy eyebrows became emblems of mobile movie theatres taken by ※truck, boat, and mule to some of the most remote areas of Cuba§. Also featured are posters for films by Hitchcock, Kubrick and starring Marilyn Monroe, whose support for the revolution and the US civil rights movement as well as her solidarity with the blacklisted Hollywood writers during McCarthyism ※endeared her to the Cuban people§.Cuno particularly mentions , an exhibition at the ※extraordinarily vital§ Hammer museum in LA, which considers art that used the female body as a form of political protest, in an era of  and repressive regimes. There is a photographic record of a performance in which Colombian artist Mar赤a Evelia Marmolejo cut her feet before she walked on paper laid throughout a public square, leaving a trail of blood. The Hammer show is in part an exercise in retrieving forgotten activity: also documented is the Mexican artist Maris Bustamante＊s conceptual work in which she patented the taco. She would also appear on stage wearing an apron, as if she had come straight from the kitchen, and throw firecrackers to suggest gunshots, before jokily threatening: ※Nobody leaves a lecture on feminist art!§The days when the nabobs of the art community were interested solely in Diego and Frida, or in Latin American artists only when they touched on the accepted north-oriented narrative (when  etc), are now distant. The story is no longer about ※connections between ＆them and us＊§, Cuno says, but vibrant indigenous cultural expression. And today there is a ※missionary zeal§ to rewrite art history with many new chapters.The current art carnival is the second Pacific Standard Time. Cuno arrived at the Getty in 2011 just as the first one 每 which explored art in LA from 1945 to 1980 每 was beginning. It had already become clear, he says, that ※the art world was wider and more complicated than simply Europe and New York§, and that LA was ※a dramatic and important player in the education, exhibition and housing of artists§ 每 the latter because studio space was relatively cheap. The first PST ※exploded with great excitement§, he recalls, not least because of the unique nature of the collaboration: he has talked of ※a youthful, sunny disposition§ on the part of Californian colleagues in joining together. When the second iteration was being planned, therefore, ※all we had to do was open the door and the world wanted to rush in§.We＊re speaking in Cuno＊s office at the Getty Center, the palatial modern complex of white marble and glass on a hill that rises above LA＊s smoggy heat haze. When it was built in the early 1990s, the Getty came under fire for removing itself from a troubled city 每 the Center＊s sparkling building was deemed an embodiment of elitism. Cuno says that the huge number of visitors it attracts has proved critics wrong (its views are a pull: ※This isn＊t San Francisco, there isn＊t a Hampstead Heath, we don＊t have high points to look out from§). But it seems evident, too, that PST is important in connecting the wealthy Getty with the southern Californian art explosion, bringing the Foundation down from the hill.The Center will itself put on high-prestige exhibitions 每 including , a display of treasures from the royal courts of the Mayans, Incas and Aztecs. But thanks to PST, it also has a direct link with closer-to-the-ground contemporary art, such as . And the inclusion of Latino as well as Latin American art simply made this PST ※even more deliciously complicated that we had imagined§. of faceless, dark-skinned workers into Hockney tableaux of sun-dazzled swimming pools is an example, within PST, of Latino art adding a layer to an increasingly complex visual history. Another is the work of the Mexico-born Carlos Almaraz, a leading force in the Chicano arts movement of the 1970s, who is the subject of . His car-crash paintings were not only a comment on California automobile culture and a freeway-dominated city, but were refractions of such recent art as Judy Chicago＊s sprayed Car Hood and Ed Ruscha＊s photographs of parking lots and gas stations. Latino artists were significant even in the first, 60s-70s stage of the LA art revolution, when, as Cuno describes it, there was ※great excitement about the laid-back openness of California§, and the state became ※what New York had been in terms of the public imagination§.He says there is now ※an even greater wave of younger people ＃ central and east LA are opening up. There＊s a lot of focus, new galleries and growth.§ He is enthusiastic that the Getty ※can help to create the conditions in which it can all thrive＊. Much of the funding has been directed towards scholarship, archives and catalogues, so that PST leaves roots behind. As all the marvels of LA/LA are about to be uncovered, and the topic it explores glints with subversion, Cuno has one over-riding hope: ※That we can look back five years from now and say that things changed.§																																											"

Focusing around the east LA neighbourhood of Boyle Heights, art galleries that have tried to move into the area have been met with resistance.Along with real estate agents, who promoted the area＊s lower rents as a selling point to outsiders, community activists viewed incoming art galleries as part of a wave of gentrification that had already changed other areas in the city with , such as Echo Park, Silver Lake and Highland Park.Groups opposed to gentrification have targeted spaces they accuse of ※§ 每 such as the United Talent Agency＊s , which opened with a Larry Clark show 12 months ago, and the non-profit PSSST, which closed recently after a protracted campaign by those who opposed its presence in the area.Defend Boyle Heights and the Boyle Heights Alliance Against Artwashing and Displacement released a statement celebrating the closure. ※Boyle Heights will continue to fight against the false promises of development and community improvement that are supposed to benefit us, but end up displacing us from our home,§ it read. ※Once again we call on all galleries in Boyle Heights to reconsider your position and leave immediately.§As Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, the city-wide exhibition that focuses on the relationship between , its Latino communities and Latin America gets under way, there are hopes that some of the butting of heads between elements of the art world and the communities they serves can ease.Getty Foundation deputy director Joan Weinstein, who helped organize the more than 70 shows involved in the project, hopes it will help start conversations between art spaces and communities that have started to oppose them.Weinstein said: ※People have identified coffee shops and galleries as a sign that a local area is becoming gentrified and local population are being priced out of the neighbourhood. I think Boyle Heights became as a flash point, and one would hope for constructive conversations rather than the polarization which somehow sees art as the enemy in this conversation.§That conversation could be triggered by the different themes the exhibition offers from ※borders, diaspora and displacement§ to ※definitions of identity§. Not only does the work chime with some of the issues taking place in the city＊s art world but also the wider current political climate. The weekend before the exhibition started  over the termination of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), the latest White House move that has affected more than half a million ※Dreamers§ who live in California.It＊s something Weinstein and the exhibition＊s organizers couldn＊t have anticipated in 2012 when preparations started. ※We began this project in a very different political climate, almost five years ago,§ she said.※There was a kind of an agenda here as we were re-writing art history from a different perspective. We were asking: what does art history look like if you write it from the position of Latin America?※Now it has taken on a very different feel with the current political climate. There couldn＊t be a better moment for us to assert that we want to build bridges, not build walls and as we point out 每 borders are really political creations and they don＊t fit into cultural production.§Chon Noriega, director of the Chicano studies research center at UCLA, sees Pacific Standard Time as an opportunity to rethink the way we see Latino communities in the US and the US＊s impact on Latino and Latin American groups. (Noriega also curated the exhibition Home 每 So Different, So Appealing along with Pilar Tompkins Rivas and Mari Carmen Ram赤rez.)※It＊s given people a different way to think of themes like home and belonging,§ he said of his exhibition at Lacma.※When we think of home and think about the American dream, and a white picket fence, and segregated living communities 每 we wanted to look at the flip side of that, which is what did that dream do to the rest of the continent or hemisphere?※You can look at the instability of a country like Colombia because the primary exchange between Colombia and the US is cocaine 每 and that＊s not going to the street that＊s going to the upper middle class.§Noriega and Weinstein see Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA as a way to reassess Los Angeles＊ relationship with Latin and Latin American art 每 and hopefully continuing that with research grants that are also part of the project.※There＊s a stereotype of Latin American art being Diego [Rivera] and Frida [Kahlo], and there isn＊t much of that stuff here,§ she said.

That＊s a shame, it really is, but unfortunately, there is nothing cute or romantic about a man making loud, public demands for a woman＊s attention, time and affection.The piano player＊s vigil has ended 每 after he says he was  early yesterday morning. Obviously nothing about his conduct warrants that sort of reaction, but it＊s time that both men and the media stopped presenting such entitled, creepy behaviour as ※cute§ or deserving of sympathy.Rejection is painful, but that pain doesn＊t give anyone licence to disregard another individual＊s assertion of boundaries 每 which is what rejection is: a drawing of lines excluding us. People are allowed to draw up whatever boundaries they like in terms of who they wish to spend time with or date. As adults we should learn to accept this and move on. But men have long been taught to disregard boundaries, as any glance at  demonstrates.People learn behaviours as they grow up in many ways, and it＊s not just parents but society and pop culture that teach us what＊s acceptable. And these things teach us that such entitled behaviour is not only welcome, but a normal part of relationships. One of the highest rated sitcoms of all time, The Big Bang Theory, has a lead female character outline the basis of her romantic relationship with the male lead by saying: ※He started to slowly wear me down.§ . On another occasion: ※.§ More laughs.Instead of being welcomed willingly into her life, he had to ※wear§ down her boundaries until she felt forced to let him in.

Women have their boundaries negated again, this time by news sites wanting to know more, get more hits. Playing along with these attention-seeking men only makes it harder for others to accept rejection like mature adults. Media attention reinforces the idea that such heartbreak is deserving of a hero＊s write-up.The media have a responsibility to refrain from indulging such entitlement. Stop calling these men heartbroken. Stop listening to their whining for attention. Start calling out this behaviour for what it is: entitled men who refuse to take no for an answer.

"For the first time in its history, all plays in the ＊s new season at its two main theatres will be directed by women.On Tuesday the company announced its summer 2018 season, with a directorial lineup of Polly Findlay, Erica Whyman, Fiona Laird, Maria Aberg and Jo Davies.The RSC＊s artistic director, Gregory Doran, said it was not a deliberate act but part of a process whereby they had ※reached a point where those women directors had been with us and had grown, developed§.Equal representation for women in theatre is one of the liveliest debates in the sector and strides have been made . But many believe more changes are needed. Michelle Terry, .Doran said his autumn 2018 production of Troilus and Cressida would be the first RSC production of a Shakespeare play that had a 50:50 split, but he said he would not be following Terry＊s wider ambition.※I don＊t want to impose that on directors, it might mean we couldn＊t do an all-female production. I want to keep it much more fluid and much more organic than that.§The season will include a production of Macbeth directed by Findlay, with Christopher Eccleston in the lead role, making his RSC debut.Doran said the actor had contacted him more than two years ago asking to play the part. ※It is one of those roles which is difficult to cast,§ he said. ※We don＊t breed Macbeths much in this country and it is great to have someone of his clout and his talent. There is something about the mind and the grit of Chris Eccleston that I think will be brilliant in that play.§Whyman, the company＊s deputy artistic director, will direct Romeo and Juliet, which she said should be seen as a political play ※about a group of grown ups who have let their young people down quite profoundly§.While audiences may read the play＊s 2018 setting as a commentary on Brexit, Whyman said the politics of the moment would not be directly mentioned. ※There will be an emotional analogy rather than a direct one.§The third new production in the Royal Shakespeare theatre will be The Merry Wives of Windsor, directed by Laird and starring David Troughton as Falstaff.Doran said the plays were deliberately three of Shakespeare＊s most popular as part of a string of RSC initiatives to to encourage a passion for Shakespeare in young people.In the Swan theatre, Whyman will direct a musical based on the life of one of the 20th century＊s most influential and troublemaking theatre directors, Joan Littlewood; Aberg will direct a new production of Webster＊s The Duchess of Malfi; and Davies will direct a play by a writer lost to history, Mary Pix.Doran said her play The Beau Defeated emerged because of an RSC workshop trying to uncover female playwrights from the late 17th and 18th centuries who had been ※shamefully disregarded§. A comedy of manners, it will be retitled The Fantastic Follies of Mrs Rich.The company is also the subject of frequent protests because, like the British Museum and Royal Opera House, it takes sponsorship money from BP. Doran said it was money that was needed. ※In the economy we are in it is very difficult to unpick what is ＆good＊ money ... if you can answer me that question I＊d be delighted.§ 																																											"
"The Women＊s Social and Political Union may have started life in Manchester (, 7 September) but the suffragette movement moved to London because, as Christabel Pankhurst said, politicians took more notice of ※demonstrations of the feminine bourgeoisie than of the female proletariat§.

Good on Father Alan Everett (, 11 September) for placing poetry at the heart of a devastated community and for also providing real practical help and assistance when the Grenfell Tower victims needed it the most. This is indeed a man who cares and has ensured that  will stay in our minds forever.

"My love affair with books began when I was four years old. I＊d just started school. At the end of my first week, I came home proudly carrying a new calico bag with a picture book tucked inside. It was about a little girl searching for the perfect birthday gift for her mother. She seeks suggestions from a series of animals 每 her toys. Finally, the perfect idea presents itself: the girl bakes her mother a cake, as the toys look on. The final page of the book featured a recipe for the simplest of sponges. ※Will we make one too?§ my mum asked when I showed it to her. The next day, I helped her measure flour, sugar, eggs, butter, as she read aloud from the recipe. An hour later, from the oven emerged a wondrously warm, sugary-smelling creation. That book had made this marvellous thing happen? It was like magic. I wanted more. Back then our town had only a small public library. But as country kids, my six brothers and sisters and I were invited to participate in an outreach program run by the state library in Adelaide. We filled out forms, ticking our ages and subject interests. Once a month thereafter, an anonymous city librarian chose four books for each of us, sending the parcels by train. Our father 每 the local stationmaster 每 would phone to say they＊d arrived. Over to the station we＊d go, thrilled at the chance to be his ※real§ customers. Back home, we＊d unwrap our brown paper and corrugated cardboard bundles. I＊d ticked every box on my form, so I never knew quite what might lie inside. Once, I received a guide to raising newts. Another time, a Biggles trilogy. (I＊d ticked both the ＆Boy＊ and ＆Girl＊ boxes.) I read them all regardless, and my siblings＊ books too. Soon after, Mum got a job running our local library. Another miracle. Borrowing limits were instantly lifted. After-hours access was ours. I discovered three shelves of musty-smelling hardback Enid Blytons. I didn＊t so much read them as climb inside them. I was that little girl sitting on an old chair that sprouted wings. I lived in that big Faraway Tree, dodging Dame Washalot＊s water, hearing the clank of the Saucepan Man. I solved crimes in Dorset, rowed across to Kirrin Island, disguised myself to fool the local village bobby. I moved on to other shelves in the library. I was an ordinary kid in an Australian country town, but I lived a different life with every book I read. I＊d climb up to my favourite reading spot (the tin roof of our family house, tucked behind a chimney for shade) and be transported far from home. I time-travelled. I lived during the American civil war, in colonial Australia, on an island in Canada. In reality, I＊d never been beyond Adelaide, but through books I was travelling the world. I read descriptions of snow and tried to imagine how it might feel. (I would be 19 and living in London before I found out.) I read about pea-souper fogs while above me the daily sky was blue and clear. Year after year, book after book, my mind filled with stories, kaleidoscopic views conjured by my imagination, all sparked by lines of words. When I first moved to Ireland with my Irish husband as a 26-year-old 每 26 years ago 每 books were also my passport into Irish life. Reading novels by Maeve Binchy, William Trevor, Molly Keane and Edna O＊Brien helped me decipher Irish society. In Dublin now, if I＊m homesick for Australia, I reach for an Australian novel. Books by Robert Drewe, or Jane Harper, or Garry Disher instantly bring me back under an Australian sun, breathing in Noosa sea air or the sharp scent of country gums. If I＊m planning a holiday in a different country, I seek out novels set in my destination. Donna Leon＊s Venetian detective series. Alexander McCall Smith＊s Edinburgh books. But like everyone else, I find myself too often lured from book reading by the instant gratification of my smartphone and iPad. I＊ve had to make a conscious decision to remain a book lover. Deliberately make time for them. I＊ve banned my smartphone from the bedroom. I carry a book in my handbag. I make myself read whenever I can, rather than automatically turn to a screen. It＊s not always easy but I always feel better for it. That＊s another benefit of reading. It doesn＊t just take us out of the everyday. It also calms us, feeds our minds, our hearts, our inner lives. Reading opens up the world to us. It helps us be whoever we want to be. 																																											"
"hat＊s under the bed and in the wardrobe? Who＊s on the stair and what＊s going on in the shed? Rachel Whiteread＊s sculpture is both deadpan and affecting. It can be modest in scale and homely, grand and austere, mischievous, menacing. Her art is filled with safe spaces and frightening places, mystery and memories. All this from an artist who, since the late 1980s, has been almost entirely devoted to the making of casts. From filling a rubber hot-water bottle with liquid plaster and using it as a mould, Whiteread has gone on to cast sinks and baths and mattresses, , then an . She has cast library shelves and even one of New York＊s ubiquitous rooftop water tanks. Looking up, the translucent cast of the tank＊s interior presented a solidified, glinting void against the sky.Some of her more recent casts of cabins and sheds have been permanently located in out-of-the way places, to be discovered by chance (just imagining them baking in the Mojave desert, or getting soaked in rainswept Norway, is itself a pleasure). Whiteread refers to some of her recent works as ※shy sculptures§. Throughout her career, she has shuttled between complexity and simplicity, and between the small and close at hand, to fragments of the larger world 每 , a stairwell, a cast of the meeting , which is now installed in Whiteread＊s . The false walls in the main temporary exhibition galleries have been removed 每 to my memory, for the first time 每 leaving one enormous, open space. At first, it feels like a warehouse, filled with objects that you have to walk among and between. We are also walking through a career and a life, making our way as we will. But individual works soon take hold, and the proximities of her sculptures play off against one another and the exhibition space itself. Similarity doesn＊t mean sameness. Each of her cast mattresses and bed-bases has an entirely different timbre and feel. This is as much psychological as it is physical. Casts of sash windows and casements, interior and front doors (some with a letter-flap), are plays on differences as much as on their similarity as forms. The way her casting materials pick up the imprint of grain on a wooden floor, the muffled contours and planes of a painted door, dinks and dents, spalled plasterwork, soot stains in a fireplace, human and material imperfections, give each work character, even a kind of personality. The details are at once forensic and a reminder that everything that was once new gets worn down by time and accident, imprinted by human contact and use.Beyond the galleries, Whiteread＊s 100 casts of the spaces under chairs (made in 1995) march in rows down the first half of the Duveen sculpture court. In the rear half, Whiteread has selected a number of works from Tate＊s collection 每 signalling affinities and friendships, artistic affections, kinship. Unexpectedly, Richard Dadd＊s , a small window into the patricidal Dadd＊s mental turmoil, hangs alone on one wall. All these works 每 including sculptures by Anthony Caro, Lynda Benglis and Sarah Lucas 每 do things Whiteread＊s own art doesn＊t. Outside Tate Britain, her white, concrete chicken shed shares a lawn with a Barbara Hepworth bronze.Back inside the gallery, the saw-tooth inverted stair treads of Whiteread＊s cast stairwell climbs towards the trapezoid skylights. Nearby, light pools on an aluminium cast floor. Both these works refer to other spaces, other times. Whiteread＊s singularity rests in what is shared, the common space both of everyday objects and of art itself. As various as it is consistent, as metaphorical as it is material, her work insists on its volume and mass, its physicality and surface and absorption and resistance to light, reflection and refraction, shine and mattness, solemnity and sparkle and even colour 每 a multitude of off-whites, greys, ambers, yellows and a spectrum of Morandi-like dusty tints and shadows.But still one asks: what does a window mean, or a toilet roll, or the space inside a room, a doorknob, or a humble hot-water bottle? A beehive or a chicken shed? Whiteread＊s work often looks blank and literal, a fixed trace, like a snapshot, of an absent object, the space that once it occupied. We can never forget our passage through our surroundings, among the things we recognise and handle daily, often unconsidered and unmeasured, a familiarity that can suddenly turn into a threat and glower back at us. What Whiteread does goes beyond formal gambits or a repertoire. What she is really doing is making solid a volume of air.  Rachel Whiteread is at , until 21 January.																																											"
" is a real tonic. I defy anyone not to smile at ＊s effervescent readings of Haydn＊s graceful and urbane cello concertos in C major and in D major. He spins an exquisitely light and agile line, maintaining a delightfully sunny disposition, even in each concerto＊s adagio. These works make good-natured partners to CPE Bach＊s more earnest but equally tuneful concerto in A major, and we find some discoveries along the way too: the aria Geme la tortorella, from Mozart＊s a, arranged by Isserlis for cello, and Boccherini＊s delicately sweet adagio from his rarely heard concerto in G major. The Bremen players add just the right degree of elegance and poise to make this a CD to treasure.																																											"
"ld age marks a rendezvous with reality that provokes timeless questions. At the end of John le Carr谷＊s new novel, his greatest creation, George Smiley, observes that ※an old spy in his dotage seeks the truth of ages§.As he approaches 86, David Cornwell, AKA , still has to make a necessary rapprochement with his divided self, his past and its achievements. There are, no doubt, obscure and unreconciled regrets, obsessions and disappointments. But if you are lucky, as Cornwell has been, to retain your joie de vivre and your marbles, this final reckoning offers the resolution of an inner conflict. Le Carr谷 has always loved German literature, and he knows his Heidegger: ※Every man is born as many men, and dies as a single one.§The ※legacy§ of his title tells us that Le Carr谷 is in the posterity business. If he is playing for keeps, there are just three questions to which his dedicated readers will require an answer: what is  about? What is its deeper purpose? And where does it fit into his imposing oeuvre?There＊s no mistaking Le Carr谷＊s importance. The list of his published work numbers some 24 volumes which, with the exception of , his autobiography of 2016, present an impressive roll call of thrillers that date from in 1961, when Harold Macmillan was prime minister and JFK had been recently inaugurated as US president.In those far-off days, the novel of espionage seemed the perfect instrument for examining the soul of a post-imperial society. Then came George Smiley＊s finest hour, a sequence of novels that elevated the spy thriller into an art form 每 ; ; and . Few English writers of the late 20th century produced fiction to match the Le Carr谷 of these novels.Today, nearly 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we would not expect Le Carr谷 to be writing at such a pitch. Still, with the exception of PG?Wodehouse, whom Le Carr谷 idolises as ※the Master§, the English canon has rarely seen an acclaimed novelist and popular entertainer sustain such a hot streak into old age. Cornwell/Le Carr谷 has been publishing for six decades and, on the evidence offered here, remains both fiercely driven and impressively commanding.Still,  has an unmistakable aura of valediction. Narrated by an old hand from ※the Circus§, Peter Guillam, a hard-of-hearing old man, formerly the devoted colleague and ally of his master, it describes the moment in Guillam＊s recent past when he finds the aftermath of a forgotten battle from Berlin in the early 1960s coming to torment his retirement.The letter 每 Le Carr谷 does not flinch from this classic device 每 that arrives in Guillam＊s coastal farm in Brittany summons the old spy to London to answer some highly troublesome questions about the long-buried treacheries surrounding an agent named Alec?Leamas.Not only do these inquiries plunge the protagonist into some of the bleakest moments of the cold war, it also connects the attentive Le Carr谷 reader to his youthful bestseller . Here, in fact, a writer who has always dazzled his readers with the reflecting mirrors of double- and triple-bluff, surpasses himself with the backstory to his career-defining masterpiece about a covert operation conducted against the East German Stasi.Leamas, it turns out, had a son with an East German woman. This young man, Christoph, burns with vengeful rage towards the betrayals of the forgotten ※Circus§. He threatens to expose the British secret service in parliament and the courts. With no Smiley about 每 where is he now? 每 the spooks must put the squeeze on Peter Guillam for the truth about Operation?Windfall.The silky interrogations of a man named ※Bunny§ take us into a labyrinth of ruse and counter-ruse peopled by the dramatis personae of past plots. Sinister ghosts 每 Bill Haydon, Percy Alleline, Toby Esterhase, Jim Prideaux and Oliver Lacon 每 flit through the shadowy pages of lost time. Guillam visits old haunts, and resists his interrogators as best he can in a sequence of safe houses.Not much has changed in 50 years, except that the ※Circus§ is now ※the Box§, and the spooks operate out of ※Spyland Beside the Thames§. In place of action, Guillam must rifle through a lot of files, the documents in the case. This, perforce, is less thrilling than the dramatic quests of Smiley＊s prime. Then, in the midst of this expert exposition, Guillam snaps, suddenly confessing his ※outrage at having my past dug up and thrown in my face§.Here Cornwell and Le Carr谷 become one, because I think that this raw acknowledgement of frustration and bewilderment tellingly connects the inspiration for Le Carr谷＊s latest novel with some recent difficulties in Cornwell＊s own life story.Although he has sometimes teased that he was doing ※a sort of Tolkien job§ on his brief career as a spy, the truth is that Cornwell, a complex and romantic figure, has always mined his life for his art.His dismay at the troubled gestation of (2015) is well documented. A volume that was supposed to celebrate the creative interplay between Cornwell and Le Carr谷 did the exact opposite. Disappointment, frustration and outrage followed. A year ago, in , Le Carr谷 addressed a pointed rebuke to his biographer. Now, in more subtle terms, he has conducted a darker reckoning with the demons of the past. achieves many things. Outstandingly, it is a defiant assertion of creative vigour. There had been rumours of work abandoned, a professional crisis, but in these pages there is no faltering. Le Carr谷＊s storytelling remains close to top form. True, his characters speak, as they always did, in a mandarin lingo that＊s as remote from the register of everyday speech as Regency dialogue. Inevitably, for a great literary imagination steeped in a compelling fantasy, there are moments of self-parody. Not all the plotting is as flawless as hitherto. Christoph＊s two crucial interventions into Guillam＊s quest stretch the limits of credibility almost to breaking point. Smiley, his old boss, who was always depicted as angsty and middle-aged, is now a passionate Europhile, approaching his centenary. Another worry: do the treacheries of cold war espionage resonate as they used to do? In the scheme of things, however, these are quibbles. Le Carr谷＊s new novel displays a grand old man of English letters conducting a masterclass in the genre he has made his own. There will be some who want to revisit the hoary debate about the character and quality of Le Carr谷＊s genius. But he remains a great contemporary writer, whose work will always be read and reread.When, in the closing pages, we once more meet George Smiley, ※in red pullover and bright-yellow corduroys§, for Guillam＊s affecting farewell, the reader will recognise, perhaps, that Cornwell is signing off with a poignant and brilliant au revoir to Le Carr谷, his alter ego, a writer who is with the immortals. by John le Carr谷 is published by Viking (?20).

"t the end of this memoir, in the acknowledgments, Claire Tomalin thanks her husband, , for his patience in discussing ※doubts and problems§, and for encouraging her to keep going when ※I was close to giving up§. It is outside the province of the book to explore the doubts in detail or to explain why she almost ditched it. But as one reads, one speculates about the difference between writing biographies, as Tomalin has with questing brilliance 每 on Mary Wollstonecraft, Katherine Mansfield, Dora Jordan, Nelly Ternan, , Samuel Pepys,  每 and writing about herself. The book, absorbing, moving and marvellously written, will not let this question drop.Tomalin explains, in the foreword, that it has been a challenge moving between ※the trivial and the tragic§. Her aim is ※truthfulness§ and she adds the Chekhovian afterthought that life does not hold its breath for anyone: ※Even when you are at the worst moments and would like to give all your attention to grief, you still have to clean the house and pay the bills, you may even enjoy your lunch.§ She was moved to write the memoir partly to understand herself better, approaching herself like a biographical subject. She discovered she was not making ※individual choices§ but was typical of her time (she was born in 1933) and ※about as powerless to resist as a migrating bird or a salmon swimming upstream§.But to research yourself is a peculiar project. To what extent are you already an expert? You might want to resist the subjects a biographer would dwell on. You know and do not know yourself. You remember and forget. At times, she must have had to steel herself to write at all. Tragedy stands out in her story, as tragedy will. I remember an , in which she admitted that she had sometimes felt as though she were being pelted with bricks from above. In the memoir, she is more withheld.On the afternoon of Wednesday 17 October 1973, she heard that her husband, Nicholas Tomalin, a journalist on the , had been killed 每 a garbled rumour until the point that Harold Evans [the paper＊s editor] and journalists Ron Hall and Hunter Davies turned up at her house in north London＊s Gloucester Crescent: ※They were the messengers of death. Nick had been killed in Israel. I suppose they told me 每 a heat-guided missile from the Syrians hit the car he was driving in the Golan Heights.§ He was 41. Their marriage had been turbulent, but ※it felt now as though the sun had been eclipsed§. She writes with a decisive lack of self-pity. Her prose is clear, level, unheated. Nicholas＊s infidelity is lightly treated 每 not the same as making light. She has the unusual gift, in everything she writes, of never making a difficult subject more difficult.She undertakes not to dwell on her children. But she describes Daniel, born in 1960 severely handicapped, who did not survive, and Tom, born a decade later with spina bifida, who did. She is full of praise for Tom＊s fortitude. It is painfully ironic that it should be death that, lifting the ban on writing about her children, introduces the book＊s most vivid character: Susanna, her second daughter. A brilliant, life-enhancing girl, Susanna came back in 1980 from Oxford University, where she had been studying English, in a catastrophic depression. A first attempt at suicide was unsuccessful. A second attempt succeeded. Tomalin found her ※lying on the floor, her face calm§. There was a ※very small note on the floor near her, a few words saying she was sorry, but it would get worse§. It is painful to read Tomalin＊s conclusion: ＆I don＊t think there has been a day since her death when I have not thought of her, her blue eyes and her high spirits. I should have protected her, and I failed. The system failed too, badly and inexplicably...§She is hard on herself (almost always generous about others), believing she also failed her mother at the end of her life. Muriel Herbert was a pianist and composition scholar at the Royal College of Music. Her father, Emile Delavenay, was a French intellectual with perfect English, who joined the BBC in 1939. When their disastrous marriage unravelled, Tomalin moved to Welwyn Garden City with her mother and sister. She attended several schools but writes with particular enthusiasm about Dartington Hall in Devon and, later, about university 每 she read English at Newnham College, Cambridge. Her career as literary editor makes entertaining reading, starting at the  in the 70s and including an account of her affair with Martin Amis. Terry Kilmartin, then the ＊s literary editor, teasingly told her she was ※pretending to be the heroine of a French film§.I was interested in her years at the  in the 80s, partly because I was given my first stab at reviewing for her pages and remember her book-filled office and the formidable impression she made. She loved a literary argument. Once, when I＊d liked a book she hadn＊t, she kindly concluded 每 after hammer-and-tongs discussion 每 that positive reactions were more persuasive but without budging a jot. One of the surprises of the memoir was to discover how tentative she often felt about herself, although about the ＊ move to Wapping and the printers＊ strike, she has remained firm. She politely damns Murdoch and the  editor Andrew Neil. She and her deputy, Sean French, and others who refused to cross the Wapping picket line, were dubbed ※refuseniks§.Her resignation was liberation: she found her ※vocation§ as a biographer. Her mother used to say that, no matter how unhappy you were, you could escape into a book. She has spent a lifetime doing this 每 even in later, happier times 每 and in writing books into which we can gratefully disappear. In the memoir, one feels she is more at home writing about Hardy or Dickens than herself 每 the tug of the literary wins. There are reasons why she does not write about life with Michael Frayn, whom she married at 60. Falling in love with him was ※overwhelming§ but caused ※pain and difficulties for everyone§.

"Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger continue to add flair to workmanlike crime drama writing as a new two-part story begins. An author has gone missing and, it sluggishly transpires, has left behind a spiky roman a clef that gives everyone he knows reason to wish him ill. Tim McInnerny is among a roster of suspects taking their turn to look vaguely guilty; the two stars fare better when the investigation recedes and their mercurial mentor/sidekick vibe develops. Final instalment of Levison Wood＊s epic schlep along the Caucasus mountains, one of the world＊s more geographically and politically volatile realms. This episode covers the final 1,000 miles or so, from Georgia＊s border with Armenia to the Caspian shore of Iran, negotiating, among other obstacles, the sputtering battlefield of Nagorno-Karabakh. The scenery is magisterial; Wood＊s grasp of regional politics less so. The would-be astronauts are half way through their space auditions, so Commander Chris Hadfield takes them to Sweden to see how they cope in a crisis. Firstly, they are gradually deprived of oxygen and it＊s enlightening to see how some bottle it straight away, while others put themselves at risk. The contestants are a cut above the average: it＊s hard to imagine the goons from The Apprentice facing a G-force. This week in the den, we meet flip flop-wearing entrepreneurs Andy and Benno, two former city bankers who are hoping to get investment in their compact beach towel company, which is already turning over more than ?1m. So why do they need the Dragons? Then there are old pals and packaging business veterans Neville and Derek, who reckon they have an industry-revolutionising concept under their hats. But the Dragons soon burst their bubble. A sense of discontent is sweeping the nation and, as Queen, Victoria is determined to offer some assistance to her stricken subjects, much against the advice of both Albert and Peel. Her regal rescue plan involves putting on a majestic medieval ball at the palace, with wealthy attendees encouraged to wear costumes made from locally sourced silks. With the scheme hardly matching the dictionary definition of ※mucking in§, will it really win over an unhappy populace? As we reach its 16th anniversary, the events of 9/11 retain the power to shock. They also continue to challenge doc-makers to find fresh angles. This two-parter traces the decade leading up to the attacks: what emerges is an intricate web of retrospectively obvious warning signs. The contributory effects of US foreign policy are glossed over, but it＊s still a sobering tale of missed opportunities to avert catastrophe. Concludes tomorrow.In 1960, British motorcycle ace Surtees retired from the sport. It merely involved trading two-wheeled thrills for four, taking to a nascent Formula One and winning the world title just four years later. An engrossing story for petrolheads and pedestrians alike, this doc tells the story of the only person to win both motorcycle and F1 world championships, and in an era where tackling either was a life-threatening act. Vaughn＊s spy spoof stars a dapper Colin Firth as Harry Hart 每 the 007, as it were, of the Kingsmen. He＊s inducting young geezer Eggsy (Taron Egerton) in the ways of his secret crime-busting organisation, and of his gadget-packed brolly, while foiling the world-conquering plans of arch-nemesis Valentine (Samuel L Jackson). Before sliding away into an implausible conclusion, this is a grimly convincing slice of modern British life. Among an impressive cast is Tim Roth as a local solicitor and sweet dad of 11-year-old Skunk (Eloise Lawrence), Zana Marjanovic as his Polish au pair, who is in love with Skunk＊s teacher (Cillian Murphy), and Rory Kinnear as the grief-stricken Bob, struggling to raise three daughters. An unsettling, horribly funny Greek drama that＊s set in a gated house where a boy and two girls have been completely cut off from the world, their father controlling every aspect of their lives. When he kidnaps a young woman to provide for his son＊s sexual needs the walls begin to crumble on his hideous world. A macabre fable about society＊s urge to control the young. The eighth and final stage of the race, featuring a 180km race from Worcester to Cardiff. The final round from Crans-sur-Sierre in Switzerland.Coverage of the Premier League game at the Liberty Stadium.																																											"
"The Royal Opera＊s previous version of Puccini＊s enduring weepie held its place in the repertory for more than 40 years. That was a meticulously detailed affair that brought the whole world of 1840s Paris to the Covent Garden stage. Whatever surprises there are in the production directed by Richard Jones that＊s now replacing it, they are unlikely to include such levels of realism.In its 10 days of concerts scattered around East Lothian, the Lammermuir festival manages to pack in far more that is interesting and enterprising than the more glamorous Edinburgh festival can now muster. Highlights this year include recitals by pianist Steven Osborne and cellist  (21 September); chamber music with the Quatuor Mosa?ques (18-19 September) and the Gould Trio (23 September); early music from Tenebrae (23 September) and the Orlando Consort (18 September); plus new music from the  (22 September).The arrival of  has been hyped so much that it seems more like a coronation than simply a fresh start under a new music director. The first programme he conducts is also the start of a 10-day celebration of contemporary British music to herald his arrival. Rattle＊s opening programme includes Elgar＊s Enigma Variations plus works by Ad豕s, Knussen, Birtwistle and Helen Grime; the four composers will also curate programmes in the festival that?follows.

"Previously unknown objects and artworks from the personal collection of , which have remained with the artist＊s family, are to be sold at auction.The trove of objects includes artworks by Monet himself and his friends such as ?douard Manet, Auguste Rodin and Paul Signac; Japanese prints that he owned and that inspired him; and more personal items such as photographs, his spectacles and a garden pot.Adrien Meyer, co-chair of Christie＊s impressionist and modern art department, said it was a collection that had ※remained with the family of Claude Monet right until this day. It encapsulates the magic of the man, not only the artist but the collector he was.§The items were all owned by Monet＊s son Michel, who died in 1966, leaving almost everything to France＊s Acad谷mie des Beaux-Arts and its Marmottan Museum. But Michel also had a daughter he did not formally recognise 每 Rolande Verneiges. Evidently Michel gifted various items to Verneiges while he was alive and it is these items that have been rediscovered and are being sold.Verneiges died in 2008 and it was three years ago that Meyer was invited to the family home of her descendant to discover, tucked away in drawers and in cardboard boxes, the remarkable Monet trove. ※This is what we do our job for, to experience these unexpected encounters and stories,§ Meyer said.The collection includes paintings and drawings by Monet that, because they were owned by Michel, are known by the art world and are in the catalogue raisonn谷. Their whereabouts had previously been a mystery.They include an early example from Monet＊s series of views of poplar trees, most of which are in museums. Trois Arbres 角 Giverny (Peupliers) from 1887 is being sold with an estimate of $2m-$3m (?1.5m-?2.3m).At the other end of the price scale is a pair of Monet＊s spectacles ($1,000-$1,500) and a terracotta pot that can be spotted in several paintings such as , which is at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC. That has an estimate of $1,000-$2,000.Works by other artists are also in the collection, including a watercolour by Rodin of Salome. ※The expert on Rodin fell off her chair when she saw it,§ said Meyer. It has an estimate of $50,000-$80,000.Because the market for Monet is particularly strong in east Asia, Christie＊s is holding its 54-lot auction in Hong Kong on 26 November, available to view in London for a week from 30 September. It will also, for the first time, transmit live to its Paris saleroom where European buyers can bid.Meyer said Verneiges was ※a very modest and discreet woman§ and that it was an honour to offer the rediscovered pieces at auction for the first time.

"Amazon and Apple have emerged as contenders to take on the multibillion-dollar distribution rights for the  film franchise and could provide a new TV home for 007.The rights, valued at between $2bn and $5bn (?1.5bn-?3.8bn), according to Hollywood Reporter, are considered to be underexploited in a world where blockbuster global intellectual property is in high demand.Disney  in 2009 and the , the home of Star Wars and Indiana Jones, in 2012, while  the comic book company Millarworld,  and Kingsman.The joint James Bond rights holders MGM and Eon, the latter of which produces the films, have been on the hunt for a new distributor since  after  in 2015.The contract, which includes co-financing and distribution, is being pursued by the usual Hollywood suspects including 21st Century Fox, Universal, Sony and the frontrunner, Warner Bros.But the emergence of Apple and , which bought the US book rights to Ian Fleming＊s James Bond novels in 2012, suggests MGM and Eon are considering a wider deal.The TV rights are sold to broadcasters around the world, with Sky the first to get Bond movies in the UK, but an agreement with  or Amazon could change that, according to analysts.Richard Broughton of Ampere said: ※If Warner wins, it will be business as normal, they＊ll sell on to other players in each market. If Amazon or Apple take the deal, they may not then sell on TV rights, instead using them themselves globally.§David Hancock, a film analyst at IHS Markit, said: ※We know that Bond works in cinemas, but [with] the way people consume films and the way the market is moving, there is merit in MGM/Eon looking at distribution and potentially a wider deal in a different way.※The emergence of Apple and Amazon suggests that an online or digital element of the deal is being considered far more seriously than it was two, three or five years ago.§For the makers of Bond, which is based and filmed at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, theatrical releases remain the focus.

"here is a small white shack on the lawn in front of . It looks exactly like the very thing it is, namely the concrete cast of a chicken shed. The windows are blind and the door could never open to let the birds out, for the object is a solid block, heavy and impenetrable, unlike the airy structure it repeats. And yet it is still, first and last, a chicken shed.Or is it? The art of Rachel Whiteread turns things inside out. This piece 每 hailed as a major new work , though it＊s anything but, and the artist calls it ※shy§ 每 is a cast of the space inside the shed. There＊s a clue in the fact that the window frames are indented, instead of standing out. But so what? The object on the lawn 每 literal, stolid, untranslated 每 retains the form of the shed. It is a sculptural tautology.Whiteread (born 1963) has been casting these so-called ※negatives spaces§ for three decades. The original idea comes from the US artist Bruce Nauman, whose (1965-8) spells out the method, if not the varying effects. Whiteread has gone further, casting the innards of a hot-water bottle and a mattress; the undersides of a table, the space behind a fireplace or surrounding a bath. Her works run from the modest to the monumental 每 most famously the interior of  每 cast in plaster, resin, concrete or rubber, occasionally in metal (mundane) and lately in papier-mache (actively hideous). Everything she makes balances the possibility of poetry against the risk of banality.This is not necessarily intrinsic to the objects themselves. Take the beautiful piece that opens this enormous exhibition. Cast in plaster, from a hot-water bottle, this little thing lies on its back, vulnerable, pale and turning slightly, as if troubled in sleep. Whiteread made this sculpture in 1988, and it remains unsurpassed. One can say this because the artist has been casting hot water bottles ever since. There are nine more in this show 每 in clear resin, yellow wax, flesh-pink plaster, each differently swollen or flexed. Not one has the same potency or charge.It is the same with the mattresses. Some look precisely like mattresses; others appear less familiar; most are propped against the wall. But  is slightly slumped, as if exhausted, or trying its best to inhale and exhale in the midnight hours. There is, in short, a marvellous analogy between the original object, the sculptural form and the title. And all the nuances of solitude and anxiety are carried without any resort to the anthropomorphic.There is a spellbinding quietude to these early works. People still go on tiptoe to look into the kitchen sink, as if there might something stirring there.  每 the cast of a wardrobe covered in black felt 每 still makes the childhood fear of such interior darkness both visible and solid. , her cast of a grate and the space behind it, goes to the quick of one＊s curiosity about the secret world behind the fireplace. And the towering white plaster, from 2001, zooms up and down to nowhere, with overtones of Piranesi and Escher, like the flights of steps in trapped dreams.That whiteness has become Whiteread＊s own trademark somewhat. It diverts attention from the original object, emphasising the status of these works as sculptures. A cardboard box, a bath, a sink 每 cast in white plaster or concrete, all lose their individuality to become universal forms, and perhaps even quasi-abstract. There is a work here called  and its provenance is completely unclear. It looks far more like a work of American minimalism than any kind of household object.Whiteread＊s debt to America is everywhere obvious, especially to Bruce Nauman, Donald Judd and Carl Andre,  have their echoes in her many casts of floors 每 floors that precisely resemble floors. And here is an obvious division in her work. Some casts produce recognisable facsimiles; the space around a bath, when cast, produces another bath. But the one hundred casts of spaces beneath assorted chairs, made in glowing coloured resins, translucent as Pears soap, do not evoke chairs. Some look like tiny telephone boxes, others like miniature cenotaphs or tower blocks. Stretching away into the distance, they suggest a whole metropolis of small buildings. The emphasis is architectural rather than human.That can feel obdurate, and even chilling, especially in the largest works. In 2003, Whiteread cast the interior space of Room 101 at the BBC＊s Broadcasting House, supposedly the inspiration for the torture chamber in George Orwell＊s . The colossal white block, with no point of entry or exit, is a properly ominous presence in this show. But then a nearby collection of cardboard boxes yields nothing more interesting than a dozen white blocks, ribbed with corrugations if you care to look closely for the purposes of identification; the arrangement feels arbitrary, the concept (whatever it might have been) is lost.The interior walls have been removed at Tate Britain to create a single gallery the size of an aircraft hangar. This means that every work has exactly the same context. Without natural lighting, some of the transparent doors lose their lovely volatility. Without smaller spaces, some of the more modest pieces struggle to speak. Shown all together, what＊s more, Whiteread＊s work starts to look almost obsessively neat and over-determined, nothing whatsoever left to chance.Which may simply be the nature of her modus operandi, of course. Cast the inside of a box and you get a cube that looks just like a box; cast the inside of a can and you get a cylinder. Geometric forms inevitably predominate. But when she presents loo rolls in tidy lines, or coke cans on shelves, or wallpaper rolls on chairs, they appear both trivial and wilfully domestic.Whiteread works in series, as this show makes clear. Replication can border on repetition; facsimile, no matter in what medium, colour, configuration or scale, doesn＊t always lead to transformation. But when these elements are in perfect alignment, she is a poet of the past. This was the case with in 1993, that pale ghost of a building commemorating the lives of its lost East End inhabitants; in the translucent high up in the SoHo skyline, that became a monument to New York＊s vanishing history; and in the celebrated  (2000), a library turned inside out, in the centre of Vienna＊s Judenplatz.In this show, curiously, the strongest building is the smallest: a cast of a doll＊s house made out of glass. It is a wonderful sight, ghostly and gleaming, like a miniature palace of ice. And as if fulfilling some childhood fantasy, you can see right through the walls into every room, even when the doors are closed 每 looking down translucent corridors into all these shining chambers of the mind.

But there has also been , starring Arnold Schwarzenegger (and its 2012 remake);  (2002), with Tom Cruise; the Richard Linklater ※rotoscoped§ version of , which overlayed animation on live-action footage of Keanu Reeves; and 2011＊s .PKD, as he＊s usually known, most recently came to prominence thanks to the Amazon TV series based on his 1962 alternative history novel , which posited an America controlled by the Nazis on the east coast and the Japanese on the west after the second world war., the 10-part Channel 4 series, features adaptations of PKD＊s short stories, each with a different screenwriter. The contemporary appeal is obvious. His stories often deal with themes of corporate greed, authoritarian control, artificial intelligence, drugs and how technology can be used to both elevate and subdue individuals and populations.Charlie Brooker＊s phenomenally successful series  owes a big debt to PKD and his dystopian visions. Indeed, life seems to become more and more like a PKD story; in the days before  is aired we＊ve had shrill news stories about sex robots that could be hacked to carry out murder, and the unveiling of a new iPhone that unlocks itself through . Increasingly it feels as if this is PKD＊s world, and we just live in it.Two complaints often arise in any conversation about the author, though. One, he was awful at titles 每 at least, marquee-friendly titles.  (an aside; the forthcoming film , while not based directly on a PKD work, is eagerly awaited for continuing the story of Deckard, played in the original by Harrison Ford) was called in its novel form ;  was ; and the 1995  was based on a short story called ※Second Variety§, while  had only just a slight tweak from the original title of .The other point is more contentious: that PKD actually wasn＊t a very good writer. There will be protests from the self-confessed Dickheads who adore him and, personally, I think the criticism is a little unfair. There＊s a sparseness to his prose, for sure, and some of his dialogue is clunky and awkward. He certainly doesn＊t have the narrative flair of contemporaries such as . But what PKD had, and what Hollywood has known for decades and TV is switching on to now, was ideas.We＊re often more forgiving of beautiful literary prose with little substance, or that rehashes old ideas in a fresh way, than we are of writers who turn out new concepts but perhaps in a less stylish manner. PKD was a high-concept writer, and sometimes it feels as though ideas were bursting out of his mind at such a pace that he didn＊t have time for the intricacies of wordplay.His UK publisher Gollancz has republished the  stories in an anthology with introductions by the writers who have brought them to TV. What stands out in almost all cases is that they＊ve taken PKD＊s central idea and built a narrative around it. This is typical: , , ＃ they all have at their heart the original concept from the source material, but PKD adaptations that slavishly follow the text are rare.  has already stretched to two seasons, far outstripping the original book.Ronald D Moore, the writer behind the  reboot, has adapted PKD＊s ※Exhibit Piece§ (retitled ※Real Life§) for , and he says: ※Very little remains of this story in the show, but the heart, and perhaps more importantly the brains behind the episode originate in this tale.§Should we think any less of Dick for this? Is writing just words assembled in a pretty order, or is it ideas and concepts and things that no one has ever thought of before? The answer, of course, is that the best writing is both.																																											"

"t＊s Monday morning and a new week at the BBC＊s new Broadcasting House headquarters somewhere in central London, as head of values Ian Fletcher arrives in order to begin it.§ So says narrator David Tennant, in a new series of the BBC＊s self-parody  (BBC2), in order to begin it.It is not just Fletcher (Hugh Bonneville) arriving, but also director of?strategic governance Simon Harwood (Jason Watkins) and dim intern Will (Hugh Skinner), all on their foldy bicycles 每 a?trident of mediocrity, a three-pronged, six-wheeled attack on the week ahead. By 9am, Ian, as someone whose job it is to steer the corporation confidently towards whatever it is that is going to happen next, is chairing a meeting of The?Way Ahead Group. The focus is on the More of Less Initiative (※The fact is this is about identifying what we do best?and finding more ways of doing less of it?better,§ explains Sarah Parish＊s head of output Anna Rampton, helpfully). And with the royal charter up for renewal, the group is to be renamed The Renewal Group. The Way Ahead is behind. Brilliant, hurrah, joyous, yes, exactly, say the assembled members, watched over by a giant, smiling photograph of Mary Berry.There is also change over at PR consultancy Perfect Curve, which is now called Fun, having been taken over?by Dutch media giant Fun Media. Fun 每 which is, fun 每 comes complete with comedy bearded Dutch chairman and silent disco enthusiast Jens Smit. He is fun to his bone marrow. Happily, Siobhan Sharpe has been retained as joint CEO 每 happily, because she (Jessica Hynes) is?still the best thing about W1A, stealing every scene she crashes into.Back at the beeb, the newly renamed Renewal group is tackling discrimination head on. After discussing the case of a former footballer, who claims he is being overlooked as a Match of the Day pundit because he is a cross-dresser, they turn their attention to the gender pay gap within the corporation itself, and the attention it has been getting.Producer Lucy Freeman (Nina Sosanya) suggests that it might be fun (yay!) if they all write their own salaries on Post-it notes and stick them to their foreheads. Ian Fletcher starts to say that that might not necessarily be the best way to approach the issue, going forward, but before he has bumbled it out everyone else has said brilliant, yes exactly, hallelujah. And next thing you know, Ian＊s sheepishly sporting a Post-it note with 每 in quite small writing but readable when the camera zooms in 每 ?245,000 written on it. Meanwhile, senior communications officer Tracey Pritchard (Monica Dolan) has written ※minimum wage, zero hours contract§. And she has also done all the O＊s with a cross underneath, so they have become female signs.At which point,  director general, Tony Hall, finally making a W1A cameo, bursts into the room to announce that he has launched at least three different enquiries into how this sorry state of affairs has come about. And that, in the meantime, everyone 每 male, female, the gender fluid, Ryan the cross-dressing former footballer, even Will the intern 每 will have their salaries bumped up to the figure he＊s wearing on his own forehead: ?450,000. And that, as a result, for budgetary reasons, the creation of all original content will be immediately cancelled. Going forward, the corporation will be solely an online platform for UGC (user-generated content), called BBCme, not wholly unlike YouTube ＃You＊ll know, if you actually saw it, that most of the previous three paragraphs are 每 to borrow a word from?the  每 bollocks. I am making a point about W1A, though, in?a?really fun way, yay! [Puts on headphones, has little shuffle]I＊m saying it might be pitch perfect in its depiction of levels of nodding nonsense and corporate guff. And beautifully performed (Rufus Jones＊s entertainment format producer David Wilkes needs a shoutout). It is very funny at times; and lovely that Auntie can do this, look in the mirror and have a little chuckle at herself. But it is just that 每 a chuckle, a playful slap on the arse (possible tribunal had it not been self-administered) rather than a proper kicking in the genitals, where anyone else making a mockumentary send-up of the BBC would go straight for.Yes I know this was all done before the pay storm hit, so it couldn＊t be in there. And of course they＊re not going to give themselves a proper kicking. So it does all come over as a teeny bit smug and self-serving. The fact that BBC grandees and stars 每 Lineker and Shearer () 每 are queuing up to?take part doesn＊t help.Obviously the next episode will mainly be about the gender pay gap scandal. And I will look like an idiot.?So?that＊s all good then.																																											"
"n the run up to the Emmys, consensus seemed to be that Westworld would sweep the board, which I took as read with a sour kvetchiness, like indigestion of the soul. The Handmaid＊s Tale and Westworld are not dissimilar in the broadest ways: dystopian tales of a credible near-future, wrecked by carelessness and male delusions. Westworld even has a little feminist tang, in the shape of some spunky female robots (we can debate robot gendering some other time). But The Handmaid＊s Tale is in such a different league: so beautiful to watch that the end of each episode brought a peculiar, near-physical, pain at having to return to the unchoreographed hubbubs and humdrum colours of the regular world. It was so chilling in its plausibility, spoke so forcefully to the night terrors of today＊s politics, that there ought to be an Emmy for fortune-telling; for the commissioner who guesses most closely what our anxieties will be, two years＊ hence. had already, by Mad Men, I think, entered that space that is rare for a male actor and almost unheard of for a female one, where you stop thinking about or even noticing what she looks like, as you dive into her face. And yet the confidence of this drama, the amount of sheer emotional toil they left to her eyes, and the way she met that challenge, so graceful and alive ＃ it was peerless. The woman is simply incredible. As is the director, of the pilot among other episodes, Reed Morano. Jake Polonsky, cinematographer on Billions, remarked of Morano: ※She＊s an extremely talented film-maker. She shot our season two opener on Billions and brought a great energy and eye to the episode. Coming from a background of cinematography, she has both technical ability and the on-set experience to be a great director.§ I guess you would expect a cinematographer to appreciate a cinematography background in a director, but the visual coherence, the sumptuousness, the way that every shot looked like a Vermeer, did put The Handmaid＊s Tale in a league of its own.Margaret Atwood always said of her book that , as such, since the oppression was more pyramid-shaped, ※with the powerful of both sexes at the apex, the men generally outranking the women at the same level; then descending levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom§. On a related but separate note, the TV series is not feminist: to consider it a type of hell, when one caste of people is routinely mutilated and treated as a ※womb on two legs§, is not exactly a radical bid for equality. And yet the sheer dynamic of it, the intensity of Moss＊s performance, the complexity of Aunt Lydia＊s character, the primacy of female friendship, female solidarity, compassion between women and the abhorrent chill of its absence ＃ God, let＊s be even plainer: the fact that this drama was about women, with men mainly in the supporting role of the faceless oppressor, forced the acknowledgment of how rare that is. There＊s an all-female comic tradition (from Golden Girls, through Sex and the City to Girls), but in drama, not so much; the tacit uncertainty being, women＊s interior lives are all very well, but can they really carry a whole hour?If The Handmaid＊s Tale hadn＊t won all that it did on Sunday, it would have been a travesty, an injustice against Moss, against Morano, against Ann Dowd (who played Aunt Lydia), against everyone else involved in it, against , oh, and against all women, regardless of whether or not they watched it. But then it did win 每 outstanding lead actress, outstanding directing (for Morano＊s pilot episode), outstanding drama series, outstanding supporting actress (for Dowd), outstanding writing (for Bruce Miller), outstanding production design, outstanding cinematography (for Colin Wilkinson) and outstanding guest actress, for Alexis Bledel＊s haunting performance as Ofglen, whose act of violent defiance unspooled her delicate face in a shot that will live on in the assorted nightmares of all who watched it. It won a lot. It couldn＊t have won much more. So that＊s OK then.Nick Lee, the acquired series manager at Channel 4, describes how they lucked out with a show that was so politically relevant. ※We acquired the show earlier this year, so were aware of the particular resonance of themes in the show. Whether the original commissioners at Hulu had read those tea leaves or not, the drama is so compelling and the story so powerful that even without the parallels it would still be a standout drama.§ Whatever mix of instinct and serendipity produced such a vivid dystopia for such a vividly dystopian time, the shock and originality of that nowness can＊t be repeated. But the Handmaid＊s Tale has done something exciting for drama as a whole, in making that whole dark-future genre commercially viable. Arguably, given The Hunger Games and Maze Runner, dystopia was already a thing; previously, though, it was a teen-thing, and the Atwood-Moss-Morano axis has made it an adult＊s thing. We can now presumably look forward to TV adaptations of  (niche 1920s Russian dystopia by Yevgeny Zamyatin, lots of marching and buildings made of glass for a long-pre-Facebook surveillance fantasy), the  (niche British post-nuclear fantasy, telepathy, patriarchy and birth defects, not dissimilar to The Handmaid＊s Tale, by John Wyndham) and anything by John Christopher (niche 50s and 60s British dystopian, whose canon is one manmade disaster after another, after which society immediately descends into rape and pillage, mainly rape).And The Handmaid＊s Tale has done something invaluable for Hulu, which started life as an S-VOD (a subscription video-on-demand service), jointly backed by Disney, 21st Century Fox and Time Warner. Like Netflix, it diversified into making its own content (which is where the money is made), and, like Netflix, made some low- to zero-impact shows before producing something outstanding. Lee points out that this isn＊t unusual. ※AMC＊s launch of Mad Men 10 years ago proved that new entrants can always be the source of big hits.§ A TV exec who wishes to remain anonymous (being in the middle of a delicate deal), explains: ※The fact that it was a book made it an easier sell, because the book is a brand. It＊s much easier to say, ＆We＊re doing The Handmaid＊s Tale＊ than ＆We＊ve got this show about women who are subjugated and get their eyes put out.＊§ If Hulu were previously seen as arrivistes, ※they are massive players now. All you need is one show, and then suddenly, that＊s it. It＊s like Netflix and House of Cards, the brand of a successful drama is just gold dust.§Season one＊s ending didn＊t diverge from Atwood＊s book so much as leave out a bit of crucial detail to set up season two, which is already under way. It is a perilous business, taking a book farther than its author did, as we can see from the last season of Game of Thrones, all dragons and not enough sex being the headline complaint, the more sophisticated rendition of which is that the show never managed to breathe the original author＊s life into the characters, and it became plot-driven and head-spinning, like a whistle-stop tour of military planning. Whether or not The Handmaid＊s Tale: the Sequel suffers the same fate, nobody can know; it＊s a risk I＊m prepared to take. The end of season one felt like losing a limb.																																											"
"ina McKee plays , the rebellious queen of the Iceni, in Tristan Bernays＊s new play about Roman subjugation and she is predictably good. The real surprise is finding a play that, for all its mixed messages for the Brexit age and odd blend of pastiche Shakespeare and four-letter excess, holds the stage with confidence. I enjoyed it infinitely more than all the rough Shakespeares seen at the Globe this summer. The setting is AD61 and Bernays expands on the few facts about Boudica 每 or Boadicea, as she is still known on a triumphalist statue on Westminster Bridge. We see her being deprived of her rightful kingdom, in modern East Anglia, after the death of her husband, whose wealth the Romans appropriate. Boudica is publicly flogged and her two daughters are raped. In alliance with other local kings 每 including Cunobeline, who actually died 20 years before the play starts 每 Boudica leads an uprising against the Romans and, after early military triumphs, is crushingly defeated. Over the centuries, Boudica has been a handy symbol for everyone from Victorian imperialists to the suffragettes. But what are we to make of her today? At first, I feared that Bernays might be providing solace to ardent leave backers who have dubbed Theresa May . The Romans are seen as cruel power-grabbers gobbling up native resources, and the locals celebrate military victory with a rock anthem proclaiming: ※We will cut the bastards down, we will win back this land.§ But just as you start to fear the play might be entering Farage territory, Bernays shows one of Boudica＊s daughters, Alonna, arguing for peace, befriending a first-generation Roman and routing her sister who talks of immigrants as ※a tide of filth§. So, by implication, it becomes a remain play after all. Bernays drives the story forward with great skill, and there are constant nods to Shakespeare: the language frequently slips into iambic pentameters, a Roman soldier has his tongue cut out like Lavinia in  and Boudica exactly echoes Cleopatra when she says, of a rival, ※he words me§. It just seems odd that the Iceni queen at other times comes out with lines such as ※Shut your mouth, you stinking piece of shit§, and that Bernays loads the dice by making the Roman centurions, while decrying Britannia＊s barbarians, talk like a bunch of lager louts., however, holds the play together. She doesn＊t roar or shout or adopt heroic poses. Instead she has the imposing stillness that betokens real authority, makes excellent use of her native north-eastern vowels and plays Boudica not as a nationalist icon but as an aggrieved woman seeking justice, and as a mother passionately concerned for her children. It＊s a performance far removed from breastplated Last Night of the Proms camp. Eleanor Rhode directs with an assurance that should make her a permanent fixture at the Globe, ＊s timbered set disintegrates to good effect and Jules Maxwell＊s music has a strong, percussive beat. Joan Iyiola and Natalie Simpson as Boudica＊s warring daughters, Abraham Popoola as a bombastic Belgic king and Forbes Masson as the anachronistic Cunobeline (Shakespeare＊s Cymbeline) lend firm support, while the play, which had looked as if it might become patriotic propaganda, ends by sensibly warning us of the danger of splenetic isolation.

"erched at the edge of Shanghai＊s Kaixuan Road, between Tianshan Park＊s leafy calm and the imposing weight of the elevated West Yan＊an Road metro station, sits Yuyintang Livehouse, a mainstay of the city＊s underground music scene. Signposted by the electric glow of a polar bear holding a guitar, this indie music destination 每 in a city short on such venues 每 recently hosted the fourth East Asia Shoegaze festival. Organised by Lulu, guitarist of the Shanghai shoegaze quartet Forsaken Autumn, and Japan-based Luuv Label, this year＊s lineup featured an eclectic range of new and known bands from the region, including rising stars , Japanese shoegaze royalty Cruyff in the Bedroom and the diffuse Taiwanese dream-pop outfit . Despite the genre＊s decline over two decades ago, shoegaze 每 a style of noisy, beautifully hazy psychedelic rock 每 never truly disappeared. Now it is back in the spotlight due to the re-emergence of genre figureheads . With the Reading five-piece sitting alongside such seminal bands as My Bloody Valentine, Chapterhouse, Swervedriver and Ride atop its family tree, the genre continues to influence musicians across the globe, often taking root in the unlikeliest of places. From Tokyo and Taipei to Shanghai and Xiamen, lush hooks, half-whispered lyrics, melodic noise and warrens of effects pedals come together as a quintessentially western musical style cross-pollinates with Asian aesthetics to form a striking hybrid.Chinese shoegazers RUBUR were quick to stamp their own cultural background onto the genre. Along with the carefree noise-pop of the White Tulips (from Xiamen) and the silky electro-glitch effects of Goodbye Honey Boy (Beijing), their art school aesthetics are helping to define shoegaze in their home country.※Honestly, I am rarely influenced by western shoegaze,§ says RUBUR＊s drummer, Salajane. ※I learn about it through various kinds of western, Japanese and Chinese bands, which have shoegaze elements.§ He says he finds a sense of identity in the genre＊s sound 每 ※an introvert＊s mode of expression§.At first glance, shoegaze and Chinese culture might seem unexpected bedfellows, but as another RUBUR member, Maojia, explains: ※In ancient Chinese love stories, lovers wouldn＊t say ＆I love you＊ to each other. For us, the harsh noise and wispy voices of shoegaze music is the language we use to communicate sentimental things.§ (The band incorporates dialogue from the Chinese film , a seminal romantic drama,on one of their tracks.) For Japanese band ＊s singer and guitarist Takaharu Sasaoka, the musically promiscuous approach of Tokyo band  offered a compelling local example of shoegaze and post-rock musicians who were willing to experiment with other genres. For Sasaoka, shoegaze elicits an immersive euphoria: ※A sense of the extraordinary combined with the isolation of being alone in a crowd§. Since their formation in Shimokitazawa in 1998, veterans Cruyff in the Bedroom have been a mainstay on the Japanese shoegaze scene. For them and innumerable others,  was a gateway to the addictive joys of reverse reverb and the whammy bar. Their music reached western record companies, and these connections were strengthened by the internet, ※especially through MySpace 每 the internet expanded our world,§ says vocalist Hata Yusuke. The band remains captivated by the genre＊s ※ambiguous and beautiful sound§ with its ※feedback noise and sensitive melodies§. Paradoxically, the genre＊s inward-looking emphasis has endowed it with a global outlook. Vocalist Uray of Taipei＊s U.TA cites Cocteau Twins and early 4AD as formative influences, but for her, shoegaze represents music without borders. Their approach to music is also deeply informed by the aesthetics of Hong Kong cinema, particularly the films of : ※We transform all of that beauty and stylistic decadence into beats, sounds, melodies, and lyrics.§Such openness to influences and experiences is evident when listening to U.TA＊s mixture of post-rock, psychedelia and punk. As with kindred Taiwanese rockers , the results 每 as geographic and stylistic differences dissolve 每 are mesmeric.Events like the East Asia Shoegaze festival further bolster the scene via the weird familiarity of strangers with shared interests. Between sets, audience and band members spill on to the narrow slice of pavement outside Yuyintang, careful to avoid the electric buses and bikes weaving their way through the humid Shanghai night. As each band takes the stage, their guitars slowly wash away the din of the street, tinting the evening with a euphoric wistfulness.																																											"
"ever let it be said that a good pun doesn＊t get you places. New ITV2 reality show Bromans has already made  around the world thanks to the . Now, the first episode of Bromans is upon us. Its premise is simple 每 some lunk-headed TOWIE-types play-act as Romans for prizes 每 but can it stand up to the strength of its name?ITV2 is desperately selling Bromans as the new Love Island, though you suspect that＊s only because  was very popular very recently. Although the casts share some similarities 每 when you first meet them, roaring and gurning and kissing their own biceps, your immediate reaction is ※It was nice knowing you, humanity§ 每 the elaborate setup puts Bromans squarely in the lineage of other under-appreciated high-concept reality shows like Tool Academy,  and .This is no bad thing. Those shows are all straight-down-the-line reality pieces elevated beyond measure by their total commitment to a ridiculous premise, and so it goes for Bromans. It contains absolutely nothing you haven＊t seen before, but its true selling point is the juxtaposition between contestant and premise.Fortunately, in this sense, Bromans doesn＊t disappoint. Somehow, it has managed to source some of the bro-iest knuckleheads ever assembled on television (it＊s honestly like ITV2 has genetically engineered an endless succession of Joey Essex clones) and let them loose in a world they don＊t understand. One of them 每 already my favourite 每 marvels at the setup by exclaiming ※I＊ve gone 2,000 years back. I＊ve never gone that far back before§. A few seconds later he sees a statue. ※How the fuck did they carve that?§ he yelps with a dumbstruck infant awe. You can understand his astonishment. Not to use a 10-pound term on a 50p show, but Bromans is a masterpiece of mise-en-scene. To all intents and purposes, it is set in ancient Rome; a slightly wobbly Up Pompeii ancient Rome admittedly, but ancient Rome nonetheless. It takes place within a sprawling set made up of pillars, street merchants and a mighty colosseum. There is also a crappy nightclub with a neon sign, but let＊s gloss over that.The Bromans＊ guide through this new world is Dominus 每 played by actor Tom Bell, soon to be seen in the Benedict Cumberbatch period drama The Current War 每 who puts in such a pitch-perfect Richard O＊Brien impression that you end up wishing he＊d hosted the Crystal Maze revival. Their trainer is Doctore, a screaming sergeant major played by David McIntosh 每 : ※Kelly Brook＊s love rat ex David McIntosh admits: ＆I can＊t stop cheating on women＊§ 每 who exists partly to serve as the Bromans＊ jumped-up Crossfit instructor, and partly to inspire wild lust in their girlfriends.There are tasks, obviously. On the strength of the opening episode, they mainly involve stripping the Bromans naked, making them carry heavy things around and goading their girlfriends into having physical confrontations with each other. However, a future episode promises to force the Bromans to make casts of their genitals, so there＊s that too. One couple is eliminated each week, voted off by their fellow competitors. Hopefully this will sow the seeds of resentment, and subsequent episodes will be a little nastier.At heart, though 每 and this is the one thing that might push Bromans beyond the realms of its own gimmick 每 this is ultimately a series about couples under pressure. The tasks are all self-consciously stupid, but they all serve as forms of relationship stress-tests. And the fact that these people have signed up for it is entirely to their credit. My pervading thought while watching Bromans was ※You wouldn＊t catch me dead on this§. That＊s partly because I possess a rudimentary level of dignity, but also because I don＊t want to examine the flaws of my relationship in public while wearing a toga. I get the sense that not every Broman couple will make it out of the show intact; and this, for my sins, is why I＊ll keep watching.																																											"
"Shakespeare compared breasts to globes in The Rape of Lucrece, and used a globe in the punchline of a fat joke in The Comedy of Errors. The Pop-Up Globe that＊s appeared in the grounds of Melbourne＊s Myer Music Bowl serves a kinder purpose, if one no less Shakespearean. It will be staging four of Shakespeare＊s plays and a contemporary work with a Shakespearean theme over the course of a repertory season that opens on 21 September and runs until 12 November.The Globe, of course, was Shakespeare＊s own famous London playhouse. Built in 1599, it was destroyed by fire in 1613, resurrected in 1614, and ※closed by (the) ordinance§ of the dastardly Puritans in 1642. By 1645, the history＊s dullest religious zealots had had the vocational home of Britain＊s greatest theatremaker razed to the ground to make way for tenement buildings. But one should never underestimate the patience of British vengeance; in 1997, a replica Globe was erected in London not too far from the original site and has served as a working theatre ever since. Melbourne＊s present pop-up owes its existence not to this theatre, so much as it does the depiction of the same in a picture book for children. According to Miles Gregory, the artistic director and instigator of the Pop-Up Globe, the idea came to him while reading to his three-year old daughter. ※The Globe popped up and she said, ＆Daddy, can we go there?＊§. As they were living in Auckland, New Zealand, at the time, his initial answer was no. But Gregory had spent his ※whole life fascinated by Elizabethan amphitheatres§, and had a collection of degrees in Shakespearean scholarship obtained from universities in Britain, so inspiration soon took hold. Using extant sketches of the second Globe made in the 1630s, Gregory sought to replicate not the replica, but the authentic experience of up close, stripped back Elizabethan theatre from the second Globe＊s design.※The project was big and exciting and seemingly impossible,§ he says ... and it was completed in 15 months, just in time to coincide with Shakespeare＊s 400th birthday celebrations in February 2016. He capitalised on the project by mortgaging his house, and with the support of a friend he＊d known since he was four.As a gamble, it＊s paid off 每 the Pop-up Globe has completed two seasons in New Zealand, and already sold 40,000 tickets for its first repertory rotations in . Three companies with a total personnel of 90 travel with the show, as does its wardrobe of 500 bespoke costumes. The size is warranted for the programme; no less than 14 individual shows are staged every week of its season. It＊s a relentless schedule replicated in the physical construction of the theatre itself; the whole Pop-up is assembled over just six weeks, and packed down in less than three.Those expecting the smell of the greasepaint and roar of the crowd to emanate from galleries of tiles and timber should be prepared. ※This is not a lime and hair museum,§ Gregory says. While the audience pit before the stage still demands its patrons stand, and the roof is every bit as open to the rain, the structure swaps the tiles of the original for corrugated iron and timber stalls for metal scaffolds 每 ※honest material§, according to Gregory, and always sourced locally. Gregory＊s own delight is in the strength of illusion conjured on his pared-down stage, its power over the audience. ※They come to see the building,§ he smiles, ※but they come back ＃ for the performances.§ Repeat viewings are affordable. Those wishing to experience Henry V, As You Like It, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello or Around The Globe in 60 Minutes can do so for standing tickets starting at $20.33. The fancy option of a somewhat royal-like private box is available from $150 with refreshments included. As previews begin this week, Melbourne, be aware: 																																											"
"Writer-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano had a hit in 2011 with their odd-couple heartwarmer Untouchable, starring Fran?ois Cluzet as the quadriplegic wheelchair-user who hires Omar Sy as his nurse. (The Hollywood remake of it, .) Now they are back with something machine-tooled to be an undemanding feelgood comedy. It stars the always formidable and dyspeptic Jean-Pierre Bacri as Max, the chief of a hospitality company in Paris that provides food, booze, music and service for super-classy parties of all sorts. He is just about tolerant of all the idiots and assholes that he employs, and indeed the idiots and assholes who form his customer base; his patience is tested to destruction when he takes on a massive job, a huge wedding reception party at an 18th-century chateau. It ends in farcical chaos, and his team seem determined on making his life as much of a nightmare as possible.The movie canters gamely along to the finish, and the ensemble players certainly work together with efficiency, but there is a note of silliness and basic-level unbelievability to almost everything that happens which undermines the comedy: the script isn＊t quite good enough to function as an alibi for its scene-by-scene implausibility, and the action isn＊t sufficiently credible to excuse the lack of really sharp gags. And for me, Bacri gets off to an odd, unsympathetic start when he yells at an impoverished young couple who are trying to reduce the cost of a fancy bash they have booked in an expensive  within sight of the Eiffel Tower. Are they supposed to be contemptible fools for worrying about money? Is he right to jeer at them? Where is the gag that could have answered these questions?Max shows up to supervise preparations for the big nuptial event at the country house to find everything in uproar. His co-director Josiane, played by Suzanne Cl谷ment (the ferocious mother in ), is having an affair with Max but mad at him for not committing; his mercurial manager Adele (Eye Haidara) is always screaming at the lounge singer they have hired: James (Gilles Lelouche). The photographer Guy (Jean-Paul Rouve) is a lazy complacent nincompoop who won＊t let guests take photos alongside him with their smartphones. The smug groom Pierre (Benjamin Lavernhe) isn＊t happy with anything and his bride Helena (Judith Chemla) is still carrying a torch for her gloomy ex, who is now temporarily employed as a waiter at this very same wedding. And it is Max＊s job to put out the brush-fires of hysterical incompetence that these people create. His maxim is: ※We adapt＃§There are one or two nice moments: I liked the running gag about Adele announcing deadpan that there is an outrageously nightmarish problem, waiting for Bacri to goggle at the horror of it all 每 and then reveal that she＊s kidding: ※Your face!§ It＊s the kind of setup which would work better as comfort-food television on a Sunday night, with more of a chance to invest in these dopey characters.

"It＊s known for its low-cut swimsuits, lavish ballgowns and shimmering tiaras, but on Sunday, Miss America＊s 91st pageant took a distinctly political turn.As the final five contestants 每 three representing states that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump in 2016 每 lined up to receive their last questions, some might have expected the answers to continue a tradition of bland,  replies.Instead, each contestant took it in turns to criticize Trump, the former owner of the rival Miss Universe pageant, on an array of topics including climate change, Russian interference in the 2016 election, and white supremacist rallies.※The justice system should do their due diligence and they should be punished accordingly,§ said Miss Missouri, when asked if the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia.※It＊s just a bad decision on behalf of the United States,§ said Miss North Dakota of Trump＊s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate accords. The representative from the Peace Garden state would go on to win the competition.Below are the questions and answers in full. There are multiple investigations into whether Trump＊s campaign colluded with Russia on the election. Well, did they? You＊re the jury. Guilty or innocent? And please explain your verdict.  Right now I＊d have to say innocent, because not enough information has been revealed. We are still investigating this and I think we should investigate it to its fullest extent, and if we do find the evidence that they have had collusion with then they should ＃ the justice system should do their due diligence and they should be punished accordingly.  Last month, a demonstration of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and the KKK in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent, and a counter-protester was killed. The president said there was shared blame with ※very fine people on both sides§. Were there? Tell me yes or no and explain.  I think that the white supremacist issue, it was very obvious that it was a terrorist attack and I think that President  should have made a statement earlier addressing the fact, and making sure all Americans feel safe in this country. That is the No 1 issue right now. One hundred and ninety-five countries signed the Paris agreement, in which each country sets non-binding goals to reduce manmade climate change. The US is withdrawing from the agreement, citing negligible environmental effects and negative economic impact. Good decision? Bad decision? Which is it and why?  I do believe it＊s a bad decision. Once we reject that, we take ourselves out of the negotiation table, and that＊s something that we really need to keep in mind. There is evidence that climate change is existing, so whether you believe it or not, we need to be at that table and I think it＊s just a bad decision on behalf of the United States. Thank you.  A recent poll found that over half of Americans favoured leaving confederate statues in place while others want them removed. Keep them or get rid of them? What＊s your vote and why?  I don＊t think the answer is to get rid of these statues, I think the answer is to relocate them into museums, because we are truly defined by our country＊s history and I don＊t think it＊s something that we need to forget. We need to always remember it and honour our history of America because it truly makes us who we are as Americans. But they should be moved to museums. Thank you.  Given the evidence that concussions from playing football can cause brain damage, would you support legislation that outlaws full contact football in elementary and high school? Yes or no? And why?  I do believe that I would. As someone who wants to go into the medical profession, I know how important it is to keep our kids safe so that they can have a quality education and when they＊re getting to high school and they＊re playing these sports, they＊re able to do so at the best of their ability; they＊re not limited because they chose to play football at a young age.

"t sounds just charming: a long look at all the feathered friends flitting around our back gardens. Yet the cosy material in Natural Selection, an exhibition by father and son duo Andy and Peter Holden, turns out to have more drama than Hitchcock＊s The , rife with dastardly tales of a criminal underworld, obsession and class conflict.The project, commissioned by public art powerhouse Artangel and sited within London＊s former Newington Library, takes as its jumping-off point A Natural History of Nest Building, a three-screen film essay presented by artist Andy and his ornithologist father Peter.Sporting a cravat, Peter has the measured tones of a man comfortable on camera: as ※the bird man§ on Blue Peter and co-presenter with Bill Oddie on Bird in the Nest, he introduced generations of children, including his son, to the wonders of birds. In a faded brown tie and jacket and nerd glasses that look back to his dad＊s heyday, Andy on the other hand is nervy, his delivery fast-paced and unpolished.What of the birds? The pair relate fascinating stories, from the cuckoo＊s parasitic tactics to birds that lay eggs straight on to cliff edges. Holden junior is particularly interested in how nest-building relates to art-making. Do birds create their intricate constructions because instinct tells them to drop moss on twigs, or do they have a vision of their home in mind, suggesting a higher consciousness? Consider the Australian bowerbird, unique in fashioning an inverted arch of sticks purely for displaying the objects it collects, like ※a set for a performance§. Andy has constructed a massive version of one in the gallery. Meanwhile, bird behaviours become pronounced metaphors for the creative process, like the osprey, whose nests resemble vast balls of tangled wool, sites they return to again and again and build up over the years. Andy＊s breakout 2010 work comes to mind, a knitted boulder that upscaled a chip of a pyramid he had ※stolen§ as a child, into an ingenious analogy for the comic distortions of memory and guilt.This is Andy＊s typical modus operandi: starting small with something from his own life, then exploding it outward into a twisty nest of ideas. Sophistication is balanced by self-exposure, embarrassment even. Natural Selection＊s inspiration he tells us, was a blackbird nest discovered when he moved back to live with his parents.The artist first started collaborating with his dad on bird-themed art performances in 2011. But, as diverting as these nest-building accounts are, it＊s in the library＊s low-lit basement 每 where another father and son, Richard and Henry Cuming, once stored their natural history collection 每 that the plot thickens. Here an eerie CGI-animated blackbird with Andy＊s voice relates the history of egg-collecting. Beginning with Victorian aristocrats hell-bent on cataloguing nature, through to the 21st century＊s outlaw nest robbers, it＊s a narrative peppered with police chases, undercover detectives and secret societies.Egg collectors aren＊t presented as monsters immune to the threat of avian extinction though. Rather they are self-styled experts, often clinging to the values of a past era. A backdrop of paintings romanticising the English landscape, from Eric Ravilious＊ chalk horse on a West Country hill to David Hockney＊s Technicolor take on Yorkshire, underlines how artists also impose their very human vision on to the natural world.Where things get really interesting 每 and risky 每 is in Andy＊s focus on a particularly thorny subject right now: class, specifically the white working class, apparently left behind by the globalised world and demonised as stuck on a vision of a Britain that never was. Today＊s criminal egg collectors are welders and decorators, living isolated existences with pictures of those original ※gentlemen scientists pinned to their walls§.Victorian hero Lord Rothschild 每 who founded the Natural History Museum, gifting it his egg collection 每 is represented in the two-screen video by a photo of his zebras pulling a carriage. On the other hand, the East Ender Matthew Gonshaw, whose collection landed him in prison in 2011, comes across as a tragic, sympathetic figure. ※I＊d like to find a female,§ he says, baring his lonely heart to a gang of news reporters. In an adjoining room, Andy has recreated a 2006 hoard of 7,130 eggs, found in Cleethorpes. The tiny speckled treasures are housed as they were discovered, not in display cases but old margarine tubs and chocolate boxes.The subject matter is quaint, but Andy uses rough edges 每 his awkward delivery, the iffy animation 每 to avoid what might be a rose-tinted Wes Anderson-ish dive into yesteryear＊s pursuits. What emerges, finally, is a reflection on the dangerous allure of nostalgia itself. There are a lot of layers to unpick. But, like the osprey＊s nest, it is a project that deserves repeat visits.   is at the former Newington Library, London, until 5 November.																																											"
"What would you do if one day you woke up and you were Kanye West? To most people it＊s a ludicrous question, others may have given it more thought, but it sits at the heart of a new play written by rising playwright .Kanye the First imagines a scenario where the superstar rapper dies and returns to the world in the body of a 27-year-old, middle-class British woman called Annie. Confusion reigns for Annie, her family and the world at large, but she eventually comes to take advantage of the persona thrust upon her.The idea began as a wildcard pitch to new writing company , who will debut the play as part of their festival in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, and Walthamstow, London, this month. Steiner, whose play  has been a hit at the Edinburgh fringe for three years running, is keen to emphasise that Kanye the First is not about caricaturing the rapper. He had been struck by the ※empathy gap§ that was revealed last year when West was  and spent time in a psychiatric centre.※I became really frustrated with how people were mocking him, and implying that he deserved this in some way,§ said Steiner. ※To me it showed this growing empathy gap that people have when it comes to Kanye West; friends of mine who had struggled with mental health problems and know what it＊s like to go through a hard time felt totally fine about taking the piss out of Kanye for it. I thought it was coloured by racism to some extent, but I became really interested in why people responded to him in that way.§Yet this is not a play about Kanye, this is a play about Annie, who is struggling with an ill mother, a detached sister, an absent father and a general difficulty in connecting to the world. By examining the rapper through the prism of her ordinary, relatable life, Steiner said he wanted to make people think twice about the way society treats, and also shapes, celebrities such as West.※So much of Kanye＊s current identity has been formed by the things we the public put on him,§ said Steiner. ※And that scared me a little bit, that we＊ve done this to this person to some extent, we＊ve created this public monster. He＊s been treated quite cruelly and he＊s responded to that.§As a longtime fan of , particularly the way he ※makes the personal epic§, Steiner was also drawn to exploring what makes the cult of Kanye such a global fascination, where he is no longer viewed as a human with flaws but simply an ※android celebrity monster§.※I think he has this really interesting dichotomy between bravado and desperation,§ said Steiner. ※I think he has this confidence which is rooted in self-consciousness, which I really relate to and I think a lot of people relate to, yet we almost refuse to attribute that humanness to him because it＊s played out on a bigger scale.§He added: ※A lot of the journey of the play is Annie using this mask of Kanye West＊s identity to open up and allow herself to be vulnerable and say what she wants to say.§ The play is subtly littered with West song lyrics, and verbatim passages from interviews such as his infamous encounters with Zane Lowe in 2013 and 2015. Kim Kardashian ※may or may not§ also make an appearance in the play, and Steiner admitted that grappling with the complexities of West had given him some sleepless nights. ※I had this moment a week before the first draft where I remember going, ＆this man is too complex for a play＊. But I think fundamentally he is trying to be himself and trying to express himself, which people relate to. And he＊s unpredictable, in the same way that Bowie was unpredictable, and that＊s rare and exciting.§ Steiner said he felt a lot of the issues people had with West and his statements about himself and his work were rooted in race, and the play explores the often problematic cultural appropriation rife in the way that the work of black artists is often treated and consumed.Steiner observed that it can be a minefield to discuss, but said that was no reason to shy away from it in the play. ※It＊s difficult because I believe in multiculturalism, that art and music is a way of sharing cultures and experiences and is all about empathy,§ said Steiner. ※But then I＊ve been to concerts where I＊ve been in a 90% white audience and half of the crowd have chanted along with the N-word, which is really problematic. And during the play rehearsals we were discussing the issue of white women at Solange concerts singing along with the lyrics ＆don＊t touch my hair＊, without any real sense of how politicised hair is for black women.§While it may grapple with Messiah-complex issues, and indeed the second coming of Kanye, Steiner said the play is rooted in a very simple human story, showing how even the biggest egos on this planet are not without their vulnerable sides.※I think hopefully the play shows how, even though Annie is a completely separate entity, there are a lot of shared experiences between a 27-year-old woman in this country and being Kanye West,§ he said. ※That when it comes to grief or shame or confidence issues or feeling like an outsider, no one is exempt.§																																											"
"Pierre Berg谷, who has died aged 86, was crucial to the 20th-century change in couture from a craft enterprise to an international megabusiness. His Napoleonic belief in his destiny was not focused on fashion until, at 29, he met at dinner , the fragile prodigy aged 22 who had suddenly inherited the house of Christian Dior. It was love at first conversation, about everything but fashion, so intense that Berg谷 forthwith left the artist , whose amanuensis he had been for years.From then on, it was all about Yves. When Saint Laurent broke down during a rough first month as an army conscript, Berg谷 tracked him to a military hospital, and used his formidable energy and social aptitude to gain access. He became Saint Laurent＊s support, suing the house of Dior for damages ( had taken Saint Laurent＊s job) to fund an independent YSL atelier to which Dior personnel defected.Berg谷 grasped that  couture was ailing, its houses＊ commercial ventures too tentative when demographic and economic forces were opening up markets. He persuaded, or browbeat, Saint Laurent (Berg谷 alternated as hard and soft cop) into ready-to-wear in 1966, a financial and critical success.Perhaps their compatibility 每 also combatability, given their opposite temperaments 每 came from outsidership. Saint Laurent was from Algeria, Berg谷 from the ?le d＊Ol谷ron, an offshore island in the Bay of Biscay. Both had scant formal education and dreamed of Paris. At 17, Berg谷 left his father, Pierre, a civil servant, and mother Christiane (nee Sicard), to make his fortune in the capital. His accounts of his rise sound like a young-man-on-the-make from a Balzac novel; he traded in old books (collecting rare volumes all his life) and at 19 founded a shortlived anarchist magazine, La Patrie Mondiale.However, Berg谷＊s gift lay in meeting persons of consequence, by contrivance or accident: he claimed that  fell out of a window on to his head, that he shared a cell with the writer  after a demo. Through Buffet he knew , through Cocteau Dior 每  每 Saint Laurent.YSL ready-to-wear was merely Berg谷＊s initial bold move; as company president, he sold its rights in 1971 for capital to invest in a different way of staging couture shows, more like rock concerts, with clothes as loss-leaders to promote licensed accessories and perfumes. (YSL made enough to buy back the rights in 1973.) Berg谷 made complex deals when the luxury conglomerates of today had not yet managed their first merger; in 1986 he sold 25% of YSL for enough to buy Charles of the Ritz, which owned rights to Saint Laurent perfumes and cosmetics.In 1989, the YSL group, with its Berg谷每generated internal synergy, was the first designer house listed on the Paris Bourse, oversubscribed by 27 times. Those who got shares did exceptionally well for a while, but Berg谷 did better. He was fined 1m francs for insider trading, selling shares just before an announcement of plunging profits, while the pharmaceutical company Elf Sanofi paid over the market rate for the 44% of the capital held by Saint Laurent and Berg谷 . , still with the vestigial involvement of Saint Laurent and Berg谷, who did not leave as president until 2002.While together, the couple created museum-like apartments in Paris and New York, a Normandy chateau with every room named after a Proust character, a villa and . They split personally in 1976, when Saint Laurent＊s perma-depression veered towards drink, drugs, and seclusion, although Berg谷, patient with Saint Laurent despite being a prowling, growling panther, claws out, towards everyone else, kept his faith as well as the business going. They lunched daily, and Berg谷, who respected Saint Laurent＊s creativity, if not his metier (※§ was his description) used his arts network to promote exhibitions of Saint Laurent. Showcasing a living designer was a novelty, and Berg谷 went wide with it, to museums in Beijing, Moscow and New York.Berg谷 never ceased buzzing around the arts, owning , with weekly recitals by the best voices in town. As a lifelong socialist, albeit of the ※caviar left§, supporting , he refused a Mitterand cabinet post but accepted the presidency of the , in charge of the new Bastille Opera House, Palais Garnier and Salle Favart, from 1989 to 1994. There he vented even more ferocious temperament than he had in fashion,  for ※too little work for too much reward§, and disputing with ballet director Rudolf Nureyev over his international schedule. Leading conductors refused to enter the Bastille, senior staff escaped it; the theatres were in turmoil. Berg谷 delivered far fewer productions than promised, and most were failures.Mitterrand, a close friend of Berg谷, appointed him an officer of the National Order of Merit (1987) and he was later appointed  (2015). In 2010 he was one of the new investors who bought a controlling stake in.Berg谷 went through a ceremony with Saint Laurent to become legal civil partners shortly before the designer died in 2008, and after disposed of their art collections, reserving only Jardin Marjorelle as their joint memorial, with a Saint Laurent museum.This year Berg谷 , who survives him.

"hen tasked with recreating a recent tragedy on screen, film-makers find themselves toeing a precarious line between respect and exploitation, the end result too often being met with outraged accusations of ※too soon!§ by an understandably angry mob. So while films about the second world war still prove largely profitable (Dunkirk＊s mammoth $414m global take is recent proof of this), there＊s less consistency when covering events that are more fresh in the memory. Last year, Peter Berg＊s one-two punch of Deepwater Horizon and Patriots Day both struggled to attract much of an audience, strong reviews doing little to persuade audiences to relive real world horrors that still linger at the forefront.The events of the latter film also act as a backdrop for this striking new drama from director David Gordon Green. In Stronger, the Boston marathon bombing itself is not the primary focus but more of a starting point for the journey of a man caught in the middle of the tragedy and struggling with the road to recovery.Jeff Bauman (Jake Gyllenhaal) is trying to make amends with his on-off girlfriend Erin (Tatiana Maslany). Her biggest problem, the issue that continues to divide them, is that he just doesn＊t show up. Keen to show her that he＊s someone worth relying on, he lovingly creates a banner and plans to surprise her as she finishes the Boston marathon. But tragedy strikes and a terrorist attack leaves Jeff in the hospital, both of his legs amputated. An uncertain road lies ahead for Jeff and Erin with instant celebrity, pain and rehabilitation threatening to either tear them apart or pull them closer together.During the majority of Stronger, I was struck with the feeling that a far more generic, far less humane version of this story could have so easily been made instead. It＊s borderline Lifetime TV movie territory, and what can seem so inspiring on paper can often feel weighed down with sugar and cliche on screen. But Green proves to be a fine choice as director, an unusual career flitting between lo-fi indie fare like George Washington and Undertow and stoner James Franco comedies like Pineapple Express and Your Highness somehow making him the perfect fit for the material. He＊s keenly aware of the familiar territory, and there＊s a constant effort to make intriguing rather than safe directorial choices. There＊s an effective sense of small-scale intimacy throughout, Green striving for authenticity within the delicate dynamic of Jeff and his loved ones rather than attempting to tell the entire story that surrounds them. There＊s a wonderfully effective moment in the hospital when bandages are being taken off that Green decides to tell entirely within the constructed world of Jeff and Erin. Everything else is a blur and the focus remains on them. Similarly as Jeff leaves for the first time, the camera remains on his face, capturing his every emotion as he copes with life on a wheelchair and the waiting paparazzi.It＊s a refreshingly unconventional style that also allows Gyllenhaal the opportunity to truly impress. Another actor could have struggled with such naked camera work, the mechanics of their work seeming, well, mechanical, but Gyllenhaal is effortlessly good here. It＊s an awards-worthy performance for a star who so often gets miscast and he sells both the good and the bad within Bauman. It＊s pleasing, in a field full of overly deferential biopics, to see a fact-based drama based on a book written  the subject, that still contains nuance. Bauman is not a saint: he＊s often selfish and immature, and by keeping these flaws in the movie, we become that much more involved in his story.The script, written by actor John Pollono, works by focusing on the details. There＊s a studied, informed portrayal of the minutiae that comes with such a loss. How does one cope with using the toilet? How does a fitting for artificial legs actually work? How does everyday intimacy change between a couple? There＊s a particularly poignant scene between Jeff and Erin when he tells her: ※I wish you were leaning on me§. The day-to-day tasks of his life are affected but so is his masculinity and by keeping a tight focus on the couple, Green＊s film carries us with them as they confront new challenges.Maslany is a perfectly cast partner here, delivering an equally naturalistic performance, erring on the right side of sentimentality and there＊s also fine support from Miranda Richardson as Jeff＊s hard-drinking mother. Stronger is a film filled with warmth and humanity, but one that doesn＊t sugarcoat the reality that comes with it. Bauman is an inspiring figure but he＊s also just a guy, full of imperfections like everyone else. Throughout the film he finds the title of ＆hero＊ to be unearned and there＊s a similar avoidance of loftiness by Green and Gyllenhaal, who both work hard at grounding the film. For some, it might seem too underplayed but by keeping things small, it somehow feels that much bigger.																																											"
"n many ways, theatremaker Ong Keng Sen was a natural fit to run the  international festival of arts when it relaunched in 2014.A recipient of Singapore＊s Cultural Medallion, Ong＊s company TheatreWorks signalled a new creative movement when it was founded in 1985. He was there for the birth of Singapore＊s arts scene and 30 years later is still a major player within it.But for a festival run by a famously restrictive government, Ong was also a risky choice: an outspoken artist known for avant garde experimental work, and for pushing buttons that others wouldn＊t push.Singapore arts festival was founded in 1977, organised and funded by the government and curated largely by bureaucrats. But in 2012, battling dwindling ticket sales, it was put on hiatus. The National Arts Council launched a six-month industry review, which recommended the festival be brought back with an international focus and the government kept at arm＊s length.※You can＊t go into a new festival with censorship hanging over your head,§ Ong explains over lunch. ※That was the only reason why I would take the job: if it was not going to be a government directed festival ... [but] the promise of no censorship evaporated within about 15 months.§With his final festival closing this weekend, before the baton is passed to new artistic director Gaurav Kripalani, Ong is eager to speak about the arts in Singapore, and his history battling the various bodies which regulate it. ※I wouldn＊t want to go on for another four years,§ he says. ※I feel drained by the fighting.§ In just 50 years since independence, Singapore has established itself as a global city-state, one of the richest places on earth and one of the most expensive to live in. It＊s clean, safe, multicultural and meticulously organised: a green city with nature parks, biodomes and waterviews, with gardens falling down the sides of skyscrapers built on reclaimed land, and some of the best schools, and food, in the world. One marker of its economic success is the thriving arts scene, up to 85% of which  according to its data. During the week the Guardian visited, there were at least three publicly-funded arts festivals being held, and many speak of the sector＊s vibrancy. Writer Ng Yi-Sheng says on the whole, Singapore has become a more culturally healthy place thanks to the government＊s arts funding. ※Many people have benefited, many of my friends have benefited ... and having works officially valued by institutions gives the average person here more sense of wellbeing, belonging.§But as many artists explain, that money comes with strings attached.Australian theatremaker Edith Podesta moved to Singapore a decade ago and was immediately struck by the government＊s control over the arts. ※At the beginning I remember it being quite shocking,§ she says. ※The funding here is far better than in Australia 每 like, better, and there＊s lots of opportunity for someone who wants to do more experimental avant garde work to find their audience ... But it＊s like constant juggling: where there＊s a plus point there＊s also a negative.§Singapore has been under the rule of the People＊s Action Party since it won self-governance in 1959, and society is still heavily regulated. Sex between men is punishable by imprisonment (prime minister Lee Hsien Loong maintains the law won＊t be ※§, but hasn＊t changed it); protest is legal only in one designated park, subject to pre-approval; the press is categorised as ※§ by the Freedom House watchdog; and there are restrictions 每 formal and informal 每 on which topics are permissible for public discussion.These restrictions are known as ※OB markers§ 每 as in, out-of-bounds markers, and include issues of politics, race, religion and sexuality. ※Singaporeans are very aware of where they should align themselves without being told,§ Ong explains. ※You＊re not told what＊s not possible, but you are given an indication that that＊s the way you should go, and you just internalise it, and co-ordinate yourself and your desires.§ In the arts, those OB markers are regulated from above.  is a two-sided coin for creatives in Singapore. On one side is the government grant application process, which can lead an artist to adapt their art to make it more palatable to the National Arts Council, and grants the NAC the right to take back funds if the work produced is in breach of their guidelines. And on the other is the Infocomm Media Development Authority: the regulatory body that issues licenses and audience restrictions before any performance, film, TV show or exhibition goes public.TV or radio content that ※promotes, justifies or glamorises§ homosexuality is unacceptable under the IMDA and will be censored. For example, the Guardian was told of a Singaporean student who was surprised to hear there were gay characters in Glee, because they＊d all been cut for local broadcast. Meanwhile, IMDA＊s  regulates all live performances and exhibitions to protect the young from ※unsuitable content§ and to ensure that content will not not ※undermine public order, national security and/or stability§ or go against ※prevailing community standards of morality and decency§.In a statement to the Guardian, an IMDA spokesperson said: ※The IMDA aims to strike a balance between reflecting generally accepted social norms, while giving due consideration to the events＊ artistic merits.§ But in effect, this means if a performance hits any of the ※OB markers§, its creators will probably be asked to make changes, or will have their audience restricted to over 16s or over 21s. The show could even be denied classification, which results in an effective ban.These restrictions, Ong says,  for the quality of art produced, and its potential for critique.※Singapore is [portrayed as] this kind of garden paradise, but you don＊t know where the landmines are. And of course most tourists won＊t step on them, but for locals there are lots of controls ... I want to reveal them, to have a more transparent society.§ Until Ong came on board to revive the festival, it had been curated by the government and had therefore been exempt from licensing restrictions. ※They forgot about that for the first year, and in the first year we had carte blanche,§ Ong says. ※But in my second year, the censorship came back.§In February 2015, it was announced that Sifa would need to apply for licenses for each event 每 which this year numbered more than 90, including 16 commissions. In what＊s widely regarded as an administrative headache, the IMDA asks for finalised scripts and content checklists to be sent in at least two months before opening night. As many theatremakers know, a work can change dramatically during this period 每 even during dress rehearsals. ※We were quite shocked,§ Ong says. ※In the first place, it＊s impossible to commission effectively that way.§ In 2015, two foreign films were  after the IMDA refused classification. The following year Sifa brought Swiss director Milo Rau＊s Five Easy Pieces to Singapore 每 a challenging work about a convicted murderer and paedophile, which . The IMDA slapped it with an R18+.※It was ridiculous. The only children allowed in the theatre were performing for the adults,§ Ong says. ※It became cannibalistic. We were consuming these children, who were performing for us what was meant to be a morality tale for them.§Also that year, the . The official line was that her portraits of female Kurdish soldiers fighting against the Islamic State had the potential to ※undermine public order, national security and/or stability§.But instead of cutting the show, the organisers and the artist replaced each censored photograph with a black card. The exhibition became a statement about censorship itself.※One of the first steps towards compromising the integrity of the festival is when you try to hide the censorship as it occurs,§ Ong explains.※I think it＊s very important to know when there has been a public disappearance.§When Singapore＊s founding father Lee Kuan Yew died in 2015, Ong says, it led to ※a kind of tenuousness§, or loss of identity, that was felt throughout the city-state 每 and led to a government more afraid to take risks: ※We started again after LKY passed away ... and from 2015, the conversation became more restrictive,§ he says.※I feel like the officials are closing the spaces quite quickly ... it＊s not getting better, let＊s put it that way.§With a high profile and proven track record, Ong is able to take more risks than others, and be more outspoken. But with the huge audience provided by Sifa, he also is less likely to fly under the radar 每 and his frequently critical Facebook posts are now preceded by a disclaimer: ※The postings on this site are my own and do not represent [the government＊s] opinions or positions.§※There have been several feedback sessions where I got the sense of what the borders are,§ Ong says carefully. But he fears that once his tenure at Sifa is over, there will be real consequences.※I have this fear that once I leave the festival, they will punish me ... They won＊t punish me directly, but through my company TheatreWorks. Withdraw funding. Withdraw our space,§ he says. In a high profile story in 2010, theatre company W!ld Rice had  cut for projects ※incompatible with the core values§ of the government.※I＊m very aware that everything I say now affects the company later,§ Ong says. ※I＊m just waiting for it to happen. And it may never happen. But it＊s a fear I live with.§In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson from the NAC said: ※Apart from our funding conditions, we do not have any theme or issue which is deemed ineligible for funding ... We respect the artistic direction made by various artists and arts companies.§Perhaps unsurprisingly, a major theme running through Ong＊s 2017 festival was ※transparency§. In , Filipino director Lav Diaz opened the set of his forthcoming film to the public, to watch the making of it; in , everyday Singaporeans invited 20-30 strangers into their private lives and told them their story; and in collaboration with Podesta, graphic novelist Sonny Liew＊s stage show  became as much about his new book as the process of creating it.When Ong launched Sifa, he also launched the Open: an annual pre-festival of ideas aimed to encourage public dialogue. This year the Open kicked off with a public forum held across two nights, tackling taboo subjects including LGBT representation and plurality in Singapore, and Singapore＊s ageing population. It took two months of internal meetings with high ranking officials before they could get a license 每 and by the time it was green lit, its original vision had been watered down.Noorlinah Mohamed, the Open＊s artistic director, believes Singaporeans are much more open and progressive than the government gives them credit for 每 but she says many do internalise top-down restrictions. ※We＊re taught to say, ＆Oh we should not challenge authority,＊ or, ＆We should not question race or religion, because that might lead to ＊ ... It becomes mythologised in our psyche that these are areas we should leave alone; that our government knows best for us. And because of that we tend to censor ourselves a lot more.§The artist, she explains, constantly has to weigh up which is more important: having the work go ahead as intended, or making requested changes and reaching a bigger audience. ※You start to become preoccupied with these questions. You add them into the equation of every single creation.§ Another Sifa commission this year was : a geopolitical work written by Stephanie Street and produced by acclaimed Singapore theatre company Pangdemonium, which is run by the husband and wife team of actor Adrian Pang and theatremaker Tracie Pang.Tracie Pang believes the government＊s restrictions are unnecessary: ※We have a community of arts goers who are intelligent enough to make up their own minds.§ But, she adds, they can have positive consequences for the work as well 每 if artists ※box clever§ enough. Their first commissioned work Tango, which , was an example of that.※I would say it makes us work harder to ask the same questions but in a different way, which then makes the work become intellectually more stimulating,§ she explains.※As a company, we feel it＊s better to work with them than against them ... The people [at the IMDA] kind of have hands tied. When we talk to them there is a sense of, ＆Guys, we really want to help you, but we have this rule book!＊§When Singaporean graphic artist Sonny Liew first heard the government was , in May 2015, he was surprised.※I thought we were safe,§ Liew says. ※I had my editors look at it, and historians, lawyers 每 everything was fact-based and well-researched.※So when a friend texted me a few days before the book launch and said ＆I hear your book is getting withdrawn＊, I was like, ＆What are you talking about?＊§The book in question, The Art Of Charlie Chan Hock Chye, went on to  and recently  at the prestigious Eisner Awards at San Diego＊s Comic-Con. It follows comic book artist Charlie Chan on an unblinkered journey through Singapore＊s post-independence years, featuring Lee Kuan Yew as a character.It was the reinterpretation of Singapore＊s official history, Liew presumes, that got him into trouble. But all he can do is guess. The National Arts Council released a statement saying Liew＊s grant, which had been awarded to publisher Epigram Books, had been revoked because of ※sensitive content§ that ※potentially undermines the authority and legitimacy of the government and its public institutions§. The final version didn＊t deviate from the draft which had won the grant, Liew says, so he assumes someone higher up got their hands on the book and vetoed the money. ※The problem is there＊s no dialogue about any of the process, so we don＊t know anything 每 but that＊s the impression we have.§When Liew became the first Singaporean to win at the Eisners, the NAC published  每 but as many noted in the comments below, it failed to mention the book. The NAC has offered to fund one of Liew＊s next works, which he says he＊s ※grappling with§. Self-censorship, he says, is real.※Let＊s say for example I wanted to make a movie of Charlie Chan. That would require a lot of funding, right? ... So do I now become a bit more well-behaved, so I don＊t tread on toes? Or do I just do what I want to do?※[Charlie Chan] has become part of the conversation about arts and censorship in Singapore ... so now I＊m just trying to figure out [what to do].§In a recent editorial for , poet Toh Hsien Min argued that artists shouldn＊t expect money to come for free. ※The NAC may be the only organisation funding the arts whose grant recipients routinely expect to have no stake in the outcomes,§ he wrote. ※If artists are not happy with the conditions set by whichever organisation is offering funding, the only real option is to decline that funding.§But in a young arts economy that has few funding alternatives, only the privileged can afford to say no to a grant. ※If [young artists] behave, they will get the funding 每 and naturally, as a young artist, you the funding,§ Ong explains. He has , where the government sponsors only operational aspects such as studio space and administrative costs, leaving the artists to create what they want. For Sifa, it remains to be seen what incoming festival director Gaurav Kripalani will bring. But as the artistic director of Singapore Repertory Theatre, he comes from a more commercial space, and in : ※I think it＊s safe to say that I have a reputation of not doing weird shit,§ he said. ※I do love mainstream work. I don＊t think it＊s a dirty word.§																																											"
"ear rises like gas from a corpse in ＊s brilliant horror-satire The Death Of Stalin. It＊s a sulphurous black comedy about the backstairs Kremlin intrigue that followed the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, adapted by Iannucci, David Schneider and Ian Martin from the French graphic novel series by Fabien Nury and Thierry Robin.Faced with the unthinkable demise of Stalin, so long revered as nothing less than a god, these Soviet dignitaries panic, plot and go in and out of denial: a bizarre, dysfunctional hokey cokey of the mind. Everyone is of course initially terrified of saying out loud that he is dead 每 a quasi-regicidal act, which could, in any case, turn out to be wrong and interpreted as traitorous wishful thinking. But dead he is, and Iannucci shows that it is like the casting, or lifting, of some witch＊s spell. All these ageing courtiers and sycophants have suddenly been turned into a bunch of scared and malicious children.The Death Of Stalin is superbly cast, and acted with icy and ruthless force by an A-list lineup. There are no weak links. Each has a plum role; each squeezes every gorgeous horrible drop. is outstanding as Molotov, the pathetic functionary with the kindly, unhappy face who has long since sacrificed his marriage and self-respect on the altar of Stalinism;  is a nervy Khrushchev, who morphs from uneasy court jester into a Soprano-esque player;  is compelling as Stalin＊s wan daughter Svetlana, driven to a borderline-Ophelia state of trauma and dread.  is hilarious as the vain and preposterous Malenkov, and so is  as Stalin＊s deadbeat boozer son, Vasily.  gets sledgehammer laughs as the truculent war hero Zhukov, to whom he gives a muscular northern accent: a down-to-earth man of action who is to carry out the film＊s final, brutal coup.And the first among equals is  as the toadlike secret police chief, , a figure oozing evil. For decades, I wondered if this extraordinary theatre actor would ever get a screen role worthy of his stage career. Now at last he has. His Beria is the dark heart of the film: a man who disingenuously suggests softening or ※pausing§ the programme of beatings, imprisoning and torture, so that reformists can be reviled for ideological disloyalty and weakness, and he can be credited for restoring authority. It is Beria＊s cruelty and inhumanity that puts the warhead on the satire.Beale＊s great scene, maybe the best scene in the film, is when he, Molotov and Khrushchev are having a conversation, and Beria grinningly insists on hearing again Molotov submissively and piously say in a loud, clear voice how his wife deserved to be taken away and executed for treason. Beria has got a satanic surprise in store for Molotov: what Greene might have called the worst horror of all, although poor dopey Molotov doesn＊t recognise it as such. If you re-read the final scenes between Winston Smith and Julia from Nineteen Eighty-Four and then watch this scene, you can have your own version of Marx＊s dictum about history as tragedy, then farce. also has a tremendous small role at the very beginning as Andreyev, the radio producer who presides over a live transmission of a piano concerto, featuring a soloist, Maria Yudina (Olga Kurylenko) who is to play a fateful role in the action. Towards the end of the broadcast, Andreyev is aghast to receive a phone call from Stalin himself, curtly asking for a gramophone recording of the event. He then has no choice but to tell his exhausted musicians to re-perform for a recording, and to round up another conductor in circumstances reminiscent of preparing someone to be sent to a labour camp. And his mention of their glorious leader triggers an outburst of neurotic clapping among those present, a droll allusion to the myth that official applause could go on virtually for ever in that era when no one wanted to be the first to stop.Stylishly plugging into the classic Soviet-era mode of subversive satire, and melding it with his own, Iannucci has returned to his great thematic troika of power, incompetence and bad faith. Like the spin-doctors and aides of his TV satires  and , these poisonous Soviet rivals are orphaned by the times. The real power 每 PM, president, general secretary of the Soviet Union 每 to whom these people pay lip-service but have forgotten why, is absent, somewhere beyond or above or below them. They scurry around in an eternal headless-chicken dance whose purpose is to make sure that someone gets the blame. But in The Thick of It or Veep it was different. Get something wrong, and for the most part all you endured was media embarrassment. Here you get a bullet in the back of the head. I wonder if anyone from Vladimir Putin＊s cabinet will see The Death of Stalin. They might see something awful being born.																																											"

At the same time, he turned to opera. His version of Prokofiev＊s  and English National Opera the following year, in which scratch and sniff cards were handed to the audience, was deemed irritating and intriguing. Here was something novel, zany and outrageous.Then in the mid 90s came. Uneven but intelligent, the production also struck many as inept and provoked bilious headlines. Jones is in two minds about it. ※I＊d love to have another go at . Nearly 25 years on, I can safely say aspects of that production were catastrophic.§ Music director Bernard Haitink was not sympathetic to Jones＊s ※naked§ Rhinemaidens fattened up with Latex body suits, or to Wotan carrying a one-way sign for a spear, or Br邦nnhilde wearing a brown paper bag over her head. The difficulties were well recorded.Yet Jones was never out of work, at home or abroad, directing productions in Germany, on Broadway ( the musical) and at Glyndebourne. His style is unmistakable, whether in the human zoo in ), the inflatable horrors of Mark-Anthony Turnage＊s ) or the exquisite, white-starched serenity of , part of ).※You liked ? I＊m glad,§ he asks, surprised, as if no one else had. It was universally acclaimed. ※I was worried about the nuns. That bit at the end when the madonna and angels come on＃ But it seemed to go OK. It＊s all there in Puccini＊s stage directions. They are so detailed, as they are in , too. Tony Pappano is amazing, very attentive to all that.§He has collaborated with Pappano many times, calling him ※a fantastic colleague and very funny. It＊s terrible if a conductor doesn＊t have a theatre gene. A lot don＊t.§ He won＊t say which, but points to  and  as among those who do have it.Jones agrees that after four decades he has established ※quite a monotonous method§ of directing: ※Backstory, biography, where the action is, what the temperature was, what they＊re trying to achieve in a scene. I like clarity of intention. It＊s not a crime to read . I try to be quite rigorous. It＊s hard. But these are top professionals, a brilliant team with none of that ego that can cripple things in rehearsal. Three weeks in a production room and then a tough birth ＃ §And then there＊s the pressure of replacing the Copley show, a hallowed Royal  ritual that enjoyed 26 outings and several hundred performances. ※I can＊t think about it. The other day I took a peek 每 on DVD 每 at the beginning of Act IV of the old production. Then I panicked and turned it off. Not out of disrespect ... I know it＊s given people great joy.§A member of the public asked Jones, perhaps hopefully, the other day whether his  would be traditional. ※I wasn＊t being disingenuous§ 每 a favourite Jones word 每 ※but said, ＆Please can you tell me what traditional means in this context?＊ You have to try to do it for someone who＊s never seen the show. Even the performers come with an idea of how it should go, an imago, so they may resist what I suggest. We＊re currently having some discussion over ＃ the ending.§ He skilfully manages not to spill the beans. ※It＊s a lot easier doing something like  每 a new piece, a blank page.§He considers  bullet-proof, ※like . Some pieces just are.§ He＊s too canny to mean this in terms of his own production. It＊s a practical observation. Other great operas lack that indestructible quality. ※There＊s a lot of plate-spinning in, say, , where you have to convince the audience they＊re watching a dynamic show. It＊s not dynamic in the same way as  is.§He has directed Puccini＊s 1896 masterpiece, based on  by Henri Murger, once before, in Bregenz. That  ※didn＊t work so well§, he concedes. For the new ROH production, he will rehearse the first of three casts, then hand over to a team of staff directors who will continue it until Christmas. Meanwhile, Jones will head to the Almeida theatre to direct , based on the early 1960s American sci-fi TV series ※dealing with aliens, nuclear war, anxiety, all rather prophetic§ 每 and all rather up Jones＊s psycho-fantastical street.For an interview sceptic, he has been generous and obliging. As we wind up, he bursts into a paean to . ※It＊s a fantastic play. It＊s through-composed. The text is faultless, it＊s economic, propulsive. It＊s got really ingenious characters. Everyone＊s ambiguous morally. Everyone＊s good and bad. It＊s almost like Chekhov. It＊s about the young, the vulnerable. It＊s about people falling in love, squabbling, parting, reuniting. Then at the end something devastating happens. That＊s an amazing theatrical formula. It makes people＊s hearts joyful, and it breaks their hearts. That＊s what it＊s there for.§That＊s quite a sell, and still his production secrets are safe.

"Late-night hosts on Wednesday addressed Donald Trump＊s speech on , , and the bipartisan deal struck yesterday to raise the .※Donald Trump did more things today,§  began. ※For one thing, he traveled to North Dakota to talk tax reform, and by talk tax reform I mean ramble incoherently until they turned his mic off.※Trump started by addressing local issues like North Dakota＊s current drought,§ Colbert said, showing footage of Trump saying he didn＊t know they had droughts this far north. ※And Trump compared North Dakota＊s current drought to what Houston＊s going through right now. I＊m going to guess that one was off script.§Colbert then showed more clips from the speech, in which Trump says North Dakota has the ※opposite problem§ as Houston. ※Then he got to the heat of the meat, the reason he was there. He laid out his tax plan,§ Colbert said. In the speech Trump called for a simplification of the US tax code and asked the audiences if they＊d rather labels read ※Made in America§ or ※Made in the USA§. He added they should ※probably pick one§.※Yeah, we should definitely pick one, and then the electoral college can pick the other,§ Colbert joked. ※He seems to think the president＊s job is to pick the labels that go on products. You like ＆Made in the USA＊ better? Great, I＊ll have my factory in China crank out a bunch of those.§※By far the most awkward moment, and for Trump that＊s a pretty high bar, was when he brought up Ivanka,§ Colbert continued, referencing Trump＊s invitation to Ivanka to join him onstage. The president added that Ivanka said: ※Daddy, can I go with you?§ on the trip to North Dakota. ※I like that,§ Trump said.※Not weird at all,§ Colbert said. ※All of Trump＊s advisers call him daddy. Sean Spicer was actually the one who started it.§Colbert continued: ※As Trump so sensitively mentioned, Texas is still dealing with the aftermath of , and they will be for years. Meanwhile, another hurricane, Irma, is bearing down on Florida. It＊s the largest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded. So Irma is a frightening and intense storm, but don＊t worry. President Trump is tweeting at it.§The president wrote: ※Watching Hurricane closely. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!§※That＊s a really oddly casual way to describe exhausted first responders racing to save lives,§ Colbert concluded. of Comedy Central also weighed in, discussing both the impending hurricane and Trump＊s decision to accept a proposal by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to raise the debt ceiling to allocate more funding towards hurricane relief.※Can I just ask a question?,§ Noah began. ※How many once-in-a-lifetime events is it going to take in our lifetime for everyone to admit that maybe mad-made climate change is real? Do you realize  is the most powerful Atlantic storm ever recorded. And that is exactly the sort of thing that climate science predicts: in this part of the world, warmer oceans will lead to stronger hurricanes.§※What is it going to take to get climate deniers to acknowledge this,§ he continued. ※Maybe we need Isis to help us out. Hey, Isis, I know we don＊t agree on stuff but can you help us out here? Maybe Isis should start taking credit for hurricanes. Every time a hurricane hits, Isis should be like, ＆that was us, we sent that storm to destroy America.＊§※And then Republicans will be like, that＊s ridiculous, you guys can＊t cause hurricanes. Isis will be like, who causes hurricanes? They＊ll be like, they＊re caused by climate cha- oh, man. Nicely played. Damn it.§The host continued: ※But before America deals with this potential disaster, it has to finish dealing with its current disaster. As you know, victims in Texas are in need of relief funding. Unfortunately, that funding has to come from the federal government. So when we woke up this morning there was a good chance that the federal government could be shutdown in a few weeks because, as usual, everyone in Washington was too busy slap-fighting each other.§※But then at roughly 12.30pm Eastern daylight time, a true miracle place, the thing you would never expect to happen actually happened:  made a deal,§ Noah said, referring to the president＊s decision to raise the debt ceiling in a deal struck with congressional minority leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.※I don＊t know about you guys, but this all feels like some crazy dream,§ Noah said. ※Donald Trump is working with together the democrats, and my hand is a fish?§Seth Meyers, too, recapped the day＊s news, including Trump＊s cavalier tweets regarding Hurricane Irma and his comments about the possibility of military action in North Korea.※President Trump broke with republicans and struck a deal with democrats on a short-term extension of the debt ceiling,§ Meyers began. ※And you know what that means? No, you don＊t. Neither do I.§※And this guy definitely doesn＊t know,§ he added, showing a photo of Trump. ※As Hurricane Irma hit the Caribbean this morning, president Trump tweeted, ＆Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic.＊§※Hey man, could you try not to sound so excited?,§ Meyers quipped. ※It＊s a hurricane, not the Game of Thrones finale.§Meyers went on: ※Speaking about Hurricane Irma today, president trump said, ＆It looks like it could be something that will be not good.＊ When a natural disaster is bearing down on our country, it would be nice to hear from a leader who knows more words than Tarzan.§Meyers then addressed the president＊s latest comments with regard to escalating tensions with North Korea; earlier this week, UN ambassador Nikki Haley and defense secretary James Mattis both discussed the possiblity of military action being taken to deter Kim Jong-un＊s nuclear capabilities.※When asked today if he is considering military action against North Korea, Trump told reporters, ＆certainly that＊s not a first choice but we will see what happens,＊§ Meyers said. ※Which is scary, because Trump does＊t usually go with his first choice,§ Meyers concluded, while showing a photo of the president with his first wife, Ivana.

It also has ※boobs§, ※big weapon§ and ※bent copper§ written all over it. Billed as a ※sexy Brazilian crime drama§, the show focuses on ex-cop Andr谷 Camara who has just served three years in prison for a crime his terminally ill dad (also a cop) actually committed. Papa croaked without leaving behind the promised confession that would clear his son＊s name and now Andr谷 is alone, shunned by a family who think he＊s guilty and sitting at a dusty bus stop in the desert with no prospects. It becomes clear he must turn illegal bounty hunter to make ends meet.There＊s so little opportunity these days to unashamedly celebrate men punching and killing each other while pole dancers in plastic macs look on admiringly. This show casts aside decades of progress and takes popular culture back to a murky place where corrupt narks and topless sex workers hang out of every window, the men growling and pulling guns on each other, the women arching their eyebrows in perpetual sexual invitation.Most conversations between the male characters are held at gunpoint, in a boxing ring or in the seedy manager＊s office of a strip club. Stubble and sweat and sexy ladies＊ belly buttons are almost always on screen, whatever else is going on. Our hero is beautiful and doomed and helpfully close-crops his luxurious hair to denote the edgy transformation of his character into a ※bad boy§.He＊s in love with his brother＊s alcoholic wife, drinks some unnamed clear spirit direct from the bottle and kicks out sex workers without paying them when he tires of their technique. When this desperate set of circumstances befalls him, my immediate reaction is: good. He deserves nothing more, the big one-dimensional idiot.It seems I＊m not the only one with a low opinion of him. About once an episode, two men on a black motorbike pull up and spray Andr谷 with automatic gunfire, always just missing him. He, of course, stands his ground in the middle of the street and fires his handgun right back at them because he＊s a MAN. It wouldn＊t surprise me if the actors are making the ※pee-ow pee-ow§ noises under their breath, so childishly bad are the show＊s frequent gun battles.Each episode is a straight split between Andr谷＊s overarching search for justice and the cases he takes on as a bounty hunter (he＊s fed leads by his former partner at the police department, Lopes). The weekly guest plot nearly always involves an international visitor searching for a family member before we discover they＊re not actually who they say they are. And a female sex worker with a secret. He meets a lot of those.It＊s not clear why the acquisitions folk at the usually great Walter Presents thought to fork out for this tosh. Perhaps as an antidote to all the nuanced, stimulating international drama they also show. Several times I pause to wonder if this is a period drama, but no, there＊s a mobile phone or a laptop to confirm it＊s set now.

"As claims to fame go, the city of Bangor in eastern Maine has one of the most playful out there. Disguised as its fictional persona of Derry, this small city is the setting for several Stephen King stories 每 including ,  and  每 and it is also the author＊s own residence. While fictional Derry has servedas the epicentre of many paranormal and supernatural events, and is arguably the world capital of terror, real-life Bangor is a quintessential New England small town, with its suburbs and malls, its brick buildings and peaceful waterfront. But it can easily be seen in a menacing light when its streets are quiet and lit only by the glow of street lamps. With the release of the new film adaptation of his 1986 novel , hordes of tourists have travelled to the real-life version of Derry. King-themed tours of Bangor include sites, like the storm drain that inspired terrifying scenes involving the evil creature that appears as Pennywise the clown.Stephen King lives in Bangor, which is as much of an attraction as the city＊s fictional referencesHis house is located on a quiet suburb and is flanked by a wrought-iron fence shaped as spiderwebs and bats. He is known for chatting to eager fans who pilgrimage to take the obligatory selfie in front of his home. A few days ago, a mysterious red balloon 每 the plaything that Pennywise gives children 每 appeared in one of the windows to fans＊  and chills. ※I wasn＊t the one who hung the balloon!§ . ※Tabby [his wife] and I are visiting with friends and relatives in the western part of the state. Not sure who did, but I don＊t mind.§※When there is a book, a movie, a mini-series or some significant Stephen King-related activity, we always see an uptake in the tour vans and the cars parking in front of his house, and coming to see the sights in Bangor that are related to his stories,§ says Tanya Emery, the community and economic development director for the city. Bangor residents have always been extremely matter-of-fact about it all 每 and their respect for his privacy is reportedly what＊s encouraged him to settle here. 每 the population of Bangor. 每 the average low temperature in January. 每 the size in acres of the Mount Hope Cemetery, believed to be the second oldest garden cemetery in the US. It was also the setting for the film adaptation of King＊s Pet Sematary. 每 the height in feet of the statue dedicated to Paul Bunyan, a legendary lumberjack. Bangor is that claim to be his birthplace.Bangor was incorporated as part of New England by European settlers in 1791, and by the 19th century it became the . Located on the Penobscot river, it had huge lumber and shipbuilding industries until the trade diminished and headed west. In the 20th and 21st centuries, its economy veered towards retail and healthcare. Like many American cities, it was deeply affected by the 2008 recession, and it is now trying to figure out how to prosper in a post-industrial world.Bangor is indirectly present in pop culture via Stephen King as the fictional town of Derry, but many of the adaptations of King＊s books weren＊t actually filmed there. Pet Sematary was, however, where you can see King doing a cameo as a priest. And, of course, you can head to cinemas to watch , directed by Andy Muschietti.There are deeper talking points in Bangor than the . The city is in a time of transition; the last decade has seen a lot of redevelopment bringing ※a reenergised sense of downtown and the waterfront, which has been really positive for the community in so many ways§, says Emery. Big employers such as e-commerce homeware company Wayfair have moved into town, but there is also a lot of disparity. Bangor is still grappling with the remnants of the 2008 housing crisis. ※We＊re dealing with substance abuse issues, which so many communities in the US are dealing with, and disengaged people who we want to bring back either to workforce or to education,§ says Emery.The downtown v suburbs struggle has been seen elsewhere in America, as many towns experienced a similar shift in the last 50 years. ※Malls became the popular thing, and everybody moved out of downtowns and into suburbs, and was focused on commuting in cars. There are so many cities in the US that have gone through this transition 每 Hartford, Connecticut, Cleveland or , which is probably the biggest and has been the most challenging,§ Emery adds.Bangor is quietly observing how those communities forge a path from this, and it is in the middle of the new national interest in people living in cities again.The challenge now is to piggyback off that tendency to grow the economy while ※retaining what makes the city unique and interesting§. In the immediate future, Bangor＊s council is focused on continuing to redevelop its waterfront area and supporting existing businesses to ※make sure that we weather the storm§. Being a huge retail centre 每 servicing all of northern and eastern Maine and Atlantic Canada 每 the nationwide  in that industry has had a devastating effect.The  and  websites are both great resources for information on arts and culture to brilliant hidden restaurants.

"One of the most important pieces of suffragette history has been bought for the nation after languishing in an obscure charity shop for 10 years. A banner that provided the backdrop for many of Emmeline Pankhurst＊s most famous speeches had been tucked away in a cupboard in the Halton Moor and Osmondthorpe Project for Elders charity shop in Leeds. It had been donated as part of a house clearance, with volunteers unaware of its significance.Embroidered with the legend ※Manchester 每 first in the fight§, the purple banner has been bought by the People＊s History Museum in Pankhurst＊s hometown of  and will go on display next May for the centenary of women getting the vote. Pankhurst shared the platform with the banner at a huge rally in Manchester＊s Heaton Park on 19 July 1908, when she spoke to a crowd of 50,000 people. It aimed to remind people that the Women＊s Social and Political Union had started in Manchester in 1903, despite having by then moved its headquarters to London. The , which charts the history of British democracy, had hoped to buy the banner when it came up for auction this year but was outbid by a professional dealer. Jenny Mabbott, the museum＊s head of collections, was heartbroken to miss out on the first chance to buy a Suffragette banner for 30 years, but gave her card to the dealer ※just in case we could change his mind§. He eventually agreed to sell up for ?20,000, about a quarter of which the museum raised in just one week from a crowdfunding campaign, which saw supporters pledge amounts from ?1 to ?2,000 to the purchase. The rest of the cash came from an  and the  programme. Mabbott said: ※The significance of this banner to suffragette history cannot be overstated. Such pieces rarely come up for sale and this combined with its quality is what prompted our campaign to acquire it. ※What makes the banner even more special is that it witnessed some of the key suffragette rallies that took place in Manchester, where the movement began. Having the Manchester suffragette banner as part of our collection will help us to illuminate to visitors this important chapter in the story of Britain＊s struggle for democracy so we thank everyone who has supported our campaign.§ Mabbott and colleagues were able to establish the authenticity of the banner with the help of the Manchester Guardian. An edition from 20 July 1908 carried a report of the Heaton Park rally, which mentioned the banner alongside an anecdote about a suffragette being heckled by someone shouting: ※Why don＊t you get married?§ Miss Woodcock of Liverpool replied: ※I am kept so busy advocating women suffrage that I have no time to think of it. But just give votes to women and then I may consider my wedding.§																																											"
"he late  once said that the book he most wished he＊d written was Peter H?eg＊s  每 with the caveat that he would have reworked the unsatisfactory science-fictional ending (his reservations about that book＊s coda were widely shared). Had the creator of Kurt Wallander lived to read H?eg＊s new book, (Harvill Secker, ?16.99, translated by Martin Aitken), there is little doubt that he would have once again wanted to rejig the unlikely climax. H?eg＊s signature character, Smilla Jaspersen, had an almost supernatural intuitive ability involving weather that aided her deductive skills, and the author echoes that here by giving the eponymous Susan a similar gift: the ability to compel interlocutors to tell the truth. But Susan 每 who also possesses an Olympian sexual appetite 每 is responsible for putting her equally odd family in danger when she is called on to investigate a clandestine thinktank called ※The Future Committee§, and finds the stakes are nothing short of apocalyptic.Interestingly, Miss Smilla was marketed as literary fiction (about, among other things, Denmark＊s post-colonial legacy), with its crime fiction trappings seen as incidental, in the same way that the axe murders in  are less important than the study of guilt and redemption. But H?eg is evidently no snob, and now seems happy to move decisively into the less ※respectable§ field of crime. Judged in genre terms, this is an artfully written, exuberant thriller with a mercurial and interesting central character. It will please many 每 or at least those in whom the ending doesn＊t inspire a Mankell-like desire to do a rewrite.From Denmark to Italy 每 but none of H?eg＊s ornate use of language is to be found in the caustic and blunt (Europa Editions, ?13.99). This massive crime epic, already adapted for TV, is translated by Antony Shugaar in unfinessed fashion (※Samurai ripped them into shreds. His friend never even fired a shot. Then they shovelled the remains into trash bags and dropped them into the Tiber§). Italy, with its endemic political and religious corruption, is fertile territory for crime fiction. Choosing the Berlusconi era as it enters its long-overdue final phase, Bonini and De Cataldo (a magistrate and journalist respectively) name their narrative for Suburra, a rundown and lawless area of Rome. The financial crisis of 2008 has allowed the Mafia to gain even greater influence over the police, their own criminal foot soldiers, far-right extremists and a deeply compromised Catholic Church plagued by sex scandals. There＊s no nuance here, but  is a reminder that crime fiction can say as much about a society as other genres.More European criminality in the distinctly off-kilter (Harvill Secker, ?16.99) 每 but then, the eccentric literary world of French writer Fred Vargas (here translated by Si?n Reynolds) has quirkiness as a given. The eponymous musician is the principal suspect when two Parisian women are killed. He flees to sanctuary with Marthe, a former sex worker and the nearest thing he has known to a mother; Marthe then inveigles former investigator Kehlweiler into taking an unorthodox approach to unmasking the real murderer. The book is as beguiling as?previous entries in the Three Evangelists series, with the pleasure here coming from the comic interplay between the unconventional sleuths. And (as this is Vargas) a pet toad has a?significant role.After so many tired police procedurals, who can produce something different in the genre? Sarah Ward, as (Faber, ?12.99) demonstrably proves. Like Ann Cleeves, Ward infuses a degree of Scandinavian chilliness into her resolutely English scenarios, and has a gift for the macabre image 每 such as a burning body, strung from a?ceiling, which turns slowly to face those who have discovered it. Diminutive DC Connie Childs finds that the key to three murders in a Derbyshire house may lie with an as-yet-undiscovered fourth body.Readers may initially wonder why (No Exit, ?12.99) bagged a big Norwegian prize. But those who persist will realise that the longueurs are intentional, and patience pays dividends. Winter holds Norway in its grip. Left-leaning lawyer Vilhem Thygesen finds a frozen corpse in his garden 每 that of a young woman, the victim of a bloody knife attack. The police dismiss the murder as drug related, but then a member of a biker gang once represented by Thygesen dies in what appear to be accidental circumstances. The common denominator in both cases 每 the bolshie, 60ish lawyer 每 is suddenly of interest to the police, who have long nurtured a dislike of him. It doesn＊t hurt that the translation is by the reigning monarch of the?art, Don Bartlett.																																											"
"utside the House of Commons stands one of the few London statues of a woman. Thomas Thornycroft＊s 1902  shows  (always Boadicea to me), rampaging in her chariot with her two daughters. It＊s one of many versions of the queen of the Iceni. She has been embraced as an imperial heroine and a fighter against male tyranny. ※Mad and maddening all that heard her,§ wrote Tennyson.Tristan Bernays＊s vigorous new play sees her as bloody, brave and fiercely maternal. Strongly plotted and directed with exceptional clarity by Eleanor Rhode,  is an occasion for debate and action, not for nuance.

And occasionally speech flashes into something really striking. ※Flex your tongues like bows,§ Boudica commands. Not long afterwards, she is tearing out an enemy＊s tongue.

" (R1) |  (BBC World Service) |  ()When I was young I listened to Annie Nightingale＊s Radio 1 show every week. It was on straight after the Top 40 and I liked her music choices more than John Peel＊s, though he was deemed the indie king. Nightingale played strange stuff 每 she＊s a musical magpie who＊s naturally attracted to the offbeat and alternative 每 but she had a pop sensibility, an ear for a hit. She still does, which is why  continues to employ her and I continue to listen.As part of Radio 1＊s 50th birthday celebrations, Nightingale has been commissioned to make four hour-long shows. They＊re themed soundscapes on the subject of Rebellion, Love, Heroes and Dreams (perfect pop choices); last week＊s was . In each, tunes bleed into one another, with the occasional punctuation of a news clip or relevant voice. Though Nightingale only speaks at the beginning and the end, with the odd comment in the middle, her musical taste is all over these shows, which bop between the Beatles and Stormzy, Kym Sims and Nadia Rose. You note that the tracks were all, at one time, seen as new, revolutionary, weird. Now they are classics: familiar yet moving. They come from a particular time and culture. They mean something.※Taking you on a journey§ is a DJ cliche, but the programmes have a sense of movement. Though the tunes hop about chronologically, you feel a progression from then to now. It＊s a good feeling. I also like the way that the theme is stuck to but not conventionally interpreted.  was full of love, but not the usual boy-meets-girl stuff. Nightingale is too unconventional for that. This love included sex, love for God, unrequited love, love that＊s left you in bits. And communal, uplifting love 每 rave love 每 the kind you only find in big crowds with big music.Some interview clips brought you up short, such as Margaret Thatcher＊s section 28 pronouncement: ※Children ought to be taught to respect traditional values＃ they are being taught they have an inalienable right to be gay.§ (We later heard from David Cameron, announcing that gay marriage was to be made legal.) And, oh, it＊s so great to hear these tracks. I knew every single one, but This Mortal Coil＊s , CeCe Peniston＊s Finally and the Street＊s Dry Your Eyes all made my heart sing. And Elvis Costello＊s I Want You, that shocking shudder of a song, took me right back to the very first time I heard it. It was 1986 and I was in my bedroom, listening to the Annie Nightingale show.There was more old and new in last week＊s  on the World Service. It brought together two amazing athletes: gymnasts Nadia Comaneci and Simone Biles. Unfortunately, the conversation, steered by Kim Chakanetsa, was disappointing. Chakanetsa＊s descriptions of Biles＊s signature tumble were embarrassing (※She flips twice with her body fully extended, then twists around and lands without looking on the ground§; it＊s like saying of a golfer: ※He swings the long stick, hits the small ball up in the air and it goes a really long way§) and she didn＊t pick up on Comaneci＊s comment about the changes in equipment from her era to now (※The floor was very hard,§ said Comaneci. ※We didn＊t have the same springs as now.

"Hundreds of one-star reviews of Hillary Clinton＊s memoir What Happened, which appeared online within hours of the 512-page book＊s publication, have been removed from .What Happened, in which Clinton gives her account of the 2016 presidential campaign, was published on Tuesday. By Wednesday morning, there were more than 1,500 reviews of the memoir on Amazon.com, the majority either glowing or scathing.The book＊s publisher at Simon & Schuster, Jonathan Karp, told the Associated Press: ※It seems highly unlikely that approximately 1,500 people read Hillary Clinton＊s book overnight and came to the stark conclusion that it is either brilliant or awful.§Quartz, which , said that of the 1,500-odd original reviews, ※only 338 were from users with verified purchases of the book§. At the time, What Happened had an overall rating of 3.2 stars, but Quartz points out that ※average rating for reviews from unverified purchases was a 2.3, while the average from a real purchase of the book was 4.9§.By Thursday, only 581 customer reviews remained, 95% of which were five-star. Amazon said on Thursday morning that ※we remove customer reviews that violate our community guidelines§.  ※when we find unusually high numbers of reviews for a product posted in a short period of time, we may restrict the number of non-Amazon Verified Purchase reviews on that product§.Amazon said customers＊ reviews ※must be related to the product and are designed to help ＃ purchase decisions.

We do however have mechanisms in place to ensure that the voices of many do not drown out the voices of a few.§Karp said that Simon & Schuster had hoped that online commentary would ※reflect opinions of people who have actually read the book§.On Thursday morning, the latest reviews included a one-star write-up from a user who felt that ※she lost and the best person in the world won, President Trump§; a two-star review from one who wrote that ※I would＊ve given this one star but didn＊t want my review deleted§; five stars from a customer who simply wrote ※#StillWithHer§ and five stars from another who wrote: ※When I hear people criticitizing [sic] the book on TV or on the radio or giving it a poor review, I can tell right away that they haven＊t read it.

"he habitual calm and gentleness of Mahamat Saleh Haroun＊s film-making here has a sharp edge and an overtly political point 每 as well as a flourish of violent destruction and despair that blindsided me. This Chadian director, who lives in France, brings the African experience to Europe in a deeply felt, compassionate film about refugees who find that one of their bitterest abasements is the loss of dignity and status.These are proud people, who left behind prestigious jobs in their homeland, now forced to take on low-paid work or ask for handouts while their various appeals and applications grind through the intensely policed asylum system. They are people who suffered terrible losses in making it this far, and have to resign themselves to all these wounds being invisible to the state agencies from whom they are asking help. And male pride can be an important, even tragic factor.It is the story of two brothers who have escaped together from Bangui in Central African Republic: Abbas (Eriq Ebouaney) and Etienne (Bibi Tanga). They both held academic teaching positions at home but in France have to make do with cash-in-hand jobs: Abbas heaves crates around in a fruit and veg market and Etienne works as a doorman. Against this, Haroun allows us to absorb the irony of the heavy-set security guys positioned in the government appeals office, ready to get tough with any desperate refugees who won＊t accept the official decision. Abbas has two children whom he adores, but his wife was killed in their escape, and he still sees her in nightmares and sleepwalking episodes, in which he pursues her phantom down corridors. To complicate things, he has now fallen in love with a Carole, a French woman, played with shrewd insight by Sandrine Bonnaire, but lives apart from her in various hostels and halfway houses for a complicated set of reasons, which Eriq Ebouaney＊s dignified performance subtly conveys. He feels disloyal to his dead wife, and that his pride as a breadwinner will not allow him to be a kept househusband. In the same way he resents having to jump through bureaucratic hoops because of his resentment at the indignity, and the prospect of unbearable pain and disappointment at being turned down. As for Etienne, he is feeling a similar malaise, living semi-rough in a shack by the river, but maintaining the habits of an intellectual. He still reads seriously. Yet the situation is taking its toll on the relationship he is having with a woman there. It is Etienne for whom the agony of the situation is to become too much to bear, and manifests itself in a tragic, shocking act.The film＊s best moments are when Carole and Abbas are having dinner at her flat, along with the children. Abbas has taken the decision not to open the most recent official letter he has received until the dinner is over 每 in case it＊s bad news. Haroun simply lets the scene run, from the meal to the impromptu dancing afterwards, and there is a marvellous ease and a charm to it. Ultimately, there is an awful reckoning coming. Haroun has a coup in his final scene, bringing us to a strange, empty wasteland in northern France. Finding out what this place is provides an education you won＊t get from watching the TV news. This film reminded me of a comment that the dramatist Martin Sherman made in Vanessa Redgrave＊s documentary : that refugees are in a state of shock, their impassivity and calm mask an inner pain at suppressing their anguish at what and who they have lost. Ebouaney and Tanga show this too. It is possible that the title is intended to trigger an echo of Rimbaud＊s A Season in Hell. Hell is the place that the refugees are escaping, but their purgatory continues in the prosperous west.																																											"
"Too many public sculptures are examples of ※plop art§ 每 works dropped into an apparently random site and hardly noticed 每 according to artist .The  winner has been responsible for a number of public works around the world, including a cast of the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square and the Holocaust monument in Vienna.Speaking ahead of a major retrospective of her work at , Whiteread said all her public sculptures were in places for a coherent reason.※I＊m not a great fan of what I call ＆plop art,＊§ she said. ※Where you plop a piece of work down in a place and it doesn＊t really bear any relationship to anything else.※Art has got extremely popular which is great for many reasons but I think a lot of public sculpture is ill-thought-out and put in places it shouldn＊t necessarily be. It then becomes something that is sort of invisible. People don＊t even notice it. I think art is there for a reason and should be respected and looked at, not be just a sideshow.§Whiteread declined to name which sculptures she thought were plop art, but there will be many people who have strong views on the subject, given how fiercely divisive the subject of public sculpture can be.For as many people who love, for example, , there are large numbers who loathe it. How many people could name the men who occupy the three other plinths in Trafalgar Square? How many can even visualise them?Whiteread said London was ※completely full of sculptures which no one bears a blind bit of attention to§. She added that although there were figures everywhere: ※People have no idea who they are or what they are for.§The Essex-born artist burst onto the art scene in 1993 with her cast of an entire east London terraced house,.Her new retrospective surveys 30 years of her casts, whether of hot water bottles, doors, seats, windows, mattresses, or entire rooms and staircases.All the walls have been removed from Tate Britain＊s exhibition space leaving just one 1,500 sq m space full of her sculptures.It took four weeks to install the show and Whiteread said she looks on it with pride. ※It has been quite emotional actually; it has been an interesting journey.※What I feel very proud of in this show is the consistency, the work has kept this very rigid path and I＊ve created a language and I＊ve worked with this language ... it is like making an alphabet: you start to make words and play with them.§In the show, the casts of floors and chairs and mattresses have tape around them, but keeping visiting children off them may be an extra challenge, curators admit.Whiteread said she was more concerned about children getting yelled at by their parents than the threat to her work, although she stressed they were not for climbing on.For the Tate Britain show she has made a sculpture cast from a Norfolk chicken shed, owned by a friend.It has been installed on the gallery＊s lawn and is part of a series Whiteread calls ※shy sculptures§ 每 of sheds, huts and cabins from remote locations such as a fjord in Norway, up a hill on New York＊ Governors Island and the Mojave desert.Whiteread said sheds were beautiful things with their own poetry: ※They are furniture for people to dream away their lives in.§ She wanted to make many more and locate them in remote landscapes around the world accompanied by a book and a map, but added: ※They have to be the right locations.§The Tate Britain retrospective will run in London from 12 September to 21 January 2018 before travelling to Washington, Vienna and St Louis.

"A film about Russia＊s last tsar has had its first screening amid heavy security after attacks on a cinema and a film studio by religious extremists determined to prevent its release.Matilda, directed by the Russian film-maker Alexei Uchitel, tells the true story of a romance between the future Nicholas II and Mathilde Kschessinska, a teenage prima ballerina at the Mariinsky theatre in St Petersburg.Nicholas II, who was executed along with his family by Communist revolutionaries in 1918, was canonised by the Russian Orthodox church in 2000. Some Russian Orthodox Christians claim the film, which was funded by the culture ministry, is blasphemous because it portrays the ※holy tsar§ in love scenes.Christian State-Holy Rus, a radical Russian Orthodox movement, warned in February that ※cinemas will burn§ if Matilda was screened.The film, which was initially due for release in March, was shown in Vladivostok, in Russia＊s far east, on Tuesday. The premiere was delayed by a hoax bomb threat but went ahead after a sweep of the cinema by a police bomb squad.A second screening of the film, in Moscow, was cancelled on Monday after two cars parked outside the law firm that represents the film studio were set alight by suspected Orthodox radicals. ※Burn for Matilda,§ read a note left at the scene.This month, another Orthodox Christian activist destroyed part of a cinema in Yekaterinburg, the central Russian city where the royal family was murdered, by driving into it in a minibus containing gas cylinders and a barrel of petrol. A 39-year-old man who had previously protested against the film was arrested over the attack, which police have not classified as terrorism.Uchitel, whose film studio in St Petersburg was targeted in an attempted arson attack in August, says police have ignored his appeals for protection.Natalia Poklonskaya, a prominent MP with Vladimir Putin＊s ruling United Russia party, has said the film ※insults the feelings of religious believers§, a criminal offence in  since 2013, and has called for it to be banned.Critics accuse her of stirring up religious tensions. The Kremlin has condemned the violence but Putin said artists should strive not to upset believers. The Russian Orthodox church has urged the creative community to show ※tact and respect§.																																											"
"sing the N-word is never okay. It＊s a fairly easy rule to live by, but one that needs repeating in the wake of YouTube megastar Felix Kjellberg＊s .Commonly known as PewDiePie, the vlogger called another player ※a fucking nigger§ during a live video stream. Taking too long to realise his mistake, he qualified the racist slur with ※I don＊t mean in a bad way§ and laughed it off. Social media kicked into gear after the video came to light and condemned the YouTuber. In addition, . Most notably Sean Vanaman from Campo Santo responded by filing a copyright claim to order YouTube to remove Kjellberg＊s Firewatch videos. He also urged other developers to do the same.Despite the public outcry, many people are coming to Kjellberg＊s defence (some using the hastag ), dismissing the event as a crime of gaming passion. This ignores his influence and sends a clear message that it＊s okay to be racist in the gaming community.Casual use of racial slurs needs to be condemned wholeheartedly, every single time. There is never a good reason to use the language displayed in this video. Playing a video game is not an excuse, just as being drunk or angry does not give anyone free reign to use racist insults.Watching the video is shocking because Kjellberg drops the word so casually. In fact, he doesn＊t even seem to recognise what he＊s just done, until you hear some nervous laughter from someone off-camera prompting Kjellberg to attempt an apology. It＊s all framed as something said in the heat of the moment. It doesn＊t represent who he is or what he thinks, his social media supporters claim. His fans tell us that he＊s clearly not racist, but all we have to go on is the fact that he repeatedly uses racist language as a source of what he calls satire and entertainment. It＊s not the first time racist language has been used in jest by Kjellberg: he lost lucrative contracts with Disney and YouTube in 2016 after  in his videos. It＊s easy to be sucked in by the affable, good looking YouTuber. Kjellberg＊s PewDiePie persona is the funny, care-free friend you want to hang out with. He doesn＊t take anything too seriously. He＊s fun to have around. Let＊s not forget that Kjellberg was the highest paid YouTuber of 2016, earning ?11.8m last year with nearly 60 million subscribers. For this seemingly harmless, popular figure with no agenda to use offensive, racist language as if it＊s nothing only normalises it. Laughing it off like Kjellberg does is even worse.The trouble with the ※he＊s not racist§ argument is that it ignores everything that comes with any racial slur. It ignores the pain and the history and the times people have had to shrug off those insults. Using the N-word is a choice, not an accident. And we need to stop framing the perpetrators as the victims because they seem like nice people or because they have black friends and an appreciation of rap music. Racism isn＊t funny. It＊s as simple as that. In the current political climate, the far right has managed to rebrand itself as the so called ＆alt-right＊, reframing its politics as the acceptable face of racism and homophobia. Only a few weeks ago, a Nazi rally took place in America and dominated news headlines for days. The word Kjellberg used is not just a word. It＊s a word that is heavy with history and suffering, but just because it＊s used in rap music or films people feel they are entitled to use it. They are not. And they are not entitled to tell black people not to be offended when someone like Kjellberg uses it. How many times is the games industry going to be shocked and appalled by Kjellberg＊s racist language and stunts? How many apologies does he have to record before we admit that the industry needs to stop supporting him? Silence is complicity.																																											"

Williams was known for his rich voice, gentle delivery and storytelling style. He toured sparingly, did few media interviews and spent much of his time on his farm west of Nashville.His career started as a musician in Portland, a city he moved to from his native Texas, where he was born in 1939. He moved to Nashville in the late 60s and wrote songs for some of country＊s biggest names, including ※Cowboy§ Jack Clement.※It＊s one of those blessings and curses kind of things,§ Williams said in an interview with the Associated Press in 1994. ※There＊s very few things in my life that I＊ve done that come anywhere close to making you feel exhilarated and humbled and fulfilled and challenged and all that, all at the same time.§ His hits included I Believe in You, Lord, I Hope This Day Is Good, You＊re My Best Friend, Some Broken Hearts Never Mend, and Till the Rivers All Run Dry.

"here＊s a reasonable premise to this horror-thriller, but also something straight-to-rental about the look and feel of the whole thing. It＊s a heist movie-horror mashup. A ruthless armed gang led by sisters Leah (Francesca Eastwood) and Vee (Taryn Manning) plan on taking down a neighbourhood bank. They make all of the terrified customers and employees kneel on the floor, and one nerdy guy with a moustache (played on autopilot by ) tells them there is a secret vault, one floor below the main bank concourse, that is crammed with millions of dollars. What he doesn＊t say is that this vault was the subject of a horrifically violent failed bank job in 1982, and now the ghosts of that robbery are lying in wait to take a terrible vengeance on those who venture down there.Perhaps inevitably, there is no satisfying third-act conclusion to this setup, but plenty of cliches, including the one in which people feel the need to set stuff on fire, flipping open a Zippo lighter and tossing it into the pool of gasoline, etc.																																											"

"e wrote  with four actors in mind: , ,  and . As hardly ever happens, none of them died, and they all said yes.I first met Jerry in Las Vegas, where we rehearsed. Walking through the crowded gambling floor of a Vegas casino with Jerry, the reactions ranged from hysteria to the shock that comes with seeing a ghost. He＊s alive! Very much alive. (In fact, he was a very sprightly 69.)From the outset, he was generous. There was only one alarm bell: he made a show of presenting me with a signed copy of his book, The Total Film-Maker. It threw me, humbled me. It reminded me I was directing a director. Was the book an instruction manual on how I should proceed? I kept expecting him to be difficult; to pull rank. He never did.If he was ever difficult, it was in ways that never bled on to the set. No room at Blackpool＊s Imperial hotel was big enough for him. In the end, it was one room for him and one for his belongings. Locks had to be changed. And I had to hide the fact that I had the biggest room, the Gigi suite 每 something I also had to hide from Leslie Caron  to anybody familiar with her filmography.But he embraced it all. The fish, the chips 每 all of it. The world of my home town, , as it appeared in my childhood.The film is full of non-professional actors, from many different walks of life. The crew called the film ※the mad, sad, uninsurable world of Peter Chelsom§. In particular, there were a lot of comedians. For me, there＊s a very thin line between a talent for being funny and being a great actor. Jerry Lewis epitomised that. And that＊s the thing about him 每 he really was a fine actor. He played it very truthfully. He understood the zone he was in: real characters in absurd situations. In , there＊s comedy and there＊s acting, but there＊s no ※comedy acting§. You don＊t act absurd; it＊s a by-product. He got that.There is a scene where he visits his son (Oliver Platt) in his dressing room before going on to stage. He asked me how I saw it. I told him I just wanted him to ※own§ the room, to stay loose. I didn＊t want to give him moves. I was rolling two cameras, and I would catch whatever he wanted to do 每 I knew he would direct himself. He knew what worked. I just wanted to watch. Take one is in the movie.He told me he loved what the film had to say, about comedy, about our lives. He related to the polarity, the limits, the dark side of it all: this was a film where a comedian () is fuelled by applause to almost murder someone on stage. Jerry embodied the term ※funny bones§: a way of differentiating between comedians who  funny and those who  funny. He was definitive casting.I had been obsessed with the essence of comedy from the age of seven. Jerry used to ask me: ※How do you know all this without coming from a show business family?§ Then one day, I pointed out  in the distance. ※You see Butlin＊s, Jerry? My grandmother won the glamorous grandmother competition there five years in a row. And I＊ve got all the cups to prove it.§ He smiled, spread his arms and said: ※So you  come from a show business family!§																																											"
"ach autumn for more than a decade, EMI (now Warner Classics) has produced a three-disc compilation of recordings from the previous year＊s Progetto Martha Argerich, the annual festival that  founded in the Swiss city of Lugano in 2002. The mix of solo piano, chamber music and concertos has showcased an equal mix of generations, as Argerich＊s long-standing friends and collaborators played alongside up-and-coming musicians whom she supported. There was always something special among the recordings, even if there was not always as much of Argerich herself as her fans might have liked. But that all came to an end last year, when sponsorship of the festival was withdrawn, no replacement could be found and the 2016 festival had to be the last.Appropriately for this final compilation, however, Argerich does feature prominently throughout the set. It opens with something that has been a real rarity for more than 30 years: her giving a solo performance of one of the pinnacles of the 20th-century piano repertoire. She recorded Ravel＊s  in the studio in the 1970s, and hearing her play it 40 years later with the same dazzling security and clarity is an extraordinary privilege. There is also yet another performance of Ravel＊s G major Concerto, a piece she must have performed and recorded more often than any other, though the orchestral playing on this latest one, from the Orchestra Svizzera Italiana under Alexander Vedernikov, doesn＊t quite match her brilliance.Argerich also partners Sergei Babayan in Mozart＊s Sonata for Two Pianos K448, and Stephen Kovacevich in a two-piano arrangement of Debussy＊s Pr谷lude 角 l＊Apr豕s-Midi, as well as accompanying Tedi Papavrami in Bach＊s C minor Violin Sonata. But what I think is new to her discography is Beethoven＊s Choral Fantasy, in which (with Diego Fasolis conducting) she plays the obbligato piano part with tremendous panache. There are other treats, notably a wonderfully warm account of Brahms＊ Horn Trio, played by David Guerrier,  and , and a feisty, muscular one of Berg＊s Chamber Concerto with Capu?on and Angelich as the soloists. But there is no doubting who the set is really all about.																																											"
"he best things in life are usually closer than you think,§ says Luke Wheadon as he pours a healthy measure of his artisan gin over ice.

The gin is infused with hibiscus flowers and mandarin limes grown in one of the island＊s vast greenhouses 每 which once supplied many of the UK＊s tomatoes. His signature gin, created from 13 exotic botanicals, uses rock samphire foraged from a nearby cove. ※Each infusion features a key ingredient that I source locally, so it＊s honestly a taste of Guernsey,§ he says.Jersey may be known for its Michelin-starred restaurants but Guernsey is now establishing itself as a gastro destination, with several new eateries and bars opening this year and an increasing number of artisans creating standout products.The following morning we walk down to the cove at Moulin Huet 每 a spot favoured by Renoir. Rugged cliffs tower over the sea, crowned with a mantle of wild flowers and samphire. At half-tide, a sandy beach is revealed, and a heavenly, albeit chilly, swim sorts out our gin-soaked heads.Renoir also frequented the La Valette bathing pools near St Peter Port, built in 1865. Victor Hugo, who made his home at nearby Hauteville, was also a fan. Years of storm damage had made them unusable but now the pools are being rejuvenated as part of an ongoing community project. It＊s still early when we visit and we have the mirror-calm water to ourselves.Back on the food trail, we warm up in , an airy new restaurant on the waterfront run by Delphine Pesrin-Auder and chef Mickael Pesrin, the couple behind Le Petit Bistro in town.

The breakfast choice is less bewildering, and we tuck into a ※house breakfast§ 每 Guernsey sausages, cured bacon, eggs and beans (?10) 每 on the terrace, with views across Havelet Bay to the ramparts of Castle Cornet.There are reminders of an embattled past all along Guernsey＊s coast: menacing German concrete bunkers; stone Martello towers, remnants of Napoleonic-era defences; and Pleinmont Tower, an intimidating six-storey lookout that stands sentry to one of the island＊s most picturesque walks. Happily, there is also no shortage of tearooms or ※kiosks§ nearby, such as , serving hunks of Guernsey  (pronounced gosh), a fruit loaf that＊s best spread with golden Guernsey butter.The island champions artisans such as , and Rick Creber＊s Home Grown Chillies. A growing number of small-batch producers are creating cider, gin, craft beer and fruit liqueurs flavoured with locally grown fruit and wild herbs. Box stalls filled with fresh produce, known as ※hedge veg§, can be found on hedgerows, with an honesty jar alongside.St Peter Port, with its cobbled streets, boutiques, restaurants and cafes, is the heart of an increasingly vibrant foodie scene. At , a tiny new tapas bar, chefs trained by London luminary  create mouthwatering combinations: tender lamb cutlets with  (cold garlic soup); asparagus with manchego cheese; and Monte Enebro goat＊s cheese with honey. The rosemary cheesecake is silky smooth, with hints of rosemary and ginger, topped with nougat 每 quite exquisite.Nearby, up Constitution Steps, is Moroccan-inspired hotel and restaurant . Cocktail in hand, we catch our breath in a cosy beach hut on the roof terrace. Below, slate roofs sweep down to the harbour, and beyond lie the islands of Herm, Jethou and Sark, in a glittering sea.Closer to sea level,  is another new hangout. The old abattoir beside the harbour has been given a facelift and its bar is well-stocked with local ales 每 such as Randalls Breda and Rocquette cider 每 and gins. There＊s also an extensive cocktail list, while mains include pan-roasted sea bream with parma ham and sea herbs, and fennel pollen-encrusted lamb loin with miso and wild mushroom fricass谷e.For those with a sweet tooth, nearby chocolatier  offers artisan confections with cumin, miso or raspberry and stinging nettle. For a more hands-on experience,  at Oatlands Village now offers chocolate-making workshops. I leave clutching a bag filled with boozy prunes dipped in dark chocolate and a delicate white chocolate oyster shell.Until 24 September the  in St Peter Port will shine a spotlight on local produce, with markets, demonstrations and promotions in restaurants and bars 每 it＊s also . And in October there＊s  (1 Oct-11 Nov, three-course menus from ?10 ), a six-week taste-athon in which hotels, restaurants and gastro pubs across the Channel Islands offer low-cost menus.We complete our weekend with fish and chips on the sea wall, just up the coast at Cobo. Watching the sun set over the sea with sand between your toes, is hard to beat: simple and local. Yes, the best things in life are usually closer than you think.																																											"
"You may have little room left for outrage at the moment, but please spare a quiet scream for Glenn Close who has 每 ready for it 每 never won an Oscar. The 70-year-old actor has accrued six nominations during an illustrious career, yet for every  that followed each of Leonardo DiCaprio＊s losses, we haven＊t witnessed a similar online campaign to propel Close to the stage of the Dolby theatre. As it stands, she holds the record for the living actor with the most nominations without a win. But, as she begins a new decade, it looks like her chance for a statuette may have finally arrived.In the electrifying 90s-set drama , she stars as a woman married to a distinguished author (a never-better Jonathan Pryce) poised to accept the Nobel prize for literature. Her own writing career, once seen as so promising (we learn this via a series of flashbacks starring Close＊s daughter Annie Starke as her younger self), ended early so she could support her husband and raise a family. But as the pair head to Sweden to accept his medal, tensions begin to boil and a woman who has spent years in the shadows is ready to come into the light.The Wife is about marital secrets, sacrifice and also 每 in a fantastically performed opening scene 每 it＊s about what sex means for those over the age of 60. ※I think people don＊t realise that you keep your sexuality up until you die,§ Close tells me, as we share a near-conspiratorial chat in the lounge of the Ritz Carlton hotel. ※I think it＊s good for kids to see it. That scene is kind of funny and real, and Jonathan was just so wonderful to work with.§It＊s a sensational, thrilling turn from Close and in a career filled with fine work, it may well be her best yet. The film, still awaiting UK and US distribution, premiered at this year＊s , a fertile breeding ground for awards hopefuls and she seems gratified by the buzz that it＊s receiving. It is a role that she is effortlessly suited for, but in reality, Close, who has been married three times, has never lived in the shadow of a spouse; instead, she has often been the one on the other side of the equation.※I think it＊s difficult,§ she says. ※I don＊t think the male ego is necessarily conducive to having a really successful and recognisable partner. I think it can be hard and I now accept that!§ She laughs and tells me about a Harvard study that showed both men and women tend to warm more to female figures who are more traditionally feminine and nurturing. It＊s not a fact that Close has paid much attention to, though, her career typified by characters who refuse to comply with old-fashioned gender conventions. She played a ruthless lawyer on the small screen in ; a manipulative widow in ; a dog-killing fashionista in ; a strong-willed vice-president in ; and bunny-boiling lover Alex Forrest in  每 none of whom were ever stuck in the kitchen playing house. ※I＊ve played a lot of women that people have called bitchy or evil,§ she says. ※They have been incredibly strong and it＊s just interesting to me because the parts I＊ve played in my career have been labelled as if they were women in the workplace.§Her most recognisable role to date remains Forrest, the woman who single-handedly scared male cinemagoers off having affairs in the late 80s. It＊s a flooring performance, but while Forrest became known as one of cinema＊s all-time greatest villains, to Close she remains a misunderstood figure.※That character had a lot of secrets,§ she says. ※But there＊s no way for the audience to know what her past was. It＊s only hinted at when she looks at him giving the bunny to his daughter and then throws up in the bushes. Nobody would say: well why did that happen? Whereas I asked that and the psychiatrist said if she was molested at an early age, and what she was made to do made her gag and throw up, then that＊s her trigger. Someone who＊s been abused like that has absolutely no self. I mean, there＊s a hatred for one＊s self because you＊re made to be a sexual object way before you＊re ready. When  came, it gave a catharsis to the audience but that kind of made her into a psychopath.§Fatal Attraction made Close a household name and provided her with a fourth Oscar nomination, but despite a decade filled with hits, she felt was not always awarded the respect she deserved behind the scenes. We discuss the casting process and the horrors that often greet female actors along the way. She offers a ※demeaning§ anecdote of an actor who inappropriately touched her thigh (※I did feel there was a collusion between him and the director§) but goes on to recount a far more troubling story.※I was asked to come in and read with an actor who was huge at the time and I walked in and there was a bed,§ she tells me. ※I had the pages with me, but he didn＊t know any of his lines and didn＊t have them with him. So it was horrible. I realised afterwards that it was like putting a dog in with a bitch to see if he wanted to jump on her. If I had just forgotten the lines and worked at seducing him then I probably would have gotten the part.§Playing the game, whatever that might be at any given point, has never been of interest to Close. She has never lived in Los Angeles, has avoided industry schmoozing (※Maybe I should have gone to more parties, but I hate parties!§) and worked on films that tested her versatility rather than increased her bank balance. She also remains outspoken on issues such as mental health, LGBTQ rights, abortion and her outrage over Donald Trump＊s presidency.※It＊s so dangerous because [Trump is] creating these diversions and meanwhile all his people are deconstructing vital things for our country in every single area,§ she says with visible frustration. ※These are bad people; why would you do these things unless you just want to get richer? It＊s mind-boggling to me. I think the scary thing is we＊ll all get to a point when you just don＊t want to hear about it any more and that＊s the danger. I know who my representatives are and I think the best thing to do is just calmly write letters, write letters, write letters. You can＊t just scream and say this is awful; you have to very quietly say: ＆Well let＊s get rid of him.＊§Close＊s commitment to wider social change remains a constant in her life, alongside a tireless work ethic that, in the past year, has seen her shooting an Amazon pilot (※A character like I＊ve never played before§); playing a villain in the dystopian Netflix thriller ; taking on parts in comedies  and ; and reprising her role as Norma Desmond in the Broadway musical version of . The latter is a character who remains dear to her and one that she＊s set to take on again in a new big-screen adaptation. ※We＊re waiting for the final contracts to be signed and it＊s pretty hairy!§ she says. ※I hear from my agent closer, closer; and I hear from the director who wants to do it, closer closer. It＊s a profound story and has huge resonance today.§While Close＊s packed career is in no need of an added validation, an Oscar would still prove to be an appreciated, and unexpected, cherry on top. ※I＊ve always felt like I＊m an outsider looking in and I guess that＊s why something like an Oscar would mean a lot because of that feeling,§ she tells me. ※It＊s the most valued recognition you can get, certainly in film, and having been doing it for so long, it would mean a lot to me.§The downside? All those parties ＃																																											"
"peaking to , the thick-bearded, 300lb tattooed Albanian-American rapper who has forged a second career as a gourmand TV presenter, it seems surprising that more musicians aren＊t foodies. Surfing from city to city on expense accounts, with plenty of free afternoons, life on tour offers a lot of scope for exploring out-of-the-way restaurants and eateries.※Music and food go hand in hand,§ Bronson explains. ※The dish in the middle of the table is like the song you put on for everyone to start grooving to. It＊s the language of the world, a way of bringing people together.§As he explains, for him the food came before the music. He grew up in Queens, New York, son of an American mother and an Albanian father. ※My grandmother would be making food three times a day,§ he says. ※Delicious Albanian delicacies, but I didn＊t appreciate it until I was older. I＊d be eating hamburgers like a little prick.§ He worked as a chef, and even briefly did food TV himself, before an injury led him to focus on the music.Soon, however, Bronson＊s catholic palate and growing hip-hop fame led to a show on Vice＊s food channel, Munchies, called .As you might guess from its title, the series does not dwell long on the finer points of flavouring or sous-vide technique. Instead, Bronson travels around, meeting local chefs, exuberantly sampling their wares, and swearing a lot.※This is going to blow your pussy off,§ he says of some fried chicken in New Orleans. ※This tastes like my grandmother. Not like her, like the things she used to make,§ he says of a meat-filled pancake in Paris. ※I feel like Jamie Oliver,§ he says, showing us how to make Hawaiian poke on a New York rooftop. It＊s funny, unpretentious 每 and filthy.Perhaps inevitably, given the millions of views it has received, the show has led to a  of the same title, co-written by Rachel Wharton. In it, Bronson lists 100 of his favourite things to eat, going into 40 recipes in depth, as well as telling some colourful stories from his childhood.※Think of it as volume 1,§ he says. ※You can＊t fit everything into just one book. It＊s the start of an  of food.§ Like its author, the book is equally devoted to haute cuisine and street food.※I＊m not a snob,§ he says. ※I didn＊t grow up on fine dining and I love everything. I love going to the shittiest part of the neighbourhood for a barbecue and then going to a three Michelin-star restaurant where you have to wear a tie. It＊s about experience. That＊s how you increase your knowledge of who you are.§Not that he doesn＊t have his favourites. Copenhagen and Paris are his top cities to eat out in. He＊s been fed by  at  in Modena, and . But in the UK he goes straight to east London for earthier delights.※As soon as I touch down in London I go directly to  in Whitechapel, straight off the plane. They know where to sit me, what to bring me. I get a shish kebab, lamb vindaloo, vegetable curries, two types of naan. It＊s a staple.§ He＊s good friends with  of  in Highbury, and  at . ※Those places are cathedrals.§Other food presenters have spoken about the inches the job puts on their waistline and what it does to their blood pressure. Is there ever a move from the people around him to make a programme about, say, yoga instead?※You try not to eat the whole meal,§ he says, ※but I don＊t even think I＊m overweight. I know the way I move on stage, and I could do 50 push-ups in a clip. The only thing that makes me feel overweight is when my shirt clings a little bit. But it＊s all about how you feel. You can change the outside, but it doesn＊t change what＊s inside.§Besides, he has important work to do showing his fans how much great food is out there to be discovered. ※I hope I＊m helping to make it happen. People in the music industry you＊d never expect have told me they love the show. And I＊ve had messages from the fans telling me they＊re eating this or that. Motherfuckers from the hood saying, ＆Yo, I made octopus tonight,＊ who would never have tried it. They＊re getting the hype. I don＊t know what I could have done with my life, besides some sort of humanitarian work, that would have been more satisfying,§ he says. ※I＊m very fucking satisfied.§F*ck, That＊s Delicious 																																											"
"This anthology series of Philip K Dick adaptations begins, in noirish fashion, in a bleak near-future in which telepaths (※Teeps§) coexist, uneasily, with Normals (non-mind readers). Starring Richard Madden and Holliday Grainger, the staging is a twist on the mismatched buddy-cop formula. It＊s satisfyingly crepuscular and, for a story written in the early 50s, has plenty to say about the information-saturated yet disconnected present.  Last year, Kevin Herbert collected the crown for his amazing West Wing, a recycled marvel you＊d be perfectly happy to live in. In among this year＊s finalists for eco and budget sheds is Chris Law and Julie Ann Marchant＊s Tiny House, built for ?1,000. With features including a downstairs toilet and fitted kitchen, it＊s become a full-time home for the couple. Other candidates include a Woodland Stargazer, and a replica Hobbit hole.  Choosing the prospect of an interesting case over financial remuneration, Strike goes to work on behalf of Leonora Quine, wife of gruesomely murdered novelist Owen. Trouble is, plenty of people had a motive to kill a writer who made enemies freely. Meantime, Robin chafes at the constraints of her PA role and faces a dilemma. Hugely entertaining, it＊s a series which pulls off the neat trick of recalling whodunits from the Agatha Christie era without seeming dated. Laura Poitras＊s documentary chronicles the peculiar life of Julian Assange from the news of rape allegations against him, and through the first six years of his ongoing self-imposed sequestration in Ecuador＊s embassy in London. Poitras, who also made Citizenfour about whistleblower Edward Snowden, appears to start out admiring Assange, but finds this increasingly difficult as the story unfurls and its subject grows ever more vainglorious. From its inception in 1947, the Magnum photo agency developed an intimate relationship with the cinema. Robert Capa was involved with Ingrid Bergman, enabling him access to Hollywood studios for some candid if stylised snaps. Eve Arnold presented portraits of Marilyn Monroe which presented a more thoughtful, vulnerable alternative to her bombshell image, while more recently, we＊ve seen Paolo Pellegrin＊s portraits of Kate Winslet. Reality TV might be over-reliant on extreme circumstances and wacky characters, but this is too far the other way. Five pairs of ordinary Brits with no ballroom dancing experience 每 three couples, a woman and her gay friend, and a mother and son 每 embark on intensive training. Can they acquire enough expertise to hold their own on the competitive ※Sunday circuit§? Everyone＊s nice, but with nothing at stake there＊s no reason to care.  Preventing the Earth＊s average temperature from increasing by two degrees was the purpose of the Paris Agreement in 2016. This jumbo-sized doc itemises the domino rally of disasters that would follow such a change, exploring a future USA ravaged by unchecked wildfires, persistent flooding and mega-hurricanes. The cut-price CG effects are a bit Sharknado but that might even encourage a certain sceptic-in-chief to tune in. Another charming and engrossing excursion into Andersonland. This one＊s set in a fictitious coastal town, in 1965, where 12-year-olds Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) are in love and run away together. Their actions create a crisis for troubled adults, including Suzy＊s unhappy parents (Bill Murray, Frances McDormand), lonely police chief Bruce Willis, scout leader Ed Norton and icy social services officer Tilda Swinton. Sean Connery returns as James Bond after a 12-year break. It also goes back to the earlier, crunchier style (※I hope this is a return to more gratuitous sex and violence,§ as Alec McCowen＊s Q puts it), before the special effects ran riot. The Thunderball-ish plot has 007 tackling an impressively villainous trio: Max von Sydow＊s Blofeld, Klaus Maria Brandauer＊s Max Largo and Barbara Carrera＊s voluptuous Fatima Blush. The late Jerry Lewis proved himself a fine actor in Scorsese＊s dark satirical comedy. Lewis is legendary TV showman Jerry Langford, who is stalked by Robert De Niro＊s weirdo superfan Rupert Pupkin. Abetted by the equally disturbed Masha (Sandra Bernhard), Pupkin, a wannabe king of standup, hatches a plot to kidnap Langford to win TV primetime.

"Harry Dean Stanton, the veteran American actor who ballasted generations of independent and cult films, has died aged 91. The subject of the late critic Roger Ebert＊s ※Stanton Walsh Rule§ 每 ※No movie featuring either  or M Emmet Walsh in a supporting role can be altogether bad§ 每 Stanton was famed for his ability to project his hangdog, laconic charm into minor roles, which ensured he worked continuously for over six decades. Directors who cast him include David Lynch, Sam Peckinpah, Ridley Scott, Alex Cox and Wim Wenders, but he was never nominated for an Oscar or any of the other principal acting awards.Stanton was born in 1926 in rural Kentucky, the son of a tobacco farmer. After serving as a navy cook in the Pacific theatre during the second world war, he studied journalism at college before dropping out to attend acting classes at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1949. Stanton had ambitions to be a writer and a musician as well as an actor, but, , he ※surrendered§ to acting. In the ensuing two decades, Stanton secured a string of tiny roles in TV shows and low-budget films, including The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, Gunsmoke and Johnny Ringo. One of his  in the 1967 Paul Newman vehicle, Cool Hand Luke, in which he performed the gospel song Just a Closer Walk with Thee.However, Stanton＊s weatherbeaten visage and anti-heroic mien suited 70s cinema and the rise of the Hollywood new wave, and his roles slowly increased in significance. He played one of the American soldiers in Kelly＊s Heroes, the 1970 war comedy, a gay hitchhiker in Two Lane Blacktop, Monte Hellman＊s existential road movie from 1971, and outlaw Homer Van Meter in the John Milius-directed Dillinger in 1973. More cult roles followed: in Hellman＊s Cockfighter, the little-liked 1975 Farewell My Lovely remake, and alongside Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson in the much-derided Missouri Breaks.Other than a walk-on role in The Godfather Part II, commercially successful films seemed to elude Stanton: that would change after Ridley Scott cast him as a crew-member of the Nostromo in the sci-fi shocker Alien, overcoming Stanton＊s own reluctance to take on a ※monster movie§. Stanton went on to find work with a new generation of film-makers in the 1980s: the key role of Brain in John Carpenter＊s Escape From New York, a speed-sniffing car repossessor in Alex Cox＊s Repo Man and 每 rather weirdly 每 as Molly Ringwald＊s hopeless dad in teen romance .The same period also saw what will no doubt be regarded as Stanton＊s most emblematic role: the  in Wim Wenders＊ Palme d＊Or winning Paris, Texas. Having got drunk with writer Sam Shepard, Stanton found himself offered the lead in the film 每 his first 每 at the age of 58.  he was ※finally playing the part I wanted to play. If I never did another film after this, I＊d be happy§.However, well-received as it was,  did not transform Stanton into a leading man; rather it increased the popularity and budget of the films he was asked to take supporting roles in. He played St Paul in Martin Scorsese＊s The Last Temptation of Christ, Toot Toot in Stephen King adaptation The Green Mile, and began a profitable relationship with Lynch, appearing in Wild at Heart, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and, latterly, The Straight Story and Inland Empire.Stanton continued to work steadily through the 1990s and 2000s, averaging two or three films a year 每 of variable quality, it has to be admitted. These ranged from the Adam Sandler comedy Anger Management to the Sally Potter-directed drama The Man Who Cried, to the Kelsey Grammer submarine comedy Down Periscope. He had a long-running role in the HBO series Big Love, playing ※prophet§ Roman Grant. As he moved into his mid-80s, his output began to slow; however, he did have brief appearances in superhero movie The Avengers and Martin McDonagh＊s Seven Psychopaths, and recapped his role as trailer park owner Carl Rodd for the new  TV series.Stanton was phlegmatic about his place in the film industry eco-system, telling the Observer: ※In the end, you end up accepting everything in your life 每 suffering, horror, love, loss, hate 每 all of it. It＊s all a movie anyway.§Despite a number of relationships, notably with Rebecca DeMornay in the early 1980s, Stanton never married, and is not known to have had any children.

" am not, I will admit, a breakfast TV sort of person. The primary colours and endless jollity traditionally favoured by television in the early hours have always been, to my mind, an affront to all that is decent and proper. I＊ll keep the TV off, the curtains drawn and have Radio 4 on at a low murmur, if it＊s all the same to you. But, because it＊s good to mix things up (and because I was told to), over the last few weeks I have braved the carnival of controversy that is  (). I have done this every morning through a mist of tears, while biting down on a stick to muffle the screaming.In this case, it＊s not the dazzling sets, the zany ※light§ segments and the relentlessly upbeat weather reports that have pushed me over the edge; in fact, all these things have brought merciful relief. The source of my agony is , a man so ghastly that  with a note saying: ※Keep him. He＊s yours.§It seems the more he is bounced from one show to another, the more bullying and cartoonishly grotesque he becomes. Now he has taken to yelling at guests as they try in vain to finish a sentence. On his quieter days, they will get roughly eight seconds to make their point before he starts hurling insults and barking like an elephant seal. Witness him huffing and frothing at the  recently, and reducing what should have been a thoughtful and nuanced debate about white privilege and racism to: ※How dare you insult ME? ME ME ME ME ME ME MEEEEEE!§ A few days later, GMB＊s bookers saw fit to invite suited corpse Jacob Rees-Mogg to air , perhaps because he＊s the only man in Britain able to make Morgan look vaguely reasonable.Morgan＊s early-morning scenery chewing is, of course, great news for GMB＊s bosses, who have seen a spike in ratings and round-the-clock bonfires on social media, many of them stoked by Morgan himself who, in the reversal of the vampire trope, starts to smoke and shrivel whenever the light moves off him. It＊s not such good news for A&E departments that, one assumes, have experienced a surge in Morgan-induced aneurysms. It＊s a wonder that his co-presenter Susanna Reid wasn＊t carted off long ago, driven to distraction by his incessant foghorn condescension. Still, Reid＊s expression is currently less ※surrendered wife§ than ※woman biding her time§.

There was a time when breakfast telly, with its bland yet jolly presenters, terrible sweaters and sunshiney motifs, was about easing viewers into the day.

"dysseus took only marginally longer than  to return to his homeland. It＊s been a mighty wait, with many advance sightings of the recognisable 62-year-old conductor whose popularity, against all usual laws of gravity and the deadly effects of hype, continues to rise. In the past few months he＊s given concerts, workshops and an , as well as timely verbal contributions on everything from the campaign for a new London concert hall to the state of , Liverpool FC.Rattle＊s  appointment was announced in March 2015 but rumoured long before. His title of music director, rather than chief conductor, implies a hands-on involvement his predecessors have neither sought nor been offered. After 16 years with the Berlin Philharmonic 每 which he leaves next summer 每 Rattle is at last in harness. It＊s his third major post, having started his journey of reformation and revolution with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, where he stayed for 18 years.Thursday was the real First Night. Loud applause greeted Rattle at the start, a standing ovation at the end. He encouraged no gimmicks. A modest bow, a broad grin, then he raised his baton and got on with it. An all-British programme of quixotic and trepidatious variety launched  an 11-day festival of 31 events celebrating his arrival. These include concerts programmed by composers to whom he has a particular loyalty.Each was represented on Thursday evening＊s curtain-raiser. Thirty-six-year-old ＊s short, dancing, air-filled Fanfare, a world premiere, cast a brief spotlight on each area of the orchestra. From it she will make a longer piece for the LSO, for performance next spring. ＊s four-movement  was premiered by Rattle in 1997, when he was still with the CBSO. This fiery work hisses and glows with molten energy, unfurling into a pounding, techno-inspired finale.＊s 25-minute Violin Concerto, played with fearless virtuosity by , spins, lurches and ricochets through restless moods, now in partnership with the orchestra, now with soloists who step forward to play. The work ends in a poetic recession, orchestral colours erased one by one, leaving a single, plucked note on the solo violin. That delicacy of sound is also prominent in Oliver Knussen＊s short, sensuous  (1979), in which the combinations of celesta, harp, guitar and chimes leave their mark.The last work in this all-British evening was the first written: Elgar＊s Enigma Variations. Starting with expansive leisure, Rattle here seemed to challenge the players to stretch their capacities in this familiar score (less easy to judge in the contemporary works). He has spoken of the tendency of British orchestras to play absolutely on the beat, with little of the rhythmic flexibility of, say, his Berlin musicians. Accordingly, the LSO leader  was visibly cajoling his violin section towards a more fluid and agile sound, to which they responded, whether in the spiky detail of Variation II, the ripeness of the fifth or the hushed, silvered opening of ※Nimrod§. This was a rigorous, uplifting kick-off for the LSO＊s Rattle years, with all to play for.A big week, too, for the Royal Opera, which has replaced John Copley＊s staging of Puccini＊s  after 43 years with a fresh one by , with Stewart Laing (designer), Mimi Jordan Sherin (lighting) and Sarah Fahie (movement). To escape their curtain call with cheers and no boos is an achievement. Judiciously retaining a period setting, they have slightly updated the 1830s Paris of Murger＊s  (the opera＊s source) to a mid-century ※railway age§ look. Women wear tartans, hooped skirts and bonnets. Men in long frock coats and top hats might have stepped out of an early volume of Proust.Conducted by , with a good cast, limpid, hushed strings and urgently pointed woodwind and brass, all is secure musically. First-night nerves will vanish. The Australian soprano  has a lovely mix of desperation and tenderness as Mimi, with an attractive warmth in the upper voice. American tenor , radiant vocally but also a capable actor, is the life force of the evening, his Rodolfo vivid and credible. The star Polish baritone  sings Marcello with classy intensity. (Mimi later in the run) is bright-voiced and so outrageous as Musetta you want to smack her, especially when she whips off her silk knickers at dinner.A detailed appraisal of the music, this once, must yield to an account of the new staging. Jones and Laing follow the work＊s dramatic trajectory scrupulously: from the sparse attic home of the young bohemians, via a spectacular Saint-Germain on Christmas Eve and a chilling . As a piece of stagecraft, it is coherent, streamlined and thoughtful, honouring Puccini＊s masterpiece in all its detail. How it will change and mature, whether over a decade or four, is part of the fascination.In the grand second act we are whisked into the glass-and-iron  of old Paris 每 that world of enclosed streets which later obsessed Walter Benjamin in his epic . Mimi＊s death, for all its visual stylisation, was overwhelming. Her friends stand back in a line, outsiders to this terrible intimacy. Musetta tidily pulls a blanket over the dead Mimi. Rodolfo can＊t bear it, pulls it off, grabs her in his arms, sobbing. All too imaginably true.One ingredient of the old staging remains. The bass  has sung the cameo role of Beno?t 91 times since 1993. He will give 22 more performances this season. This sort of company spirit and continuity cannot be manufactured.

"or the past nine months,  has been living in his mother-in-law＊s house, a grand, many-storeyed residence in downtown Manhattan to which he and his wife, the novelist , decamped after . This was the place in Brooklyn where they had been living since 2011, and almost a year after the fire 每 the result of a defective chimney and which, Amis says, broke out on New Year＊s Eve like ※the last kick in the arse of 2016§ 每 he still looks like a man who has suffered a shock. In the gloomy drawing room, he moves stiffly around nursing a back injury, ruefully enumerating the ways in which old houses can ruin one＊s life. The property was salvageable, but the couple＊s peace of mind was not, and they will soon be moving to a new home, an apartment in a skyscraper in downtown Brooklyn. ※It＊s on the 20th floor, so you are up there in the clouds,§ he says. ※It＊s going to be very heady, certainly to begin with.§It seems strangely fitting that, two years shy of his 70th birthday, Amis should be plunged into a modern setting, although the very idea of Amis at 70 is somehow absurd. For many, he is frozen in time as he appeared in the late 1980s and early 1990s: young, rangy, belligerent, chucking out neologisms with a verve readers found either delightful or altogether too much. Amis as elder statesman doesn＊t compute, not for any lack of gravitas on his part 每 he is, as always, erudite, thoughtful, disinclined to hold back for the sake of an easier life 每 but rather for some quality in his writing, a youthful elasticity. He is still very much Amis, slyly commenting on the absurdities of his adopted American home, but this afternoon his energy seems tempered by a frailty of form. If an occasional note of hesitation creeps in, it serves as a reminder that, for even the boldest among us, age is a process of becoming steadily less sure., a collection of essays and reportage, goes back to pieces written by Amis for  while at Talk magazine 每 notably,  in 2001 每 to , to recent . (※Above all, perhaps,§ he writes of Trump, ※his antennae are very sensitive to weakness... Trump can sense when an entity is no longer strong enough or lithe enough to evade predation... The question is, can he do it with American democracy?§) The most compelling among these are his pieces about writers, which suffer from none of the anxiety that can mar his engagements with pop culture. There is a crushingly good piece on Nabokov＊s decline, but also wonderful essays on the genius of Larkin and JG Ballard, as well as loving tributes to Iris Murdoch, Saul Bellow, Christopher Hitchens and Amis＊s father, Kingsley. ※We are all of us held together by words,§ Amis writes in reference to his father＊s last days, ※and when words go, nothing much remains.§ Perhaps inadvertently, the book has an elegiac tone. In a piece about tennis, Amis wryly notes his own encroaching decrepitude: ※The ball comes over the net like a strange surprise; you just stand there and watch until, with a senescent spasm, you bustle off to meet it.§ (The use of ※bustle§, here, a quintessential Amis touch.)If America is, for Amis, an easier place in which to grow old 每 fewer critics, for a start 每 he retains an expectation that he and his wife will move home one day. ※I miss the English,§ he says. ※I miss Londoners. I miss the wit. Americans, they＊re very, well, de Tocqueville saw this coming in about 1850 每 he said, it＊s a marvellous thing, American democracy, but don＊t they know how it＊s going to end up? It＊s going to be so mushy that no one will dare say anything for fear of offending someone else. That＊s why Americans aren＊t as witty as Brits, because humour is about giving a little bit of offence. It＊s an assertion of intellectual superiority. Americans are just as friendly and tolerant as Londoners, but they flinch from mocking someone＊s background or education.§This is not an inhibition from which Amis suffers. His most recent spat in the British press was over a piece he , in which he mocked Corbyn＊s lack of education, among other things, and which was considered by some to be unforgivably snobbish, a case of picking an unfair fight with the poor man who wants to be prime minister. ※Two E grades at A-level,§ Amis says now. ※That＊s it. He certainly has no autodidact streak. I mean, is he a reader? Hitler＊s education ended when he was 17. Stalin was an incredible reader. Balzac, Dickens. I＊m going back to all that now, because it＊s the anniversary of the Russian Revolution. Lenin has been very much downgraded and Stalin has been, not rehabilitated for his crimes, but for what he was before the revolution. Not just published, but an anthologised poet. A lifelong autodidact. And capable of political poetry in a way Lenin wasn＊t. But it does matter if leaders have some sort of backing.§Corbyn＊s success in the election has done nothing to raise Amis＊s opinion of him. The Labour leader is, he says, ※more cautious now, but still grimly ideological, and an admirer of tyrants 每 Ch芍vez, Putin§, the beneficiary of a deranged electorate that, for different reasons, gave rise to Brexit and Trump. ※It＊s a sort of restless desire for change,§ Amis says. ※And also 每 this sounds like a conspiracy theory 每 but the internet, for all its incredible benefits, has had a stupefying effect, I think. It was always a Pandora＊s box 每 its part in terrorism is malign. And it has made it difficult for people to concentrate.§There＊s a good line in one of the essays in the book: ※We grant that hatred is a stimulant but it shouldn＊t become an intoxicant.§ Amis is referring to the sharpness of some of his friend Christopher Hitchens＊s work, but it might stand as a description of the internet. ※Isn＊t it amazing, the wells of hatred? It＊s a shameful confession, in a way, but I＊ve never looked at social media.§ Momentarily, his confidence retreats. ※I was amazed when Salman did Twitter,§ he says of another friend, Rushdie. But he did quit. Yes, Amis says, but ※why take it on in the first place?§It may be harder, in some ways, to be American than British 每 the terms of success in the US are narrower, with a greater emphasis on individual responsibility, so that, Amis says, there is ※no honourable withdrawal§ 每 but it is undoubtedly an easier place in which to be a successful novelist. Being the writer son of a famous novelist father was always going to play both ways for Amis, although he maintains that most of his early novels, from The Rachel Papers onwards, were written in relative darkness. By the time he wrote  in 1984, and  a few years later, literary novelists had been co-opted into celebrity culture. These were Amis＊s reputation-making novels in comparison with which, and with a certain sadistic delight, reviewers judged later books to fall short. (, published in 2012, got a tough time, not least for the ridiculous name of its antihero, but this was nothing compared with  of 2003＊s , which Fischer likened to ※your favourite uncle being caught in a school playground, masturbating§; Amis responded, ※He＊s a wretch.§)Among his British critics, Amis excites a peculiarly angry commentary, partly on matters of substance and partly for reasons of style. No matter how many times he insists he grew up in shabby bohemia, he is earmarked as posh, or at the very least grand (he pronounces Darth Vader to rhyme with Prada), and whether real or a pose, his louche indifference to criticism only adds oil to the fire. When he moved to America, it was speculated with some glee that he was fleeing the press, which Amis is adamant wasn＊t the case.Nonetheless, he is happy to have escaped some elements of British literary culture. American novelists, Amis says, are less feverish about pecking order than the British. ※They＊re more realistic about it. Berryman, when Robert Frost died, said, ＆It＊s scary. Who＊s number one?＊ Very unsentimental. At least status anxiety is overt here. And I think writers have a better time from the press here than in England. My historical explanation is that Americans wondered what sort of country they were living in, a new, young country, and subliminally saw that writers would play a part in telling them; not just a collection of Italians, Germans, Jews, but a real nation. In England, they don＊t want to be told what they are. They＊re quite clear on that, thank you very much.§He gives it a moment＊s further reflection. ※And they think writers are just pretentious egomaniacs.§***If the election of Trump struck Amis with greater force than the disaster of Brexit, it is because, it seemed to him, it came more out of the blue. On election night in the US, he and his wife anticipated a win for Hillary Clinton, and were ※rubbing our hands together over the size of the landslide§. The next day, he was put in mind of something Sebastian Haffner, the German historian, said after Hitler came in. ※He said the feeling was not of horrror; it was of complete unreality. You go out into the street and people look different. The commerce, the cars; it all looks staged for your benefit. Completely make-believe. A sick-making feeling. And here it is. And what the fuck did they expect?§We have walked down the street to a Japanese restaurant where periodically, over lunch, Amis will stand up to relieve his back. (He has not, historically, suffered from back pain 每 ※the perks of being short§ 每 but he hurt it recently.) Looking back over the decades, he thinks Trump has suffered a horrific mental decline. ※If you look at , using words like ＆chagrin＊ correctly. And with a certain amount of ironic reserve.§ There is, Amis says, a question of ※dementia§.The Hitler analogy, meanwhile, is one that strikes many, even on the left, as unhelpfully inflationary. Actually, Amis says, it is wrong for several reasons, not least because, ※It＊s always been Mussolini and not Hitler. Mussolini was completely ridiculous. He claimed he knew every language on Earth.§But also, he says, because Trump＊s ambitions don＊t quite fit the totalitarian mould. ※The slogan, which I used to see on bridges in Italy in the 1970s, was Mussolini Is Always Right. Trump is that crazy, and that boastful, and that deluded. Even Mussolini had a few good years before he lost it. But people like Hitler and Stalin wanted to change human nature. That＊s what totalitarianism is. Trump doesn＊t want to make a total claim on you as an individual. He wants to stay in power, and that＊s about it.§The question of impeachment, Amis suspects, is wishful thinking, though he suggests that a particular order of world event could push Trump over the edge. ※I am, in a way, thirsty for an international crisis,§ he says, perhaps unaware of how this comes across. ※Not with North Korea; he＊s itching to do that and thinks he＊ll get the Nobel peace prize if he wipes it off the map. But I want something really ticklish, like the hostage crisis after the Iranian revolution, where he＊s not going to reach for the button, but people are going to see him under stress.§But, Amis adds, we shouldn＊t underestimate Trump＊s talent for stoking up unrest. ※Trump is trying to stock up an army of neo-Nazis who, if he gets ousted before his term is over, are going to think it＊s a coup. They＊ve all got huge guns; that＊s a sword to hold over the situation. That＊s what they＊re scared of.§ This neo-Nazi element, which predates Trump, but which he has been very shrewd at exploiting, is something Amis sees as the last stand against Obama by the kind of American who ※before 2008 could look out of his trailer and say, I may not be much, but I＊m better than a black man. Then they see Obama, so handsome and witty and learned, and think, can I really say that?§ Racism exists in Britain, of course, but he considers it a category difference. ※It＊s not to do with hatred from the gut.§He wishes Hitchens could have been around to wrestle with Trump. In the new book, their friendship is very touchingly portrayed 每 they knocked around in their 20s when they worked on the New Statesman and part of the reason Amis decided to move to America was to be closer to Hitchens during the final days of his cancer, ※hoping for a last spell with him. It was unclear how long he would live.§ But Hitchens died in 2011, much sooner than Amis expected. He was in denial all through his friend＊s last days. At the hospital in Houston, Amis spoke on the phone to , who brought up something caustic Amis had written in a draft essay about Hitchens, a critique of his terrible puns. ※And Ian said, you＊re not wrong about that, but does he need that when he＊s dying? And I didn＊t say it, but I wanted to say, but he＊s not dying!§But he was. ※It＊s an awful thing, a death watch,§ Amis says. ※Especially now, because you have the machines telling you progress. The blood pressure falls. Human nature being what it is, you actually want it to end.§ He wasn＊t there for the very end. It was Hitchens＊s son, Alexander, who informed Amis of his father＊s now-famous last words: ※Capitalism. Downfall!§ Amis smiles. ※Still the street fighter socialist.§It sounds sentimental, he supposes, but after his friend＊s death, Amis felt he had to take on some of his qualities. ※He had a greater love of life than me. He really enjoyed everything, so much. I quite like life, but I＊m not as crazy about it as he was. It somehow formulated itself in me that, now he was dead, it was my job to love life as much as he did. It hasn＊t gone away.§And in this age of political polarisation, one thing Amis is adamant about is the absurdity of losing old friends over politics. They disagreed violently about the Iraq war, which Hitchens supported. ※He just hated Saddam, from the left, not the right. Although this drove him into some weird positions, like supporting Bush/Cheney in the re-election year, 2004. He would＊ve given anything for a good outcome. But you＊re not going to get a good outcome if you invade a country like Iraq, expecting people to welcome you for invading them.§ But to have lost Hitchens as a friend over this would have been ※self-righteous§. He saw it happen to his father, who ※lost a lot of friends over Vietnam. And great friends, like Al Alvarez and Karl Miller. You can＊t afford that. As Hitch said, you can＊t make old friends.§Amis is currently writing an autobiographical novel 每 ※that I insist is a novel§ 每 featuring not only Hitch, but Larkin and Bellow, as well as Amis＊s late stepmother, the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, who married his father in 1965, when Amis was a teenager. The marriage lasted until 1983, but Amis and Howard were in touch, and close, he says, until the end of her life in 2014, though he retains some vestiges of guilt about an earlier phase of their relationship. ※One of the perks of being the son of a writer is not that you come automatically equipped to write novels, it＊s that you don＊t bother much about praise. Kingsley never bothered much about praise and dispraise. My stepmother did care. She was desperate for praise, and very much wanted it from me.§But for a while in the 1980s, after the marriage ended, Amis entirely refused to engage with her work. ※I stopped reading her out of spite, because it was so disruptive when she dumped my father. His three children had to rotate to look after him.§Recently, Amis read the Cazalet books, Howard＊s family saga that spans five volumes, and was ※incredibly impressed, particularly by the first two. Really marvellous, flashes of genius. In this autobiographical novel that I＊m writing, I＊m going to do some wish fulfilment. The Cazalet novels were a fantastic achievement, and in this novel I＊m going to tell her.§After the demise of his first marriage to Antonia Phillips in 1993 每 he left her for Fonseca 每 his own family life has been low in drama. One gets the feeling that Fonseca insulates him from a lot of the bothers of daily life; he admits she handled everything after the fire. He has been a domestic creature for a long time, even when his children were young, preferring to work in the house, as Kingsley did, rather than go to an office. His eldest three, two boys and a girl, are now well into adulthood, but his two youngest daughters, to his delight, aren＊t quite off his hands yet; 21-year-old Fernanda is a student at NYU and Clio, the youngest, is at 18 still living at home. Amis is hoping against hope she won＊t opt for college in California.Being a father has, he says, been vitally important to his life as a novelist. ※I know a novelist who made the decision, very much thwarting his wife, not to have children, because he thought it would interrupt. And I thought: you＊re so wrong. It＊s a huge part of life that you＊re excluding yourself from.§ Of course, he adds, ※quite a few other writers who＊ve never had children 每 Philip Roth; Don DeLillo 每 write beautifully about children. But I was very broody. I did want kids. I was completely fed up with being single as well. I wanted to see a fresh face. Having children can＊t help but open you out.§What kind of parent was he when his kids were young? Not a shouter, he says. ※Anger isn＊t my thing.§ When his boys were misbehaving, their mother, his first wife, would tell him to go in and lay down the law, but on the rare occasions he did, it didn＊t go well. ※Both my wives were capable of having a good shriek, but I can＊t do it. It bores me, which is infuriating to my wife.§How does he express anger?※I have a mannerism that drives my wife crazy.§ He looks away and does a mild tut. But, he says, ※I do feel that, along with a harmonious marriage, having a good relationship with your children is the main bit.§He and Isabel have, he says, been ※lucky in all sorts of ways§. They can almost laugh about the fire now, at least at Fonseca＊s initial reaction. She was in Florida when it happened, and when Amis called to tell her the house was on fire and there were six fire engines outside, she said, in her derangement, ※When the firemen come, could you ask them to take off their boots before they go upstairs?§Now in their temporary residence, work continues. Even here, Amis notices he has mellowed somewhat. He used to be a terrible purist about the terms on which readers should engage with his work. ※Dryden said in the 17th century that the purpose of art is to delight and instruct, with the emphasis on delight. Because instruction is not always delightful, but delight is always instructive. And it has stood up very well.§ He concedes it has taken him a while to get there. ※I was snooty at some radio event where people read your novel 每 it was London Fields 每 and then you take questions from them, and a lady said, ＆I＊m sorry, but I struggled with it.＊ And I said, ＆Why?＊ And she said, ＆I didn＊t care about the characters.＊ And I said, ＆Well, I＊m afraid you should really not be thinking about that. You should be thinking about what the author＊s trying to do.＊ But I think she was dead right.§ It is the truth before which all matters of style melt away. ※You have to give a shit.§ The Rub Of Time, by Martin Amis, is published next month by Jonathan Cape at ?20.

"t is a long time since I have seen a tasselled lampshade on stage. Or an antimacassar. But then it is a long time since I have heard such gradually uncoiling, slowly deepening dialogue as that in David Storey＊s .When Storey , he was celebrated for work based on his own early days: fictional and theatrical evocations of northern working-class life. His novel  (1960), filmed by Lindsay Anderson, drew on his career as a professional rugby league player: he was as much athlete as aesthete, and once hit the ＊s Michael Billington after an adverse review. , set in a retirement bungalow near the Yorkshire coast in 1989, has an intense naturalism that suggests personal experience: Storey bought his own parents such a bungalow. It might have been written to prove that lack of dramatic action does not mean dramatic inertia. This is an evening when a tiny movement, such as a light and unexpected kiss, can send a gasp and a sigh through the audience.A couple marking their diamond wedding anniversary are visited by their three children. He is an ex-miner, out of school at 11 and down the pit till he was 65; she was timid and is now tense. The adult kids are used to the elderly grumping at each other and to their competitive ailments: his pneumoconiosis versus her hysterectomy. They are unprepared for the sadness of the secrets they let out. This is a drama of disappointment spliced with hope. Is the constant bickering really just banter, the sniping only display? Or is it the gruff amiability that is the pretence, covering up an abyss of grief? It is Storey＊s skill to keep these questions up in the air.In Alice Hamilton＊s finely calibrated production all the performances are lively. But the evening belongs to the jubilee couple. To Ian Gelder, habitually jaunty but invaded by bewilderment and sudden sadness. His cheeks slowly drop towards his slippers. And to Sue Wallace as his wife, her snappy terseness 每 ※There＊s feelings and feelings§ 每 undermined by anxiety. There is no explosion, but continual upset.

"ive years ago, this acerbic singer-songwriter was transparently a major talent when, aged just 18, his debut album topped the UK chart and went on to go double-platinum. Inevitably, he was . World domination appeared assured.Half a decade down the line, Jake Bugg＊s career trajectory is noticeably less spectacular. His record sales have slumped; there have been missteps. His third album, , saw him unwisely dabbling in dance beats and even hip-hop. His latest, the country-hued , was recorded in Nashville with veteran studio musicians who backed Elvis and Wilson Pickett.Such creative restlessness would usually be laudable, but in Bugg＊s case the effect seems to have been to shear off the urgency and the rough edges that initially made him such a compelling artist. His new record is largely dreary, and nearly all of the highlights of this solo acoustic benefit show for  and Grenfell Tower fire victims are drawn from his first two albums.Has he done too much, too young? There must be a downside to a life spent making an album a year and living on the road since his late teens. Where once he was all vim and brio, Bugg now cuts a world-weary figure, sighing his way through country-tinged songs of regret and reminiscence as if he has entered his twilight years at 23.It＊s a marked shift for a tyro performer who emerged snarling feral tales of a misspent youth watching drug dealings on a Nottingham council estate. Taciturn and black-clad beneath a tousled mop, Bugg remains fresh-faced but croons the languid, sparse Hearts That Strain and Southern Rain with the bruised fatalism of a grizzled resident of the Grand Ole Opry, or like  reincarnated.It＊s soporific and more than a little boring, and the night only comes alive when Bugg fires into the sprung rhythms and dextrous lexical gymnastics of his brilliant early roustabouts Trouble Town and . They embody the urgency the evening has lacked. An obvious message is reinforced by a provocative set-closing first-album triumvirate of Two Fingers, Broken and the 21st-century skiffle of Lightning Bolt. If Jake Bugg is to find his way, he needs to sound hungry again.																																											"

"wedish journalist Stieg Larsson planned 10 instalments in his . The three novels he did write, beginning with , had energy, spectacular violence and superb plotting. Larsson＊s weird, sometimes clunky prose style was forgiven because there was real chemistry 每 empathy, even 每 between his two stars, the computer hacker Lisbeth Salander and the journalist Mikael Blomkvist. The series made a fortune and, as no good deed goes unpunished, it has been turned into a franchise.is the second instalment to be written by the Swedish biographer and novelist , translated by George Goulding.  (2015) sold very well and this new outing has been published with full blockbuster treatment.Damaged, dysfunctional heroines are common in thrillers, as are layers of gendered trauma, but Larsson＊s Salander was a fabulous, surprising character 每 a feminist superhero, an Amazonian queen, a Lolita who fought back. Obsessive and antisocial, she was forged in the crucible of violence she experienced as a child. She took the kind of revenge on rapists and paedophiles that most only fantasise about, taking on powerful, corrupt men with righteous but lawless violence. With Blomkvist, she was the glamorous half of one of the oddest but most effective and entertaining crime fiction couples. Blomkvist, the old-school social justice warrior with a penchant for underdogs and a hatred of social hypocrisy, provided a perfect foil. is billed as the revelation of the appalling things done to Salander when she was a child, but the narrative meanders between a bewildering array of storylines that never come together. The story starts with Salander in prison for unconvincing reasons. When she does wander on to the page, she gets beaten up or does stuff on her computer, but remains ghostly and uninhabited. The author commits the cardinal thriller sin of telling rather than showing what she does: there are long, mansplaining sections about genetics and social research that made me pray to Elmore Leonard, the god of economical thriller writing, who famously instructed that writers should ※try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip§.Lagercrantz has turned Larsson＊s eccentric and feral feminism into a simple inversion. This time there are two female arch-villains after Salander. One is an ageing, ailing Mad Scientist with a doctor＊s bag of syringes and lethal poisons who is determined that nothing of her social eugenics programme will be revealed. The other is a ludicrously cartoonish gang boss who ends up hospitalised by Salander＊s quick fists and is in cahoots with a pair of nasty brothers 每 billed as Islamists 每 who have hired her to persecute their jailed and silent sister. There are identity-switching twins who make the antics of Sebastian and Viola in  seem pedestrian, and many references to Salander＊s evil twin.The reader is repeatedly told that Salander and Blomkvist are driven by a desire for justice, but because we spend so little time in close-up with the book＊s heroine, it is not convincing. There is a sluggishness to the plotting and much of the tension relies on orchestrated interruptions and delays, which irritate. Lagercrantz has all the elements of the Millennium series at his disposal, but the adrenaline is missing: it feels as if one has gone to a restaurant, ordered a rare steak and been served soggy fish fingers instead.

"he movie star charisma of  has led him, deservedly, to the top of the A-list but has also steered him away from showcasing his considerable and transformative talents as an actor. As his fame has increased, there have been crumbs left along the way but too often he＊s been stuck in substandard action territory, an understandable business decision but a regrettable one nonetheless.Last year, his adaptation of Fences allowed him to show just how equipped he still is, and would have made a far more deserving best actor winner than a sleepwalking Casey Affleck in Manchester by the Sea. He＊s probably hoping for better luck this season with yet another meaty role in unusually quick succession. But his latest, the poorly titled Roman J. Israel, Esq., might prove a little too unusual for the Academy and for audiences too.Israel is a socially awkward, idealistic lawyer who is relegated to an office-based position within the law firm he co-partners, his eccentricities and rigid adherence to the law better suited to a role behind the scenes. But when tragedy strikes his partner, Israel is left without a job and forced into a world that＊s unfamiliar and unwelcoming. He finds himself tapped for a job by the slick head of a larger firm (Colin Farrell) and, through an unlikely set of circumstances, Israel＊s life rapidly begins to change.Like writer/director Dan Gilroy＊s previous film Nightcrawler, Roman J. Israel, Esq. works best as the character study of a man who never usually gets to take centre stage. Initially, Israel seems like the sort of semi-autistic legal genius that we＊ve come to expect on the small screen, a brilliant renegade wowing courtrooms with his unlikely charm on some repetitive CBS procedural. But there＊s far more here to chew on and Gilroy isn＊t interested in cliche or providing us with a series of satisfying gotcha moments.Israel is a by-the-book, true believer in the importance of following the letter of the law. When he＊s finally allowed inside a courtroom, he＊s dismayed that in practice those around him aren＊t quite as steadfast, and there＊s a lingering poignancy as he gradually loses touch with his core values in a bid to survive in the real world. He＊s a relic of sorts, a civil rights activist from another era who believes that the system is in need of widespread reform and in another package, those he meets might be impressed with this. But he＊s an odd proposition, uncomfortably dressed and almost always wearing headphones, a savant lacking in social skills.It＊s not a role we＊re used to seeing Washington play, his hugely underrated performance as a haunted soldier in The Manchurian Candidate probably coming the closest, but he＊s never been better. There＊s nothing overly mannered or visibly rehearsed about his work here, he just disappears into the character, a difficult task for a star as familiar as Washington. He＊s so captivating to watch that at times I wished he was headlining a 10-part Netflix series, his daily trials proving endlessly fascinating.Given the career renaissance he＊s recently enjoyed, it＊s a somewhat regressive role for Farrell, playing the sort of hotshot he was stuck with in his early Hollywood career and there＊s a subplot with Carmen Ejogo as an activist that doesn＊t always ring true, but even in the film＊s less successful moments, I admired the loose shagginess of it all. It＊s structured in a way that will frustrate many viewers expecting an involving Nightcrawler-esque thriller, but it＊s the sort of patiently plotted mid-budget drama that rarely gets made nowadays. Gilroy＊s script is alive with detail and deft characterization, and it＊s become a cliche to compare a film like this to the cinema of the 70s, but Gilroy almost forces the comparison with a score and soundtrack that, like Israel, live in the past.It＊s a haunting and timeless American tragedy that feels ever prescient given the current administration＊s foggy understanding of morality. It might prove to be a tough sell thanks to an awkward title and a strange plot trajectory, but Roman J. Israel, Esq. is a richly rewarding drama blessed with one of the best, most lived-in performances of the year. 																																											"
"ape culture is a notoriously divisive concept. What does it mean, after all, to say that we live in a culture pervaded by rape? The suggestion can seem abstract and out of sync with many people＊s experiences. However, an incident currently unfolding in the Irish media can help us to think about rape culture in concrete terms.Last Friday, one of Ireland＊s best-known radio broadcasters, prominent rugby pundit George Hook, held forth on the topic of rape. Discussing a case in which a woman went to a hotel room with a man for consensual sex and was raped by a second man, Hook condemned the rapist, but also said: ※Why does a girl who just meets a fella in a bar go back to a hotel room? She＊s only just barely met him. She has no idea of his health conditions; she has no idea who he is; she has no idea of what dangers he might pose. But modern day social activity means that she goes back with him, then is surprised when somebody else comes into the room and rapes her.§. There＊s a word.※Is there no blame now to the person who puts themselves in danger?§ Hook pondered on his primetime radio show, unintentionally answering his own question. He concluded that the ※real issues nowadays§ is ※the personal responsibility that young girls are taking for their own safety§.So remember, ※girls§, if a man rapes you, it is not a real issue. The real issue is that you might visit a hotel room to have consensual casual sex for pleasure. (Interestingly, Hook＊s radio show is sponsored by Clayton Hotels, whose parent company Dalata, to its credit, has .)There＊s since been , likely urged by Hook＊s higher-ups. If I sound sceptical, that＊s because it＊s not the first time Hook has treated the Irish nation to his learned opinions on consent and culpability.In 2015, discussing a case in which a woman＊s boyfriend repeatedly raped her while she was unconscious as a result of heavy medication, Hook asked if there wasn＊t  because the two shared a bed. There was outcry and a walk-back then too.Hook＊s autobiography offers further evidence of his commitment to women＊s ※personal responsibility§ in the face of sexual coercion. He describes a date with a women who wears eyeshadow and drinks G&Ts 每 proof, apparently, of her loose status. He writes: ※I＊m thinking I＊ve struck gold. It＊s the : fill your boots! I＊m afraid to have a gin and tonic myself because I can＊t hold my drink. So I order tonic water while pushing the .§There are some contradictory lessons here. Girls 每 ensure you don＊t get drunk and engage in casual sex; boys 每 soberly ply her with gin until you can fill your boots.Many of the Irish folks reading this will shrug, ※Yeah, yeah, if you tune in to Hooky, you shouldn＊t be surprised if this is what you get.§ And I know from Hook＊s Twitter mentions that many people agree that a woman who gets drunk and has a consensual one-night stand is blameworthy if she is subsequently raped. Paradoxically, these are also people who scoff at the concept of .When Hook says that a woman who consents to sex with a man she has recently met shouldn＊t be surprised to be raped by another, what he＊s really telling us is that  is not surprised. He＊s telling us about his cultural expectations.These cultural expectations are proof of rape culture.If you agree with Hook that it is women＊s personal responsibility to be on constant guard against rapists yet refuse to concede that we live in a culture in which rape is a constant threat, you must be experiencing some intense cognitive dissonance. If you share the opinion that women who do not take what you consider to be sufficient precautions against rape are partly to blame for being attacked yet do not agree that we live in a society that blames victims for their attackers＊ crimes, your mental gymnastics must be Olympian.Another prevalent thread of Irish commentary is to declare Hook victimised and silenced for simply speaking his mind. But who 每 in this situation 每 is really being silenced?, features no female presenters during the peak radio hours of 7am to 7pm. None. As research from the National Women＊s Council of Ireland shows, this problem is endemic to the Irish airwaves. Women are silenced; yet when they try to talk back, they are accused of silencing others. This is what the literary critic Barbara Johnson calls muteness envy. She writes: ※It is not that the victim always gets to speak 每 far from it 每 but that the most highly valued speaker gets to claim victimhood.§When men＊s voices dominate public discourse, they also define cultural narratives of rape. Rape culture exists in relation to patriarchal power, whereby the voices of women or feminised male victims are considered less authoritative than the voices of male rapists and apologists.Rape culture is the tall grass in which an attacker can hide; it obfuscates and exculpates where apportioning blame should be simple; ; it makes perpetrators more likely to rape. We can＊t always be in a hotel room to pull an attacker off a victim, but we can be ready to protest when the Hooks of the world tell survivors that rape is partly their fault. We can be not only surprised by rape culture, but outraged by it. Emer O＊Toole is an academic and author																																											"
"he epilogue of the final Harry Potter book, which sees the boy wizard packing off his son from King＊s Cross for his first school year at Hogwarts, takes place on 1 September 2017. The real-life station was duly packed two weeks ago with fans eager to mark the date. But that wasn＊t the only big moment for Potter fans this month: more than a decade since it was first published online, the identity of the mysterious author behind the notoriously awful fanfiction My Immortal was finally revealed. It was an unveiling deemed so momentous by the internet that the Daily Dot compared it to ※§.After a decade of fervent internet sleuthing failed to uncover her identity, young adult fiction (YA) author Rose Christo identified herself as Tara Gillespie AKA XXXbloodyrists666XXX, the author of what is widely deemed the worst fanfic ever written (). Christo did so in part to debunk the theory that Lani Sarem, who recently made headlines when she was accused of faking sales to make the New York Times bestseller list, was the author. An interview with Buzzfeed, in which Christo revealed a USB drive that contained original documents proving her claim, also announced that the whole saga is set to be told in her forthcoming memoir Under the Same Stars, which will cover how and why she wrote My Immortal alongside her search for her brother in New York＊s foster-care system. I＊m not surprised that XXXbloodyrists666XX AKA Gillespie AKA Christo appears to have real writing chops. ; I even performed a live reading of it at the Brighton Fringe festival. It＊s far more than a rehash of JK Rowling 每 for a start, the main character isn＊t Harry, it＊s an American exchange student called Ebony. She is sometimes also Enoby, because among its foibles, My Immortal is so peppered with typos that reading it is like interpreting ancient runes. It begins with lines I know by heart:A good chunk of the 20,000 words that follow are dedicated to describing Ebony＊s amazing array of Hot Topic outfits (※I was wearing a blak plaid miniskirt with hot pink fishnetz, a sexy blak MCR corset and blak stiletto boots with pink pentagroms on dem. My earrings were blake Satanist sins and my raven hair was all around me to my mid-black.§) And the writing style is quite distinct from Rowling＊s: ※＆What the fuck r u doing!＊ I shooted arngrily. Snoop laughed meanly. He polled down his pants. I gasped 每 there was a Dork Mark on his you-know-wut! 11!§Most of the characters have had their names changed, for ostensibly goth reasons: Harry is Vampire Potter, Ron is Diablo, Hermione is Bloody Mary Smith. Something resembling a plot occurs when Ebony＊s relationship with villain Draco Malfoy is put in terrible jeopardy when she is sent back in time to seduce a young Voldemort. At one point,  even turns up, from another realm entirely.Even though My Immortal is seriously, often knowingly, funny, I always found it hard to believe that it was just clumsy teenage angst, devoid of any earnest effort by a real-life Ebony. Christo now says she wrote it as a ※troll fic§, a deliberate parody 每 but as we have also learned with her reveal, she wrote it at the age of 15 or 16. So perhaps it was a bit of both: the author of My Immortal was a real teen girl trying her hand at writing, with japes.But whether Christo intended Ebony as a joke or not, her jet-tressed heroine is a classic example of a ※Mary Sue§: the idealised, annoyingly perfect cypher for the author that turns up all too often in fanfiction. It＊s often meant as a term of derision 每 but My Immortal shows how, even at their most indulgent, Mary Sue stories can be engrossing and heartfelt. Because under the black leather, it is just a story about a teenage girl who wants to dress up in amazing clothes and date Draco Malfoy. It thereby captures a more painful and poignant truth about being a regular teenager than Rowling＊s original series achieves with many, many more words 每 however accurately spelled.Which might, I hope, incline you to look past the ridicule and read My Immortal .

The artist, wearing a dark Giorgio  suit, white shirt and tie, leans back in a chair, one bare foot on the floor, the other up on a chair. The combination of the suit and the bare feet is typical of the way Basquiat defined his own image; always with an unconventional bent.I＊ve obsessed over his style when standing in front of , a 1983 work from a series where the images relate to stereotypes of African Americans in the entertainment business.

These artists carved out instantly recognisable uniforms: clothes that symbolise the same singular point of view as their greatest works, usually with the sense of complete ease that is the holy grail of true style.Basquiat＊s wardrobe was distinctive, whether he was in mismatched blazer and trousers with striped shirt and clashing tie, or patterned shirt with a leather jacket pushed off his shoulders. He was perhaps most recognisable in his paint-splattered Armani suits. ※I loved the fact that he chose to wear Armani. And loved even more that he painted in my suits,§ Giorgio Armani says. ※I design clothes to be worn, for people to live in, and he certainly did!§In many ways, this bricolage approach to clothing is akin to the way he created his art. ※His work was a mysterious combination of elements 每 text and colour, historical reference, abstraction and figurative techniques,§ Armani says. ※In his life, he also mashed up creative activities 每 he was a graffiti artist, a musician, an actor, a maker of great artworks.

"Sir Peter Hall, who has died aged 86, was the single most influential figure in modern British theatre. As a director of plays, especially Shakespeare, Pinter and Beckett, he was very fine. In the opera house he brought real musical understanding to the work of Mozart and Verdi. But it was through his creation of the  in the early 1960s and his stewardship of the  from 1973 to 1988 that he affirmed his passionate faith in subsidised institutions. If we now take their existence for granted, it is largely because of the pioneering battles waged by Hall and his visionary enthusiasm.As a man, he was extremely complicated. To many in the theatre, he was seen as a consummate politician: someone who hid his manipulative skills behind a mask of public affability. And he certainly possessed the politician＊s ability to get things done. But he also had the vulnerability of the artist and, on many occasions, I glimpsed the melancholia and wounded spirit that lay beneath the geniality. Far from being a consummate Machiavel, he always struck me as a candid, generous and open person who made little attempt to conceal either his euphoria or his disappointment.Hall＊s life and career were inevitably shaped by his upbringing. He was born in Bury St Edmunds, the only child of a Suffolk stationmaster, Reg Hall, and his wife, Grace (nee Pamment). Not only was Hall the sole recipient of his parents＊ love: they encouraged his precocious interest in music and drama. Hall was the classic, working-class scholarship boy who was, in his own words, ※avid for art, hungry for culture§. Free railway travel, because of his father＊s job, enabled him to get to London to see the legendary -Ralph Richardson seasons at the New Theatre at the end of the second world war. A visit to Stratford-upon-Avon in 1946, where he was enchanted by the 21-year-old ＊s production of Love＊s Labour＊s Lost, made him decide he would like to run the Shakespeare Memorial theatre.He studied at the Perse school in Cambridge, where he played Hamlet, became head boy and learned the art of public speaking, and then did statutory national service. This was a deeply formative experience since in 1949 he was posted to Germany, where he saw first-hand evidence of the civic impact of arts subsidy. Having got a scholarship to read English at St Catharine＊s College, Cambridge, Hall fell under the spell of two influential dons. From FR Leavis he learned the importance of textual rigour and the moral power of art. From , who ruled the , he absorbed the primacy of Shakespearean verse-speaking over scenic decoration.Cambridge provided Hall with a perfect springboard into the profession. His undergraduate production of Pirandello＊s Henry IV was given a two-week London run at the  in 1953. Alec Clunes, who ran the Arts, liked what he saw, and when Clunes passed on the directorship to John Fernald he recommended that Hall be retained as a ?7-a-week assistant. Hall quickly made his name with productions of Lorca＊s Blood Wedding and Gide＊s The Immoralist. After Fernald＊s departure, Hall was offered the directorship of the Arts and so, at 24, found himself running his own London theatre.The decisive moment, both for Hall＊s career and the future of British theatre, came in 1955 with the arrival on his desk of a play by an unknown Paris-based Irish dramatist: Waiting for Godot by . Hall passionately believed in the play without immediately understanding that it was a turning point in modern drama. Although it was initially greeted with derision (※a remarkable piece of twaddle§: ), the Sunday notices by Harold Hobson in the Sunday Times and  in the Observer turned the play into a box office hit and a national talking point. Hall＊s directorial reputation was made and, with reason, since it was he who had interpreted Beckett＊s characters as tramps rather than clowns and who had realised the text＊s austere music.Hall was suddenly British theatre＊s golden boy, in demand in the West End, Stratford, New York and at Sadler＊s Wells. His 1956 production of Colette＊s Gigi introduced him to a Hollywood star in Leslie Caron. They soon married and had two children.At the time, largely because of the Caron connection, Hall was even offered a job by MGM. But, having put down his marker at Stratford with productions of Love＊s Labour＊s Lost, Cymbeline and Twelfth Night, he was suddenly asked to succeed Glen Byam Shaw as the theatre＊s director, a bold appointment that was to have huge repercussions for British theatre as a whole.Hall inherited a thriving, star-oriented Shakespeare festival: the 1959 season alone boasted Olivier, Charles Laughton, Paul Robeson and Edith Evans. But Hall＊s vision was of a permanent company playing in Stratford and London and bringing its Shakespearean skills to both epic and experimental new work. His plans met entrenched opposition from London commercial managers, reactionary actors and funding bodies more concerned with embryonic plans for a .However, Hall＊s chairman Sir Fordham Flower, and loyal colleagues including Brook and John Barton, supported his dream. The result was the formal creation in 1961 of the , which finally proved that permanence was possible in the freelance whirligig of British theatre.If there was a moment when the RSC achieved artistic maturity, it was with the 1963 production of , Barton＊s three-part conflation of the Henry VI plays and Richard III. During rehearsals Hall suffered a severe breakdown in health and was ordered prolonged rest. Instead, on the advice of Brook and Peggy Ashcroft, he went back to work and the result was a defining company triumph: a production that discovered in these ancient history plays a metaphor for modern statecraft and power-politics.But even that achievement was superseded in 1965 by Hall＊s staging of ＊s The Homecoming and Shakespeare＊s Hamlet, with David Warner; he brought the same ruthless textual clarity and emotional precision to both. When you consider that in the same year he directed Arnold Schoenberg＊s opera Moses und Aron at Covent Garden it looks like his annus mirabilis.Running the RSC, however, was a Sisyphean struggle, particularly since the pussy-footing Arts Council viewed its London base and expansive tendencies with disfavour. In 1968 an exhausted Hall handed over the reins to  in order to become a freelance director of plays, operas and films: the result was a hectic period in which Hall＊s constant success at Glyndebourne with Mozart and Monteverdi was not matched by the quality of his work in the movie studios. But Hall was, by temperament, a man who loved running things. And, after an abortive agreement to join  as joint director of the Royal Opera House, Hall responded positively to discreet overtures to succeed Olivier as director of the National Theatre.Even Hall, however, found that his formidable political skills were tested when news of his appointment leaked out in 1972. Olivier felt that he had been shoddily treated by the board, and Hall faced a concerted guerrilla attack from discontented members of the ancien r谷gime, hostility in the press and uncertainty about the opening date of the new National. The golden boy of the 60s had become the theatrical carpetbagger of the 70s. He weathered the storm; but, as his diaries, published in 1983, reveal, his early years at the National were marked by tension, turmoil and despair.Hall＊s great achievement, however, was to make the new National Theatre a living reality. He did this by adroitly colonising the building stage by stage, so that the  opened in March 1976, followed by the  six months later, and the Cottesloe (now ) in spring 1977, the year in which he was knighted.Hall ensured from the start that the National＊s obligations to world drama were matched by its commitment to living writers. He quickly got young dramatists such as ,  and  on board as well as more established talents such as ,  and . In retrospect, this was Hall＊s great legacy at the National: a belief that it should not simply acknowledge the past but also, at the risk of controversy and debate, warmly embrace the present.The struggle to get the show on the road inevitably affected Hall＊s own work as a director. There were also criticisms of his acceptance of outside work (not least a Ring cycle at Bayreuth and his hosting of the television arts show Aquarius). There were even allegations, which he steadfastly denied, that he was abusing his position as director of the National by earning substantial amounts from West End and Broadway transfers of his work.But, after a shaky start, Hall did some outstanding productions at the National: best of all, Shaffer＊s Amadeus (1979), Tony Harrison＊s version of The Oresteia (1981), and a matchless Antony and Cleopatra (1987) with a witty, mercurial  and a ruggedly ruined .When he left in 1988, Hall handed over the National to : one of his achievements, as he showed at the RSC, was his shrewd, unselfish choice of successors. But, for a man used to running large institutions, it was difficult to return to freelance life. His answer was to create the Peter Hall Company, which enjoyed spasmodic, and not always happy, relationships with a number of co-producers, including Duncan Weldon, Bill Kenwright and the Old Vic. The abrupt termination in 1997 of an Old Vic season, which included first-rate revivals of Waste, The Seagull and Waiting for Godot, was a bitter disappointment to Hall.But in 2003 he established a vibrant annual summer season at the  which ran for 10 years and yielded excellent productions of Shakespeare, Pinter, Coward and Rattigan as well as helping to re-establish Shaw＊s reputation with a brilliant revival of  (2007) starring Michelle Dockery and .Hall was also a driving force behind the creation of the  modelled on its Elizabethan namesake. Even if Hall＊s dream of pursuing an eclectic repertory with a semi-permanent company never materialised and he resigned shortly after his opening , he returned there several times and in 2010 directed a magical production of  with Dench as Titania.Late in 2010, to mark his 80th birthday, Hall returned to the National to direct a quietly autumnal  starring his daughter, , as Viola. While it did not possess the comic vigour of Hall＊s earlier productions, it was profoundly moving.Hall＊s last major production was of the two parts of Shakespeare＊s , in 2011: it was a fitting swansong to an extraordinary career. After that, his health declined; he developed dementia and moved to a care home for the theatrical community, Denville Hall, in north-west London, and later to accommodation at Charterhouse within the City of London.In his earlier years, Hall＊s private life had been a turbulent one. After the break-up of his marriage to Caron in 1965, he was married in the same year to his onetime RSC assistant, Jacqueline Taylor. The marriage was dissolved in 1981, and the following year he married the opera singer Maria Ewing. When the couple divorced in 1990, he found with Nicki Frei the stability and domestic happiness that had long eluded him.Hall had six children from his four marriages and created his own theatrical dynasty: his son Edward is a distinguished director in charge of  and his daughter Rebecca has become a film star.But Hall＊s ultimate legacy is his public one. If we still have a thriving Royal Shakespeare Company, a globally envied National Theatre and a network of subsidised regional playhouses, it is in large part because of his vision, tenacity and militant campaigning fervour. Deeply wounded by the , he once ruefully said to me: ※I feel I have done the state some service.§ And it was his ability to harness his formidable private ambition to the traditional notion of public duty that made him such a powerful force for good in the British theatre.He is survived by Nicki, his children, Christopher, Jennifer, Edward, Lucy, Rebecca and Emma, and nine grandchildren.

Sometimes topped with a jaunty quiff, or dressed in a lurid harlequin costume as if to scream ※Youth!§: these goliaths are sprouting across Britain, lumbering into its towns and cities like container ships run aground.This urban disease of mean-minded, pile-em-high cells is not a new government prison programme, but actually purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA). It is one of the most lucrative sectors in the UK property industry, currently worth ?46bn, with developments completed this year expected to total a record ?4.7bn. But is it time to stop this tide of tacky tombstones? Are they spoiling our built environment?Hardly a year goes by without a slab of PBSA featuring on the  for the ugliest UK building. This year it was the turn of a , designed by Cooley Architects for Unite, the biggest student housing provider in the country.

Its cladding system failed fire safety tests in July, following the Grenfell Tower disaster 每 as if it wasn＊t obvious enough before that wrapping towers in foil-coated plastic wasn＊t a great idea. The cladding on five more of Unite＊s brand new blocks have also failed the test, sending alarm bells through the sector and revealing construction quality to be far from top of the industry＊s priorities. Standards of student accommodation caught the headlines in 2013, when a block of flats for University College London on Caledonian Road , for placing a 350-bedroom hulk behind the retained brick facade of a Victorian warehouse, without even caring that the windows lined up. The idea that students should be expected to look out on to a brick wall, less than a metre away, isn＊t unique, though: they have the same pleasure at the . The developers can get away with such things, because student housing doesn＊t officially classify as housing. It falls into the murky category of ※sui generis§ (Latin for ※of its own kind§). As it falls outside a specific use class, it doesn＊t have to adhere to the . Local authorities differ in the their approaches, but student accommodation is usually either treated as a hotel (C1) or residential institution (C2), the same category as care homes, hospitals and boarding schools. Due to their limited occupation, these building types are immune from many of the codes that govern residential dwellings 每 from space standards to daylight and acoustics. At the same time, crucially, the developer is exempt from providing any contribution towards affordable housing.So it＊s not hard to see why PBSA is such a booming industry: you can build tiny bedrooms with minuscule windows, use cheaper materials, and cram many more units on to a site, with no need to provide parking or private amenity space. Unlike housing, the flats don＊t have to be individually marketed, there＊s a ready supply of students, and you only have to please the customer for three or four years. Local authorities are usually only too happy to encourage the march of new student flats, given that they take pressure off existing local housing stock, while universities are over the moon, as it means they don＊t have to spend precious capital budgets on building their own accommodation. It is the perfect storm, with no party to stand in the way.The growth is also being fuelled by some of the most powerful backers in the world. Since the slowdown in the high-end residential market, the kinds of overseas investors who were originally pumping their hot cash into the super-prime apartment bubble are now funnelling it . It may seem unlikely, but these grim tankers of rabbit-hutch digs are where the sovereign wealth funds and ultra high-net-worth individuals are now choosing to park their capital.According to Savills, the proportion of international investment flowing into the market has almost , with ?1.2bn coming from Singapore alone in 2016.

Across the country, sites that were originally allocated for housing are finding themselves sprouting blocks of student flats, as they represent a more ※viable§ proposition for a quick return. In central London alone, there are around 4,000 student rooms under construction, with over 8,000 more with consent or in planning.An annual conference in Covent Garden , but journalists are denied entry because, said a spokesman, ※people can talk more openly without the glaring eyes of the press§.

"urking behind the crowd-pleasing veneer of 1970s set drama Battle of the Sexes is a depressing reminder that unequal pay remains a shamefully unresolved problem 44 years later. In the film, 29-year-old Billie Jean King is frustrated by the disparity between what male and female tennis players are paid, and it＊s her annoyance at this injustice that acts as a propelling force for the plot.King (Emma Stone) has just been triumphant at the 1972 US Open, but before she can finish celebrating, she finds out that the United States Lawn Tennis Association has announced a new prize fund, offering eight times less for women. In an act of rebellion alongside manager Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman), she launches the Women＊s  Association, designed to provide a more equal working environment for female tennis players. It irks the old boys of the sport, including misogynist ex-pro Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell), who challenges her to the ultimate test, a match between the pair that will, in his mind, prove that women are lesser players than men.There＊s an unavoidable comparison to recent US politics to be made here. On one side we have the hard working, respectable woman, and on the other, there＊s a chauvinist, showboating man, eager to prove masculine superiority. It certainly adds an extra spikiness to the rivalry, our all-too-fresh experience of watching an attention-seeking buffoon try to bring a woman down on live television helping us root for King even more. Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire screenwriter Simon Beaufoy gives us more than enough reasons to gasp throughout with everyday sexism casually falling out of almost every male character＊s mouth (※It＊s not your fault, it＊s biology!§).It＊s a film filled with necessary reminders that will bait an insecure male audience (there＊s a reason the film has before even being released) but there＊s not quite enough within the mechanics of a plot to justify a two-hour running time. It＊s a decent tennis movie, solidly told and choreographed, but it＊s in the film＊s depiction of a same-sex romance between King and her hairdresser, played beautifully by Andrea Riseborough, where things truly comes alive. At the time, King was married to a man, but when the pair meet, there＊s an instant connection. There＊s a clandestine electricity that radiates from their interactions, and also a genuine tenderness that develops in a time when such a relationship was almost impossible, at least within the public eye. It＊s a finely handled dynamic, and Beaufoy deserves kudos for avoiding the easy route of lazily turning King＊s husband Larry (no, not that one), into a villain. We feel for him as much as we do for the woozily romantic women.It comes from Little Miss Sunshine directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Deyton, who bring a similar rousing vibe to the proceedings (the less said about their twee misstep Ruby Sparks the better). Stone is strong in a steely, unshowy role and it＊s rewarding to see her outside of her comfort zone; Carell is an annoying and cartoonish presence but, well, so was Riggs. The attempts to flesh out his character via scenes at home, struggling with a gambling addiction and a disintegrating marriage with his beleaguered wife, don＊t quite cut as deep as they could, but it does give a small opportunity to Elisabeth Shue, who nabs one of the film＊s many nifty supporting roles. There＊s also room for Fred Armisen as a redundant vitamin doctor, Bill Pullman as an odious sexist tennis champ, and the aforementioned Silverman as King＊s commanding manager. It＊s a shame, though, that the other women who make up King＊s tennis tour are so interchangeable, not one possessing any particularly notable characteristic other than ※plays tennis§.Like any great sports film, everything is leading towards one final confrontation and after a slightly saggy middle section, things do pick up just in time. It＊s an ending that will soar for many, a vital victory for those who need a lift, and a lingering shot of a ※Billie Jean for president§ poster acts as a reminder that the film was made with a contemporary grand slam in mind that didn＊t quite take place as planned.

" is his own worst enemy. Ever since he bottomed out America＊s collective stomach in 2004 with the fast food expos谷 Super Size Me, Spurlock＊s films have gradually nudged his public persona into the foreground at the expense of the trenchant reportage that originally endeared him to us. Though his vanity hit its nadir with the male-grooming documentary Mansome 〞 a feature-length ode to Spurlock＊s trademark handlebar ＆stache 〞 that narcissism still threatens to eclipse the subject at hand. And by revisiting his breakout pet topic of cheap food＊s steep costs, Spurlock＊s made his own self-absorption more abundantly present than ever.Super Size Me tracked one man＊s masochistic descent into a hell made of Big Macs, his suffering illustrating what would have otherwise been left as talking points. His latest endeavor, awkwardly titled Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!, places Spurlock at the center of the film once again. But this time, his journey doesn＊t send him to the ends of experience. Instead, he goes on a smug odyssey of know-it-all-ism that yields a scant few factoids we didn＊t already learn from his first film.Worse still, the entire concept revolves around Spurlock＊s own celebrity. The film begins with a montage of talking-head news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio all reporting on the same odd story, that that rascally documentarian Spurlock＊s latest stunt is an all-new chicken-to-go restaurant in town. Lines are out the door on opening day, as curious parties wait to figure out what his game is. With this brief snippet of footage, he undermines his own point in two minutes flat: Spurlock wants to figure out if a regular guy with no idea what he＊s doing can start his own chicken shack, but the deck is already stacked in his favor. He＊s not some quixotic yokel on an underdog mission to bring poultry to the people, he＊s an extremely rich and well-connected figure who can afford to spend his money and time with elite branding consultants in plush office buildings. The fat cats of Big Chicken are surely guilty of an unfair advantage, but Spurlock＊s not entirely innocent of the same sin.Mostly, however, we＊re reminded that fast food is still bad for you and that big-box eateries are very crafty about convincing consumers otherwise. The first forty minutes play like an intro-level media analysis class, as a crack team of marketing experts walk Spurlock through the subtle deceptions of fast-food advertising. Bandying about meaningless buzzwords like ※artisan§ and ※responsibly sourced§ has gotten the likes of Subway and Wendy＊s pretty far, and Spurlock takes to the hucksterism like a fish in dirty water. As he and his image-management sidekicks survey their newly purchased domain, one points to a wall that would be perfect for ※propaganda.§ Nothing especially mind-blowing here, save the minor detail that using dark food dye to make imitation grill marks is an age-old trade secret.The film only has the impact Spurlock clearly wants it to when it＊s pulling back the curtain on patently evil practices from the seemingly nefarious folks at Purdue and Tyson. Among the more shocking revelations mined from industry nitty-gritty: that the terms ※all natural§ and ※free-range§ mean bupkus, that it is absurdly easy to con the USDA into certifying subpar meat (mostly because they don＊t give a damn), and most affecting of all, that chicken manufacturers are systematically suffocating the farmers that purchase and raise the birds. To his credit, Spurlock simply and thoroughly explains the infuriating ※tournament system§ through which Big Chicken chooses which farmers will receive which fowl. The complicated process essentially enables distributors to keep the salt-of-the-earth types spreading the feed in permanent debt, a no-win situation one farmer compares to indentured servitude. If the fearsome totality of Purdue＊s power wasn＊t clear, a disgruntled ex-employee only speaks out when his face and voice are disguised, for the sake of his personal well-being.Spurlock＊s urge to follow up on Super Size Me didn＊t have to be a bad idea. He makes fleeting mention of a sea change in fast food culture early on in the film, sharply observing that fast-casual burger chains like Five Guys and Shake Shack have got the old guard running scared and rethinking their business models. (After twelve years away from McDonald＊s, Spurlock is shocked to find upon his return that the place now resembles an actual restaurant, and not a building-sized children＊s toy.) Unfortunately, he blows right past it so that he can get back to the Morgan Spurlock show. That＊s what this is all really about, not chicken but ego. When Spurlock gets wind of a menacing email from a head-honcho chicken executive, he puts on a face like he＊s disturbed that such a large corporation has targeted little old him. But Spurlock＊s a much worse actor than documentarian. We can tell he loves it.																																											"
"bout two thirds of the way through my self-guided walking tour of  Contemporary, I ran into an artist friend. Conversations at Australia＊s largest and now dominant art fair usually begin with asking what you＊ve seen. For my friend, the question was different: was there too much beauty? Her concern was that, being somewhat philosophically opposed to the naked commercial forces at work at such events, and yet ambivalently accepting of them as the reality of selling and buying art, she was worried about being seduced by all the loveliness.Sydney Contemporary 2017 arrives after its one-time rival,  afterscuppering a 10-year co-management deal with Art Fairs Australia, the company behind Sydney Contemporary, and after three key galleries pulled out of MAF at the last minute to sign up to a (rumoured) exclusivity deal with Sydney. Although MAF will return as a reduced, tent-scaled event next year, Sydney Contemporary has meanwhile gone annual. Australia＊s limited gallery scene and its cash-strapped gallerists will now need to prioritise.With that kind of commercial imperative at least partially informing the thinking behind the choice of work on display at Sydney Contemporary, there is much loveliness to be experienced. Seduction is on offer, and if you can＊t afford it now,  Money a loan agency that lends people cash to buy art  has a stall set up near the entrance. For cash-strapped art critics and other window-shoppers, there＊s plenty to see.The highlights of Sydney Contemporary are split between those works by artists you might already know but go beyond expectation, or artists unknown to you who have a mature and interesting practice. Of the first category, Catherine O＊Donnell＊s Urban Perspective installation at  is a delight. O＊Donnell draws on paper with charcoal, producing exact, delicate 1:1 scale drawings of the windows, doors and screens of suburban fibro houses. The  Continuous Life and Death at the Now of Eternity, at Martin Browne Contemporary, represents the state-of the-art in digital media: a real-time animation that responds to the seasons outside the exhibition halls through a series of algorithms that produce a gorgeous field of seasonal flowers floating over a gold leaf background. This suggests both the super-flat aesthetics of traditional Japanese landscapes art, and the way those aesthetics can inform experiences of space in digital media. An artist who I had never heard of, the , has three landscape paintings at the Nanda/Hobbs stall. Where much realist Australian landscape painting deals with the merely picturesque, Blowers＊s trio of images deal with nature in collapse, riverbanks and waterways tangled with dying trees.The art fair experience is sweetened by the opportunity to see projects created specifically for the event, works that are perhaps not saleable in themselves, but are by artists represented by commercial galleries at the fair, or might soon be. Curated by the Museum of Contemporary Art＊s Rachel Kent and Megan Robson,  Contemporary places around the fair some arresting works, including Shoufay Derz＊s elegant copper sheet pierced by quills, Richard Lewer＊s series of personal declarations (※Sometimes I just want to punch people§) and Hayden Fowler＊s Together Again, in which the artist lives with a dingo in a cage that was also reminiscent of my own living room, complete with a dog asleep on the couch while a disoriented man scrabbles around on the floor looking for the remote control.There is always a sense of self-consciousness to these kinds of projects, not so much on the part of the artists who are simply doing their thing, but for the art fair management who want to be seen promoting non-commercial projects and maybe even widening the scope of what Australia＊s collectors are willing to support. The Indonesian artist Uji Handoko Eko Saputro 每 aka Hahan每 is presenting Speculative Entertainment No. 1 (Sydney Edition), which takes that idea to an extreme. Art fair visitors are invited to buy sections of one of Hahan＊s large paintings for twice the price of their art fair ticket. Once purchased, visitors can then auction off their segment for whatever they can get, speculating on their investment, with Hahan taking a 10% commission. As a gesture toward the market 每 and in effect empowering the artist to directly profit from it 每 it is a neat idea, only compromised by the fact that it＊s a sponsored event.My friend＊s question about the seduction of the market lies at the heart of the art fair experience. We like to entertain the idea that art is special, that it＊s even spiritual in the right circumstances, but to be surrounded by even the most enlightened dealers and collectors, their wares displayed just so, is akin to being like Jesus confronted by the moneylenders in the temple. Sure, we could kick over the tables and drive them out, but why not stick around, have some lovely wine and look at some art?  																																											"
"he new Birmingham Conservatoire is in many ways a reminder of the Brummie resurgence. England＊s second city centre was not long ago  每 a tiny commercial core cut off from its natural space by ring roads and a belt of derelict Victorian properties. However, in recent years it has been revitalised with a futuristic train station, swanky new library and an impressive new civic centre, called, in a statement of intent, Paradise. So sure of its reclaimed place as the heart of the nation, that . Such a stage will be welcomed by Birmingham＊s orchestra, one of the best in Europe. The worry is not about the future of the city, which bursts with elan, but where future musicians will come from.Opening the conservatoire, its principal, Julian Lloyd Webber, , and he hoped to use the new college ※to ensure that the future arts industry is not dominated by the wealthy elite§. He will have to try hard. Those studying music at university are vastly more likely to hail from private schools, or from abroad. In 2016 the Royal Academy of Music, which produced Annie Lennox and Sir?Simon Rattle, took in the . The Royal College of Music took in the sixth-lowest. Almost a quarter of the rest of their students come from abroad: both institutions are  with the highest proportion of international students.Worryingly, music education in the UK seems in decline.

Medical science can make us live to 90. If?you don＊t have music to enjoy, one may ask?what＊s the point of living until 90?It＊s becoming a real question for the have-nots. Music is taught in the majority of schools around the country, but it is skewed towards the rich. Those wishing to study classical music, a grounding that can lead to rock and pop, must often pay for private tuition and own their own instrument, which cuts out those who cannot afford it. Despite?outreach efforts  are from private schools.

Britain has a long history of training great musicians from poor backgrounds (the Italian composer Luciano Berio  was the way it nurtured young musicians). Exclude state school pupils, and future musicians will be drawn from the top. Britain would be poorer for it.																																											"

" is a man ambushed by stories 每 his own and other people＊s. He thinks he has published four books so far this year, though neither he, nor anyone from what turns out to be five publishers, seems sure. No sooner had he sent his latest, a hefty memoir, to press than a stash of family photographs emerged from a cupboard in the US, adding an irresistible twist to his life story, and that of his extensive tribe. The result, he cheerfully announces, is that the proof copy I have just read is already out of date as he has added a new postscript to the finished version.At 71,  is one of the UK＊s best-known children＊s writers, with more than 200 books to his name 每 hence his momentary forgetfulness. Though his stock in trade is comic verse for small children, this year＊s crop includes a non-fiction book about , the second in a series of novels about 10-year-old Malcolm and his bossy Uncle Gobb, a picture book about a very fierce cat, an illustrated version of his 4m-hit YouTube poem, ※Chocolate Cake§, and the memoir, He is also a professor of children＊s literature at Goldsmiths, University of London, and a passionate defender of progressive education in the UK state school system, with  and a strong broadcasting presence as presenter of . Now a prominent supporter of , he stood as a  candidate in the 2004 London assembly election.But it＊s the memoir that has him bouncing up and down in the north London home where he is under doctor＊s orders to take it easy after a minor operation 每 and in particular the 17 photographs that were discovered in a shoebox during a clear-out of the home of an American relative. The most poignant of them shows two well-dressed women and a younger man in a greatcoat walking arm in arm along a Polish street in the 1930s. At the top, in looping handwriting, are the names Mishka, Stella and Bella. Rosen knew that Stella and Bella were his father＊s aunts but it wasn＊t until he had sent the picture to a different branch of the family that the young man＊s identity emerged.※Mishka§ was his father＊s cousin Michael, who had been sent out of Poland on a train aged 17, just as the Nazis were invading. He never heard from his immediate family again and, now in his 90s, was overwhelmed to be confronted by the first photograph he had ever seen of himself with his mother. It was, as Rosen says, ※this incredible picture of happiness§ before the horrors began.※So why did the American family keep this secret?§ he muses, concluding that it must have been due to ※a mixture of shame and guilt that they hadn＊t got them out,§ so that it was only after the older generation died that the faces began tumbling out of their hiding-places.The belated appearance of the pictures might be a mild inconvenience but it was no great surprise to a man who has coasted along on a lifetime of mysteries. The first one emerges at the very start of his memoir, when he and his older brother, Brian, discover a photo of a sibling they never knew they had.※That＊s Alan. He died,§ their father tells the two young boys. ※He coughed to death in your mother＊s arms. It was during the war. They didn＊t have any medicines. He was a lovely boy.§ Alan was never mentioned again by either of his parents. ※For a moment I felt ashamed that I had made this discovery,§ writes Rosen.Its repercussions ripple through a memoir that is in part a love letter to his educationalist father. He wonders if his special closeness to ※the old man§ came from the fact that, as the youngest of the three boys 每 ※the one who came after§ [his brother＊s death] 每 he was the replacement child. ※Perhaps I was also a cough waiting to happen.§He was born in a nursing home in north London. His mother, Connie, had been an academically gifted child of the Jewish East End. His father, Harold, had a more cosmopolitan background. Born in the US to a mother who fled her marriage for London taking three of her five children with her, he kept his American nationality while reviling its capitalist values. Both Harold and Connie were prominent members of the Communist Party, who had been part of the Cable Street march against Oswald Mosley＊s fascists. Neither had any time for their origins. So two of Harold＊s more surprising legacies to his youngest son were an army canteen from his days as a second world war conscript to the US army, and the middle name Wayne. In a typically baroque biographical flourish, Rosen explains that he was given the name in honour of Wayne C Booth, who was billeted with Harold at the US army university in Shrivenham, Oxfordshire, and just happened to go on to write a seminal book about the modern novel, .Rosen recalls a family life driven by his parents＊ beliefs, with summer camps in France and one memorable holiday in communist East Germany where his mother suddenly revealed she was fluent in German because of the Yiddish that, unbeknown to her sons, she had spoken as a child. In such a loquacious family, the silences were gaping, setting Rosen off on an early mission to become the family archivist. ※A couple of years ago my brother asked: ＆Why was everything ideological?＊ Ideology wasn＊t just ideology, it could be about coffee or the shape of a bowl,§ he says. ※But a lot of the time it undermined itself, partly because of Brian undermining it, but also because it led to the paradox of questioning everything, including what I＊m questioning.§Brian, Rosen says, was the brainbox of the family, who has gone on to become a marine palaeontologist with a species of coral named after him. Michael bobbed along in his wake, with interests that ranged from butterflies to theatre. His parents were devoted but ※over-involved§ in his education. When he told them at the age of 12 that he liked acting, they sent him halfway across London to join the leading am-dram company, Questors. When he later expressed an interest in biology, they decided he was destined to become a doctor.He dutifully enrolled at Middlesex Hospital medical school, but found that ※sitting in the canteen arguing about the metabolism of the liver§ was not his idea of fun, so came up with the ruse of applying to Oxford University, as it would allow him to change course. He duly transferred to English and spent a happy three years ※acting, writing, directing, doing journalism and the course§. While there, he wrote a play, , which was staged at London＊s Royal Court and published by Faber. Meanwhile, his interest in politics, which had ※petrified around the age of 17§, was revivified by encounters with a new generation of activists including ,  and Tariq Ali.After university, he was fast-tracked as a graduate trainee into the BBC, where he stayed for three years until, in 1972, he was abruptly asked to leave. ※The head of staff training said: ＆We think it would be better if you went freelance.＊ At that moment I thought, wow, what a promotion. It took a bit of time to realise they were sacking me, and it took until 1985 to realise that it was because I was on an MI5 list.§ The truth emerged through an Observer scoop: he had been blacklisted for, among other things, annoying the US embassy by showing film clips of American soldiers being subjected to tests of LSD.After leaving the BBC, he wrote some poems for a schools radio programme his mother was running, and began to assemble a collection about his childhood, not imagining that it would be read by children. His first book of poetry, , was published in 1974 with illustrations by , to whom he feels he owes his publishing career. ※Without him, it would have completely died a death. He＊s a mime artist on the page. He gave the poems a sort of physicality, which matches my performances on the page.§The other great debt of his early career was to the deputy head of a London school who asked him to give a poetry reading. ※I remember holding the book up in front of my face so the kids couldn＊t see me. Halfway through he said: ＆No, it doesn＊t go like this,＊ and there was this great roar. He grabbed the book off me and didn＊t just read them 每 he danced them. I＊d thought people would read them on the page and spot the quiet ironies, but I realised, my God, this was a performance.§It was, he says, ※an absolute eureka moment. I immediately remembered all those years of performance that I＊d kept separate 每 all that Brechtian stuff of being in and out of role at the same time, and thought I could do that. It＊s only what standup had been doing for 100 years, but it hadn＊t occurred to me that you could do it with poetry.§So began a career that pioneered the two-track life of writing and performance that is now the norm on the children＊s book circuit. Generations of parents and children all over the world can quote from his best-loved book 每 the Smarties prize-winning , which has sold more than 8m copies in 18 languages since it was published in 1989.Then, in 1999, ※everything changed§ when his 18-year-old son Eddie died overnight of meningitis, after arriving home from school complaining of ※feeling groggy§. , published three years later, recounts the experience as part of a series of 72 prose poems that cover much of the same biographical ground as . He stares the tragedy down in an almost unbearable central sequence describing the night of Eddie＊s death and its immediate aftermath. ※He was there. Then he wasn＊t. Though in between, he was blue and stiff and landed with a thud when 999 told me to pull him to the floor.§But tellingly, even in deepest, darkest grief, a schoolboy humour bubbles up, as he recalls his final exchange with his son, which was to ask him for the answer to a riddle.※- Did you get it?- Yes, he said, your bum.- That＊s it, I said.Your bum.Yes, those were his last words.§Two years later he teamed up once more with Blake to relive the experience in picture-book form for . He did it, he explains, because he felt he owed it to his longstanding fans to explain what had happened to Eddie, who had starred in earlier poems 每 notably in his 1983 collection , as a tearaway toddler, putting pepper in the raisins and Shreddies in his ear.Eddie was one of three children and two stepchildren that Rosen had accumulated through his first two marriages. He has since married the radio producer and film-maker Emma-Louise Williams, with whom he has a teenage son and daughter. He＊s mindful of history repeating itself in this new tale of the children ※who came after§ 每 but Eddie, he says, is a mythical figure to them, whose memory is kept alive through the hockey match held every year in his name to raise money for meningitis research. The prize is a goalkeeper＊s glove with half a pint of beer in it. Big, gangly Eddie, he says fondly, was a goalkeeper who loved a pint.Jokes and tribulations are seldom far apart in the work of an author whose books wrap many of the most important experiences of growing up in titles such as  and , and who made it the mission of his role as the fifth children＊s laureate to set up the  ※because funny books often get overlooked when it comes to prizes§. His inaugural Goldsmiths lecture was on humour in children＊s books. In it, he mused on the importance of wee-wee jokes and the existential wisdom of Professor Branestawm taking his housekeeper Mrs Flittersnoop out to see a film about the home life of the brussels sprout, as it appeared to a small boy growing up in a household of ※the only Jewish communists living in Pinner Middlesex in 1950 ＃ On the one hand this was nothing like our family set-up ＃ on the other hand there was something [in it] of all of us. The joke of the cranky, obsessed, life-ignoring professor was in part a joke on us.§His Zola project, simultaneously a book and a radio collaboration with Williams, reveals a more academic side. It covers Zola＊s exile from France after his  intervention in the Dreyfus affair, in which the celebrated novelist accused the French government of antisemitism in its persecution of an army officer charged with spying. ※He was at the height of his career. There was every reason not to get involved, but his passion was also for truth and justice and if you＊re passionate about truth and justice it will turn you on to politics. I＊ve never been called upon to be as brave as he was in taking a stand.§He and Williams are now working on a programme about . Did you know, he enthuses, that the Jesuit priest-poet discovered sprung rhythm from nursery rhymes such as ※One, two, buckle-my-shoe§?Professor, punster, political commentator 每 how does he manage to keep so many balls in the air? His eyes bulge in comic indignation: ※That＊s like saying your spikes in the front are different to the spikes on your back. I＊d say no, I＊m just a hedgehog. They＊re all my spikes.§																																											"
"or their latest show,  invite audiences to a secret address in Hull. A disused office building has been transformed into the headquarters of the Kasang corporation, an imaginary South Korean outfit specialising in smart technologies designed to identify consumer habits and encourage us to spend more. The audience of about 40 are given ※kpads§ so they can shop in the company＊s neon-lit mall and gain K points.

But, in a show played out over several floors of the building and an adjoining multi-storey car park, the game gradually turns nastier and darker. We find ourselves lost in a maze and suddenly transported to a police station where stony-faced officers glare if we try to go the wrong way.First produced in Korea in 2013, One Day, Maybe was inspired by the suppressed 1980  in which 2,000 may have died, many as a result of detention and torture. The uprising is often seen as the turning point in South Korea＊s struggle towards democracy. But what would some of the protestors think about what that democracy has achieved, particularly regarding South Korea＊s role in the global marketplace? Did people die so you and I could have a smart fridge?With dozens of cast members playing Kasang employees and police, the show conjures up the past and the dead who stare back accusingly from photographs. Director Tristan Sharps has always been a brilliant . The scale is always impressive, even if the content is sometimes thin. Some segments trail on too long and the show is so specifically about Korea that it risks losing universality. Although it does make you think what our ancestors might feel about how we use the freedoms they died defending.The piece becomes increasingly emotionally pungent, and Sharps smartly uses juxtapositions: in one segment the muted home life of the past is in tension with the shiny emptiness of the present day. It is often in the silent moments that the show is at its most eloquent.  At  until 1 October.																																											"
"he first time  came to London, she was 18 years old and called herself . She had released only a handful of songs on Soundcloud, but one of them, Bitch I＊m Posh, had taken on a life of its own. It was a lo-fi house track topped off with a funny, laconic, trash-talking vocal 每 the kind of thing hipster playlists and profiles in Vice are made of 每 and now, inevitably, record companies were circling. One of them was interested enough to fly her to Britain.You might have thought Frasqueri would be delighted. It was, after all, only two years since she had run away from an abusive foster home in East Harlem with ※three dollars in my pocket and 75% on my cell phone battery§ for a life on the streets, as she subsequently told the makers of the . But something about it didn＊t sit right. ※I still think: what the fuck was I doing? I couldn＊t understand why people were glorifying me when I wasn＊t that talented; there was no substance or merit in what I was doing. I couldn＊t let myself get away with that. And there was a lot of male dominance surrounding me, wanting to be a fly in my ear and dictate or surmise what I was going to be doing.§So she spurned the record company advances 每 ※To me, the music industry doesn＊t exist,§ she laughs, ※it＊s like the devil, it doesn＊t exist if you don＊t believe in it§ 每 returned to New York and ※started all over again§. She changed her stage name to Princess Nokia, after the brand of cheap ※Obamaphone§ she was eligible for as a low-income earner, and shifted increasingly towards hip-hop.That was five years ago. Today, Frasqueri is sitting in the back of a people carrier, wrapped in a blanket, sunglasses on, clutching a travel pillow. She has been in Britain for a grand total of 14 hours, long enough to play a rapturously received , and now she＊s leaving again. Thanks to the success of her third mixtape 1992, a flatly brilliant collection of tracks gleefully glorifying her own outsider status (it has just been reissued in expanded form by Rough Trade, which, she is keen to point out, is just distributing and promoting her records and has no say in what she does artistically), her schedule is so tight that the only place she has time to do an interview is en route to the airport.At first, I get the feeling that her itinerary might be getting to her. Her reputation as an extremely tough customer has been sealed through umpteen sharp, funny lyrics and remarks about race and gender (※she identifies as a bruja [witch] and a tomboy, a classic New York Boricua shorty, a feminist, a queer woman who isn＊t burdened but empowered by her complexity,§ ) and , when she got offstage at a Cambridge University event and slapped a male audience member who she said had been mouthing ※Show me your tits§ at her, telling the crowd, to cheers: ※That＊s what you do when a white boy disrespects you.§ Today, however, she seems subdued and softly spoken, the opposite of the motormouthed Bronx-accented figure depicted in the Destiny doc. She says she doesn＊t want to say too much: ※I talk a lot in interviews, and I don＊t want to overtalk something, so I＊m being a little bit more quiet with my responses, because I overshare§.She says it politely and with a smile, but it＊s hard not to feel a bit deflated: this ranks fairly high up on the list of things no interviewer wants to hear from an interviewee. But I needn＊t have worried. The car has barely pulled away from her hotel and her resolution to be a little more quiet seems to have gone out the window.She＊s as smart as her lyrics, about everything from comics 每 ※I like Marvel because characters look like me and women don＊t have roles that make them look too sexual§ 每 to the gentrification of New York. ※It makes me really sad. It has glossed over these really formative areas that have inspired me in my life and raised me. A lot of people from the inner city, like I am, they observe it but they＊re not going to be vocal about it, because they＊re just going about their day. But I really see it; I understand the modern colonisation that they＊re doing. So I feel offended. My neighbourhood isn＊t even undergoing development, there＊s no real estate there, but I＊ve seen a couple of people walking down the street who I know aren＊t from there and I＊m like ＆get the fuck out!＊ I think: ＆How dare you? To have the audacity to just walk into this neighbourhood, you really got some gall.＊ You know they＊re really trying to be the first of their kind in the neighbourhood, and cash fucking crop.§Her musical background is fascinating. Her parents were hip-hop fans, but she was exposed to heavy metal aged six, courtesy of a goth babysitter. ※She was the coolest person to be near. I＊d watch her chain-smoke and listen to Rob Zombie and make out in front of me and it was scandalous and I loved it. I grew up in a liberal home where we all loved all types of music and my uncles listened to the Red Hot Chili Peppers; rock wasn＊t considered some white-boy shit. But her specifically, I saw and I was really drawn to. It was radical, it was fun, it was aggressive, and it had a tone that matched my heart.§She says she was always a misfit 每 ※not a typical clean-cut young lady, always a bit rough around the edges, always a bit messy§ 每 even before her life was turned upside down by the deaths of her grandmother and mother, the latter from Aids. She was farmed out to a foster mother she has described as ※a succubus§, who beat her so severely that she had to wear makeup to cover a black eye in a school photo. The obsession with 90s culture that runs through the lyrics of 1992 is clearly bound up in her troubled childhood. ※Growing up in the 90s was the coolest thing to me. Listening to metal with my gothic babysitter, dancing to Kriss Kross, hanging out and listening to the music at the block party downstairs from my house, the cartoons I＊d watch, seeing black representation and Latina representation on Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel, going to summer camp; oh, God, it＊s so vivid, so significant. And then my grandma died and I went to go live with a woman that wasn＊t the nicest person in the world and my life shattered and changed. I didn＊t like the music that was on the radio, I didn＊t wear the cute things girls wore at the time, I was on some baggy clothes,  tomboy shit, and puberty hit and ＃ I had to subconsciously block a lot of stuff that was going on at the time, so all I got is memories of the 90s.§She escaped into New York＊s underground punk scene. ※The principles of punk-rock culture, of self-expression and DIY culture, that really spoke to me. I remember at school one day there was a vocabulary list on the chalkboard and the word ＆nonconformist＊ was on there and it said: ※Someone that doesn＊t appeal to society, someone who doesn＊t fit in.§ We had this whole conversation about it and I realised it cohered to the punk-rock world that I was into. It was more than the clothes, although I loved the fashion. It was rooted in this beautiful socio-economic awareness and identity, and just saying: ＆Fuck you, we＊re going to be loud and express ourselves.＊ It gave me so much confidence and backbone.§She had a particular love for riot grrrl bands including  and , who she belatedly discovered via a music streaming service, and indeed, you can see the influence in everything from  每 a kind of online audio fanzine that Frasqueri started ※so I could have my own space when I was co-existing within a lot of white cis male spaces ＃ where I could talk about urban feminism, sexuality, relationships, spirituality, music, art, and interview people and laugh and make fun of myself§ 每 to her insistence that female audience members stand at the front of her shows.※Men standing in the back 每 it＊s what＊s right. All the shows that you go to, men would just be in the front in droves, moshing and they have such a brotherhood 每 which is beautiful and very commendable and I respect it very much. But it＊s like a thousand men with their sausages out and it＊s a real testosterone fest. Girls are, like, quivering in the corners, holding on to their purses, and they deserve to hold so much more space than that. A Princess Nokia show is this place where girls can do that and take the space in the way that men and the brotherhood do.§She currently occupies a unique and enviable place in pop music: a fiercely independent female rapper with a radical intersectional feminist agenda and burgeoning following, who has garnered praise everywhere from the world of fashion 每 she has modelled for Calvin Klein 每 to the music press and the serious socio-political blogs. ※The only way you can make something work is really by being your most unique self and having a lane, and there＊s no one in my lane,§ she says. ※Not until a sweet 17-year-old girl comes out of high school and does the same thing I do and I＊ve paved the way for her. That＊s important and I want that.§The one place she hasn＊t been lauded, she says, is in the world of hip-hop. ※When I＊m featured in serious hip-hop blogs, the commentary is really negative. It＊s not over-sexualisation 每 it＊s just: ＆Who the fuck is she? This bitch is whack and corny.＊ Because I speak highly of myself, people think I＊m pompous, or that I＊m really narcissistic. But I＊m only speaking on myself and what I＊ve done and accomplished, and I only speak like that because no one else is doing it.§By now, we＊ve pulled up outside the airport. Everyone else has got out of the car, including the driver. He taps on the window 每 ※Please,§ he says, plaintively, ※I cannot park here§ 每 but Frasqueri keeps on talking. ※I don＊t take it personal. I have come into this knowing very much who I am and knowing where I stand within this world. The fact that I get to coexist with it, and only focus on making art, is all that matters. It＊s not a competition, for me. Excluding me out of circles and worlds, it＊s happened all my life and that＊s what my music is about. So,§ she says, ※I will happily be the GG Allin of the hip-hop world.§I find myself letting out a startled bark of laughter 每 I hadn＊t expected our interview to conclude with talk turning to the late, self-styled ※true king of rock＊n＊roll§, notorious for performing naked and bloodied, defecating on stage, then throwing his excrement around while singing Eat My Diarrhea. GG Allin?She nods. ※GG Lopez, it＊s a concept I＊ve created for many years. And that＊s what it is and that＊s what it will always be and I love that and I take ownership of it and everybody can suck a dick.§Then she gives me a hug 每 ※it was lovely talking to you§ 每 picks up her travel pillow and finally gets out of the car, vanishing into the terminal building.

"The ghostly power of Whiteread＊s casts is one of modern British art＊s wonders. Her sculptures 每 preserving the shapes of lost objects 每 combine the authority of abstraction with the spookiness of Victorian photographs. Her work has a poetic intensity that has not diminished since she created her now-demolished public sculpture House in 1993. It is very possible her art will survive and be admired when so much else of?our time is forgotten.The ancient Roman poet Ovid annoyed the emperor Augustus so much with his erotic?verses and other, unspecified crimes, that he was exiled to the Black Sea to live among the Scythians. These ※barbarian§ neighbours of ancient Rome excelled at fighting on horseback, were ruthless enough to destroy all their property to foil a Persian invasion and loved gold. Here,  in an exhibition that should resurrect interest in a fascinating shadowland of history.The art of Bruce Nauman is brutal and beautiful, a description he could surely fashion into one of his flashing neon anagrams. Deliberately crass language games pulse through this free exhibition of his work: ※Run from Fear§ becomes ※Fun from Rear§. His videos are hilarious and terrifying in their absurdist verbal shufflings and implicit or explicit violence. An?artist who shows the world as?it is now, unfortunately. Fun by the seaside in an event that has become part of the British art calendar. Folkestone leads the way in the chain of contemporary art centres that line the south coast.  includes the venerable conceptual artist Michael Craig-Martin, rent-a-radical Bob?and Roberta Smith, pessimistic humorist David Shrigley and the pioneering sculptor of found stuff Bill Woodrow. places his Cyberman-style statues in the sea off two south coast towns in an attempt to colonise yet more of the landscape for his humanist vision. It＊s interesting that in a century so troubled by our impact on nature, some of the best-known artistic interventions in landscape stress the human figure.																																											"
"rhan Pamuk has written better than most contemporary novelists about the relationship between east and west. His great book  mingles history, personal reminiscence and political analysis to produce a panorama of the city that is also a map of the world 每 at once clearly drawn and poetically evocative. Much the same goes for his novels. While they explore separations, they look for elements that unite., translated by Ekin Oklap, is driven by the same obsessions, but develops them in suggestive new directions. While establishing a link ※between the nature of a civilisation and its approach to notions of parricide and filicide§, it blends the close observation of details with the broad brushstrokes usually associated with myth-making and fables.There are three sections, the first two apparently narrated by Cem Celik, the teenage son of a leftist who in the mid 1980s is snatched from his family by the state police, and later abandons his home for more selfish reasons. This leaves Cem searching for a father substitute, which he finds in the figure of Master Mahmut, a well-digger who employs him as an apprentice.Travelling with Mahmut to the countryside near Istanbul, Cem learns how a father figure can inspire fear as well as affection, and how secrets need to be preserved in order to create an independent sense of self. More routinely, but more enjoyably, he finds a way to lose his heart, when he glimpses a mysterious red-haired woman on one of his evening jaunts to the local village of Ongoren. She turns out to be attached to a travelling theatre of morality tales, and in all respects the ideal focus for his fantasies.At every turn, Pamuk balances the actual against the symbolic. The well is a site of genuinely hard work, but also a dive into the subconscious. Themes are as important as naturalism. Cem is obsessed by the story of Oedipus, which of course centres on a son＊s murder of his father, and the woman in her theatre performs a version of the , in which a father murders his son. Both Cem and the woman are set on a course that continuously weighs and compares the role of fate, the example of history, the warnings of myth, and the flow of everyday life.The first section closes with the woman and Cem sleeping together; ※I＊m old enough to be your mother,§ she tells him ominously. Near the beginning of the second section, in which Cem returns to Istanbul, he finds a new love, Ayse, and hears his father (with whom he is now back in touch) say that she ※is just like your mother§. Clearly the shadow of the past still falls darkly across the present 每 but rather than seeking to evade their lessons, Cem and Ayse welcome them. They set up a company called Sohrab; they continue to brood about the Oedipus story; they travel the world looking at manuscripts of the Iranian national epic the , in which Abolqasem Ferdowsi tells the story of Sohrab＊s killing by his father Rostam.And the effect? As Cem and Ayse begin to see the larger political issues raised by these stories, so we start to read  as a parable about present-day Turkey: about the injuries and aspirations that lead to the election of an authoritarian leader, and about the manifold grave dangers of such a process.※It seems we would all like a strong, decisive father telling us what to do and what not to do,§ Cem says. ※Is it because it is so difficult to distinguish what we should and shouldn＊t do, what is moral and right from what is sinful and wrong? Or is it because we constantly need to be reassured that we are innocent and have not sinned? Is the need for a father always there, or do we feel it only when we are confused, or anguished, when our world is falling apart?§Given the force that Pamuk ascribes to myth, it＊s hardly surprising to find Cem drawn back to Ongoren at the end of his narrative. The remainder of the novel revolves around a tussle between the power of inherited stories and the resilience of individual will, and Pamuk＊s way of telling it involves a major but well-prepared surprise.In a novel less thoroughly aware of its own strategies, this authorial friskiness would seem clunky. Here it seems happily all-of-a-piece. It reminds us that , like all good novels determined to deliver political and social criticism, understands that pleasure in the means of the delivery must equal the value of the thing said.

"either ＊s Piano Concerto No 2 nor his Paganini Variations are exactly under-recorded, but this disc has a good deal going for it.  brings to both works a clarity of articulation that makes the passages high up the keyboard sound weightless, like something Mendelssohn would write for Puck or Titania. Further down the keyboard things gain in density, and though Vinnitskaya is always poised she can sound a little clinical.The NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra plays with an old-school glow and solidity for . While his changes of tempo can be sudden they never seem dangerous, and for all its urgency the concerto＊s passion seems constrained 每 although the second movement is strikingly unhackneyed, played like a lullaby in which the melody is suspended above flowing notes that roll on and on. The episodic Variations suit the cool, controlled approach better, and it＊s here that both Vinnitskaya and the orchestra shine.																																											"
"elena  is one of our most innovative theatre-makers. She has now adapted and directed this Orwellian political allegory by , first published in West Germany in 1975 and translated by Michael Glenny. Giving us a dog＊s-eye-view of the Soviet system, it is staged with tremendous physical bravura but fails to sustain the narrative momentum of its gripping first half. The action is seen from the perspective of Ruslan, a dedicated guard dog conditioned to accept the institutional horrors of Stalin＊s gulags. When they are dismantled in 1956, the majority of his fellow canines are shot but Ruslan survives and remains doggedly loyal to his former master. Even when shunted into the care of an ex-prisoner, known as Shabby Man, Ruslan treats him as if he were still a suspected convict. Aware of the old order＊s cruelties yet pining for its restoration, Ruslan ultimately pays the price for his fidelity. It＊s an ingenious fable that makes a number of sharp points about the difficulty of living with the reversals of political power battles: Ruslan becomes a potent symbol of Soviet citizens trained to accept Stalin＊s edicts with blind faith and unable, after  of the former leader, to adjust to the new reality. But just when you are getting involved in the problems faced by Ruslan and his new owner, incarcerated as a repatriated prisoner-of-war, the story laboriously backtracks to recreate the nightmare of the labour camps. The idea that the story is being told by a group of contemporary Siberian convicts is also never followed through. What we do get, however, is an amazingly disciplined piece of physical theatre in which, unsurprisingly since  is the movement director, you can detect the influence of : when the actors evoke the impact of a passing train through their juddering bodies, I was reminded of that company＊s version of . The 13-strong ensemble also switch with consummate ease from playing dogs and chickens to brutal soldiers and their victimised prisoners. Max Keeble, in his professional debut, is outstanding as Ruslan; and there is striking work from Martin Donaghy as his master, Paul Brendan as his vodka-swilling new owner and Isabelle Joss as a haunted landlady. Even if  is the ultimate guide to the horrors of the gulag, the piece is worth seeing for the dazzling expertise of its actors. 																																											"

"Record-breaking horror film  may already be a hit with audiences, grossing hundreds of millions of pounds at the global box office in its first week, but one group is not celebrating the success of the latest adaptation of Stephen King＊s novel: clowns.For a community already struggling to combat perceptions of clowns as scary rather than fun, the emergence of Pennywise, the movie＊s child-killing clown villain, played by Swedish actor Bill Skarsgard is truly the stuff of nightmares. Even before the film＊s release the  that the film could cause its members to lose work, even going as far as publishing a press kit to prepare clowns for the damaging effects It might have on their reputations. Now, only a week into the film＊s run at cinemas, some clowns are already complaining that their business has taken a battering, with Darlington entertainer Tommy Bungle telling . It＊s no laughing matter for a industry that is still trying to recover from the devastating effects of 2016＊s global ※killer clown§ craze, which saw people don clown costumes to scare passers-by.※There＊s definitely a negativity to the industry,§ says South Wales-based clown Mr T. Ricks, whose real name is Alan Paget. ※Last year, especially, was really bad and I can only see it getting worse.§ Paget says that times are particularly tough for those, like him, who work as child entertainers, with parents nervous about hiring clowns for birthday parties. ※I get phone calls and messages on social media asking ＆are you a scary clown＊? It＊s getting to the stage where it＊s ridiculous,§ he says. ※Sometimes I feel like saying ＆well, you＊ll find out in your nightmares＊§.Not all clowns share his sense of doom and gloom. ※A load of the folks who say ＆this is terrible for the industry＊ have been clowning for about five minutes 每 they＊ve not been through this before,§ says Ian Williams, honorary secretary of Clowns International, which claims to be the world＊s oldest clown organisation. ※It＊s not going to kill off clowning. [The TV miniseries adaptation of It, starring Tim Curry] came out 27 years ago. I was clowning then, I＊m still clowning now.§What＊s more, Industry worries over the release of It might have been misplaced, according to Leah Curtis of concierge company Poptop, which helps supply performers, including plenty of clowns, for events. During the killer clown craze ※bookings went down, says Curtis. ※But, since the release of It we have had a booking growth of 25%.§Williams is confident that the clown community can weather the storm brought by the release of It. ※Next year we＊ve got . We just need to look at the good things coming up and focus on them until this film＊s out of the way,§ he says.There＊s one problem though: this isn＊t likely to be Pennywise＊s only appearance on the big screen, with a sequel for It already pencilled in for a 2019 release. ※The worst thing is that this is just part one of the film,§ says Paget. ※There＊s a second part coming. Come 2019 it＊s going to be exactly the same.§																																											"
"Sure, the bookers have a penchant for a certain type of earnest artist and the presenter＊s impish manner may drive you potty. But 25 years in, this show has racked up its share of great performances. Pleasing archival moments include a deliciously wobbly duet from Shane MacGowan and Nick Cave, an ace grime segment (mercifully free of boogie-woogie piano) and Holland telling a teenage Adele that she＊ll be a world star. Aww. For the last time in the current series, Nick Knowles invites two pairs of complete strangers to embark on the gameshow equivalent of a rap battle, each team stepping up to make good on their encyclopedic boasts on a series of given subjects. As ever, one team will win the opportunity to clamber up Nick＊s ladder of lucre, grabbing as much as ?50,000 before deciding whether to gamble those gains against another pair of opponents. Debut of a new series in which Monty Halls retraces some of the more audacious decampments from Nazi PoW camps. Tonight, the most successful mass-escape of the second world war 每 the breakout from Stalag XVIIID in which Australian Ralph Churches busted out more than 100 comrades. Halls follows their path through 200 miles of mountains and forests, meeting the Slovenian partisans who helped along the way. A Scooby gang of hot young Scandis romping around a remote, rustic ski lodge might sound like hygge heaven. But BBC4＊s latest Swedish import is more interested in creating a mood of unsettling horror. Something awful happened at the Black Lake resort two decades ago, and those bad vibes seem to be bleeding into the present day. Can the empathetic Hanne unravel the spooky mystery before her bossy boyfriend loses it with the locals? In terms of guests, reliable chat and the odd headline-grabbing revelation, Jonathan Ross is at the top of his game in his comfy ITV chair.

In its time, it has performed manoeuvres between Saturn＊s rings and vastly increased our understanding of that planet＊s moons and, indeed, how life is made. Now the challenge is to end its mission without contaminating the very ※promise of life§ it helped discover. Like fellow mod David Bowie, the diminutive dude born Mark Feld would flit like a stylish butterfly between personas 每 from dapper clothes horse to folkie to hippie 每 before eventually emerging as Marc Bolan, Prince of Glam. Here, friends, family and superfans trace his journey from Stoke Newington to stardom. So much more than the pre-punk placeholder he＊s sometimes considered to be, the Jeepster rocked with a capital R. Inspector Clouseau＊s first case features Peter Sellers in inspired form as the bungling detective, engaged in clumsy cat-and-mousery with debonair thief David Niven for possession of the legendary Pink Panther diamond.

"ersonally the prospect of immortality does not excite me, but the prospect of being a materialistic idol for four years does,§ says Marc Bolan, narrating his own documentary  (BBC4). Well, actually it＊s actor Jamie Bamber talking, but he is using Bolan＊s words, extracted from diaries and interviews. It＊s a nice touch that gives a personal, almost confessional feel to the film.Others chip in too.  and  are a given, because this is a BBC music doc on a Friday night. Plus  and , who worked with Bolan; Harry Feld, his brother; Toyah Willcox, who worshipped him; Gloria Jones who went out with him and had his son; , of tribute act T-Rextasy, who pretends to be him; and Mick O＊Halloran, who carried and set up gear for him.Roadie Mick is one of the most telling contributors. He remembers losing his rag with his friend and boss, telling him that success had made him ※too effing big-headed for his own good§. Marc＊s response was to give Mick an extra fiver a week. It＊s certainly no hagiography. Bolan comes across as hard to love, unless you were actually in love with him, which most people were 每 including, or especially, himself. He was self-obsessed and narcissistic, and perhaps cynical. But he was also undeniably brilliant, a true original whose influences ranged from Ravi Shankar to JRR Tolkien to Beau Brummell, who rethought what it meant to be a man long before everyone else did, who was almost hypnotically beautiful, and who had a few great songs too. His former publicist puts it well: ※It＊s easy to underestimate him because he overestimated himself.§ And then he died of course, a fortnight before his 30th birthday, in a Mini, in Barnes 每 something he foresaw. When Napier-Bell, his manager, warned him of revering James Dean because he might end up dying in a Porsche, Bolan apparently replied: ※I＊m just tiny, I＊d like to die in a Mini.§Not immortal then, but an idol certainly, just as he wished. And if that＊s not enough Marc Bolan for you, on the 40th anniversary of his death, there is another documentary on Sky Arts tonight, with many of the same contributors and also his son, Rolan Bolan.

"et＊s start with Samuel Pepys, scurrying about Restoration London in a whirl of work and pleasure before going home to write it all down in his . Born in Fleet Street in 1633, Pepys spent his journalising years living in nearby Seething Lane from where he routinely clattered off to the docks (he was secretary to the Admiralty), popped into City coffee houses (the person he had gone to meet had invariably left five minutes earlier) and canoodled with pretty actresses in Covent Garden (he always felt wretched afterwards). Through Pepys＊s eyes, we watch as London pukes itself to death in the plague of 1665 and then goes up in a blaze the following year.In  (1965)  dives deep into four and a half particularly sticky summer weeks. A sweltering House of Commons is debating the Corn Laws, while in Chelsea Thomas and Jane Carlyle worry that their stodgy mutton and potato diet is giving them constipation. Elizabeth Barrett is trying to get a breath of fresh air in Wimpole Street while her secret paramour Robert Browning slogs across the city to his home in New Cross.For a more whiffy take on Victorian London in melt-down, you can＊t do better than Rosemary Ashton＊s  (2017)Meanwhile Henry Mayhew＊s  (1851) throws some quavery gaslight on the bits of the city where literary Londoners seldom ventured. In a classic work of immersive journalism and ethnographic inquiry, Mayhew gets the watercress sellers, rat catchers and whores of Seven Dials and St Giles to tell their stories in their own voices. Passages of riveting testimony in broad vernacular are interspersed with Mayhew＊s sterling attempts to add statistical roughage 每 how many people live in this street, what does it cost to set yourself up as a sandwich-maker?Back in the world of the haut bourgeoisie, Virginia Woolf＊s essay  (1927) is one of the most thrilling accounts you will ever read of fl?neuseing (the female equivalent of loitering and looking in the urban space). Using the excuse of needing to buy a pencil, Woolf walks halfway across London in the wintry twilight, enjoying the anonymity of the rush hour bustle. Along the way she drinks in ※the carnal splendour of the butchers＊ shops with their yellow flanks and purple steaks§ and speculates on the lives of every kind of Londoner from the homeless to the prime minister. (2012) by Peter Barber charts the city＊s transformation from its Londinium days to the Olympiad of five years ago, by means of maps culled from the British Library＊s rich collection. We start with a symbolic view of London from the late middle ages and end with a series of snapshots of where we are now: a census map showing South Asian immigrants living in London in 2001, a pigeon＊s eye view of the King＊s Cross redevelopment, and a plan showing the extent of the London railway systems in 2012. In addition to the detailed charting of the city＊s inner workings, there are extravagant speculations about what London might have been, if only common sense and financial probity hadn＊t got in the way of wild imagination.In (1998) Iain Sinclair walks the streets of a newly corporatised London, which is about to be handed over by the Tories to Labour in the 1997 election. Along the way he logs every gleaming phallic tower as well as every scribble of wild graffiti, which he reads as the authentic cry of a weeping city. This was the book that gave mainstream literary culture a word it hadn＊t heard before 每 ※psychogeography§. Now everyone＊s doing it, or at least they think they are. But Sinclair＊s understanding of the term has always been rigorous, rooted in the work of the French Situationists of the 60s rather than something pinched from a press release. He is still the master. has always been a more parochial presence than Sinclair, concentrating on London＊s pockets rather than its seams. In, which was originally published in 1977 but reissued in 2010, Tindall peels back the palimpsest that is Kentish Town. At first glance this no man＊s land, wedged to the north of Camden Town, might seem to be a place without significant history. But with the benefit of Tindall＊s discriminating eye, we learn how a countrified retreat for the Tudor gentry became one huge market garden in the 18th century and then, with the coming of the railway, turned into the kind of leafy suburb to where Mr Pooter might dream of moving.Last year＊s by Ben Judah is an epic account of London as a place where global migrants come to scratch a subsistence living or, occasionally, spend a shady fortune. We are far, far beyond the Windrush generation here. Arabs, Afghans, Nigerians, Poles, Romanians and Russians pour out their stories 每 often terrifying, mostly sad, occasionally funny 每 while Judah writes it all down in compulsive, shocking detail. We＊re back in Mayhew＊s London, but now watercress sellers and mudlarks have been replaced by sleepy Africans catching the early morning night bus to their office cleaning jobs four zones over on the other side of town.Finally Peter Ackroyd＊sremains a classic. No one has ever dreamed the capital into being quite like Ackroyd, who was born in East Acton but has always appeared to live imaginatively in WC1, on the cusp of plushness and dissolution. His ※biography§ of the city is likewise an inclusive swoop, refusing to be tethered either by chronology or postcode. There are chapters here on silence, food and flowers and everything in between. Nearly 20 years on, Ackroyd＊s  reads like the loveliest of love letters. To order any of these titles, go to 																																											"
", who has died aged 91, was a vintage performer, only reaching his full potential in his late 50s.Billed as Dean Stanton throughout the 1950s and 60s, the narrow-faced, weather-beaten actor with the hangdog expression was probably the busiest actor of his generation. His distinctive features and style proved a godsend for casting directors in search of conmen, misfits, sleazeballs, losers and eccentrics. In the first half of his career, Stanton made scores of television appearances, mainly westerns, and dozens of films, mostly in brief roles. His face but not his name gained recognition.That is until he came into more focus in  (1979) as a downtrodden engineer on the doomed spaceship. Then, in 1984, greatness was thrust upon him when he was given two of his rare leading roles, in Alex Cox＊s Repo Man and Wim Wenders＊ , which were, understandably, his own favourites. A few years later, he was celebrated by Debbie Harryin the 1989 Blondie hit I Want That Man.Stanton was born in a small town in Kentucky, where his father, Sheridan Harry Stanton, was a tobacco farmer and barber, and his mother, Ersel, a hairdresser and cook. After leaving high school in 1944, he served in the US navy in the second world war, during which he saw action in Okinawa. He then returned to study journalism and radio at the University of Kentucky, where he became seriously interested in acting after playing Alfred Doolittle in a college production of Pygmalion.He dropped out of university and headed for California and the prestigious Pasadena Playhouse, where he acted alongside Gene Hackman and . Four years later, Stanton, who was also an excellent singer, and played the harmonica, bass and guitar, toured the country with The American Male Chorus. In Cool Hand Luke (1967), Stanton got to sing Just a Closer Walk With Me, accompanying himself on the guitar. He also taught Paul Newman the song he sings, I Don＊t Care if it Rains or Freezes, Long as I Got My Plastic Jesus.After touring with the chorus and working in children＊s theatre, Stanton headed back to California where he began to get work in films and TV. One of his earliest features was the western The Proud Rebel (1958), in which he played the first of many villains, in this instance, framing Alan Ladd for starting a brawl. For most of the 60s, Stanton was a regular in TV horse operas like Laramie, Have Gun, Will Travel, Bonanza and Rawhide. In the cinema, he was noticed as an evil outlaw with an eyepatch in Monte Hellman＊s cultish low-budget western Ride in the Whirlwind (1965), written and starring Jack Nicholson. (Stanton was best man at Nicholson＊s marriage in 1962, and the pair lived together in Laurel Canyon after Nicholson＊s divorce in 1968.) Stanton＊s film career really took off in the 70s, with two more roles for Hellman 每 Two-Lane Blacktop (1971) and The Cockfighter (1974) 每 and Sam Peckinpah＊s Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973). Stanton recalled that during the latter, he became friends with Bob Dylan. ※We hung out quite a bit during the shoot,§ he said. ※Drove together all the way from Guadalajara, Mexico, to Kansas City together. We jammed together quite a bit.§ Stanton sang with Dylan and Joan Baez in the sprawling film Dylan directed, Renaldo and Clara (1978).  He played an FBI man in The Godfather II (1974), supported Marlon Brando and Nicholson in The Missouri Breaks (1976), and was convincing in Straight Time (1978) as an ex-con, bored with his middle-class existence, who, while lying beside his pool, asks Dustin Hoffman, planning a heist, to ※Get me out of here!§. In 1979 came Alien and John Huston＊s Wise Blood, with Stanton excellent as a fraudulent blind preacher in the latter. Stanton then proved his versatility in three comedies: as the smooth-talking recruiting sergeant in Private Benjamin (1980), who gets Goldie Hawn to sign up to the ※new§ army; as the pathetic chain-smoking dognapping vet in The Black Marble (1980), and announcing that ※there are over 100 bodily fluids and I have tasted each and every one of them§, as a medic in Young Doctors in Love (1982). Stanton＊s off-kilter performance in Repo Man, passing on his philosophy of life to his prot谷g谷 (Emilio Estevez), perfectly gelled with the sensibilities of the tale involving punk-rockers and creatures from another planet. In Paris, Texas, in a role written for him by Sam Shepard, he is first seen walking alone in the Texan desert and does not speak for the opening 20 minutes. Stanton＊s attraction to eastern philosophy and spirituality may have helped his still, eloquent performance, brilliantly evoking an outsider, a voyeur of life. ※I can＊t relate to the Judaic-Christian concept at all,§ he once claimed. ※It＊s a fascistic concept. All fear-based. All about there being a boss. Someone in charge. A creator.§ Stanton continued to reveal his more tender side with several gentle performances such as the guardian angel in One Magic Christmas (1985), as Molly Ringwald＊s burnt-out father in Pretty in Pink (1986), and as a sweet-natured, but ill-fated, private investigator 每 ※so clever he could find an honest man in Washington§ 每 in David Lynch＊s Wild at Heart (1990). Also for Lynch, he made a touching cameo appearance in A Straight Story (1999) and in the cryptic Inland Empire (2006), he makes the most of his short role as Jeremy Irons＊s debauched and broke assistant.  Television offered him the chance to return to his villainous ways as a satanic church leader of a polygamous group in 39 episodes of Big Love (2006-2010). On the whole, the quality of his films declined, but Stanton could always be relied upon to hold audience＊s attention, paradoxically, with his understated portrayals. ※Usually, I just play myself,§ Stanton explained. ※Whatever psychological traumas or conflicts I＊m going through at the time I try to put into the role. Sometimes it＊s quite a feat to pull off, but sometimes it works.§ His final film, Lucky, directed by John Carroll Lynch, is due for release at the end of September. Apart from his busy film schedule, Stanton had a parallel career as a musician, on guitar and singing in The Harry Dean Stanton Band, which played their own mixture of mariachi and jazz. He lived alone in a house on LA＊s Mulholland Drive, where his doormat read, ※Welcome UFOs§. In 1996, he happened to be home when burglars struck, tied him up and pistol-whipped him before stealing some expensive electronics and taking off in his car. But they were soon apprehended after the car was traced by a tracking device. Stanton suffered only minor injuries. He rarely talked publicly about his private life but, though he never married, he once said he had ※one or two children§.																																											"
"The objects on display range from the cosy and nostalgic, such as Terry Pratchett＊s Blue Peter badge, to the grand: a gleaming sword infused with shards of meteorite created by the author himself to commemorate his own knighthood. Fans will, no doubt, love the vivid, original paintings of Pratchett＊s beloved Discworld characters and the chance, for the first time, to peek inside a detailed reconstruction of his study, nicknamed The Chapel. Newcomers to the life and times of  may be surprised at the anger that inspired and drove him in his writing and campaigning. The many sides of one of the UK＊s most beloved fantasy authors are reflected in an exhibition called , which opens on Saturday at Salisbury Museum, not far from his Wiltshire ※manorette§ where he died in March 2015.The memorabilia is as eclectic as the author＊s writing, from his first typewriter 每 a manual Imperial 58 bought secondhand for ?14 每 to his trademark leather jacket and Louisiana fedora. There is a lot of humour, such as his T-shirt with the greeting: ※Tolkien is dead, JK Rowling said no, Philip Pullman couldn＊t make it, hi I＊m .§Tucked away in the corner of one of the rooms is Pratchett＊s knighthood insignia, but dominating the centre is that sword he made himself. He did it the hard way; digging iron ore out of the ground, smelting it in his garden, then adding a few pieces of a meteorite for a touch of magic. The fulcrum of the exhibition, however, must be a recreation of his study, including the six computer screens he used. ※Why do I have six monitors?§ he said. ※Because I don＊t have room for eight.§ His glasses lie on the desk as if he has just left for a moment and below is a nook where his cat Pongo used to sleep. Dotted around the walls is artwork connected to Pratchett and his writing, including 40 original paintings and drawings by Paul Kidby, who designed the Discworld book jackets from 2002. Enthusiasts may also relish Pratchett＊s own sketches, such as a tiny one of his wizard Rincewind labelled: ※general worried impression ＃ poor straggly beard ＃ ill-fitting robe§. Another extraordinary exhibit is the rather sad remains of a hard disc which, at the writer＊s request, . The disc contained perhaps 10 manuscripts he was working on when he died. A central idea of the exhibition is for Pratchett＊s life to be told in his own words. Published writings, interviews and scribblings were mined. There is fun, jollity 每 and rage. On a board in the first room, which focuses on Pratchett＊s early life, his primary school experiences are remembered: ※Mr Tame, my headmaster, thought he could tell how successful we would be in later life by how well we could read or write by the age of six. He told me I would never amount to anything.§There is anger in his description of how he initially struggled to be treated for ※a weird form of Alzheimer＊s called posterior cortical atrophy (PCA)§. He was offered no therapy, not even a pamphlet, when diagnosed. ※I felt totally exposed and alone,§ he said. ※You could have used my anger to weld steel, but I have never felt so alive! I think it is the anger, it drives me on.§ A beautiful, detailed sketch of a horseman done by Pratchett in 1971 is juxtaposed with test papers from 2009 and 2010 showing how his ability to draw or write were vanishing. ※There is something horribly fascinating about an author losing power over his words,§ he wrote. Poignant finds were made as the exhibition took shape. When a bag loaned by Pratchett＊s estate was opened, out tumbled a packet of throat lozenges, some indigestion tablets ＃ and a pamphlet for Dignitas, the Swiss assisted dying organisation. Rob Wilkins, Pratchett＊s longtime assistant and friend (and inducted by the writer as ※Grand Master of the Order of the Honeybee§ 每 a hive of friends and relatives charged with protecting his legacy) said he was overwhelmed by the exhibition. ※It＊s so important to me. To give people a chance to see all this from Terry＊s world collected in one place is delightful.§ As visitors leave the exhibition they pass under a favourite farewell phrase of Pratchett＊s: ※Mind how you go.§ 																																											"
"his delicate German coming-of-ager 每 adapted by director Jakob Erwa from an  每 wobbles between genuinely cute and aggravatingly twee before finding its feet alongside its protagonist. Sensitive late-teen Phil (Louis Hofmann) returns from camp one summer to find the small town he＊d thought a paradise irrevocably altered: a storm has rearranged his usual reference points, distancing beloved sister Dianne (Ada Philine Stappenbeck) and leaving free-spirit mother Glass (Sabine Timoteo) even more emotionally fragile than when he left.There is one ray of light in sporty new kid Nicholas (Jannik Sch邦mann), enthusiastically leading our boy into the locker-room showers, but we＊re set to wondering whether Phil＊s tangled history will darken even this glimmer of promise. Flashbacks to Phil and Dianne＊s days as Teutonically blond toddlers are proofs of baggage but feel unnecessary, and Erwa is prone to occasional visual cliches, like the overhead shot of semi-clad bodies atop a jetty that seems to recur in every Mitteleuropean drama about first fumbling love. Yet he establishes an intriguing, complicated and capably performed relationship between a mother who＊s known only hurt from the opposite sex and a son palpably longing for male affection and affirmation. A vaguely educative, afterschool-special vibe may mean the 15 certificate reflects its optimal viewer age 每 it＊s partly couched as a primer in handling heartbreak 每 but Erwa＊s emotional candour ensures his film will strike resonant chords with anybody who spent their formative years extricating themselves from strangulating family ties.

"hat happened? It＊s the question we＊ve all been asking since Donald Trump＊s surprise ascent to the US presidency. It is also the title of , in which she looks back at her campaign and reveals what she thinks ＃ happened. Some Democrats, Bernie Sanders included, have objected to the book, saying it is important to look forward and not back, but those of us still walking around incredulous will probably buy it seeking answers. Even if that answer is clarifying just how bad Clinton＊s campaign was.Clinton is not alone as a failed candidate in publishing a book dissecting events 每 she＊s not even alone as a failed candidate of 2016 publishing a book. Here＊s a list of some other titles written by hopefuls who never made it to the White House (or in some cases, the nomination):Goldwater＊s slim, ghostwritten book caused a sensation on publication, reignited conservatism, made him a star and influenced Republican thought for decades. But it also provided some of the grounds for a smear campaign against him when he ran for president in 1964: a magazine called Fact asked 12,000 psychiatrists, none of whom had treated Goldwater, whether he was ※psychologically fit§ for the top job. The criticism led to , a stipulation that psychiatrists should not speculate about the mental health of a public figure.But though Goldwater lost the election to Lyndon Baines Johnson by a landslide, his book is still often namechecked. Economist Paul Krugman wrote a riposte, , in 2007. I＊m afraid a huge motivation for including this is the title, because: the title.

Many people bought No Apology, clearing space on their shelves laden with . The book was very briefly No 1 on the New York Times bestseller list.Sanders＊ summer release is all about once again feeling the Bern, encouraging young adults to get into politics. The much loved campaigner calls for young people to ※fight for a progressive economic, environmental, racial and social justice agenda§, casually dropping in the fact .He : ※It is my observation that the current generation of young people is the smartest, most idealistic, and least prejudiced generation in the modern history of the United States§. Which is a change from the usual millennial-bashing polemics.Oh, Gary Hart! Such promise, such scandal. Hart had narrowly missed out on the 1984 Democrat nomination and was the frontrunner in his follow-up 1988 bid before he had to drop out after an (alleged) affair was exposed 每 via  cavorting on a yacht with someone who wasn＊t his wife. Rather brilliantly, the yacht was called Monkey Business. So the narrative sort of worked itself out on that one. Hart was a talented politician and has authored many books, including the taking-no-prisoners (1996), but The Good Fight was his first big book after the, you know, monkey business. In 2006, he also put out .It＊s tempting to choose Bush＊s more recent book Reply All (: ※just like a BlackBerry, I needed recharging from time to time§), but I＊ve picked his 2014 book because of the brutal fact it  in hardback.

He is a bestseller: his 2014 book, One Nation: What We Can All Do To Save America＊s Future  copies in its first year.  served as campaign literature in the run-up to his 2016 Republican candidacy, covering his thoughts on same-sex marriage, religion and taxes.

McCain went on to win the Republican nomination in 2008 and run against Barack Obama and ＃ well, we know how that worked out.I could have gone with an Al Gore book, sure, but Gore＊s books are more about global issues than his own experiences in politics.

Written in the style of a candidate＊s memoir, it is set around a 2000 election in which Franken beats Gore to the Democratic nomination.

"During the filming of , director Milos Forman had a phone call with his star, Jim Carrey, to complain about two unwanted people who kept appearing on set. ※Well, we can fire them, and I can do an impersonation,§ Carrey countered. Forman realised this wasn＊t a good idea.The two nuisances were Andy Kaufman, long dead, and Tony Clifton, who never existed. Carrey, who claimed to not be there himself, was portraying them both in the 1998 biopic of Kaufman. He was so committed to method acting that he would only work ※as Andy§ or ※as Tony§, which is annoying enough, but when you factor in that Kaufman and his creation Clifton were intentional agents of chaos, you can see how it could be a recipe for trouble.Carrey had a documentary crew follow him around during the production, and their footage has been sitting on a shelf for nearly 20 years. Knitting this footage together along with a present-day interview with a bearded, philosophical Carrey, director Chris Smith (American Movie) has all the elements of an inquiry into the madness behind fame, art, performance and the issue of when a joke has gone ※too far§.He doesn＊t quite succeed. But the consolation prize is that (hold on for this title) Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond 每 The Story of Jim Carey & Andy Kaufman With a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton is an extremely watchable movie. It isn＊t nearly as deep as it thinks it is, but it is marvellously entertaining.For a start, we get Carrey, today, speaking to us via  and looking a lot like late-period Jim Morrison. At first, his recollection of his early career is lucid, but when he starts giving rich, psychoanalytical readings of his 90s comedies, and discussing how an artist has to live ※up here§ at all times, it＊s clear that he＊s gone a little off the rails. Unless he just wants us to  that＃The material of him on set is unbelievable.

Gaze on with wonder as this pompous and very talented clown refuses to answer to the name Jim. Co-star Danny DeVito thinks it＊s funny but Judd Hirsch is just not having it. When Kaufman＊s foe, wrestler Jerry Lawler, comes to set playing himself, all hell breaks loose. Carrey refuses to break character, and it results in an injury. (Maybe 每 who knows if any of this is real?) Forman looks exasperated, but Carrey is the star and if this is what Carrey sees as his process, Forman will have to put up with it.Carrey looks back on all this as if he＊s got some pan-dimensional connection to Kaufman, and his seriousness is incredible. By the end of this documentary Carrey is so in awe at his own acting he suggests he could become anyone and have people believe it 每 even Jesus Christ.Smith offers no pushback, nor does he interview anyone else who was witness to all this.

"So that＊s it.  is no longer an action movie star. His retirement from action films,  (※I＊m sixty-fucking-five. Audiences are eventually going to go: ＆Come on,＊§ he said at the Toronto film festival), forms the conclusion of perhaps the most unlikely career jag in cinema history.It would have been unthinkable to suggest, pre-, that Liam Neeson 每 soulful, mournful, capital-A actor Liam Neeson from Schindler＊s List 每 would spend a decade punching people and jumping over things in an apparently ceaseless procession of generic B-movies would have been unthinkable. It would have been like suggesting that  was going to devote his life to gross-out comedy, or that  should sign up as the lead of a vampire gangster franchise called Bloodburst Hookers Extreme.And yet, viewed from this side, Neeson＊s action stint makes perfect sense. Although he enjoyed a four-year purple period in the 90s, during which he starred in ,  and , a retrospective glance at Neeson＊s filmography shows a hidden love of silliness right from the beginning. His breakout starring role in 1990＊s  was a thrill precisely because he was already subverting a reputation that didn＊t exist yet, cutting his well-versed sincerity with moments of gonzo ridiculousness. And, honestly, you don＊t sign up for a  unless you inherently favour swooshing about with a glowing stick over hard-earned credibility.But even taking these unexpected turns into consideration,  still came as a shock. On paper, Bryan Mills could have been played by anyone 每 a Statham, a Seagal, a Van Damme 每 but hiring Neeson was a masterstroke. His credentials as a respected actor meant that he could sell the heck out the film＊s early scenes 每 where his primary character trait was ＆sadsack＊ 每 to the point that you actually felt invested in his plight come the end. The film＊s iconic moment is the , the ※particular set of skills§ scene, which Neeson corralled into a virtuoso demonstration of controlled rage. Put that speech in the mouth of any other action star and it＊d be a mess; with Neeson it is a perfectly contained For Your Consideration package.Not all of all of Neeson＊s action experiments have been as successful as Taken. Far from it. Even though I watched  in the cinema, I couldn＊t have told you what happened in it five minutes after the credits rolled. I also paid to watch his , and I＊ve only just remembered that it existed.  was as generic as a film can possibly get.  felt like it was created by an algorithm to refill the world＊s bargain basement DVD buckets. Despite his rumoured $20 million salary,  每 with its infamous  每 represented a horrible new low. It＊s only right that he should decide to recalibrate his career back towards drama after such a mess.Taking this into consideration, Neeson＊s retirement should be celebrated. He possesses such an astonishing range of ability that it doesn＊t benefit anyone to confine him to such a narrow genre. In the last three years alone, he＊s been breathtaking in Scorsese＊s , heartbreaking in  and flat-out hilarious in . The fact that he＊ll soon be starring in Steve McQueen＊s  seems to signify that he＊s ready to show the world what an acting powerhouse he still is, and not a moment too soon.However, if nothing else, Neeson＊s action experiment did result in one unqualified success. If you haven＊t seen 2011＊s , then you must. Depicted in the trailers as yet another schlocky action outing where Neeson tapes miniature vodka bottles onto his fists and punches a wolf, the film itself is an unexpectedly beautiful meditation on grief that comes out of nowhere and leaves you absolutely floored. Plus, he does actually punch a wolf with a bottle taped to his knuckles. It played to Neeson＊s strengths exactly. No other actor on Earth could have pulled it off. If nothing else, The Grey makes this last decade-long tangent worthwhile. If he wants to come out of retirement for a sequel, I＊m sure they＊ll let him.																																											"
"here could no better tribute to , than to revive this neglected play from 1989. It is both a poignant family drama and a portrait of a world that, with the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the consequences of a decade of Thatcherism at home, is witnessing the extinction of utopian dreams. But Storey was more of a poet than an ideologue, and Alice Hamilton＊s production neatly captures the play＊s delicate shifts of mood. As in his earlier play, , Storey finds drama in an uneasy family reunion. On this occasion, it＊s the diamond wedding anniversary of the Pasmores, a retired couple living in a Yorkshire coastal bungalow. He is an ex-miner with a permanent lung disease but with memories of youthful military adventures in the Crimea: his wife is a grudgingly affectionate working-class Tory. It is the arrival of their three children, however, that exposes the fissures within the family. Colin, a Storey-like writer and lecturer, is burdened by guilt while the abrasive Wendy, busy in local politics, has jettisoned both her husband and her Labour affiliations. Only Eileen, the third child who has settled for less, appears moderately happy. As in Chekhov, not a lot seems to happen but in reality an immense amount does. At first the oldsters＊ marital bickering is rancorously funny: they even use ailments as a form of one-upmanship so that his pneumoconiosis is meant to cap her hysterectomy. But, with great skill, Storey slowly reveals Pasmore＊s private disintegration and dependence on his wife＊s protection. The family itself also becomes a microcosm of the wider world＊s disappointments. Colin symbolises the angst of the working-class renegade alienated from his past and Wendy the plight of the political activist appalled by party machinations. Without one noticing it, a family drama turns into a state-of-the-nation play. Hamilton＊s production, however, is rightly rooted in domestic detail. Sue Wallace is particularly fine as Mrs Pasmore, whom she plays as an outwardly plucky figure whose sadness is revealed only in her eyes. Even if Ian Gelder is not my idea of an ex-miner and ladies man, he captures perfectly Pasmore＊s surface bravado and secret vulnerability. Eileen＊s character is underwritten but Colin Tierney is morosely haunted as Colin, and Sarah Belcher pinpoints Wendy＊s festering filial resentment. Storey＊s play survives as a deeply moving study of the quiet despair behind the materialist orthodoxy of the 1980s.  At the , until 7 October.

"t was billed as ※the greatest architectural contest in history§, a hunt for ※the most beautiful and distinctive office building in the world§ to house ※the world＊s greatest newspaper§. The Chicago Tribune＊s owner, Colonel Robert R McCormick, had no shortage of ambition when he launched the  in 1922. And he wasn＊t disappointed by the response.The glamour of the brief, along with the lure of $100,000 in prize money (around $1.5m today), saw 263 architects submit designs from 23 countries around the world. The entries provide a fascinating cross-section of the aesthetic preoccupations of the day, ranging from neoclassical wedding cake confections to modernist slabs, reflecting a moment on the cusp of radical change.The , which still stands proudly on the corner of Michigan Avenue, was a neo-gothic fantasy of stone piers and flying buttresses, a rocket ship conjured from 16th-century France. It remains one of the finest and most intriguing towers in Chicago, if not the world, its  brought back from exotic lands by the newspaper＊s reporters. But it was the competition itself that had the bigger impact on the architectural imagination. The sheer range of entries sparked an international debate on what direction the future of the skyscraper should take, providing a stylistic smorgasbord for generations of towers to come.It is a discussion that the curators of the second hope to reignite this month, with an exhibition that will restage the Tribune Tower competition, 95 years on, asking contemporary architects to respond to the brief.Choosing as their theme ※make new history§, co-curators of the biennial Mark Lee and Sharon Johnston set out to ask a new generation what a high-rise could be today. The LA-based duo, founding partners of Johnston Marklee architecture firm, say that coming to  as outsiders, they ※wanted to generate a discussion that would have an international resonance like the original competition did§.That 1922 contest was the ultimate battle of the styles. The majority of American architects, then still trained in the Beaux-Arts manner, favoured a traditionalist approach, their designs ranging from teetering romanesque campaniles to gothic piles. These were office buildings as cathedrals, their mighty stone shafts crowned with domes, globes and spires. Columns were piled on pilasters, rusticated plinths groaned under heaving cornices and every junction was elaborated with a twiddly moulding. It was the post-industrial capitalist society searching for legitimacy in the fancy dress of yore.The European entries, by contrast, were much more diverse, ranging from colossal Art Deco monuments to stark steel frames stripped of all ornament. There was an  by Bruno Taut, an  and, perhaps most famously of all, a tower in the shape of a . On the eve of the publication of Le Corbusier＊s seminal manifesto, Vers une Architecture, you can sense the palpable excitement about capturing the ※spirit of the age§ in glass and steel.The competition has echoed down the generations, and Johnston and Lee are  as a means of sampling the mood of the day. In 1980, Chicago architects Stanley Tigerman and Stuart Cohen invited ※Late Entries§ to the competition, asking such luminaries as Tadao Ando and Frank Gehry to submit designs. As Tigerman wrote: ※The original competition occurred at a time that was near the end of one era and the beginning of another. This exhibition takes place during a time of revisionism in which Modernism is being safely relegated to its place in history.§The entries were a riotous postmodern hotch-potch of reference and collage. The designers sampled promiscuously from different periods and used their proposals as vehicles for critical commentary. , embodying ※violence, liberty, politics and technology§ in its sculpted facade. Helmut Jahn looked at exploiting the available air rights above the existing tower, building a  of the Tribune on top of its gothic crown. Ando proposed a , while , from whose wings visitors could dangle in an aerial fairground ride.Just as the 1922 competition revealed a new generation of modernists, so the 1980 version celebrated the return of history and ornament, the ※complexity and contradiction§ called for by Robert Venturi. ※Our own generation has gained new vitality,§ wrote Tigerman, ※through its desire to find formal meaning in our cultural origins now that the barrenness of Modernism is behind us.§So what will the 2017 edition tell us about the state of contemporary architecture? By limiting the selection to just 15 architects, all sampled from a similar-ish school of thought, it is unlikely to give the full picture. Rather than taking the temperature of global practice, the curators say they wanted to give a younger generation the chance to make a statement about building tall. There are none of the obvious big names 每 no globular ※parametric§ stalagmites from Zaha Hadid Architects, no Lego brick ziggurats from Bjarke Ingels, no mute stone obelisks from Peter Zumthor, no minimal white pillars from Sanaa. Instead, there will be a series of thoughtful, critical reflections on the Tribune competition, exhibited as an immersive grove of three-metre high scale models.London architect  continues the witty strain of the 1980 competition. Referring to the archaeological fragments embedded in the fa?ade of the existing tower, his proposal sees an octagonal cupola perched atop arched colonnades that in turn rest upon modernist grids. With this playful layer-cake of different buildings Jacob is reflecting on how ※architecture is not something that we create but something that already exists, just waiting for us to discover it§.Swiss practice  have gone down the ready-made route too, choosing to recreate an  built in S?o Paulo in 1964, as a celebration of ※the pristine architecture of pure tectonics§. Others have rather lazily recycled previous projects of their own, with Mexico＊s  stacking one of their framed proposals on top of another, and France＊s  scaling up a faceted column from a student housing block he＊s built in Paris. follow a similar path, but with a more elaborate narrative, asking a number of American wood-turners to each lathe a section of their tower according to a series of profiles taken from their  gallery in London, whose Georgian interior was, for a while, on display in the Art Institute of Chicago.The models will no doubt make for a series of diverting art pieces, but overall there seems to be too much interest in concocting a clever story and little attention given to actually designing a high-rise media headquarters for the 21st century.Some entries touch on the changing media landscape, but don＊t take it very far.  proposes a vertiginous stack of pavilions, like nested coffee tables gone awry, conceived as a landscape of ※theatres, meeting zones, restful landscapes and hedonistic gardens: the true productive spaces for today＊s media workers.§ African architect  imagines a mixed-use neighbourhood, with housing, workspace and cultural facilities arranged around a series of voids in a tower of cylinders. Mexico＊s  imagines a ※vertical community§ of 192 plots, given to a range of collaborators to design.Visitors expecting a cross-section of contemporary practice will be disappointed. But then again you only have to visit Manhattan to find  next to . When every kind of high-rise imaginable is already being built, from  to , it seems that many of the young practices here would rather retreat into the realms of commentary and critique than add to the mel谷e.As for the Chicago Tribune itself, the exhibition comes at a poignant moment. The newspaper recently announced that it is moving out of its iconic headquarters after its .

"y the time it was finally retired in 2015, the Royal Opera＊s previous production of , crammed with detail and affectionately directed by John Copley, had become a cherished institution, notching up 25 revivals in its 41-year history. The odds are that its replacement, directed by  with sets and costumes by , won＊t last quite as long, but it has clearly been designed for permanence 每 an uncontroversial mainstream staging that can be brought back again and again without the danger of anyone tiring of it. In fact what Jones and Laing have come up with isn＊t a million miles away from the show that it has replaced.Perhaps the  world of 19th-century Paris that Puccini creates for Boh豕me really does resist deconstruction, other than straightforward cosmetic translations into more modern settings. This production doesn＊t even opt for that, but takes the original as a given, without any friction or attempts at stylisation at all. The bohemians＊ stripped down garret of the outer acts may be historically neutral, but the lavish setting for the second act, complete with arcades, a swanky restaurant interior and Christmas Eve crowds who look as though they＊ve just stepped off the sides of a , would satisfy the most demanding literalist.It＊s put on stage with Jones＊s usual efficiency and precision, but always remains mechanical and emotionally chilly 每 antiseptic really. The performances are certainly efficient, too, but only touching, genuinely aware Mimi comes across as a three-dimensional character. However, even then her relationship with  preening, unvaryingly loud Rodolfo doesn＊t ring true. Whatever＊s going on between Marcello () and Musetta (, who takes over as Mimi later in the run) isn＊t investigated either, any more than the friendship of the four men, with Luca Tittoto as Colline and Florian Sempey as Schaunard, is really explored. Why are they there, one wants to know, and is their poverty real or not? All the real emotional intensity and dramatic engagement has to come from the pit. Antonio Pappano certainly conducts the score superbly, relishing every detail, but there needs to be passion on stage, too. In rep until 10 October. : 020-7304 4000.

"he films of actor-turned-writer-turned-director Taylor Sheridan resemble their central characters: stern, taciturn, unwilling to give anything away unless absolutely necessary. These are tales of law enforcers and their quarry, bonded by a desire to simply keep going. We＊ve seen them in , the Denis Villeneuve-directed account of the drugs war on the Mexico/US border, and the Oscar-nominated , about two Texas rangers＊ attempts to hunt down a pair of down-on-their-luck bank robbers. Sheridan＊s screenplays for both were thoughtful, funny and frequently terrifying, but above all succinct. After all, when you＊re in a shootout with cartel members or desperate felons, there＊s little time to shoot the breeze.All of which makes meeting Sheridan in person a disarming experience. He looks the part. Tall, lantern-jawed and wearing a permanently pensive expression, you can understand how, he used to make a living turning up as a guest star in rugged procedural dramas like NYPD Blue and Walker, Texas Ranger, as well as a recurring role in biker drama . But he doesn＊t seem to share his characters＊ predisposition for keeping their thoughts to themselves. Ask him a question and his answers tend towards the digressive: long, profane monologues that change subject mid-sentence. One minute he＊ll be asking if it＊s OK if he smokes, the next he＊s marvelling on the eternal youth of the French.※I saw a guy the other day. He was 75 and he looked like fucking George Clooney,§ he says. ※The porter in my hotel that picked up my bags, that girl was wearing fucking Gucci. I don＊t understand this country. I＊m so fascinated by it, because everyone＊s so goddamn pretty and happy and no one ages. What are they doing here?§ In fairness, some of Sheridan＊s loquaciousness might have something to do with the fact that he has just spent the day doing press at the Cannes film festival on a diet of prosecco and not much else. ※They haven＊t fed us, so I＊m feeling loose, buddy,§ he says by way of introduction. ※This is going to be good. I promise you that.§Sheridan came to the Croisette for the premiere of , the third instalment of his trilogy of modern, muscular westerns. Like Sicario and Hell or High Water before it, the film concerns individuals trying to maintain rule of law in impossible circumstances, its elegiac tone pockmarked with bursts of high tension and sudden, shocking violence. This time around though, Sheridan has not only written the film, he＊s directed it as well. And to drag himself further from his comfort zone, the action has been relocated as far away as possible from the sun-scorched Mexican and Texan locales that provided such a memorable backdrop in his last two films. Instead, Wind River is set in frozen Wyoming on a , where the harsh conditions are often the least of people＊s problems.The film stars  as Cory Lambert, a professional game tracker who discovers the body of a Native American woman in the Wyoming wastes. There＊s evidence of a head trauma and sexual assault. Because the investigation of the potential murder of an indigenous person falls under national not state jurisdiction, the FBI takes control of the case, though the fact that it deploys green-around-the-gills agent Jane Banner () might indicate how seriously it takes such matters. Banner finds herself plunged into an alien environment populated by people who are wary of another white authority figure marching into their home and telling them what to do. She＊s forced to form an uneasy partnership with Lambert, who has ties to the reservation but a tragic past of his own.Sheridan wrote Wind River in a six-month burst, at the same time as Sicario and . Of the three scripts this was the one he was most protective over. Having enjoyed a close association with Native American groups for decades, he was keen for their presence in Wind River not to act as a backdrop for the film, their culture cherrypicked as set dressing for a conventional crime drama.※A lot of people come to  wanting something from their world,§ he says. ※The big joke on reservations is that the white guy shows up and goes ＆I＊m Native American, my grandmother is Cherokee＊. So if you show up on the reservation they＊ll ask you, ＆Is your grandmother Cherokee?＊ They＊ll take the piss out of you. Because that＊s what everyone says and there＊s nothing to disprove it.※It＊s one of the worst things you can do,§ he adds. ※To sit there and go, ＆Oh, so I＊ve dilettanted in your world and now I＊m going to take your culture＊§.In truth, Sheridan＊s own experience with Native American culture began in somewhat dilettante-ish fashion. In his 20s, having left the Texan ranch he grew up on to pursue acting in LA, he found himself ※looking for an outlet to solve the awfulness of this massive city§. After rejecting ※self-realisation§ and various modes of non-orthodox spiritualism 每 ※I just thought bullshit, bullshit, bullshit§ 每 he visited a sweat lodge with a Native American friend and became enamoured with the Lakota belief in the Great Spirit, an abstract higher power that looms over all. ※I was like, that is the most ridiculously beautiful religion I＊ve ever heard,§ he says.Still, Sheridan was concerned that what he had experienced was fake, a westernised confection of Native American culture designed to lure in gullible Californians. Out of work and living in a second-hand Jeep, he decided he had to find out if that was the case, so he travelled to the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. There he became friendly with some of the reservation＊s Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone population and witnessed first-hand the challenges faced by a community consigned to a small scrap of land. Poverty and unemployment were high, as was the crime rate. State police and FBI officers, legally unable to carry out arrests on the reservation itself, would wait on its outskirts, ready to pounce when anyone with an active warrant passed the threshold. Meanwhile, the communities outside the reservation proved hostile to their neighbours. Some business would refuse to serve Native Americans 每 Sheridan says he was turned away at a gas station purely because of his association with one of them. ※My buddy was like, ＆You＊re hanging out with the Indians. They ain＊t gonna sell you shit.＊ It was the only time in my life that I＊ve experienced anything close to racism. I was judged not for my race but for their race.§Sheridan says that as galling as anything to the inhabitants of Pine Ridge was that their situation 每 and those of indigenous groups everywhere 每 went largely unremarked upon by the rest of America. As someone working in Hollywood, Sheridan might be in a position to change that. ※I was told, ＆Hey, you＊ve got a pipeline. No one gives a shit about our story. In your business, you could actually tell our story. If you get a chance, would you do that? But you＊ve got to tell the worst of it. ＆Cos the worst of our story ain＊t our fault＊§It＊s difficult to escape the fact that the person telling this story is a non-Native. Critics have noted that, while Wind River features excellent performances from a number of actors of Native American heritage, most notably Gil Birmingham as a grieving father, the film＊s protagonists 每 the ones coming to the rescue of the reservation 每 are both white. ※The film bears a slight but inescapable whiff of cultural tourism,§  noted.At the same time Sheridan has managed to create a film that contends with the realities of reservation life, rather than what he says is the ※foolish, romantic notion of what it is to be Native American§. ※Like any other group they＊re a people struggling to survive, to create a life for their children, themselves. They＊re just facing extreme obstacles to do that, created, manifested and supported by our government,§ he says.Like the best crime writers, Sheridan has a knack for instilling into his pulpy genre films a sense of a bigger picture, examining the larger forces that loom over its characters 每 the threat of foreclosure on the family ranch that nudges bank robbers into a life of crime or the global narcotics trade that turns taxi-driving dads into doomed drug runners. At the heart of his films there＊s a sense of social consciousness that lingers long after the last bullet has been fired. Similarly, the firing of those bullets has far more grounding in the real world than the stylised shootouts of most genre fare. In Sheridan＊s films, violence flares up unexpectedly and painfully.※When you＊re looking at violence, you can dramatise it or you can capture it,§ he explains. He prepared for one major shootout in Wind River by watching three years worth of LAPD footage of gunfights. ※The longest I saw was 30 seconds§, he says. ※Our perception of: ＆You duck down behind the thing and I duck down over here and we shoot＊, it doesn＊t exist. These things are sudden and violent and over before they start. And they＊re dirty and messy 每 people don＊t always die with the first bullet or the second or the fourth or the fifth. So I wanted to capture the realism of that. I didn＊t want to glorify that.§If Sheridan＊s hyper-naturalistic approach marks Wind River out from the neo-western pack, it＊s matched beat-for-beat by the film＊s ominous, lurching score, composed by  and his longtime wingman Warren Ellis, who also made the music for Hell or High Water. Sheridan is delighted by the result of their latest collaboration 每 ※it  the film. You listen to it and feel like you＊ve watched the film,§ 每 but was rather taken aback by when he visited the pair＊s studio to watch its creation.※Where they record is just outside Brighton, on this little farm. So I fly in and I＊m all jetlagged. And they＊re like, ＆Give us two minutes while Nick and Warren get everything set up＊. So I＊m sitting outside on a table and there＊s a cat sitting there. And I swear, the cat＊s this fucking big [he places his hand at chest height]. I＊m looking at this giant cat, and I＊m like, ＆Is this the jetlag? Am I having some kind of depth perception problem? Or is that cat fucking three feet tall?＊ Warren Ellis, one of the most revered musicians of the past fucking 50 years, walks up and says, ＆Hey Taylor, we＊re ready for you.＊ And I said, ＆I have to ask, is that a lion? What the fuck is that?＊ And he goes, ＆Oh, it＊s a really big cat, mate.＊ I＊m like ※It＊s a really big cat?§ And he goes, ※Well, we＊ve got really big mice!§He widens his eyes, appearing genuinely rattled by the experience. It seems that in the end it was only Nick Cave＊s three-foot cat that could leave Taylor Sheridan lost for words.Wind River is released on 8 September.																																											"

"ver the decades, artists have made concept albums about everything from the  to the  to the Ravenskill Rebel Militia＊s revolt against the rule of Emperor Nafaryus of the dystopian Great Northern Empire of the Americas in 2285 (US prog-metal band Dream Theater＊s 2016 quadruple album , if you＊ve got two hours and 10 minutes to spare). But few artists have alighted on a topic quite as tricky as that which drives the National＊s seventh studio album. Virtually every song on Sleep Well Beast concerns itself with the bleak minutiae of middle age: feelings of regret, relationships becoming careworn and 每 especially 每 unignorable cracks appearing in a marriage.It＊s not even a divorce album in the vein of Dylan＊s Blood on the Tracks or Bj?rk＊s Vulnicura. Nothing as dramatic as that. It deals not in fury and vengeance, but passing moments of eye-rolling frustration and sighing ennui; not in cataclysmic, rupturing rows but grumbling discontent and odd spasms of self-flagellation; not in catastrophic descents into alcoholism or substance abuse, but vague worries about boozing and smoking weed, not least the fact that they＊re not leavening life＊s load in the way they once did. ※Let＊s just get high enough to see our problems,§ suggests a song called Day I Die; ※nothing I do makes me feel different,§ complains I＊ll Still Destroy You. These are the kind of subjects that inform umpteen novels but not many rock or pop songs, and you can see why. The emotions involved are pretty universal and potent but they＊re also complex and nuanced, hard to distill into four minutes and a few verses without seeming inconsequential or self-indulgent: why have you written a song about this? In comparison, relating the saga of the Ravenskill Rebel Militia＊s revolt against Emperor Nafaryus in 2285 looks like a doddle. So it＊s to the immense credit of the National＊s frontman Matt Berninger and his co-writer Carin Besser (who, intriguingly, also happens to be his wife), that the listener to Sleep Well Beast never feels as if they＊ve been cornered at a party by an over-sharer keen to fill you in on their many woes. Berninger and Besser are very good at both summoning evocative images 每 the faded childhood memory of ※your mother＊s arms when she was young and sunburned in the 80s§ 每 and in hitting a very realistic, muted tone, amplified by Berninger＊s understated baritone voice. The songs on Sleep Well Beast are stuffed with lines that sound like they would be muttered under the breath in real life, whether they＊re dealing with helpless despair at the state of the world 每 ※I＊m at a loss, I＊m at a loss, I＊m losing grip, the fabric＊s ripped,§ complains the title track 每 or with more domestic matters. ※Goodbyes always take us half an hour,§ complains the narrator of Nobody Else Will Be There on leaving a party. ※Can＊t we just go home?§ Nuanced, understated, restrained: you could apply the same adjectives to much of the music here, which turns out to be rather more of a mixed blessing. There are moments when listening to Sleep Well Beast＊s preponderance of stately, atmospheric ballads, flecked with delicate electronics or subtle orchestration, can feel not unlike watching a long, moody, critically acclaimed film drama, possibly starring Casey Affleck: you find yourself simultaneously applauding its elegance and the evident thought and craftsmanship that went into making it, while quietly wishing it would get a move on.When it does, it＊s fantastic. The psychedelic distorted guitar churn of Turtleneck; the fluttering, disorienting I＊ll Still Destroy You 每 a song on which the oft-deployed line about the National being a kind of American analogue to Radiohead makes a kind of sense 每 and, particularly, the single The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness, a song that feels kaleidoscopic and in contrast to the National＊s more usual tendency to shade their music in monochrome, momentarily shifting the mood away from claustrophobic gloom. The latter crams a lot into four minutes 每 twinkling synthesisers, a soaring pop chorus, spasmodic retorts of fuzz guitar, a stinging solo, an appealingly ungainly take on a funk breakbeat 每 and sees a band who deal largely in muted delicacy forgetting themselves for a moment and letting go. For all Sleep Well Beast＊s considerable and undoubted strengths, it is hard not to wish they＊d let go just a little more often.																																											"
"＊s Belle de Jour is 50 years old and back in UK cinemas with all its creamy elegance and scabrous humour intact. With co-writer , Bu?uel creates a secret theatre of erotic shame. The only thing that really dates the film is a startling moment when someone reads aloud a newspaper headline about . It＊s the one moment in Bu?uel＊s career when his surrealism was unintentional.This is the story of S谷verine, played by , the beautiful, bored young wife of a wealthy Parisian surgeon, who submits to her conjugal duties rarely and unwillingly, but becomes a high-class prostitute during the day, answering only to the name Belle de Jour and experiencing a secret erotic martyrdom, all deeply bound up with childhood abuse which resurfaces in the form of disturbing flashbacks. These Bu?uel coolly intersperses with her dreams and reveries, which appear to take place in the chateau and grounds of some Sadeian romance.Deneuve has an extraordinary and almost translucent paleness, a ghostlike moon of a face, as abstracted as a sleepwalker. The boorish attentions of her husband＊s leering friend Husson (Michel Piccoli) and the indiscreet chatter of his girlfriend alert her to the fact that exist in Paris, where she could offer her expensive services. After a nervous introduction to Madame Ana?s (Genevi豕ve Page), who presides over a discreet establishment, S谷verine becomes an accomplished professional, working only in the afternoons, with some amazing white lingerie as intricate as ecclesiastical vestments. She is much prized by the clientele as a ※pearl§: the Madame explains the vulgar term to the others by grinningly miming a darning needle. Bu?uel alludes to her reputation later by showing S谷verine decorously practising embroidery in her respectable home.The customers don＊t just want sex 每 they want the fantasy of being popular, of being attractive, of being the life and soul of some imaginary afternoon party as they incessantly call for champagne that is invariably too warm. Some want masochistic roleplay fantasies. One grand gentleman, a distinguished gynaecologist, wants to be humiliated, like a servant (or like Zero Mostel with his little old lady in The Producers). Here is the bizarre pantomime of sex, from which Bu?uel often subtracts the eroticism. To quote the old maxim, they are like the dancers who look insane if you can＊t hear the music. S谷verine＊s hoodlum client Marcel (Pierre Cl谷menti) looks at her off-camera naked body and weirdly murmurs: ※Shame you only have two of them ＃§Sometimes there are moments that might not be imaginary. S谷verine visits a chateau with grounds like the one she saw in her dreams, to participate in an erotic ritual for a wealthy recluse. We see S谷verine and her husband alone on a weirdly empty beach, and for a moment it isn＊t clear if this is another dream or if they have just taken a holiday. But the keys to it all are the two disquieting moments when S谷verine is assailed by memories of her childhood. In one she is being abused and molested by a man and too scared to cry out. In another, she is in church, refusing to take communion, clearly because she feels defiled by this unseen grownup. She is not in a state of grace. And now, decades later, she can make amends by abasing and degrading herself. Bu?uel cleverly introduces the character of Madame Anais＊s 13-year-old niece in one scene, and for a woozy moment, it isn＊t clear if this is another flashback to S谷verine＊s youth.And above all this, there is a shrewd commentary on the hypocrisy of social relations and sexual politics. Bu?uel invites us to ponder the transgression of a respectable woman secretly being a prostitute in the afternoons. But wait. How about a respectable gentleman secretly visiting a prostitute in the afternoon? That happens all the time. Quite normal. The gender stereotype opposition feels like the bowler-hatted man in the Magritte painting seeing his own back in the mirror. A strange, and captivating film.																																											"
"Late-night hosts on Tuesday addressed Donald Trump＊s controversial decision to rescind the ※Dreamers§ program, protecting the children of illegal immigrants, as well as his fumbling response to  and the administration＊s continued saber-rattling with regard to the . ※While Harvey＊s a natural disaster that seems to be bringing people together in very heartwarming ways, there＊s a manmade disaster unfolding in Washington right now because the Trump administration has announced they＊re ending the , or Daca,§ Stephen Colbert began.※The thing is, the vast majority of Americans like this program, so by canceling it Trump has stepped in some steep Daca,§ he continued. ※Even though his decision is unpopular, Trump bravely stepped up, then cringed back, and had somebody else announce it. That someone was attorney general and turnip-that-learned-to-hate Jeff Sessions.§Colbert showed footage of the press conference in which Sessions said the Dreamers weren＊t ※bad people§ and that the decision to end the program was not meant to ※disrespect§ or ※demean§ them.※You＊re right, Jeff,§ Colbert quipped. ※Deporting innocent children does not mean they＊re bad people. It means you＊re a bad person.§He went on: ※These Dreamers, they aren＊t the only ones being hurt. In fact, a recent study estimated that terminating Daca would cost the federal government $60bn and reduce economic growth by $280bn in the next ten years. Wow, Trump really is a dealmaker.§Colbert then did his best impression of Trump, mocking his negotiating tactics: ※I＊ll trade you 800,000 productive young people and, wait, $280bn, for nothing. Final offer.§Seth Meyers also addressed the president＊s decision to terminate the program, but began by discussing Trump＊s response to the tragedies afflicting Houston in the wake of .He said: ※On top of everything else he＊ll face in the next several months 每 the budget, the debt limit, North Korea＊s nuclear program 每 Trump has had to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.§※To be fair to Trump, we don＊t need elbow grease from our president in times of tragedy,§ Meyers said. ※We need their inspirational words, but even there, Trump wasn＊t quite up to the task.§Meyers then showed clips of the president making a speech in Houston, mentioning the ※great turnout§ and thanking people for coming to see him.※What is wrong with you?,§ Meyers asked. ※You＊re the president, not a standup comic. But of course, as quick as he was to praise himself, Trump is even quicker to needlessly attack others, as he did on Saturday when he was praising emergency responders for their heroic work and, out of nowhere, took this false, gratuitous swipe at the media.§Trump, in a clip that aired on television, said responders had gone into the winds the media was not willing to confront.※Of course, the media was on those choppers with the coast guard during many of those rescues, which is why you saw those rescues ,§ Meyers said. ※And the coast guard and the media weren＊t the only ones braving dangerous conditions to save lives. There were also countless emergency responders like Houston-area paramedic Jesus Contreras. Contreras is protected from deportation under the Obama-era program known as Daca. He spent six straight days rescuing people from floodwaters in Houston, so how did the president thank him?§ ※Well, today Trump announced that he was rescinding Daca, supposedly with a six-month delay to allow Congress to pass legislation to replace it,§ Meyers explained. ※Trump＊s decision throws the lives of nearly 800,000 Americans who were brought here as children, and who work here and go to school here, into chaos.§Meyers continued: ※To be clear, Daca recipients were brought here as children, have known no other country, pay taxes, have no criminal record, and are as American as anyone else living here.§※So, a president who backed himself into a corner by catering to the racial resentments of his base is now needlessly throwing the lives of hundreds of thousands of hardworking Americans into chaos,§ Meyers said. also discussed some of the latest news coming out of the White House, principally North Korea＊s escalating nuclear program and the response to it from representatives of the administration.※You know that saying: find something you love and do it as much as possible,§ Noah began. ※Well, North Korea＊s problem is that what they love doing is testing nuclear weapons.§He showed cable news coverage explaining that the country＊s most recent nuclear test was its sixth, amplifying international concerns about Kim Jong-un＊s nuclear capabilities.※The whole thing that the world has spent the last 25 years to prevent  from getting, now it has,§ Noah said. ※Both a missile that can reach the United States and a thermonuclear bomb, a bomb more powerful than Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.§※Now, coming after multiple warnings from the White House to cut this shit out, North Korea＊s new nuclear test was a huge provocation,§ he continued. ※And the Trump team got bigly provoked.§Noah showed a speech given by the US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, in which she said North Korea was asking for war. He also aired footage of the defense secretary, James Mattis, stating that, while it did not intend to do so, the US had the ability to annihilate North Korea.※But look, there＊s no need to freak out,§ the host added. ※That＊s just the United Nations person and the Pentagon guy. The real time to panic is when you hear saber-rattling from the commander-in-chief. So I guess what I＊m saying is: panic.§Noah showed a brief clip in which a reporter asked Trump if he planned to attack North Korea, to which he responded: ※We＊ll see.§※We＊ll see? Dude, you don＊t Ryan Seacrest nuclear war! Will the planet be consumed in a radioactive hellfire, or will Fantasia take home this season＊s crown?§ Noah joked. ※We＊ll see.§																																											"
"e had to shut the river Tiber in Rome for this picture. It＊s expensive to shut down a whole river, but this was for the  1997 autumn/winter campaign, so we had the budget for it. You can＊t see them, but there are about 10 people in the water, setting fire to bales of hay covered in kerosene to try and make it look misty. We had to shoot it in the last 10 minutes of daylight, so that the colours would be just right. I wanted it to be more than dusk 每 you could call it the gloaming.We＊d painted the boat the right colour. Everyone was lined up, ready to go, about four hours before we were due to shoot. But right at the last minute, the stylist decided to change the dress to a red one. That proved too vibrant. Then the boat started to sink and one of the guys throwing the bales of hay in the river forgot to let go and disappeared into the water after it. I＊d been planning it for three months but in the last five minutes of daylight, the entire scene descended into utter chaos.Mr [Patrizio] Bertelli, the boss of , was standing there on the riverbank shouting at everyone. When he asked me if I＊d got the shot I said, ※No!§ and stormed off in a huff. We went back the next day. We closed the river again and worked on everything we＊d done wrong to get it right the second time around. When the film was developed it was exactly what I had wanted to achieve.I＊d seen two films growing up that influenced this shot: one was Andrei Rublev, by , and  by . Both have religious scenes of people floating down the river in the mist. I decided to do a homage to both films. I was also thinking a lot about Terrence Malick＊s . (If I were to choose a soundtrack for this shot, it would probably be from Cos足 fan tutte.)Back then, film stock was really oversaturated, because it was developed in the amateur market, so you gotthese bright, vivid colours. I was trying to achieve the opposite 每 I wanted everything to be underexposed and muted, sombre.We found tiny lights used for car shots in movies to illuminate people＊s faces. We had just one, attached to the side of the boat; that was our only lighting. To get the shot, we had to aim for this one moment when there was a perfect balance between the strength of that artificial light and the strength of the dying sun. Two months later, I discovered Photoshop, with which I could have done the whole thing in just two minutes.A photo from this shoot . The Museum of Modern Art and the V&A had already asked to have the photos in their permanent collections, so they were elevated above just magazine shots. What you＊re looking for, working with anyone from Beyonc谷 to David Beckham to Bj?rk, is a moment of spontaneity. You don＊t want the photograph to feel staged. To do that you have to read each situation. Over the years you develop a bunch of skills. With this picture, Amber Valletta, the model, had been sitting so still for so long, I think she got a kind of rigor mortis. She was probably also anxiously hoping the boat wasn＊t going to fill with water. Looking at some of the things I＊ve done, I remember the technical difficulties, the problems. But you create problems to overcome the boredom. Your parameter is basically a girl in a dress, and you do it every day. So you have to find a way to make it more interesting.Lancing, Sussex, 1968.

"A survey of more than 1,000 people working in UK publishing has found that more than 90% currently in the industry classify themselves as white British.Carried out between June and July, the  salary survey received 1,023 valid responses. The vast majority of respondents 每 84.6% - were female, and more than nine in 10 (90.4%) were white British. Four years ago, when research was last conducted, 81.8% of respondents were female, and 93.7% were white British.※I think publishers have been very proactive in trying to encourage diversity ＃ in their companies,§ said ＊s Suzanne Collier, pointing to Penguin Random House and Hachette as leaders in this field. ※But it is going to take a long time for this to take hold, and until that figure is reduced to about 60/40 we have not got true diversity.§In 2015, Spread the Word＊s Writing the Future report  and called for the trade to become ※less homogenised§, with former children＊s laureate Malorie Blackman speaking of ※being the sole face of colour at literary or publishing events§.Her comments were echoed later that year by the author Nikesh Shukla, : ※In publishing circles, I＊m often the only person of colour in a room and I＊m made to feel very aware of that. If we are to tackle this problem, people like me need to feel welcome. Everyone keeps saying: ＆I am not prejudiced, or racist.＊ But they won＊t say: ＆It is my responsibility as well to try and do better.＊§In the US last year, a survey by the multicultural children＊s publisher Lee & Low Books found that . At the time, publisher Jason Low commented on ※the tendency 每 conscious or unconscious 每 for executives, editors, marketers, salespeople and reviewers to work with, develop and recommend books by and about people who are like them§.Collier said that she could not see the situation shifting very quickly, but added: ※I think it will change in the next generation of people coming into publishing. Publishers have got to do more than tokenism. If all they recruit is one or two people from a diverse background, that is not enough.§Joy Francis, executive director of Words of Colour Productions, said: ※It is the chief executives who need to explain how, in this so-called global, diverse landscape, they can manage to be so undiverse... this is an endemic, industry-wide problem. And it＊s beyond saying ＆the ball is in their court＊. The ball is cemented to their court, because no one seems to be paying careful enough attention to these issues. Everyone from the police force to advertising is being held to account, so why aren＊t they? What is their excuse?§Ruth Harrison, director of Spread the Word, said that it was ※good to see the diversity figures improving within the industry even if from a very low level§.※Our view is that an increase in diversity across the board in the publishing industry and especially at commissioning level will see more writers of diverse backgrounds coming through,§ said Harrison, adding: ※We＊re looking forward to the time when it is not exceptional to have commissioning editors or CEOs who are people of colour, and likewise ＃ usual to have bestseller authors and award winners who are writers of colour.§The survey also found that the average overall salary in publishing was ?32,228, up 11.7% on 2013, and that the average starting salary had also risen, to ?20,470 from ?17,775 in 2013. ※This is what salary transparency does; it helps publishers realise that things are not acceptable and then they can rectify the situation,§ said Collier. ※The industry is improving, but it is a very slow climb up a very high mountain ＃ If entry-level salaries are poor compared to other industries, why would you work in book publishing?§Responses also indicated that men were still being paid more than women, with the current gender pay gap 15.7%. Where men and women were doing the same roles, the gender pay gap was ※negligible§, but of those men who responded, ※many men tended to be employed in management or senior roles, and many women appear to be in lower roles§.Collier said that 47.9% of male respondents earned above the average salary of ?32,228 compared with 31.5% of women: ※In 2013, the gender pay gap was 16%, up slightly from 15.4% in 2008, but improved on 18.1% in 2004. However, for an industry where 84.6% of respondents are women, it is disappointing that a gender pay gap occurs at all.§																																											"
"ne of the many problems with the overstuffed awards season we＊re now entering is that films with some element of prestige, at least on paper, are judged solely on their Oscar potential. The Mountain Between Us has been viewed from the outset as a major contender. There＊s the pairing of  and Idris Elba 每 check. The director Hany Abu-Assad, whose credits include two Oscar-nominated films 每 check. Based on a book 每 check. A premiere at the Toronto film festival 每 check. A fall release date 每 check. Oh, and a story that plays into the Academy＊s adoration of stories about survival 每 check.But entering the cinema with such lofty expectations does the film a major disservice. If judged through the lens of how Oscar-worthy it is, then it＊s a non-starter (which might explain some sniffy early reviews) but as an unpretentious and unashamedly mainstream romantic adventure, it＊s a solidly entertaining diversion, old-fashioned in its no-frills brand of storytelling and direction. Alex (Kate Winslet) is a photojournalist, on assignment for the Guardian, in a rush to get to her wedding. Ben (Idris Elba) is a surgeon in a rush to get to the operating room. But the pair find themselves grounded when a storm causes major delays and after a chance encounter, Alex hatches an unlikely plan: they will pay a local resident and charter a small aircraft over the snowy wilderness to Denver. Mid-air, tragedy strikes and their pilot has a stroke, causing them to crash. Both are injured, freezing and surviving on a small supply of ever-diminishing food. As they＊re forced to rely on each other to get out alive, an attraction starts to grow.There＊s something admirably to the point about the way The Mountain Between Us unfolds. It zips along at a tightly controlled pace and, as scripted by the About a Boy and Rogue One screenwriter Chris Weitz, the dialogue is refreshingly brisk and often quite witty. It doesn＊t take long for the pair to find themselves stranded and the crash that gets them there is choreographed with ferocious efficiency. Abu-Assad, known for Paradise Now and Omar, makes his English language debut here, and it might seem like a strange fit given the film＊s generic nature, but he handles the panicked set-pieces with ease.While the stakes are clearly high, there＊s something comforting about how the film avoids an overly grueling tone. It＊s an adventure but it＊s also a starry romance and there＊s a smooth handling of the two genres that makes it an easy, glossy ride, despite the situation. Given the fact that it＊s essentially a two-hander ( there＊s a dog as well, of course), it＊s all heavily reliant on the appeal of the two leads. Winslet, who tried and failed with the similar mushy throwback Labor Day, gives a committed, warm performance but it＊s Elba who really gets the chance to flex his often miscast movie star muscle. Despite his talents, he＊s been stuck in a string of thankless blockbusters from Prometheus to Pacific Rim to Star Trek: Beyond to this summer＊s The Dark Tower, but this is arguably his best mainstream film role to date. He＊s a charming romantic lead and there＊s a nice gender role flip-flop in the film, with his character defined as overly cautious and timid while Winslet is the reckless, adventurous type.The pair also have just about enough chemistry to make you root for them and even though the film starts to sag in the final stretch, there＊s an ending that works in spite of its predictability. In a film such as this, there＊s no room for cynicism. It＊s unsophisticated and hugely familiar (hardened viewers will spot the plot developments a mile off) but there＊s an earnest, simple satisfaction to be had, buoyed by two engaging star leads. Lower your expectations.																																											"
"ith a flurry of bullets, fists and fluttering white doves, John Woo offers a better yesterday: it＊s a raucously enjoyable return to the action-thriller style of his pre-Hollywood years, a cheerfully cartoony ass-kicking bromance between tough cop and falsely accused murder suspect in the manner of his classics like The Killer. There are parkour-style action sequences in crowded streets, snipers whose gun barrels emerge from billboard hoardings, cheesy emotional freeze-frames on expressive faces, a jazzy-melancholy sax theme, a scene in the subway which involves actually running on the tracks ahead of the train, and an old-fashioned jet-ski chase down a city river.The film is based on the Japanese pulp novel Hot Pursuit by Juko Nishimura, and particularly its cult 1976 movie adaptation starring the much-admired Ken Takakura (who played a yakuzain Ridley Scott＊s Black Rain, among many other credits), who died in 2014 and to whose memory John Woo has offered this remake in homage.The original was about a cop who goes on the run after being fitted up on a corruption charge; Woo now makes him a maverick lawyer and also makes him Chinese 每 perhaps in tribute to the original movie＊s colossal popularity in China. It is set in Osaka, where Du Qiu, played by Hanyu Zhang, is a Chinese-born lawyer who has just quit his job as a top-ranking consigliereto hatchet-faced big pharma boss Sakai (played by another Japanese icon, Jun Kunimura) and his creepy, deadbeat son Hiroshi (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi). Sakai suspects this man knows rather too much about the firm＊s shady dealings and needs to have him taken out. He already employs two contract killers, both addicted to the company＊s PCP-style product: Dawn (Angeles Woo, daughter of John) and Rain (Ha Ji-won), who uncork a ferocious slaying at the top of the movie. Rain meets and slightly falls for Du Qui as they banter knowingly about old films.Du Qui is framed for murder when he wakes from a drugged sleep to find a dead woman in bed next to him. He goes on the run, and two officers are on his trail: Yamura, played by Masaharu Fukuyama (also to be seen here in Toronto in The Third Murder) and his wide-eyed partner, Rika, nicely played by Nanami Sakuraba. But there is someone else taking an interest in Du Qiu 每 a mysteriously flirtatious woman (Stephy Qi) who is the widow of a scientist employed by the corporation, a man driven to anguish by the hideous properties of the top-secret drug he was forced to develop. It is this woman＊s backstory that offers the most uproarious and surreal moments. Her late husband＊s death coincided, in the most macabre way, with their wedding and, like an action-movie Miss Havisham, she now keeps her bloodstained white gown in a shrine-like room.Manhunt zooms and crashes along like a stick-shift car, with Woo at the wheel careening between action set pieces, broad comedy, champagne-swilling party scenes, flashbacks and swoony emotional moments. Of course it is a little absurd, and audiences are entitled to ask how Du Qui has not been implicated in Sakai＊s drug conspiracy, especially as the bad guy clearly thinks that his lawyer knows enough to require taking out. But this film offers something that is never in sufficiently plentiful supply: fun.																																											"

"rom Julia Donaldson＊s mouse who ※took a stroll through the deep dark wood§ to the classic Rosie＊s Walk, the journey is an archetype of children＊s literature. The Italian artist Francesca Sanna, however, who has won  prize for most exciting newcomer to children＊s picture book illustration, chose a rather tougher trek for her debut title: that of a mother and her two children who are fleeing a war.Sanna＊s The Journey opens with an ordinary family playing on a beach by the city, using images that are redolent of classic fairytales, and simple text told from a child＊s perspective. But ※one day the war took my father§, and eventually the mother takes her children away to what she tells them will be a ※safe place§. They face hurdles 每 an angry border guard, magnified to the size of a monster, turns them back; they hide in the forest; they cross the sea. ※There is not much space and it rains every day, but we tell each other stories. Tales of terrible and dangerous monsters that hide beneath our boat ready to gobble us up if the boat capsizes!§Speaking in London before receiving her ?5,000 award, Sanna said she was inspired by her conversations with several refugees, in particular two young girls she met in a refugee centre in Italy. ※Meeting them really made me think that being a refugee is a situation you find yourself in, not who you are,§ she said. ※I took inspiration from the real stories of people I met around Switzerland [where she was studying for a masters＊] and Italy.§She didn＊t know, immediately, that her story would be a children＊s book, but when she settled on the idea of a journey, it was clear to her that the medium was perfect. ※I didn＊t think about writing a book that is issue-based. But children are exposed to the topic 每 they see pictures from the news of refugees, and of the tragedies in the Mediterranean. So, the space for a discussion about this is important.§Translated into 14 languages, The Journey has also been shortlisted for the CILIP Kate Greenaway medal and won the US Society of Illustrators＊ gold medal, the Amnesty Cilip Honour and Spain＊s Premi Llibreter. Sanna beat four other illustrators to take the latest award, which was established to honour the .Judge and Gruffalo illustrator Axel Scheffler said it was ※the most inventive and original§ of the entries. ※The fear the family experiences is strongly expressed in the graphic language of the book, which is beautifully designed,§ said Scheffler. Julia Eccleshare, the chair of judges, said that Sanna＊s words and pictures work perfectly together to tell a story that ※will move all readers, whatever their age§. Sanna herself said that children and adults reacted in very different ways to her story 每 in particular to the image of the mother weeping while her children sleep, alongside the child＊s thoughts that: ※Mother is with us and she is never scared.§※For me it is important to play with what the pictures and the text can say 每 a picture can illustrate what the text says, but it can also do the opposite,§ said Sanna. ※Children explain to me here why she＊s scared. It＊s quite obvious to them that the mother is scared, that she is protecting her children.§ Parents, however, have been surprised that she has revealed the mother＊s true feelings to children.Sanna is now planning to tackle the topic of integration for refugees in her next book. ※That＊s a huge aspect of the topic of immigration, which I couldn＊t cover in The Journey,§ she said.Eccleshare said that the judges were all excited to see what Sanna does next. ※Over his long career, Klaus Flugge has always been ready to publish groundbreaking books, and many of those, though deemed challenging on publication 每  for example 每 are today recognised as classics. It is fitting that the prize in his name is this year going to Francesca,§ she said.																																											"
", the celebrated cinematographer who is the subject of ＊s new play, once wrote that if you submitted your life to a decent script editor, it would be rejected on structure alone. While Johnson＊s play is a bit bumpy, it movingly records the fragmentation of Cardiff＊s Alzheimer＊s-affected memory and yields a riveting performance from Robert Lindsay. We see Cardiff in his declining years when his son, Mason, has set up the garage of his dad＊s Buckinghamshire home as a sanctum where he can finally write his memoirs. Copies of Cardiff＊s favourite paintings and lustrous images of the female stars with whom he worked adorn the walls. But although Mason engages a young woman, Lucy, to act as both carer and typist, Cardiff prefers to re-enact the past rather than record it. Not only Lucy and Mason but also Cardiff＊s wife, Nicola, increasingly become figures from his crowded cinematic memory leading at one stage to a re-creation of the hazards of location shooting for . Most people＊s minds, as they grow older, become a jumble of past and present: Johnson suggests this is doubly so if they have had a career like Cardiff＊s and also have Alzheimer＊s. The problem is that because Cardiff worked so much with the famous, the play doesn＊t inspire the immediate empathy of a work like Florian Zeller＊s , with its more mundane hero. If it finally touches our hearts, it is because it reveals the cost to those close to Cardiff of his final decline and because of its recognition that no life achieves a perfect narrative arc, and is instead more akin to shooting a film than watching one. Lindsay is amazing to watch. He evokes the casual charm that made Cardiff magnetic to the women he worked with as well as the professional obsessiveness that led him to experiment with prisms and seek to reproduce the textures of a Vermeer or Renoir on screen. Above all, Lindsay＊s performance has a humanity that suggests Cardiff＊s cinematic memories are accompanied by a spasmodic grasp of reality. shifting between Cardiff＊s wife and his idealised Katharine Hepburn, Rebecca Night as the carer who becomes his memorialised Marilyn Monroe and Barnaby Kay as the son who turns into Humphrey Bogart and Arthur Miller, also show the pangs of becoming part of someone else＊s disordered dreams.

" (BBC1) is a programme about six people with physical disabilities embarking on a 900 mile journey, which gives the lie to the idea that disabled people are or should be treated in any way as a homogenous group. Vicky lost her leg two years ago in a rollercoaster accident, and the shock of it has been as much a life-changer as having a leg amputated. Charlie, set for life as a rugby pro until he broke his leg so badly he chose to have part of it amputated to free him from continued pain, feels ※like a fraud§ for leading a relatively unaffected life. Lou faces the complications that come from having an ※invisible§ disability 每 a degenerative condition that＊s making her increasingly deaf. Steve is a wheelchair user paralysed from the chest down since he broke his neck in a fall. His main worry is ※being the weak link in the group.§ Pride, dignity and the conventions of masculinity are a complicated set of factors in constant negotiation. ※You never want to coddle him,§ says Charlie as they contemplate the challenge of crossing a particularly mountainous area, inaccessible by any vehicle, for which Steve will need the greatest help. ※It＊s a difficult dynamic, because someone like that doesn＊t want help from someone like me.§ Biker Andy lost his arm in a work accident, but it is the phantom limb pain that most constrains him. ※It never stops,§ he says, lying back despairingly after an acute attack. ※It never leaves me.§ Mary has dwarfism, though she identifies depression as her main problem in life, and at first feels alienated from the group because she has not been through a life-changing event: ※I don＊t know any different. I＊m just living how I was born§.As they travel the Ho Chi Minh trail, it becomes clear that - as campaigners have been trying to explain for years 每 that much of what we call disability is socially constructed. In a mildly modified jeep, it doesn＊t matter how many working limbs drivers Steve or Vicky have. It only matters that reading directions is not Mary＊s strong suit. It is the steps that slow Steve＊s progress down to the river. If there had been a ramp, he＊d have been faster than the rest of them. Strangers＊ stares are a function of ignorance 每 again, an alterable state 每 while a frank inspection by children early on is a result of simple curiosity. Once they have understood what＊s going on, they invite Mary to share one of their bikes, because she is the same size as them.These points are never pushed, nor is the evident bravery of the group. Instead, their backstories are parcelled out gradually as the travelogue unfolds. It is altogether a rather beautiful, respectful and moving thing.Elsewhere,  (ITV2) is not.

It is impossible to distinguish between them; they are sixteen permatanned, hairless bodies that look to have been moulded by Zeus himself. They have names but I have forgotten most of them. As best I recall, the girls are Chanterelle, Spotify, Labia, Babe, Babes, Hun, Epoxy and Joan. To keep track of the men I had to resort to simple labels; there＊s the beefy one, beefier one, little one, Welsh one, tattooed one, posh one, northern one and another one.They pull stuff through sand, get drunk, lose their pants, and wonder what life would have been like in the days of ancient Rome. ※I＊ve never lived that far back§ says one of the guys. ※I＊ve only seen lampposts and pavements§ ※Did they have electric?§ muses Labia. ※No,§ says Epoxy who, much like the sisters of Greek myth who passed their single shared tooth and eye back and forth, must have shared possession of the team＊s single brain cell. ※Wifi, though?§ replies Labia.※It＊s like poetry, isn＊t it?§ says their dominus, played with increasing confidence by actor and comedian Tom Bell. ※I can hear them on the wind.§ I can hear Russell Maximus Crowe roaring.

"aturday 18 July 1545 was fish day on the Mary Rose.?The crew ate on the cramped gun deck, sitting wherever they could find room. Fish days were not popular, but on this Saturday the meal provided a?welcome respite from frantic activity, as all 185 soldiers, 30 gunners and 200 mariners on board were readying the ship for war.The next day the ship sank. A chance gust of wind caused the vessel, overloaded with artillery, to keel over. No?more than 40 men survived, out of?a?crew of 415. In the face of the tragedy,?Henry VIII is supposed to have exclaimed: ※Oh my gentlemen! Oh my gallant men!§ He could hear the cries of?the drowning sailors as he watched from the shore in?Portsmouth.The . In the wreckage, archaeologists have discovered the vertebrae of cattle and pigs, as well as thousands of fish spines, strewn among the remains of the wicker baskets that once held them. These were the residue of the ship＊s stores of beef, pork and cod.Such evidence has shown the extent to which England was trading across Europe and beyond, even in the 16th century. Lizzie Collingham＊s book, , is an energetic and refreshing account of a little considered aspect of British history. By examining what people ate, Collingham skilfully provides a full account of complex, even chaotic international connections.She constructs her book around 20 meals: each chapter tells a slightly different story about the empire, centred on a particular dish. It＊s hard to think of a more ingenious way of treating imperial history. Climates and ethnic groups appear with almost bewildering speed. Chapters deal with , the colonisation of New Zealand and the diet of 18th-century labourers in rural Lancashire. The range is dazzling.Purists may raise an eyebrow at the inclusion of several recipes, including ※Nellie Husanara Abdool＊s pumpkin and shrimp curry§, though budding chefs may well find the prescriptiveness useful: ※Add curry powder, brown sugar, thyme, salt and pepper. Stir and cook for another 15 minutes. Add 250ml of water and cook for 20每25 minutes until the pumpkin is soft.§ Yet , it should be clear, is supported by meticulous historical research.Using food as a way of understanding empire is highly effective. Food knows no barriers of race, gender or even time. The , a?specialty of west African cuisine, has?probably not changed across the centuries. Michel Jajolet de la Courbe, a French explorer and slave dealer, described a rice dish from west Africa in the late 17th century, in which he defined chillies as ※a green or red fruit, shaped like a cucumber, and with a?taste resembling that of pepper§.No account of food in the empire can?avoid references to the slave trade. The Africa-America sea route opened a?channel whereby ※a host of American plants and foodstuffs entered west African agriculture§. Trade, as always, is a two-way process. Forced labour was brutally taken from the African continent, which in return received a large range of American crops, particularly maize and manioc (cassava). Today, cassava is a mainstay of the west African diet. In Ghana, Nigeria, Togo, Angola and Cameroon maize is a staple, yet the earliest mention of maize in west Africa comes from a Portuguese document that lists it as being loaded on to slave ships bound for Africa. In the early days maize was even known as ※white man＊s grain§ in the Gold Coast.The necessities of the second world war are dealt with in the closing chapters of this wide-ranging book. For?the British working class, the restrictions of conflict actually improved their diet. Under , the minister for food, a programme of free school meals was introduced. Priority supplies of milk were provided for pregnant women and nursing mothers, while orange juice, milk and cod liver oil were given to the under-fives. Under this regime, rickets and vitamin deficiency diseases all but disappeared in Britain, and infant mortality rates declined.Better nutrition on the home front was, however, accompanied by such disasters as . There is little doubt that the imperial authorities were slow in dealing with this catastrophe. Ian Stephens, editor of?Calcutta＊s the Statesman newspaper, had to embark on an eight-week campaign attacking government indifference before Churchill＊s government finally acknowledged Bengal＊s plight.The war showed how even more connected disparate parts of the empire had become. As Collingham reveals, Britain ※was not a tiny island standing alone on the edge of Europe but the centre of a powerful network on which it drew for supplies of men, arms and ammunition, raw materials and, above all, food§. Nigerian supplies of tin and rubber from Sri Lanka were of crucial significance after Malaya had fallen to the Japanese; Collingham, with her characteristic eye for detail, tells us that Cyprus produced silk for parachutes.Of all the meals that represented British culture, perhaps none captured the imagination more than the Christmas pudding. It was the Victorians who firmly fixed the traditional plum pudding as a festive dish. ※The author of the ,§ Collingham writes, ※personified the plum pudding as a ＆blackamoor who derives his extraction from the spice lands＊.§ In the book＊s illustration, it even appeared as a portly black figure, clothed absurdly in medieval costume. The pudding was thought of as a national dish precisely because of the foreign nature of the ingredients of sugar, spice and dried fruits: ※an emblem of our commercial eminence§. This book＊s treatment of food in the empire is innovative and exciting; to bring such vibrancy to an old topic is a remarkable achievement. Kwasi Kwarteng is the author of  or call 0330 333 6846.

" is to star as a newspaper press baron in a BBC1 drama charting the competing fortunes of a liberal left broadsheet and a tabloid moving on from the phone-hacking scandal.The six-part series, Press, is the work of the  and  writer Mike Bartlett, who has promised a drama that interrogates why news is important and explores the ethical dilemmas reporters and editors face each day. It is also a series that, he has hinted, will do little to improve the sometimes battered reputation of journalists in the eyes of the wider public.Bartlett＊s tabloid is called the Post, his broadsheet, the Herald. Suchet will play the chairman and CEO of the Post＊s publisher, Worldwide News.Other casting at the Post includes , who plays the newspaper＊s newest reporter; , its news editor; and Ellie Kendrick, Meera Reed in Game of Thrones, as a junior reporter. Ben Chaplin, most recently in BBC1＊s Apple Tree Yard, will play the editor.Two actors who appeared in Bartlett＊s TV version of his play King Charles III will play Herald journalists. Charlotte Riley, who played Kate Middleton, has been cast as the deputy news editor while Priyanga Burford is the editor. Brendan Cowell, a rugged Australian actor often called the new Russell Crowe and familiar to Young Vic audiences after his roles in Yerma and , will play the news editor; and Al Weaver, a young church curate in Grantchester, will play an investigative journalist.Riley, who in real life is married to Tom Hardy, said Press was a ※truly brilliant§ piece of writing. ※Mike is a phenomenal storyteller and I am excited to be part of this project.§Filming for the series will begin in October. Piers Wenger, the controller of  drama, said: ※The newspaper business is part of Britain＊s identity and Mike＊s gripping series of crusading journalists in this ever-changing industry, brought to life by this brilliantly talented cast, make for a fresh, thrilling and utterly British contemporary drama.§It is a work of fiction but the Herald may not be a million miles from the Guardian given that Bartlett spent a day, three years ago, shadowing the paper＊s newsdesk.Bartlett was unavailable for interview but he has previously revealed snippets of what to expect. ※I＊d love to say it＊s going to restore journalists＊ reputations but I＊m not convinced it will,§ ※What it does do is interrogate why news is important and how we cover it. It＊s also very much a workplace drama set in a very distinct workplace in a time of uncertainty. I know that people might expect the liberal left broadsheet are the heroes and boo the tabloid but it＊s more complicated than that. Part of the fun is never letting an audience know which way the show sits.§ has a long and patchy history of portraying journalists on screen. The 1970s and 1980s US drama Lou Grant made newspapers look like one of the most exciting and noble careers it was possible to aspire to while Ken Barlow as editor of the Weatherfield Recorder made it less so.They are often written as obnoxious, overbearing, sleazy alcoholics which is why many journalists were pleased with Paul Abbott＊s 2003 drama, State of Play, which 每 wine at editorial meetings aside 每 more realistically depicted the working lives and concerns of newspaper journalists.Press will be directed by Tim Vaughan, also the director of Doctor Foster, and will, the BBC said, follow the lives of journalists ※as they attempt to balance work and play, ambition and integrity, amid the never-ending pressure of the 24-hour global news cycle and an industry in turmoil§.It will air on BBC1 at some point in 2018 and be shown after that in the US on the channel PBS Masterpiece.

"uliet Stevenson gives a typically excellent performance of bottled up shame and guilt as a woman haunted by the sins of her mother in this low-budget British drama. It＊s loosely inspired by the true story of Helga Schneider, whose mother Traudi abandoned her family in 1941 to work as a guard in .In , Helga settled in Italy; in the film she travels from London to Vienna with her granddaughter for a deathbed confrontation with unrepentant Traudi (chillingly played by Karin Bertling). The film is a little rough around the edges and occasionally lacks subtlety, but there is a powerful scene in which Traudi begs her great-granddaughter to try on her old SS uniform, which she has kept like a treasured wedding dress in the wardrobe all these years.

"aul Auster had not written a novel for seven years, and then he wrote one that came in at nearly 900 pages. Three of the other writers shortlisted for this year＊s Man Booker prize had never written one before 每 although to regard master fabulist George Saunders as a debutant simply because he has hitherto devoted his creative energies to the short form is something of a cheat. The other two 每  and  每 we can certainly allow, as well as noting that their novels, History of Wolves and Elmet, privilege the complicatedly unreliable stories of solitary children in solitary places, both made vulnerable by the violence of adults.In a shortlist that seems to reject conventional realism and celebrate precarious and unstable narratives, our half-dozen to watch is completed by Ali Smith＊s Autumn and Mohsin Hamid＊s Exit West. Smith＊s novel, written against the clock as the summer of Brexit unfolded last year, manages to capture the immediacy of a divided country while weaving in an echo of the prizewinning How to Be Both by revivifying a forgotten artist. Hamid＊s Exit West is a novel of migrants and refugees that slips the confines of particular reality by constantly crossing and recrossing the borders of genre and form.It＊s worth remarking that the shortlist doesn＊t represent 每 as sometimes happens 每 a rupture with the longlist. The novels that have fallen by the wayside, including Colson Whitehead＊s The Underground Railroad and Mike McCormack＊s Solar Bones, were also characterised by their willingness to take liberties with form, the better to unsettle their readers.Saunders＊s novel Lincoln in the Bardo takes the inhospitable narrative to an extreme; when the novel opens, the reader has no clue what＊s going on, and little in the way of footholds. Fragmentary, multi-vocal, buffeted by changes of scene, mood and tone, the narrative is an exercise in supreme irony: all this made-up stuff, and yet a real historical event 每 the death of Abraham Lincoln＊s son, Willie 每 is at its centre. Although it divided critics, one can see what compelled the Booker panel: set largely in an afterlife filled with sorrow, terror and love, it emerges as an enlarging and humane novel. Bookmakers certainly seem to have agreed, making the novel immediate favourite to win.In its theme of the responsibility that comes with power, and of the personal set against the vast crisis of the American civil war, Lincoln in the Bardo also resonates with contemporary socio-political preoccupations. And anxiety is present across this list: how we live, what binds us to one another, what constitutes identity in the midst of disintegration and displacement. Even Auster＊s 4321, which appears to be centred on an individual history and consciousness, yields to the idea of chance, to the arbitrariness of an apparently obvious trajectory, to chaos.As ever, the interests of the judging panel prove illuminating: this year, one can see how novelist and short-story writer Sarah Hall and Nabokovian Lila Azam Zanganeh may have championed narrative playfulness and indeterminacy, and how travel writer Colin Thubron would have significant things to say about the evocation of place. The chair, Baroness Lola Young, used to sitting on the boards of the National Theatre and the Southbank Centre as well as in the House of Lords, would have kept them in order. But perhaps most riveting is the figure of artist Tom Phillips, whose ※novel§ A Humument consists of an original text, repeatedly altered by deletion, collage and drawing, over the course of many decades. The idea of a piece of art that remains deliberately unfinished, hovering between forms, always ready to mutate, seems in some sense the presiding spirit of this fascinating shortlist 每 and might even point us towards the future of novel: a provisional artefact in a shifting culture.

"American heavyweights Paul Auster and George Saunders are to go head to head for this year＊s Man , as major names make way for two new faces on the 2017 shortlist.The judges, chaired by Baroness Lola Young, announced their shortlist of six titles on Wednesday morning. Alongside Auster and Saunders, the 29-year-old British debut novelist Fiona Mozley has secured a place in the final line-up, as did American first-timer Emily Fridlund.The two debuts are up against two previously shortlisted authors: Scottish author Ali Smith, who is in contention for a fourth time with , and UK/Pakistani writer , in which refugees can use strange black doors to escape to other parts of the world. Hamid was previously shortlisted for his 2007 novel The Reluctant Fundamentalist.But a host of award-winning writers failed to make the cut, with former Booker winner Arundhati Roy missing out on a place, as well as Sebastian Barry, Kamila Shamsie and Mike McCormack. British authors Zadie Smith and Jon McGregor also dropped out.American author Colson Whitehead＊s  was another high-profile casualty. It was the bookies＊ favourite, and had already won a string prestigious literary gongs, including the 2017 Pulitzer prize for fiction, the 2016 National Book Award for fiction and the . Waterstones fiction buyer Chris White was among those shocked by its absence. ※We＊re all used by now to the Booker judges delivering surprises but the omission of The Underground Railroad from the final six certainly ranks among the biggest shocks I＊ve witnessed. I think that, when we look back at 2017, we may see this as the one which got away,§ he said.Instead, judges selected short-story writer Saunders＊s first novel , which follows US president Abraham Lincoln as he visits the grave of his son Willie, and , a novel that judges called ※magisterial§, about a boy called Archibald Isaac Ferguson, whose life takes four simultaneous fictional paths.Mozley was picked for her first novel, the story of a man and his children who retreat to live in a copse in Yorkshire＊s West Riding, . Her fellow debut, the American novelist , focuses on an isolated 14-year-old as she grows up in a failing cult in the US＊s midwest.Young described the shortlisted titles as ※unique and intrepid books that collectively push against the borders of convention§.※Playful, sincere, unsettling, fierce: here is a group of novels grown from tradition but also radical and contemporary. The emotional, cultural, political and intellectual range of these books is remarkable, and the ways in which they challenge our thinking is a testament to the power of literature,§ she said.But with half of the authors from the US, judges were questioned at a press conference about the ※Americanisation§ of the UK＊s top literary award. The ?50,000 prize was opened up to US writers three years ago, and was .Ladbrokes immediately named Saunders the favourite to win the prize at 2/1. Hamid and Mozley came in second, at 4/1, while Auster was given odds of 5/1, and Fridlund and Smith both at 6/1.Young was clear that ※nationality is not an issue in terms of how we decide on a winner 每 it＊s what is in our opinion the best book in these six§. ※All we can say is that we judge the books submitted to us, and make our judgment not based on nationality or gender, but what is written on the pages,§ she said.Her fellow judge, the literary critic Lila Azam Zanganeh, added that less than 30% of the books submitted for the prize were by US writers, a drop on the previous year. ※I feel we are transcultural, increasingly,§ she said.The novelist Sarah Hall, who was also on the judging panel, said that an element that had emerged from each of the shortlisted titles was ※the idea of liminal spaces, whether that＊s moving doors, or taking down the walls of consciousness, or life§.※There is a sense in all six books that there are liminal spaces to which any reader can bring their own experiences,§ she said. ※Going from the longlist to the shortlist was tough,§ said judge and travel writer Colin Thubron. ※There were several novels one judge felt strongly about which they were gracious enough to drop in [the face of] opposition from others. We had give and take. But in general there is no book on the shortlist which I feel shouldn＊t be there.§The panel, completed with artist Tom Phillips, took six hours to narrow the field, in what was a ※pretty robust discussion§ according to Young.※There＊s no such thing as a perfect novel,§ said Hall. ※So as the books sustain the tests of technicality, of interiority, of strength of character, it becomes harder [to choose], because what is a perfect novel?§The winner will be announced on 17 October. by Paul Auster (Faber & Faber) by Emily Fridlund (Weidenfeld & Nicolson) by Mohsin Hamid (Hamish Hamilton) by Fiona Mozley (JM Originals, John Murray) by George Saunders (Bloomsbury) by Ali Smith (Hamish Hamilton)																																											"
"he invites have been sent for the opening night, the displays readied in 80 galleries spread over nine floors, and 24,000 tickets have sold out in a matter of minutes. For a few short days there is quiet.The calm will not last. In Cape Town, on one of the world＊s most recognisable waterfronts in the world, a vast new art museum, the biggest ever in , is about to open, creating the biggest buzz in the continent＊s collective creative world for many years.The  has already been described as ※Africa＊s Tate Modern§. This is, observers say, to underestimate its importance.Housed in a converted grain silo overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, against a backdrop of docks, the city and Table Mountain, the new museum is one of the most striking buildings to have been constructed in Africa. It is also the continent＊s first such institution devoted to contemporary art.※It really is significant ＃ [And] the significance is not just for my lifetime ＃ but in 200 or 300 years from now,§ said  a 36-year-old Zimbabwean artist whose work is being shown in one of the new museum＊s inaugural exhibitions.The museum, built with $38m (?29m) of private funds but open to the public, will house the collection of the German businessman , along with a series of temporary exhibitions. The opening, nine years after the project was launched, underlines the massive new global interest in African art. ※Before the first world war the most exciting artists were French; in the 1990s they were Chinese. Now the hot new place for contemporary art is Africa,§ ., where many of the continent＊s most important contemporary artists work and live, has a vibrant scene with successful dealers who have built a global presence.But there has been little public support or appreciation of contemporary artists and many struggle to find recognition.※[The new museum] gives an opportunity to archive the contemporary scene as it happens. In South Africa in particular we have had many, many artists over the decades whose work gets forgotten. A museum can create a narrative of the development of art. Galleries are more temporary, and a museum does not necessarily have the same interest in commercial gain,§ said Sisipho Ngodwana, associate at Stevenson Gallery.Not all are enthusiastic about the opening of the MOCAA.Speaking at the Johannesburg art fair last week, Mbadi Mdluli, a 40-year-old multidisciplinary artist and master＊s student in fine arts at Wits University said she knew little about the new museum. Mdluli contrasted the creative scene in Johannesburg, the commercial capital, with that in Cape Town, a city which despite deep social problems is often regarded as a playground for wealthy white locals and international tourists.The new museum will have top-end restaurants, cafes, shops and a 28-room . ※If the museum is in Cape Town it should stay there. It is a very different place to Joburg. In Cape Town there is a seriousness about the art. But almost anything goes here. It＊s a bit more real. Cape Town is really for those who can go to Europe and buy a freaking Picasso,§ Mdluli said.Others from elsewhere in Africa also had some misgivings.※People say the museum a big deal, but for me it＊s a tiny idea,§ said Daudi Karungi, a dealer who runs a gallery in Kampala, Uganda, and was exhibiting at the art fair. ※You do a beautiful museum but who is going to go there? This is not Europe where people go to museums all the time. What is urgent is the education of artists, the public, critics and collectors. People should celebrate it but it doesn＊t mean it will make a significant difference.§Mark Coetzee, the director of the MOCAA, defended the institution against charges of elitism.※A historical museum talks about the past, a contemporary museum speaks about now, the present ＃ Museums are not places for observation of beauty; they are central to political debates and that＊s where artists want to be,§ Coetzee, raised in Cape Town, said.Politicians in South Africa confronted with the challenge of dealing with deep poverty, minimal growth and entrenched inequality have not always appreciated contemporary artists.In 2012, Jacob Zuma for displaying a supposedly indecent painting of the beleaguered president which showed him in a pose reminiscent of Lenin, but with his genitals exposed. Some condemned the artist as racist.Herman Mashaba, the mayor of Johannesburg, which many critics say are important works of contemporary art.South Africa is entering a period of political instability, with a bitter contest under way to succeed Zuma at the head of the African National Congress (ANC), the party which led the liberation struggle against the repressive, racist apartheid regime and has ruled for more than two decades. Coetzee believes MOCAA is a response to South Africa＊s deep problems that is not only justified, but essential.※People say who cares about art? Who needs it?§ the 53-year-old art world veteran said. ※But contemporary museums ＃ have become a public meeting place where you are challenged by ideas you can hopefully learn from ＃ where you can discuss taboos and have a conversation about something that is different to you without killing each other.§ The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary  Africa opens on 22 September.

"From places of worship to industrial complexes, government buildings to a yurt, more than 800 buildings in the capital will open their doors to the public this weekend (16-17 September) as architecture festival  celebrates its 25th year with its biggest event to date.This year＊s highlights include the Metropolitan police＊s New Scotland Yard headquarters, which was recently revamped by renowned architects AHMM; an urban farm in Waterloo; One Blackfriars, nicknamed ※the Vase§ (London＊s newest skyscraper) and  at the architects＊ Battersea studio.For the first time since its launch, every  borough will be participating in the event, with Kingston-upon-Thames opening the doors to a number of properties, including a 16th-century conduit house and the premises of a century-old funeral directors.Among the household name buildings and Open House regulars are the BT Tower, William Morris＊s Red House, the Cheesegrater and the Gherkin, while lesser-known architectural gems include a 1930s Romford house designed by London Zoo penguin pool architect Berthold Lubetkin, and Barretts Grove in Stoke Newington, a strikingly modern block of six apartments with wicker balconies protruding from its red brick facade..Four  stations will also be open to visitors, offering the last chance to see them in relative solitude before they open for service next year. The free event was started by Open City founding director Victoria Thornton in 1992, and last year saw more than a quarter of a million people visiting properties or attending a walk, talk or tour across the capital. The concept has also spread internationally, with now held in more than 35 cities across five continents.  and  are the latest cities to adopt the concept, holding their first events this autumn.As well as celebrating architecture, Open House is founded on the importance of the public realm. ※We want Londoners to speak as confidently about their built environment as they do about books, music and art,§ says Open House director Rory Olcayto. ※Getting the public inside great buildings and visiting places that are well-designed is the best way to do it.§ 																																											"
"omeone at the probation office had seen the Hatchetman tattoo on the back of 30-year-old Laura King＊s neck. She had worn her hair up, revealing the figure of a . The next time she checked in, six months into her sentence, her probation officer informed her that she needed to speak to someone from the gang taskforce.Laura King, a musician from northern Virginia, had been serving probation for driving under the influence 每 but now, she suddenly found herself accused of being a gang member.Hatchetman is the logo for Psychopathic Records, the Michigan-based record label founded by Insane Clown Posse, an alternative hip-hop duo known for their clown makeup and violent, occult-themed lyrics. , have formed a tightly-knit community with distinctive characteristics: they address each other as ※ninja§, wear face paint and have a particular appreciation for Faygo, an inexpensive soda brand from Michigan.Juggalos consider themselves a family. The US government considers them a gang. The Juggalos will be fighting back on 16 September,  to tell the world about what they are, and what they＊re not.In 2011, the FBI＊s National Gang Intelligence Center released  that listed Juggalos as a ※hybrid gang§ 每 that is, a gang that crosses the racial and cultural lines around which traditional gangs tend to form. The Juggalos are ※loosely-organized§, according to the report, but are ※rapidly expanding into many US communities§. The section ends with a photograph of a woman in clown makeup, holding a gun.There have indeed been cases of Juggalo-related violence. In 2008, two men 每 one of whom had a Hatchetman tattoo on his forearm 每  near a construction site in Seattle. Five years later in Las Vegas, Stephen Giles, a 21-year-old , attacked a man with a meat cleaver.※But if a guy commits a robbery and he＊s got a Metallica tattoo, nobody jumps on that,§ said Scott Donihoo, who runs a Juggalo fan site called .Donihoo has been a fan of  for nearly two decades. Every year, he attends the Gathering of the Juggalos, Psychopathic Records＊ annual outdoor festival, which features carnival rides and professional wrestling alongside live concerts. He sees the group whenever they tour near his home in north Texas. Donihoo estimates that he has been to more than 100 Insane Clown Posse concerts, but he still remembers the frst time he saw the group play. ※It was completely unlike any concert I＊d ever been to,§ he said. ※When you get out of your car in the parking lot, even if you don＊t know them, Juggalos will just welcome you and give you a high-five and a hug.§An Insane Clown Posse show is a veritable experience, even for those who  fans of the group＊s music. Donihoo usually spends around $25 on a concert ticket, a relatively low cost of admission for an evening of antics. Juggalos chant ※family, family§ and douse each other with sugary Faygo soda, an act often compared to the ritual of baptism. The atmosphere is one of aggressive camaraderie.It＊s not to everyone＊s taste, however. Juggalos had been accustomed to a certain level of degradation in mainstream culture; Spin once  the Gathering of the Juggalos as ※a tragic display of American trash culture＊s bloated, badly tattooed underbelly§. But after the FBI＊s 2011 report, Juggalos began to notice abuse that went far beyond ridicule from music magazines: they were being profiled by law enforcement. To fans like Laura King, this is a direct affront to a band that helped changed their lives for the better. King was raped when she was 16. Afterwards, her classmates branded her a slut. King began drinking and using cocaine. She became suicidal.※Right before the rape happened, I＊d been an honors student,§ said King. ※Then that happened, and I was like, screw it all.§One day, while driving, a friend wanted her to listen to a funny song from Insane Clown Posse＊s 1997 album, Great Milenko. King＊s friend forgot the CD in her car, and she let it keep playing. The lyrics of the song Under The Moon went like this:※Something about the darkness in the lyrics reflected the darkness that was in me at that point in time,§ said King. ※Some of those songs, they＊re about killing rapists. So it was a coping mechanism for me.§King had never known any Juggalos, but once she sought them out, she was instantly accepted into a loving community. She credits her Juggalo friends with helping her manage her trauma. King has now attended four iterations of the Gathering of the Juggalos, and describes it as a place where she can truly feel at home.※We＊re not gang members,§ she said. ※We＊re just a group of misfits who＊ve found camaraderie in each other. Obviously, I＊d made some mistakes. But I haven＊t made the kind of mistakes that would make me a gang member.§ She explained to the gang task force officer that the tattoo represented nothing more than some music she listened to. She argued that she had gotten the tattoo in 2006, five years before the FBI＊s report. But the officer could not be convinced: that day, King became a validated gang member.King was given new, stricter probation terms. She could not visit any school grounds unless she was a student of that school, or was the parent or legal guardian of a student. She could no longer attend her two nieces＊ dance recitals. She could not associate with any ※gang members§ 每 including Juggalos, many of whom she counted among her closest friends.※It kills me that such a positive thing in my life would end up sinking me,§ said King.After the National Gang Intelligence Center＊s report in 2011, Juggalos started to share their accounts of being questioned by police for wearing clothing or accessories featuring the Hatchetman. Stories  about Juggalos who had lost jobs, who had been turned away from enlisting in the armed services, who had seen their dubious gang member status used against them in custody battles, workplace disputes, parole hearings.Some Juggalos, like King, found themselves entered into state gang databases, and worry their gang member status will crop up again and again when applying for a job, renting an apartment or adopting a child.In 2014, Insane Clown Posse, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, filed a suit against the justice department, alleging that the classification of Juggalos as a criminal gang was ※§.A federal judge  the suit, stating that any wrongdoing that may have occurred was not the fault of the federal government. A subsequent appeal was also dismissed. The legalities are tricky: Juggalos have not appeared on the National Gang Intelligence Center＊s list after 2011, but they have continued to be treated as gang members by many state and local authorities.※We know this issue isn＊t as big as racial profiling, or religious discrimination, or anything like that,§ said Scott Donihoo, who is scheduled to speak at the march. ※But it＊s a big deal to us. It＊s affecting a lot of our livelihoods.§For some activists outside the Juggalo community, however, the plight of the Juggalos is not an isolated phenomenon; rather, it is emblematic of broader injustices: state surveillance, police misconduct and mistreatment of the working class. Juggalos are a heterogenous group, hailing from a variety of socioeconomic levels, but many 每 like the members of Insane Clown Posse themselves 每 come from suburban poverty. The Industrial Workers of the World has released a  in solidarity with the Juggalos, stating that ※repression targeting a working-class subculture, and setting a dangerous precedent of casting wide nets, has to be challenged§.Laura King served gang probation for a year and a half. She is determined to attend the Juggalo March, though she is fearful of being arrested again. The gang task force officer has informed her that if she were to go to jail, her gang status means that she will be held in solitary confinement. But this fight, for King, is worth the risk.※If this can happen to us, and the American government gets away with it, it sets a dangerous precedent for what we allow in this country,§ she said. ※Who will it be next?§																																											"
"ate on in , a Guardian journalist makes an appearance. He has a ※firm and warm§ handshake and even has what might be called a ※Guardian look§: ※tie-less, jacket-less, an inexplicable but definite attitude of leftiness 每 it could have been the hair; he had undoubtedly lefty hair§.Obviously, a description like that is going to leave me preening my own lefty mop. While I＊m admitting to personal biases, I should also tell you that I once published one of Macdonald＊s short stories through my publisher Galley Beggar Press. But there＊s no conspiracy there, beyond the fact that I like her writing. I＊ve always found it sharp, funny, warm 每 and charmingly odd. The Threat Level Remains Severe has all of those qualities. It starts off as an apparently straightforward story of a young(ish) woman called Grace, who holds a safe, if unfulfilling, job in the . Her handbag, we are told early on, contains: ※the book, the phone, the lipstick, the spare tampon, the screwed-up balls of chewing gum in silver foil, the unused condom with the worn silver wrapping§ 每 giving us a neat introduction to Grace＊s personality and her lack of luck in the bedroom.But fortunately, both Grace＊s office life and her love life are starting to get more interesting. She＊s been receiving emails from a mysterious admirer calling himself Reuben Swift, which provide welcome distraction from her usual routine of committee meetings and photocopying. Meanwhile, a new Australian colleague called Brett Beamish also sparks interest. Brash, absurdly clean and ruthlessly ambitious, Brett has ※a pretty brutal exclusion policy with anything that didn＊t go his way§ 每 and remembers approvingly that his dad always said: ※Show me a good loser and I＊ll show you a loser.§ Brett also has no time for Guardian-reading lefties 每 so it seems all the more surprising and interesting that Grace begins to warm to him. So far, so Bridget Jones. Which is no bad thing 每 especially because the novel is pleasantly seasoned with the aforementioned oddness (in one scene, a character breaks down sobbing because she＊s in love with Boris Johnson). It＊s also spiced with a healthy dose of cynicism about the conventions of office life and working in parliament. As you might hope, our beloved MPs get an enjoyably rough ride, as with one called Mrs Brenton, who is brilliantly able to juggle speech-making, committees, opening fetes and judging school art and raising her children while keeping her hair and nails ※immaculate§. How does she do it all, although she is clearly a fool? She has ※utter confidence in herself on every front. That was her secret weapon.§ That certainly sounds like an MP. In itself, such material would make for a satisfying novel, give or take a few minor issues. Although Grace＊s narrative voice is smart, touchingly dissatisfied and witty, Macdonald＊s attempts to render others＊ aren＊t always as convincing. There＊s a strand in Brett＊s voice that is consistently funny, but occasionally falls back on two-dimensional stereotypes about over-ambitious, designer-clad males. Not all of the imagery works, either. One chapter ends with elaborate metaphor about good intentions to go for a healthy jog dissolving ※like a laptop screen running out of battery charge§. And yes, that fell flat for me. More generally, this is writing that＊s enjoyable line by line, embedded in an engaging story. Things get better still, because it turns out that Macdonald is also excellent at springing surprises. The less I reveal about those the better. So, let＊s just say a few things happen that complicate, darken and deepen the experience of the novel. The story becomes a study of loneliness, alienation and frustration, as well as a more conventional quest for fulfilment. Ultimately, it all heads back to something more straightforward, and the various strands are tied up with bows that cynics may feel are a little too neat. But this remains an intriguing book. If only all the fiction emerging from Westminster could be this rewarding.Next time: 																																											"

The die was cast. Big Brother wasn＊t for Pete Bennett-style oddballs, Jon Tickle/Eugene Sully-esque geeks or older eccentrics such as gay, black, pro-hunting Tory toff Derek Laud any more. Now it offered a one-way ticket to Banterville. Club 18-30: Elstree Edition.With its baying crowds, shit-stirring tasks and shock tactics, BB abandoned any pretence of being a ※social experiment§, as it was originally sold. It used to be about relationships, rivalries, slow-burning romance and unlikely friendships. Cult heroes emerged. Accidental comedy ensued. But, post-Brian, the producers began rounding up gaggles of fame-seeking gits, then prodding them for our listless entertainment. Six years ago, it moved to Channel 5.

"The documentary  opened in New York City on Friday night, for a short run at Cinema Village on East 12th Street. Introducing a sold-out screening, New York state attorney general Eric Schneiderman said co-directors Natalie Kottke-Masocco and Erica Sardarian had captured one of the ※quiet tragedies that are taking place all across America all the time§.The film tells the story of Crossett, Arkansas, a small town dominated by a huge  paper mill owned by the , Charles and David, hugely influential Republican donors with a deeply contentious 每 activists would say appalling 每 record on the environment. People who live in Crossett blame the mill for the heedless dumping of cancer-causing chemicals they say pollutes drinking water and shortens already straitened lives. ※This is a story that never gets told,§ Schneiderman said, ※and it takes tremendous commitment to get to the quiet tragedies that are taking place all across America all the time. ※The environmental movement really has not done as good a job perhaps as we should have done carrying the essential message that people who are poor and without power are always on the front lines of pollution and environmental justice.§Kottke-Masocco, who describes herself as ※a documentary film-maker and an activist§, went to Crossett in 2011 to work on a section of , a film by Robert Greenwald. Learning of attempts by local pastor David Bouie to hold the Kochs and Georgia-Pacific to account, she stayed on the story. With Cheryl Slavant, a local environmental activist and ※riverkeeper§, Bouie is a key presence in the resulting movie.In some of the film＊s most striking passages, Kottke-Masocco and Sardarian show officials from the  (EPA) floundering in the face of impassioned pleas from locals, inertia from state government and Georgia-Pacific and the Kochs＊ predictable refusal to engage.Company Town was alarming enough when it premiered at the LA film festival in June 2016. In November, Donald Trump was elected president. In office, he appointed former Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt . Federal environmental regulations have come under .※It＊s made the film more urgent,§ Kottke-Masocco told the Guardian. ※It＊s made the story more urgent, it＊s made Crossett＊s issue more important and urgent. We actually scrambled the last two months and updated the title cards in the film to make them more significant.※We want people to understand the gravity of Trump taking office because the EPA is threatened more than ever under Scott Pruitt, a man who as Oklahoma attorney general  ＃ this is a person who has a total neglect for the environment and for public health and is now in charge of protecting our citizens. So Crossett is more important than ever.§Schneiderman has pursued the president on fronts including the Trump University fraud case, which was settled for ; a lawsuit by  over the decision to rescind protection against deportation for young undocumented migrants; and  co-ordination with special counsel Robert Mueller in the investigation into links between  and Russia.The story of Crossett has been reported in depth by , the  and other outlets, to whom Georgia-Pacific and Koch Industries have issued strongly worded . Company Town has received positive reviews by the  and the . Schneiderman said the film showed what can happen when people with ※no power, no money§, like Bouie, Slavant and the whistleblower Dickie Guice, a former Georgia-Pacific safety co-ordinator, range themselves ※against the most malevolent, powerful forces in our country ＃ with the courage to stand up and step up§.※To those who say, ＆Oh my goodness, things are so difficult right now,＊§ he said, ※I＊ll say that when you see these people, we can all keep going.※The filmmakers have, and I say this as a state law enforcement official, captured the way the rich and powerful bend government to their will. And the film sends a powerful message, that we need our state actors to stand up, particularly these days if the federal government is not going to do its job. The state actors are critical. ※The federal government depends on the states, you see in the movie the EPA is very dependent on states to enforce the law. The [federal government] can＊t enforce their laws, we see this in , they can＊t enforce their immigration laws without state and local government. ※So this is an incredible story of courage and of wrongdoing but also a story about how we need to take our government back and our country back.§																																											"
"azzaretto Vecchio is a small ruined island in the Venetian lagoon, an arrangement of crumbling brick barns a short boat ride from the Lido. In its time it has been a leper colony, a plague quarantine and a dumping ground for stray dogs and cats. Thousands of corpses, animal and human, are believed to be piled beneath the buildings＊ foundations.Now Lazzaretto Vecchio has been reborn as the home of Venice VR, a pioneering section at this year＊s Venice film festival. Abandoned structures have been refashioned as airy, minimalist galleries showcasing new work from the virtual-reality industry. Inside are a range of immersive installations and standalone exhibits, plus a 50-seat cinema. Visitors totter across the cobbles wearing Oculus headsets and lightweight earphones, thrilling to sounds and visions only they can experience. There are dramas about sea monsters and jewel thieves, home invaders and Holocaust survivors. Be not afeard, .※The irony is that Venice, the oldest film festival in the world, is by far the most forward-thinking in terms of recognising new art forms,§ says Liz Rosenthal, co-programmer of Venice VR. ※It＊s the first festival that has properly recognised virtual reality and made it part of the official programme, with a competition and a jury and prizes.§The 22 films in competition are an eclectic bunch. Strictly speaking, many are not films at all. The assortment roams from the animated La Camera Insabbiata, a whimsical celebration of storytelling by  and Hsin-chien Huang, to Edward Robles＊ Dispatch, a hardboiled cop serial that puts us inside a suburban house as a murderer comes calling. Some of the films are escapist fantasy; others come with more serious intent. Greenland Melting is a campaigning climate change documentary that puts the viewer on the deck of an Arctic research ship to observe the glaciers in retreat.At the far end of the barn sit the immersive installations. Jordan Tannahill＊s Draw Me Close, developed in collaboration with London＊s , is a powerful elegy to the director＊s late mother. Here we essentially play the role of Jordan, spirited from his mum＊s deathbed and cast back to his childhood. An actor leads you through the stage-set, instructing you to open the window or draw with crayon on the floor, and then gently tucks you up in bed at the end of the day. I haven＊t been tucked up in bed since I was about 12. The experience is unsettling and moving in about equal measure.Next door to this, Alice provides light relief. This is a freewheeling virtual-reality play, sending the participant scurrying on a fraught 20-minute trip into Wonderland, where they try to catch Humpty Dumpty and chase after a crown before being yanked out through the curtains as if from a dream. I reeled back into the daylight, giggling like an idiot.※Traditionally, VR＊s two main references are cinema and video games,§ says Antoine Cardon, Alice＊s co-producer. ※Whereas for us it has always been immersive theatre. So I think VR can mean a lot of different things. It＊s not exactly cinema, it＊s not games or theatre. It＊s its own thing. We are rapidly reaching the point where the old comparisons lose their meaning.§Arden＊s Wake, by Eugene Chung, conjures up a beguiling diorama of a flooded planet inhabited by a plucky Pixar-esque heroine and her gruff seafaring dad. Chung has been hailed by Forbes magazine as ※the DW Griffith of VR§ 每 but even he feels that such movie parallels risk becoming a constraint.※Drop the film analogy,§ he says. ※It＊s an obvious point of reference but you have to know where to apply it. The idea of a feature-length story means something different in VR. The grammar is different. Back in the 1850s, opera was seen as the ideal art form. Then in the 1890s we saw the first moving pictures. We＊ve had 120 years with cinema at the top of the pile. It＊s probably about time we had something new emerging.§Where VR goes next is anybody＊s guess. ※That＊s what we＊re all wondering,§ Chung says. ※It＊s a nascent industry. It＊s a new language. You could say that the VR industry is in a similar place to the film industry was in the 1900s 每 the time of the first three-act narrative features. Although I think we＊re a bit beyond that already. Plus technology moves a lot faster than it did a century ago. No one really knows where this will be in five years time.§At the , sceptics joke that a former leper colony is the perfect home for an industry still finding its range and fighting for mainstream acceptance. But over 3,000 visitors have made the crossing this week and the Venice VR section is widely judged to have been a success. The artists on Lazaretto Vecchio, then, aren＊t exiles or pariahs. They＊re pioneers who colonised a ruined island and proceeded to build a new world.																																											"
"An image of the  Arena foyer, where a suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured 250 others, has been released as the venue prepares to reopen on Saturday. The picture shows repair work under way in the arena＊s City Room, one of the three main entrances to the venue, which was heavily damaged by the blast at the end of an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May. It was released by a charity supporting victims of the attack with the aim of preparing concertgoers for the arena＊s reopening on Saturday night, 111 days after the deadliest attack on UK soil in more than a decade. Noel Gallagher＊s High Flying Birds will share a stage with the Courteeners, Blossoms, Rick Astley and others at the benefit concert, We Are Manchester, to raise money for a permanent memorial dedicated to the victims of the atrocity.The first glimpse inside the arena came after more than 500 people who were directly affected by the bomb 每 including bereaved families, those who suffered life-changing injuries and many witnesses 每 were given a private visit to the City Room on Thursday. The controlled visit was supported by Greater Manchester police and the , a charity that supports victims of terrorist atrocities founded after the IRA bombing in Warrington in 1993. Nick Taylor, the charity＊s chief executive, said the victims showed ※resilience, solidarity as well as emotional outpouring§ when taken inside the arena for the first time since the blast: ※What we＊ve found is people found it difficult but overall found it positive and helpful.§  The charity will have an emotional response team on duty on Saturday night, as well as a suite where people can talk to mental health professionals and trauma experts.※It will be difficult for some people to return and there will be a lot of attention on this event but the artists are giving their time for free,§ Taylor said. ※There＊s going to be much-changed security in place ＃ Security is being put first. ※For many people walking into that arena, and walking out at the end, it＊s going to be a difficult experience. But the event＊s sold out and the message we＊re giving is that we＊ve got to come together and stand together and send a strong message of support to those people affected, but also send a strong message out that this is our way of life and it＊s going to continue.§ Concertgoers have been told to expect tight security. All entrants willbe screened on arrival and bags larger than 35cm x 40cm x 19cm are banned. The City Room, which is still undergoing repair work, will open to ticket-holders at 5pm on Saturday. Councillor Sue Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester city council, said: ※Those who perpetrate terrorist attacks want to divide us and stifle our freedoms. No one will ever forget the terrible events of 22 May but Manchester has reacted with love, solidarity and a determination to continue doing the things which make this such a vibrant city. ※We welcome the re-opening of the arena, a major venue which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors, as a powerful symbol of this defiant and resilient spirit. It is entirely fitting that the re-opening event should be a memorial fundraiser. Plans for the form and location of any permanent commemorations will be determined in liaison with the families of victims and others affected by the attack.§ 																																											"
"he latest portrayal of London as a Victorian city, , adapted from Peter Ackroyd＊s novel and starring Bill Nighy, is in a grand tradition that shows no sign of going out of fashion any time soon. There may, from time to time, be an example 每 such as  每 in which the whole point is for the drama  to be set in Victorian London; but even then, the weight of the capital＊s history is ever-present, the self-consciousness of the translation from 19th to 21st century evident in every second of screen time. There may be modern buildings in shot, but for all practical purposes, it＊s set in a Victorian city.That＊s because London is, itself, a Victorian city. To adapt a line from the great Hungarian novelist Ant角l Szerb, it isn＊t so much a city as a state of mind. Just as Venice is about its canals, and Paris its Haussmann boulevards, so London will always be the boiling city of smoke-blackened brick, the city summoned up in the opening paragraph of :It doesn＊t matter that the smoke and the soot and the fog have gone: this is the idealised iteration of the city, and to this day there are tourists who are bemused to find that there aren＊t any , or that the policemen don＊t wear capes, there are no hansom cabs, and that Sherlock Holmes is not in residence, consulting at 221B.It＊s also largely down to . He and Dickens, between them, carved up the city and made it theirs. The long duration of the Victorian era didn＊t hurt, either. It accounts for almost a century of an imagined city 每 strictly from 1837 to 1901, but the boundaries bleed out at either end.The question is: why this era, above all others? Samuel Johnson, a century earlier, has a good claim on the city; so does . That gives us one clue: the city, in effect, does not date from before 1666. That gives it a little under two centuries to find its feet. Enough time to construct an identity. I would actually say that the city really gets going in about 1850. That was when the farmland of Marylebone was finally built on, replaced with the traditional stucco terrace houses. With their tall windows on the first floor, more modest ones on the second and tiny ones on the third, the house shows Victorian class structure in its design. And this was London＊s modernity: the jostling together of rich and poor, sometimes not just in adjacent streets, but in adjacent buildings. It was this that made Marx and Engels look at the capital and decide that if the revolution was going to happen anywhere, it was going to happen here first (or Manchester. There is a good case for saying that Manchester is an even more Victorian city than London).Victorian London on screen looks great, with its mists and drizzles and gouts of black smoke (and sounds great, too: nothing like a horse-drawn carriage wheel rolling over the cobblestones). But the city also has an uneasy relationship with itself. Here, the wealthy may have their vast privileges but they will still be at risk from a homicidal maniac like Jack the Ripper. The city resembles a body, too. In Victorian times it inhaled foreign bodies, literal foreign bodies. They would end up in Limehouse, for example: bacilli that could be benign but, for the purposes of entertainment, were not.But this isn＊t what clinches the era＊s extremely persistent appeal. I think it＊s to do with the construction of the sewers. ※Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better; splashed to their very blinkers,§ runs another part of the opening of , and ※mire§ is a euphemism. London stank of shit until Joseph Bazalgette built the sewer system that still, amazingly, continues to stop the city from collapsing under a tide of ordure. That project started after the Great Stink of 1858, and the memory of it didn＊t go away for a long time. And I would like to think it still haunts the place, and is summoned every time we hear a Victorian peeler＊s whistle.																																											"
"emember that series a couple of years ago  as magnificently doomy and gloomy as his face, who gave shelter to crime victims in need of a secure place to stay? You do? Well, it＊s back. You don＊t? No matter 每 it＊s not really back. It＊s got a new protagonist 每 Tom, played by Stephen Moyer, who is more of a scrappy terrier than Eccleston＊s rangy, watchful wolfhound 每 and a new location: Anglesey. It＊s the television equivalent of the philosopher＊s axe 每 if you replace all the parts, is it still the same thing?The new (ITV) certainly performs the same function as the original, delivering a serviceable plot without demanding too much in the way of intellectual or emotional investment (because who has any left of either by Thursday, for heaven＊s sake? It＊s nearly the weekend). In this first episode of four, somebody abducts a woman, Julie Delaney, from her home using the same MO (build an elaborate tent out of plastic sheeting in the house while the family＊s out, clonk patriarch on head when they come home, tie him to a chair and make him watch as frightened wife is dragged away; let traumatised offspring escape) as someone called the Crow used to abduct three others eight years ago. A man called Luke Griffin was arrested and imprisoned for the crimes.Tom is a former detective who worked the original cases. He was sure then and is even surer now that Griffith did not work alone and that the real Crow is still out there. His superiors pooh-poohed that idea then and they pooh-pooh it now, even though there seems no earthly reason why they should pooh-pooh or have pooh-poohed such a reasonable idea at either stage. But we must frustrate our hero somehow. So the pooh-poohing continues, especially from a detective on the current case called Ollie, who seems to be the pooh-pooher-in-chief.Tom also reckons that the Crow＊s motive was to make the husbands left behind suffer. This seems an odd conclusion to draw. Why not the children left behind? Why not 每 uh 每 the women taken away and who have never been seen since? Julie, by the way, is currently tied to a chair in a Portacabin in a deserted warehouse. She＊s not having a particularly good time. But Tom is the hero and therefore arbitrarily vouchsafed insights the rest of us are not.While Tom is trailing Julie＊s partner John and trying to stop him being a dickhead, Tom＊s girlfriend Sam (Zoe Tapper) is readying the safe house and fending off the unwanted attentions of local handyman Craig.By the end of the episode we have Luke Griffin avidly watching the latest case on the news from jail, Craig watching Sam from his motorbike (and roaring away when she spots him), and John and Danni (Julie＊s daughter) watching their lives crash and burn from the safe house. Whether many will be watching this second-tier stuff next week depends, I suspect, mostly on the weather. It will do for a rainy autumn evening. Otherwise, I suggest you try and squeeze in one last barbecue instead. (Sky Atlantic) is an altogether more potent prospect. The plot and performances have you slavering for more from the off. The Worth family 每 who bicker and banter wholly convincingly 每 have recently arrived in a tiny Canadian town for a new start. We don＊t know why they need a new start but Tim Roth, playing the husband, Jim, is simmering with latent everything. He is the town＊s new police chief.All is peaceful until an oil company arrives and the townspeople find themselves at odds with this invading power 每 and each other. The corrupting effects of oil money are quickly but vividly drawn. Christina Hendricks plays Mrs Bradshaw, North Stream Oil＊s corporate shill, who placates and riles the inhabitants as needed. Her boss urges Jim to cooperate, but it is not in his nature.A woman who lodged a federal complaint about the company＊s behaviour is blacklisted and forced out of her job. She is found dead in her car, a supposed suicide. Jim＊s continuing opposition soon leads to an attack on his home and they flee to Calgary. They are found on the road and a single shot kills his five-year-old son and possibly fatally injures his wife. Jim tears off his bloody shirt in the hospital bathroom. He has a large snake tattoo on his back. Another version of Jim stares back, unblinkingly, from the mirror. We＊re about to learn why they needed a new start.

"he arts world is facing a Hamlet availability crisis. It is of course utterly impossible to get tickets for the reportedly superb  of the play, running in a tiny London theatre for three weeks to raise money for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada). It was also fiendishly difficult to get tickets for the recent critically adored Hamlet, starring of Sherlock fame.To compound the nightmare, there?happens also to be a new production of Hamlet starring , and it is very, very possible?to get tickets for that.News of utterly sold-out theatre shows has in the past brought out the? in me: say what you will about Hollywood films,?they are non-elitist 每 you can pretty much always get tickets. But I am also a convert to livestreaming theatre into cinema. So won＊t Kenneth?Branagh 每 director of the Hiddleston Hamlet 每 relent, and allow his production to be beamed into Britain＊s movie theatres? A portion of the ticket price could go to Rada! It?would raise money for Rada! Why are we all pining hopelessly for this show when the solution is obvious?Of course it might be that Sir Kenneth has cunningly contrived his Hamlet-famine for precisely this outcome. Never mind. Let＊s see Tom Hiddleston＊s Hamlet in cinemas.※I just think somehow we＊re bringing up a generation of rude people,§ said Salman Rushdie, explaining his .

"In recent years the Istanbul biennial has grappled with subjects such as the city＊s anti-authoritarian  in 2013 and Europe＊s migration crisis. In 2009 the biennial＊s manifesto said ※politically neutral art is a means of policing the art world§.The 15th edition of Turkey＊s most important contemporary art event, which opens on Saturday, is curated by the celebrated Scandinavian subversives Elmgreen and Dragset, and takes as its theme ※what makes a good neighbour§.However, despite Turkey＊s increasingly tense relationship with Europe,  in the wake of , and his country＊s role in the civil war in Syria, politically controversial art is almost entirely absent. Across its six venues, mention of the president, his AKP party or the tens of thousands of people detained since the coup attempt is noticeably muted.Elmgreen and Dragset vigorously deny they have practised self-censorship. They acknowledge an absence of anti-government slogans or artwork incorporating overt activism, but say contemporary politics has infiltrated in more subtle ways, and that taken as a whole the biennial offers a more nuanced perspective on the country than that usually afforded in the international media.※It＊s a little flat if art gets reduced to being a direct response to very populist politics, and very simple answers on very complicated matters,§ says Elmgreen. ※I don＊t like the situation in  but I also don＊t think the mindset ＆we have an issue, we better call some artists here and they can just respond to it like a jack-in-a-box＊ is helpful either.※These direct responses from art to many political situations often do very little good in the political arena. It can be good art but it＊s often very bad politics.§ Dragset draws a distinction between the art world and geopolitics: ※Art is not there to react the same way as politicians or the media, using the same simplified populist language,§ he says.It is also the case, he says, that the Turkish art scene is still looking for a language of resistance and a way of expressing opinions in an increasingly controlled society. ※The voices are quieter at the moment and maybe this exhibition does reflect that,§ he says.Both artists say they have been sensitive to the political climate faced by Turkish artists. ※I get upset by that very Eurocentric, self-obsessed idea that the whole world should work the same way as us, because it＊s just not the reality,§ says Elmgreen. ※We cannot be so arrogant that we disrespect artists working in the 75% of the world.§Those works that do touch on subjects such as authoritarianism, resistance and the repression of women for the most part focus on other countries, and are by international artists.One of the most political pieces is by the Moroccan-French visual artist Latifa Echakhch. It features two concrete walls painted with a flaking mural of the protests in Istanbul＊s Gezi Park in 2013, the decay symbolic of the pessimism that followed that moment of defiance.Also featured is a video by the Kurdish artist Erkan Ozgen of a deaf boy from Syria acting out some of the traumas he has witnessed. A new work by the Brazilian artist Victor Leguy was made in collaboration with refugees, many from Syria, who were living in Istanbul.Elmgreen and Dragset, who are gay, say the biennial is a celebration of diversity. Works on subjects including the queer community and feminism are in themselves a statement, they say, in a country where traditional religious attitudes are encroaching on secular society.Like almost all cultural events in Turkey, the biennial is run by an independent private foundation, and only about 6% of its funding comes from the Ministry of Tourism and Culture.The authorities could interfere if they felt the need, but the festival＊s director and the curators say there was no government input or censorship in this year＊s event.Nonetheless, several of the 10 Turkish artists involved in this year＊s biennial openly speak of the difficulties of working in Turkey. Politics was present in their work, they say, just in subtle, layered ways.※Of course, automatically we all now self-censor ourselves,§ says G?zde Ilkin, whose work here features tapestry-type amalgamations of old family photographs. She breaks down in tears as she talks about the aftermath of the Gezi protests. Many people she knew were arrested or moved away, she says, and the artistic community fractured as people became afraid and stopped talking to each other.※But we have started to create layers in our our work, so that what is happening in Turkey is there, but it is maybe not so obvious,§ she says. ※Voices have been crushed but artists will always find a way to speak.§Yo?unluk, an arts collective working in Istanbul who brought an eerie site-specific installation to the biennial, say their apolitical approach is the only way they can operate. ※No gallery would show my work if I was making political art, that I am totally sure,§ says the artistic director Ismail E?ler. ※Art in Turkey, in my opinion, it is getting superficial. And in this biennial, it is so obvious that it is on purpose that you cannot see politics in the art, otherwise they wouldn＊t let it go ahead.§Zeyno Pek?nl?, the Turkish artist and academic who is curating the biennial＊s public programme, says many artists and intellectuals have moved abroad because they felt their work wasn＊t being valued in Turkey.※But a lot of them stayed and those who did are even more hardworking than before, so the arts scene has become even more vivid,§ Pek?nl? adds. ※Events like the biennial are more important in people＊s lives because it means we can keep thinking and keep discussing.§																																											"
"Martin Amis has suggested that , who the author speculated could be suffering from dementia, is preparing for the possibility of an untimely end to his presidency by ※trying to stock up an army of neo-Nazis§.Comparisons between Trump and Hitler are wrong, Amis argues, because the US president actually resembles a different fascist: Hitler＊s ally Mussolini. Speaking to Guardian Weekend in New York, the novelist recalled seeing the slogan ※Mussolini Is Always Right§ on Italian bridges in the 1970s.※Trump is that crazy, and that boastful, and that deluded,§ Amis said. ※Even Mussolini had a few good years before he lost it. But people like Hitler and Stalin wanted to change human nature. That＊s what totalitarianism is. Trump doesn＊t want to make a total claim on you as an individual. He wants to stay in power, and that＊s about it.§According to Amis, the president is cannily exploiting the fears of America＊s far right. ※Trump is trying to stock up an army of neo-Nazis who, if he gets ousted before his term is over, are going to think it＊s a coup. They＊ve all got huge guns; that＊s a sword to hold over the situation. That＊s what they＊re scared of,§ he said. He characterised such supporters as the kind of man who ※before 2008 could look out of his trailer and say: ＆I may not be much, but I＊m better than a black man.＊ Then they see Obama, so handsome and witty and learned, and think: ＆Can I really say that?＊§In a wide-ranging interview about his forthcoming book of essays, The Rub of Time, in which he spoke about everything from the ※stupefying effect§ of the internet to the fact that he has never looked at social media, Amis compared the day after the US election to Germany after Hitler＊s appointment as German chancellor in 1933, citing the German historian Sebastian Haffner. ※He said the feeling was not of horror; it was of complete unreality. You go out into the street and people look different. The commerce, the cars; it all looks staged for your benefit. Completely make-believe. A sick-making feeling. And here it is. And what the fuck did they expect?§Trump himself, according to Amis, has changed significantly over the past decades, a change that the author suggested could be attributed to dementia. ※If you look at old tapes of him on [US talk show] Charlie Rose, he＊s using words like ＆chagrin＊ correctly. And with a certain amount of ironic reserve,§ he said.Amis, the British author of acclaimed novels including Money, London Fields and The Zone of Interest, moved to New York in 2011, saying at the time that the UK was in a condition of ※moral decrepitude§ and that he ※would prefer not to be English§.His feelings about his native country are warmer now, and he revealed that he plans to move back one day. ※I miss the English ＃ I miss Londoners. I miss the wit,§ he told the Guardian. ※Americans aren＊t as witty as Brits, because humour is about giving a little bit of offence. It＊s an assertion of intellectual superiority. Americans are just as friendly and tolerant as Londoners, but they flinch from mocking someone＊s background or education.§An experienced controversialist, the novelist＊s pronouncements have provoked debate over race, religion and gender politics. In 2007, , while three years later . In 2015, Amis wrote an essay slamming Jeremy Corbyn as ※incurious§, ※humourless§ and ※undereducated§. But despite Labour＊s success in June＊s general election, the writer has not warmed to the leader.※Two E grades at A-level. That＊s it. He certainly has no autodidact streak. I mean, is he a reader?§ he said, adding that Corbyn is ※more cautious now, but still grimly ideological, and an admirer of tyrants 每 Ch芍vez, Putin§.As for Trump, Amis is not hopeful that the US president will be impeached, but suggested that looming international events could reveal him to onlookers. ※I am, in a way, thirsty for an international crisis,§ he said. ※Not with North Korea; he＊s itching to do that and thinks he＊ll get the Nobel peace prize if he wipes it off the map. But I want something really ticklish, like the hostage crisis after the Iranian revolution, where he＊s not going to reach for the button, but people are going to see him under stress.§																																											"
"Unnervingly honest podcast (Kaitlin Prest & Radiotopia/iTunes) has always been excellent listening. Previous series have explored consent, femininity in men and lost love, but the latest batch is about bodies 每 and it doesn＊t so much break taboos as trample all over them.Mitra Kaboli＊s narration sets the scene as she focuses on a single chin hair that disturbs her and each episode, although shocking in parts, is full of reassurance.Itch, Cassie＊s tale of having ※an itch in her butt§ for years is relentless yet realistic. It＊s Not Me, It＊s You is a candid look at what happens when sex is painful. The issue is sensitively handled, but the episode is packed with experiences that no woman should have to go through, such as a partner who offers to ※wear it in a little bit§.The highlight is Meat, in which Jonathan Zenti talks about how he loves his body despite being obese in everyone else＊s eyes. ※Yes I＊m fat, and I know that I＊m fat. I know because every day someone or something reminds me I＊m fat,§ he says. He sees the look on fellow commuters＊ faces when he squeezes on to the subway in Rome, and catches the crushing moment when he was humiliated at a dinner party. ※I heard the host whisper in his wife＊s ear: ＆Oh my God, we will run out of food for the other guests now＊ and they laughed,§ he says without flinching.But Zenti＊s story is as thought-provoking as it is inspiring. He doesn＊t view being fat as an illness to be remedied, he＊s just living life. ※I can fasten my seatbelt on an aeroplane, I can walk, I can stand up, I can sit down, I can touch my nose with my finger. How can I see my weight as a problem when it＊s never been a problem for me?§ he says. He puts society＊s hatred of fat people down to them being a reminder of the fear of being unlovable and dying alone. Like all the stories here, Zenti＊s is told with style and sensitivity and it stays with you long after you＊ve listened.Given the current political climate, this podcast feels like one of the most important. It tells unconventional stories of the most marginalised bodies (literally) in society. Hosted by the reflective and witty Amanda Richards, Bodcast generates awareness about people who possess little to no privilege, and it has taught me a great deal about the experiences of those who do not fit into the overly rigid and absurd societal norms surrounding the body. My favourite episodes are the ones that approach the issues of our time 每 abortion, trans rights and health services 每 and humanise them with heartfelt discussion. The episode on Elijah＊s transition as a teenager, as well as the one with Ally Bruener 每 a disabled comic battling the medical system 每 are perfect examples of this. This podcast tells the story of two brothers＊ 11,000 mile road trip from London to Mongolia as part of a charity event called the Mongol Rally. Far from Home captures the strangeness of places most Westerners have never heard of, much less visited, like the giant fire pit and the near-empty capital city of Turkmenistan. But it＊s at its best in small human moments, from hospitality offered in Iran to the kindness of strangers after multiple mishaps.It also documents the practicalities of preparing for an 18-country trek in a tiny car, obtaining visas and car repair lessons, and the necessary improvisations along the way when navigating desert breakdowns and corrupt border guards. A brilliant listen. From the Pew Charitable Trusts, After the Fact brings you data and analysis on the trends shaping some of society＊s biggest challenges. My favourite episodes so far have been State of the American Dream and Can Technology Save the Earth?, but whether you listen from a ※what＊s in it for me§ or a ※how does this shape the world§ viewpoint, it will stimulate thought and build understanding 每 and that just might lead to action. Sometimes podcasts really fly. I never know what the magic ingredient is 每 presumably some indefinable but killer chemistry between the guests, the subject matter and how smoothly everyone＊s brains are working 每 but you always know. Anyway, this  podcast is one of them: the Guardian＊s environment correspondent Fiona Harvey, veteran environmental adviser Tom Burke and Solitaire Townsend of the sustainability agency  assess how the UK leaving the EU could affect such inconsequential matters as the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat.It＊s a free-flowing and good-humoured discussion that wears its knowledge lightly: I think you＊ll probably learn something even if you＊re a seasoned environmentalist 每 but if you＊re not, you won＊t get lost in the jargon either. And make no mistake, this really is an important topic: the UK＊s membership of the EU has played a massive role in our environment, from wildlife protections to energy efficiency and air pollution to marine conservation, the EU has led in pushing through vital measures. Some 80% of our our environmental rules derive from EU directives. So what＊s going to happen to all those laws after Brexit? Can they be transferred, who will police them, what＊s to stop them being ignored? Is our Brexit going to be green, or grisly? Please do have a listen. 																																											"
"This track opens in such a suspicious and haunting way, and boy when that bassline slaps it kicks like a mule.A contemporarily relevant spin on a classic hands-in-the-air banger. Cheesy enough to get people singing; acidic enough to get people weird.I＊d have given this wonderful boy a good home on my label and made sure he never had nothin＊ leaked, capisce?! A really well-produced, very original piece of music.I＊m not much of a show-off, but as you＊ve got me, here＊s a little ditty from the world of French library music.

I woke up in a cold sweat and realised that this nightmare was reality, and compared to this track I am a dreadful producer.The way I picture it, everyone would be swilling red wine everywhere rejoicing over the Ali Campbell chorus. This one＊s for you, auntie Justine!Lovely  singing me off as I＊m frozen and shot out of a cannon into space. I can＊t really think of anything better.																																											"
"very morning, at the absolute crack of dawn, I watch Paw Patrol on Netflix. This is because, while my son snaps to full-beam attention the very instant he wakes up, I need a few minutes to compose myself. If he asks to watch Paw Patrol, and it means I＊ll have a chance to slowly drag myself to consciousness, then we＊ll watch Paw Patrol. If he asked to watch Caligula, I can＊t rule out the possibility that I＊d let him do that too, but fortunately he hasn＊t yet. For now, it＊s just Paw Patrol.I spent so long frantically denying the existence of Paw Patrol to him. I＊d seen other kids his age fall under its spell to an obsessive degree, so I made a vow to never talk about it. ※Never mind that§, I＊d say whenever the subject was broached, ※Here＊s a . That＊s just as much fun, right?§ But a line was crossed while my back was turned, and now my kid has bought into Paw Patrol wholesale. If you＊ve never seen Paw Patrol, it＊s essentially about Ryder, a boy whose parents didn＊t tell him no enough, and the megalomaniacal world he＊s created for himself. Ryder 每 who lives in a glass tower high above the civilised world 每 has coerced a team of five puppies into providing the sole emergency services for his city. These puppies can talk, and they call him Sir. Twenty years from now when a grownup fan makes a knowing Paw Patrol revival movie, Ryder will be depicted as a cackling maniac with an unstoppable God complex, but for now all this is implied.Here＊s what happens in an average episode. The mayor, a woman who routinely ignores her civic duties to chase her pet chicken around, will inadvertently cause an emergency. Let＊s say a boat is sinking. Ryder will summon the five puppies to his tower to show them a lengthy PowerPoint presentation on the nature of the emergency 每 even though, all the while, the boat is still sinking. Then he＊ll call upon some of the puppies to help him. This will always include Chase, the bum-licking, sycophantic self-appointed leader of the group; and very rarely include Zuma (the puppy with a boat) because Ryder has got a jet-ski of his own and wants all the credit for himself. The puppies will work together to fix the boat, then they＊ll be rewarded with a treat while Ryder presumably keeps the bulk of the financial reward himself. Every episode 每 with the possible exception of the one where all the puppies turn into mermaids 每 is exactly the same. Oh, and Ryder is also working on a robotic dog, which sets up an eventual episode where the Paw Patrol, steamrollered by technology, find themselves saddled with such a profound lack of purpose that they all become grizzled alcoholics.My kid loves everything that drives me to despair about Paw Patrol. To him Ryder is just a cool dude with some cute puppies, not a dangerous supervillain in the making. To him the puppies are all distinct characters with rigid skillsets, not avatars for the growing legion of workers shafted by the gig economy. To him everyone＊s tendency to speak purely in catchphrases is a fun and repetitive language aid, not proof that they＊re all sleepwalking through life without ever engaging in the moment. To him the wall-to-wall merchandising of Paw Patrol is an excuse to have lots of nice toys, not a cynical attempt to strip me of all the money I ever earn, money that I used to spend on myself back in the days before I started cutting my own hair in a mirror with nail scissors in a state of perpetual exhaustion.And the horrible truth of it is that I put up with Paw Patrol, just because it makes him happy. I＊m going on a 130-mile round trip with him in a couple of weeks, purely on the off-chance that there＊ll be a bloke in a Paw Patrol costume there. In short, the moral of this story is don＊t have children. 																																											"
"ne of the few reliable things about the  is the apparently unerring ability of the bookmakers to get it wrong. Most years, their favourite is the most commercially successful of the nominees. And, as the Sun pointed out in a recent and lengthy piece that took it upon itself to explain to readers what the Mercury prize is, as if assuming they＊d never heard of it 每 not perhaps the kind of publicity that the Mercury is looking for after 25 dogged years of existence, but there you go 每 ※the Mercury prize is not really about commercial success and often the winner is a smaller artist§. It then went on to list a selection of past winners, and noted, perhaps with a certain arch of the eyebrow, that they remain ※less well known§.But this year, the bookies got it right: on the afternoon of the Mercury announcement,  was the favourite, and Sampha Sisay subsequently won. Perhaps the bookies started paying closer attention to the nature of the Mercury prize itself.  is a very Mercury-winner-ish kind of an album, if such a thing can be said to exist: an album that balances a traditional singer-songwriter approach 每 stark, confessional piano-led songs that make the most of Sisay＊s gorgeous, bruised, understated voice 每 with tracks that reflect his other job, as a cutting-edge R&B and hip-hop producer who has worked with Beyonc谷, Kanye West and Frank Ocean. It＊s not brazenly commercial, but it is an album that you could easily see attracting a wider audience than it already has. According to a report by the , it has thus far sold around 25,000 copies, 2,000 of them after it was nominated for the Mercury: sales some of Sisay＊s fellow nominees wouldn＊t dare dream of, but nothing to give another of them, , sleepless nights.If calling Process a very Mercury-winner-ish kind of album sounds like faint praise, it isn＊t intended as such. Inspired by the death of Sisay＊s mother, and a health scare the singer himself faced, it frequently packs a winding emotional punch, while sonically it steers away from prevalent trends in R&B and ploughs its own individual, quietly challenging path: the thrilling tapestry of electronic noise, scattered percussion and samples of rain and children＊s voices that makes up Kora Sings; the claustrophobic, compelling sound he conjures up on Under, then subverts with a beautiful pop chorus. Whether Sampha＊s Mercury win means more people hear Process, or whether his name ends up added to the list of those winners who stubbornly stay ※less well known§ to the Sun＊s readership, remains to be seen.

"ll is grey, wind howls, light is dim: design, sound and music suggest boundless, cruel space. The setting is a labour camp in Stalin＊s Soviet Union, where Ruslan is a guard dog, faithful to his guard Master and to the service (a term that refers to the staff who run the gulag and to the strict codes by which they operate). The action of , adapted from an allegorical novel by Georgi Vladimov, switches between Ruslan＊s rigidly structured past (the time of training) and his confusing present (the time of learning). The performance opens on the transition between the two.Orders issue from an unseen loudspeaker. From the back of the stage, a line of armed guards march forwards, morph into dog handlers, who morph into guard dogs, who morph into cowering prisoners (shape-shifting actors are movement-directed by Marcello Magni). Sirens blare. Stalin is dead. The gulag is closed. All are ※free§. Two main questions emerge: can repression destroy the spirit; can love and hope revive it?Ruslan, liberated by the Master he worships, cannot free himself from service rules. He assigns himself the task of guarding a former prisoner, in the hope of one day returning him to the camp, where he believes they both belong. This Shabby Man (Paul Brendan) cannot return to the person he was before the gulag reshaped him; like so many others, he barely survives in the nearest town. The play, similarly, struggles to free the story from its narrative origin: its dramatic dynamics ebb and flow.Some of the production＊s great strengths are also it weakness. Ruslan, embodied with almost mystical intensity by Max Keeble, is so convincing that his spoken thoughts (delivered both by himself and other members of the cast) seem an imposition on his animal identity; too incongruously human. Animals are so vividly realised by the actors that human characters seem to lack flesh by comparison.These things said, Kaut-Howson＊s production (she also directs) is the product of a finely honed vision. Her 13-strong ensemble create arresting images, including: a horrific ※freeze-frame§ of prisoners pressure-hosed in temperatures of -44C by a ※joking§ captain; a pack of dogs racing towards the auditorium.  offers no easy answers but a haunting experience.																																											"
"hat which is dangerous can also be thrilling. Many liberal democracies are engaged in something dangerous, as questions of identity, community and nationhood are being asked with a fresh urgency, with some of the answers turning out to be deeply disturbing. But is there also something thrilling going on? The capacity for democracy to throw up surprises, such as Britain＊s , is mesmerising.  may be a famous act of economic self-harm, but something new will be born one way or the other. Still the danger persists and may be growing.That this is happening now, as opposed to 10 or 20 years ago, is a direct consequence of the disintegration of the economic policy framework that has held sway in Britain, the US, the European commission and many multilateral institutions for much of the previous 40 years. That framework is often referred to as ※§, even if the term irritates a certain class of pundit, for whom it is some sort of swearword without any clear referent. Its disintegration is producing conflicting sympathies, as many on the left come to realise the xenophobia that can be unleashed in the absence of stable market-based rules.For George Monbiot, neoliberalism should best be understood as a ※story§, one that was conveniently on offer at precisely the moment when the previous ※story§ 每 namely Keynesianism 每 fell to pieces in the mid-1970s. The power of stories is overwhelming, as they are ※the means by which we navigate the world. They allow us to interpret its complex and contradictory signals§. The particular story of neoliberalism ※defines us as competitors, guided above all other impulses by the urge to get ahead of our fellows§.This story may not have been all that attractive, but it provided meaning and clarity. It offered a guide on what to do and how to live. With the rise of , neoliberalism came to govern how policies were designed and institutions constructed. More diffusely, it came to shape how we understand ourselves, leading us to take on ever more responsibility for our own needs, economic security and wellbeing, devaluing social bonds and dependency in the process.The grand global difficulties of neoliberalism are plain to see. The  was testimony to the stupidity of deregulation, while the inability to move on from it demonstrates that orthodox economic policy tools no longer work. Solutions to climate change are hamstrung by the need to respect existing corporate and financial strategies. But Monbiot also details considerable psychological and biological evidence for how the ethos of individual competition harms us all, running counter to our innate needs and instincts. Loneliness and distrust are not just the defining social problems of our age, but increasingly posing risks to our health.The problem is that we have no new story to tell, and are therefore trapped in a groundhog day of repetition. The principal objective of  is to identify exit routes from this miserable condition. Few of the policy ideas contained within it are original to Monbiot (he credits their sources regularly and generously) and some (such as participatory budgeting and basic income) have been around for some time, but they are rarely assembled into a single overarching narrative. Monbiot is offering his services principally as a storyteller. He reserves particular enthusiasm for the environmental economics of  and the participatory campaigning techniques of the  campaign.To construct the new story, he leans heavily on the burgeoning evidence for our innately social and empathetic nature. Human beings are the ※supreme cooperators§, which explains our dominance within the natural world. Altruism and concern for others＊ feelings are evolutionary properties that are central to our biology, hence the fact that ※social§ pain (such as loneliness or grief) produces many of the same symptoms as ※physical§ pain. Most of this research was unknown when the neoliberal story was first being told by economists such as  in the mid-20th century, but it highlights central aspects of the human condition that are neglected by our individualistic and competitive culture.What this suggests, Monbiot argues, is that a new political story must privilege belonging above all. We need to feel we belong to a particular place and a particular community, with whom we can achieve common goals. We need to combat the epidemic of alienation with a new set of institutions, through which individuals can collectively shape their own lives and environments.  makes an impassioned and optimistic case for greater democracy in virtually all areas of life, from global to local, kicking big money out of politics in the process. At the same time, Monbiot＊s intuition regarding ※belonging§ resonates with the present political mood. Was it not a desire for belonging that drove much of the Brexit vote, or at least a sense of  belonging to Brussels?This is a highly contemporary book, potentially offering the left a set of implements with which to win arguments on terrain often dominated by the populist right. After the depressing sight of Boris Johnson touring ex-industrial regions in a bus promising NHS funding that he knew would never materialise, the need for a more sincere vision of how people might ※take back control§ remains pressing. Monbiot＊s hopeful, practical energy is precisely what the left needs right now. Some of it borders on the utopian, but then so did Hayek＊s story.Optimism does produce its blind spots. Monbiot is alive to the thrill of popular power, but the dangers are absent. He touches on the pessimistic vision of Thomas Hobbes, the 17th-century philosopher who argued that the central function of the state is to stop us slaughtering each other, given our innately suspicious and arrogant nature. ※Today,§ Monbiot reassures us, ※knowing what we do about the nature and origins of humanity, we can state unequivocally§ that Hobbes＊s view ※is mistaken§. We＊d all like this to be true (even Hobbes would have done), but that＊s a brave call,  on the post-neoliberal precipice on which we stand.The yearning for belonging has historically been associated with romantic conservatism, although Monbiot offers some good counterexamples, such as the Clarion magazine, which formed socialist societies and ramblers＊ and cycling clubs during the 1890s. In the current climate, this poses a couple of questions, at least for the less optimistic reader. One is whether democratic participation can deliver the same sense of belonging as the darker political forces that are stirring, with their promise to look after their own and lock out the others. If the left is to start a conversation about belonging, it needs to be confident that it can finish it. After all, there is another storyteller in Britain, also challenging the cult of GDP growth and prioritising a sense of belonging: his name is .It is far from certain that democracy 每 even thriving, inclusive democracy 每 will produce the happy social and environmental outcomes Monbiot expects it to, including a respect for science. The indeterminacy of popular power is both its thrill and its danger. At one point Monbiot writes expertly on how to combine music, ※energisers§ and speakers to convert the vitality of protest marches into more lasting campaign outcomes. ※The energiser would bring back the musicians to lead the crowd in an anthem: there＊s no better way of generating a sense of solidarity and shared emotion,§ which sounds as much like a Trump rally as the ones that attract Monbiot＊s sympathies.Monbiot might well respond that severe dangers have already been realised, in the form of climate change, political corruption, psychological distress and inequality. Why live in fear of emerging enemies, when the established ones are already running amok?  is partly an activists＊ manual, which aims to coordinate and energise those who want a different world.

"The UK＊s ?1bn industry that sells films and TV shows such as Victoria, Sherlock and Love Island across  is under threat from plans in Brussels that will slash their value to broadcasters on the continent, a cross-party group of MPs has warned the government.The European commission is developing regulations that will allow broadcasters to make their online TV services 每 such as the iPlayer, ITV Player and Channel 4＊s All4 每 available to viewers across Europe, while only having to pay the makers of TV shows and films for the right to air their content in one country.UK TV and filmmakers earn almost ?1bn annually selling their shows country-by-country to European broadcasters, earning a fee for licensing a programme in each territory. Critics argue that the commission＊s proposals threaten to destroy that value by effectively creating one bargain basement pan-European licence fee for each piece of content sold.A cross-party group of seven MPs, including former culture secretary John Whittingdale, Labour shadow culture secretary Tom Watson and Scottish National party culture spokesman Brendan O＊Hara, have written a letter calling on the government to oppose these aspects of the commission＊s Digital Single Market agenda.※We are writing to urge you to issue a clear and definitive statement of the government＊s position on those aspects of the EC＊s agenda which currently threaten the future financing of UK film and television content and will result in poor choice for consumers,§ says the letter, which has been sent to culture secretary Karen Bradley. ※There is a cross-party consensus that the government needs to do more to support the UK audio-visual sector.§Europe is the second-biggest market for UK TV exports 每 only North America is bigger 每 worth well in excess of ?400m in sales annually. A further ?500m of the ?2bn British global film exports annually are accounted for by sales across Europe.The MPs argue that if this overseas sales revenue is lost it will mean far fewer top quality British TV shows and films being made, and will threaten tens of thousands jobs.※Any intervention by the European commission which undermines the ability to license on an exclusive territorial basis will lead to less investment in new productions and reduce the quality and range of content available to UK and EU consumers,§ said John McVay, the chief executive of Pact, the UK body representing independent TV and film production companies. The MPs say that the UK government needs to follow the lead of France, Spain and Italy, countries that have expressed opposition to Brussels＊ proposals because of the potential impact on their domestic film and TV industries.The MPs say that the UK＊s withdrawal from Europe will not insulate British producers from the problem because the 27 remaining EU countries will operate under the proposed system.※After Brexit, UK-based companies will still look to distribute content across the European market and engage in co-productions with European partners,§ the letter says. ※Any proposals that undermine the value of in this market will therefore have a major impact on the UK sector. The discussions at EU level are at a crucial stage and the UK has yet to publish a clear and unambiguous statement on this issue.§																																											"

"t was summer: Brussels was in the grip of a heatwave and Britain was isolated in Europe. The year was 1987 and Margaret Thatcher was in her prime, recalls Lord John Kerr, a former UK ambassador to the . Fresh from her 1987 election victory and ※full of adrenaline§, Thatcher refused to compromise on an EU budget line, blocking the final summit communique approved by 11 other European leaders. ※It was June and it was the old Charlemagne building [in Brussels] and the air conditioning broke down and it was a heatwave,§ Kerr recalls. ※The fact it was hot and uncomfortable and unpleasant contributed to the disastrous outcome.§If a broken air-conditioning system can leave a subtle mark on the course of history, what does that means for Brexit? Talks between the UK and the 27 EU countries conclude on Thursdayand over the next 575 or so days, Brexit secretary  and his officials will spend hours, days and weeks in a succession of meeting rooms in the EU capital.In fact, the UK＊s Brexit fate will be sealed in two buildings on opposite sides of a traffic-clogged road in Brussels＊ EU quarter. The EU briefly considered other buildings for the Brexit negotiations 每 including the nearby Borschette centre, a sad-looking concrete bunker-style conference centre. But officials soon settled on the Berlaymont, the starfish-shaped headquarters of the European commission, now the base of the EU＊s Brexit negotiator, .The building has long generated mixed headlines. Praised for its bold, 1960s modernist architecture, damned for its overrunning, , it takes its name from the former convent that stood on the site when the neighbourhood was still a sleepy residential district.The Berlaymont was designed by Belgian architect Lucien de Vestel, who was inspired by the . When it was finished, one critic for Pr谷sences magazine wrote that the building reflected ※both the 20th-century innovative spirit and sheer audacity and brings to mind the astonishing  at the [Brussels world fair] 1958 exhibition§.After its renovation in the 1990s, the building＊s operational facilities spread out over 14 floors, with offices for 2,700 officials, a 900-seat cafeteria, broadcasting studios, conference rooms and even a Nordic sauna. The style is smooth functionality: vanilla walls, lots of blond wood and neat Ikea-style pot plants. At least the temperature control works better than when Thatcher was one against 11.On the first day of talks, Davis and his top officials were whisked to the 13th floor for a four-course meal. From this vantage point, they would have had a commanding view of Brussels, from the  twinkling in the distance to the nearby , a formal landscaped park built by Leopold II with proceeds from his .The other main Brexit venue is across the street from the Berlaymont: the Europa building, the new headquarters for EU leaders  for its distinctive oval-shaped window.The main leaders＊ meeting room is decorated with multicoloured carpets and ceilings, intended to symbolise ※the united patchwork of Europe§. It is also smaller than its equivalent in the old summit building, so EU leaders can see each other more easily, without having to rely on screens. The architect, Philippe Samyn, said he wanted to create a ※joyful and friendly§ building, contrasting the round meeting rooms with ※authoritarian§ squares and rectangles.So far, it is not obvious whether the playroom colours will make Brexit talks more ※joyful and friendly§. Most EU leaders apparently like the building, although some have . In a typically tart observation, the Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskait?, said the ※screaming colours§ were to ※keep everyone awake§. That might not be a bad thing for EU summits that can drag on until the small hours of the morning. Germany＊s Angela Merkel, in her understated style, said that ※the atmosphere in the new room was different from in the past§.In autumn 2018, when talks are expected to reach a critical point, Britain＊s  fate will likely be sealed inside this building. But the British prime minister is not expected to negotiate directly with EU leaders. Instead, EU leaders will hear Barnier＊s verdict on his talks with the British and reach their own decisions 每 without the British PM in the room.The British leader will remain a regular guest in the building, though, until the UK leaves the EU at the end of March 2019. Theresa May is already familiar with the routine: the , followed by talks on an array of subjects, from high foreign policy strategy to choosing a new European council president. A three-course working lunch or dinner is never far away.Brexit means Britain will be excluded from these gatherings after 2019. Even today, the mood in Brussels is already very different from the days Kerr remembers, when Brussels was ※a British city§. ※Everyone listened to the Brits,§ he says. ※It was wonderful. We were playing at home those days.§																																											"
"Winnie-the-Pooh may have secured a place in the hearts of children worldwide and made his creator a millionaire, but author  resented the way the bear of little brain undermined his reputation as a serious writer.The revelation appears in his 1939 memoir , which is to be republished on 21 September, 70 years after it went out of print and ahead of the release of a biopic about his son, . Despite the success of Pooh, Piglet, Tigger and friends, Milne was frustrated that his reputation as a writer for adults had been irrevocably damaged.Prior to his children＊s books, Milne had written a string of hit plays, novels and short stories for adults, as well as editing the satirical magazine Punch. But his first book of children＊s verse, When We Were Very Young, sold 50,000 copies within two months of publication in 1924 and his Winnie-the-Pooh books became immediate bestsellers around the world. When the first volume Winnie-the-Pooh was published in 1926, it sold 150,000 copies by the end of the year in the US alone. It has never been out of print since.In It＊s Too Late Now, Milne claims that he had tired of children＊s writing after 70,000 words (※the number of words in the average-length novel§), but was trapped. ※I wanted to escape from [children＊s books] as I had once wanted to escape from Punch; as I have always wanted to escape,§ he writes. ※In vain. England expects the writer, like the cobbler, to stick to his last.§In one waspish passage, to which today＊s bestselling authors would no doubt relate, Milne adds: ※It is inevitable that a book that has had very large sales should become an object of derision to critics and columnists.§ In a swipe at literary snobs, he adds: ※We all write books, we all want money: we who write want money from our books. If we fail to get money, we are not so humble, nor so foolish, as to admit that we have failed in our object. Our object, we maintain, was artistic success.§The book also reveals a fraught relationship with literary critics. In his sights was the famously acid critic Dorothy Parker, r. The House at Pooh Corner resulted in one of Parker＊s most famous putdowns: ※Tonstant Weader Fwowed up§.Milne was stung and traded back: ※However greatly indebted to Mrs Parker, no Alderney, at the approach of the milkmaid, thinks ＆I hope this lot will turn out to be gin＊, no writer of children＊s books says gaily to his publisher, ＆Don＊t bother about the children, Mrs Parker will love it＊.§The memoir also shows that Milne appeared blithely unaware of the negative impact the Pooh books had on his son, Christopher Robin, who became estranged from his father later in life.Recalling that his son referred to himself as ※Billy Moon§, Milne writes: ※I mention this because it explains why the publicity that came to be attached to ＆Christopher Robin＊ never seemed to affect us personally, but to concern either a character in a book or a horse that we hoped at one time would win the Derby.§However, Christopher Robin was mercilessly bullied at school because of Winnie-the-Pooh,  ※had got where he was by climbing on my infant shoulders, that he had filched from me my good name and had left me with nothing but the empty fame of being his son.§Harriet Sanders, who is republishing the memoir for Macmillan＊s imprint Bello, said it revealed Milne to be more complex than many assume. ※People think they know him, but the memoir reveals that though he is very famous, we hardly know anything about him,§ she said.Bello, which revives out-of-print titles, is publishing the memoir alongside seven of Milne＊s other lesser known works, including a 1921 novel based on his 1919 play Mr Pim Passes By, a comedy of errors set in a grand home in Buckinghamshire; a 1933 murder mystery called Four Days of Wonder, which follows an enthusiastic teenage girl detective; and Birthday Party & Other Stories, a collection of 15 short stories that was first published in 1948.

The town of just over 6,000 sits at the very north-eastern tip of , three hours from Inverness, seven from Glasgow 每 ※the arse end of nowhere,§ as Darren Coghill, drummer for Neon Waltz, jokingly puts it. It＊s the sort of place where deer roam freely and castles outnumber supermarkets. Even the band themselves seem faintly bemused by their success. ※We never expected to get anywhere because nobody from up here normally gets anywhere,§ says singer Jordan Shearer matter of factly. ※When people started taking an interest, we thought, ＆Jesus, people actually like our band?＊§Shearer, Coghill, guitarists (and brothers) Kevin and Jamie Swanson, bassist Calvin Wilson, and keyboardist Liam Whittles met the same way everyone does here: at the high school, of which there is only one. As teenagers, their interest in music was piqued by parents＊ record collections and the radio, and they drifted in and out of numerous cover bands with friends. Neon Waltz ※just fell into place§, says Shearer, as they were the only six who wanted to take it further. ※I don＊t know exactly when we started jamming together, it just kind of happened.§ Their early promise was spotted by Atlantic, who signed them to a lucrative deal that meant quitting their day jobs and, for Shearer, getting a car, even though he can＊t drive. (He remains the only one yet to pass his test.) Almost immediately though, tensions surfaced.※From day one we thought, ＆This doesn＊t feel right,＊§ says Kevin. Things came to a head when a demo was sent back to them featuring synths that weren＊t their own. ※We went: ＆Where did that come from?＊§ says Shearer, recoiling at the experience. ※It was clear they just wanted to turn us into a band that were ＆in＊. We weren＊t willing to do that.§ Despite admitting a degree of naivety, Shearer has no regrets. ※You get offered a lot of money from a big label, especially when you didn＊t expect anything, of course you＊re going to take it.§ It took a year to sort out a formal split from the label, during which time the band got their heads down and wrote. Some songs ended up on their debut album Strange Hymns, with the rest ready to go as soon as the ※boffins§, as Shearer calls his management, agree. They recorded a new version of one of them, Heavy Heartless, in the schoolhouse on the abandoned island of Stroma off the north coast, utilising the school＊s harmonium, which had lain silent for 50 years.Two days earlier, we＊re all squashed into Morris, their beloved van, whizzing along narrow roads past fields of sheep and endless brown scrubland to soundcheck for their own mini festival in Wick, Sounds of the Summer. The van has over 250,000 miles on the clock 每 not all theirs 每 and it shows; the speedometer is broken and rust is slowly eating it. ※We once plugged a radiator leak with white bread,§ grins Whittles mischievously. ※It got us all the way to Sheffield and back.§ Inside, it＊s strewn with the detritus of lads on tour: empty cans and bottles, takeaway cartons, Viz yearbooks. It＊s also home to Stevie, a battered ventriloquist＊s dummy that was a gift from Atlantic.This far north, logistics matter, and Morris forms an important part of that. The band＊s HQ and practice space is the Croft, a cold, dilapidated house belonging to Wilson＊s sheep-farming father. But the band are spread out; some are closer to town while Coghill lives in John O＊Groats, in North House, almost the most northerly residence in mainland Britain. Planning is also vital. Festival soundcheck over, we speed east to Thurso because the band need guitar strings; the last music shop in Wick closed more than 10 years ago.We take a stroll around the centre before retiring to a local pub they＊ve played before. Not five minutes have passed before one of their tunes is piped through the speakers. ※Oh, here we go,§ says Wilson suspiciously. ※Someone＊s at it.§ They say this isn＊t common in bars, but house parties are a different story. ※They always want you to sing along,§ says Shearer. ※It＊s a wee bit embarrassing.§ Almost everyone I encounter over three days knows who they are, while well over half the festival＊s 600 attendees are wearing band T-shirts and pin badges.And then there＊s Nana, their Japanese superfan. A Tokyo native who speaks only basic English, who has seen them at least 10 times and has tickets for the first five shows of their forthcoming tour. No one is sure exactly what she does or how she affords such globetrotting. Three signed plectrums from the band dangle from her iPhone. The band dote on her, and she seems genuinely happy to just soak up their presence. During the show she is front and centre, taking pictures and dancing away; when Shearer reveals he is wearing the T-shirt she gave him as a gift, she almost bursts into tears.Later, over drinks, he tells me their manager once said that moving away would become inevitable. Will it? ※We would work it out,§ he replies. ※It always works out.§ There＊s an evident pride in the local lads done good, a ※same team§ ethos as Kevin calls it. Understandably, they＊re reluctant to leave all this behind; homes, the familiar, this ※cold place with explosions of light§ as Kevin puts it. Late on Sunday, we are at Camps Bar, the local karaoke joint. Shearer gamely struggles through TLC＊s No Scrubs before last orders and closing time. ※Right Neon Waltz, get OOT!§ shouts the barmaid; it＊s the only time all weekend their indulgences are denied.

"he roles of director and producer in theatre often involve contrasting qualities 每 academic and bureaucrat, happy collaborator and back-room schemer, maverick and establishment figure 每 but what was remarkable about , who has , is that he possessed all of these attributes in rotation and only occasional contradiction.Hall＊s most startling and lasting achievement is to have been the founding father of the UK＊s two biggest subsidised theatres in the form that we now know them: the  and the .As a director, he had a range that could encompass one of the most radical and audience-baffling plays of the 20th century 每 Samuel Beckett＊s Waiting for Godot, which he  每 and one of the most conservative and crowd-pleasing: ＊s 1979 operatic whodunnit , which transferred from the National to the West End and Broadway, swelling a personal wealth that was one of the recurrent controversies during a career in which Hall 每 a large, loud, stubborn man 每 tended to attract admirers and detractors of equal fervour.Born working-class 每 the son of a Suffolk railwayman 每 Hall had scholarships to Perse public school then Cambridge University. Even as a boy, he had an impresario＊s touch 每 organising his fellow 11-year-olds into a band 每 but the most crucial event of his adolescence was when, as a 15-year-old, he saw at the  a production of Love＊s Labours Lost by the then wonder-boy of British theatre, , only six years his senior.Revealingly, Hall admitted to having succumbed at that moment to the double ambition of not merely becoming a Shakespearean director but also being in charge of the theatre. Within a few years 每 when Hall, just out of Cambridge, was already in charge of the Arts  in London 每 Brook invited Hall for a drink to talk about working in Stratford.Though they became mutually supportive, the two Peters were professionally and personally opposites: Brook an ascetic, shamanistic perfectionist who retreated to Paris where he was happiest spending years working in private on productions, Hall a workaholic hedonistic showman who sought and enjoyed power in both the subsidised and commercial theatre.In 1958, aged only 28, Hall was appointed to run the Stratford Memorial theatre, driving its transformation into the  and adding a London base (at the Aldwych theatre) to its headquarters in Shakespeare＊s birthplace, exploring (with Brook and John Barton) radical rethinking of Shakespeare 每 such as Barton and Hall＊s rearrangement of the English history plays as The Wars of the Roses and Brook＊s circus-based A Midsummer Night＊s Dream 每 and introducing, in Harold Pinter, the concept of a living house dramatist in a classical playhouse.This experience in expanding and rebranding a subsidised theatre made him, in the early 70s, when the  was moving from the Old Vic to huge new premises on the South Bank in London, the logical candidate 每 except to a few of the devoted lieutenants of the NT＊s actor-manager, Laurence Olivier 每 to take over.Few visitors to the current National Theatre 每 recently lavishly extended with ?80m of private money 每 remember or appreciate the near-fatal difficulties of the building＊s birth. Construction delays and budget over-runs meant that, in 1975, Hall, as artistic director, took occupancy of a building site which he opened in steps over the next two years. The developments were plagued by financial crises and union disputes, which, his  later revealed, led Hall, in 1979, to vote Conservative for the only time in a life in which he always defined himself on the political left, despite lavish tastes and a belief in private schooling for his children.Although he often adopted an outward manner of invincibility and bonhomie 每 a much-republished picture from the National years caught him doubled-up in a lion＊s roar of laughter 每 this public armour hid sensitivities that could easily be inflamed by domestic crises or the newspaper abuse for which he became a frequent target, partly due to being seen as a champagne socialist and poster boy for the funding of culture by the taxpayer.In his 20s, he suffered a physical and emotional collapse at the RSC and, for a while, directed from a day-bed in the rehearsal room. His diaries record treatment for a variety of stress-related illnesses (including high blood-pressure and shingles) and, in his memoirs, he admitted to suffering such depression while running the theatrical behemoths that he contemplated suicide.A committed atheist, Hall once admitted to thinking about death every day, from as early as his 20s, but this Larkinesque terror of extinction drove him not, as it did Larkin, to alcoholism but to a punishing work rate in his hurry to get everything done. Even past his 80th birthday, he admitted to feeling most alive when rehearsing, finding backing for commercial companies first in London and then Bath, although his retirement was eventually forced by a final phase of frailty that was heralded by an incident 每 heavily publicised, to the mortification of himself and his family 每 in which he fell asleep during a West End production (not his own) and woke up shouting confused abuse.But, as he admitted in private, Hall＊s frenetic diary during six decades was also driven by the pressures of alimony and school fees. He married successively 每 and with more or less progressive levels of success 每 the actress Leslie Caron, his National Theatre secretary Jacqueline Taylor, the opera singer  and the former NT publicist Nicki Frei; earlier in his National regime, there had also been another long and close relationship with a female colleague. There is a moment in his diaries when, in 1977, he is almost terrified to read Harold Pinter＊s new play Betrayal, which concerns adultery, because of the implosion of his own private life.He managed, though, to maintain close and proud relationships with his six children, who include , currently artistic director of the Hampstead Theatre in London, and the actress , whose movies include Woody Allen＊s Vicky Cristina Barcelona. One of her father＊s favourite anecdotes in later interviews was that, when he expressed the desire to cast her in a National Theatre production of Twelfth Night to mark his 80th birthday, he was asked: ※Do you think you can get her?§The question of the extent to which the financial demands on Hall affected his artistic decisions is complex. Some members of the National Theatre boards feared that the repertoire might sometimes be shaped by the need for lucrative commercial transfers directed by Hall himself and there were certainly some odd projects, including the disastrous Marvin Hamlisch musical Jean, inspired by conspiracy theories surrounding the death of the film star Jean Seberg.And yet, as the National was threatened with financial collapse during most of Hall＊s regime, the need for profitable box office products was as much public as private, although his diaries record a number of commitments 每 including presenting the ITV arts series Aquarius, appearing in wallpaper commercials and directing operas around the world 每 that brought no benefit to the National and resulted in the absence of the artistic director. It was, in effect, a criticism of Hall that the contracts of his successors have been notably tough about leaves of absence and commercial earnings.Hall always attracted implacable foes who felt sidelined by him. Michael Blakemore＊s 2013 book  published a lengthy memo read by Blakemore at a 1976 directors meeting, which accused Hall of personal greed and self-aggrandisement in his scheduling of productions and negotiation of deals for commercial transfers of NT shows.Apart from his alleged egomania and megalomania, the aspects of Hall that irritated his enemies were his personal earnings, first-class lifestyle (he drove a Rolls Royce in the 1960s and was a keen Concorde-commuter in the 70s and 80s) and perhaps also his success with so many much younger very attractive women, even as his waistline expanded and hairline retreated. However, no other theatrical figure in his lifetime would have been able or willing to put in the long nights and bloody fights that brought the National Theatre into being.Hall＊s legacy as a director is less concrete than the buildings. The approach to Shakespeare that he ultimately favoured 每 full texts staged in period costume and spoken with a metronomic attention to the iambic pentameter of the verse 每 has been overtaken in recent years by a fashion for shorter, more demotic and time-shifted productions.But Harold Pinter＊s receipt of the Nobel prize in literature in 2005 was at least partly due to Hall＊s achievement, in directing every Pinter stage premiere from The Collection at the RSC in 1962 to Other Places at the National two decades later, in finding a spare, crisp style of staging and acting for scripts that, on the page, contained almost no instructions for performance.Even the greatest directors of theatre leave nothing beyond them, except possibly a filmed record of key productions, but Sir , more in the manner of an architect, leaves his legacy on the skyline in two huge buildings 每 the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company 每 that would almost certainly not have been built nor survived without him. Surely, eventually, a room or even an auditorium at one of the theatres will be be named after him.Anyone who works in, or goes to see, a production in subsidised theatre for the foreseeable future will be in the debt of this driven, energetic man who, though never short of personal ambition, put it to the service of larger public causes.

"ritish TV director Michael Pearce makes a commanding feature debut with this psychological drama-thriller that puts an eerily windswept island location to fine use and features an excellent lead performance from Jessie Buckley, whose open, intelligent face transmits thought and feeling with piercing clarity. Pearce has also written a well-carpentered screenplay; there are some very big scenes and big moments here 每 sometimes too big 每 but he gives us a carefully crafted dramatic setup, an intriguingly curated selection of suspects for the crime and all of it building to a fascinating, finely balanced ambiguity in the movie＊s climactic stages.The scene is Jersey, where a serial killer has murdered several young girls; in their tense, clenched way the citizens are carrying on, only rarely acknowledging this elephant of horror in their living room. Buckley plays Moll, a delicately beautiful and unhappy young woman and put-upon daughter (the character reminded me of her Marya Bolkonskaya in the ), who has a terrible job that she hates: a tourist bus-trip guide. She lives at home with her parents, a dad with Alzheimer＊s and a fiercely controlling mother Hilary (Geraldine James) who conducts the church choir of which Moll is an obedient member. Hilary treats Moll like a child who needs cold and unfeeling discipline; she doesn＊t hesitate to make it clear that Moll is a lesser sibling than her smug brother Harrison (Oliver Maltman) or her manicured sister Polly (Shannon Tarbet), who manages to upstage Moll at her own birthday party by complacently announcing that she is pregnant with twins (Hilary impulsively asks for the champagne to be brought from the garage, and to add insult to injury tells the birthday girl to go and get it). Enraged, Moll runs out on the gathering, which includes Cliff (Trystan Gravelle), the stuffy young police officer who is hoping to make her his girlfriend.There is a reason for this cruel and controlling treatment, and it isn＊t simply the reports of a killer on the island. There is a dark secret about Moll＊s emotional life, which explains Hilary＊s own behaviour: James＊s performance efficiently conveys her gimlet-eyed air of martyred authority. And then Moll horrifies her family, her mother in particular, when she takes a liking to a dangerous outsider with a police record. This is Pascal (Johnny Flynn) who for all his roughness seems to be the only person with the delicacy and gentleness to understand Moll. He carries a rifle for shooting (and poaching), giving him a hint of Mellors with Lady Chatterley. But there is something very dark about Pascal, and perhaps it has caused darkness to surface 每 or resurface 每 in Moll. Soon Pascal is in the frame for the killings and Moll has to decide how far she is prepared to go to protect him. Pearce is very good at showing the little touches of transgression that this relationship involves: Moll asks Pascal to come to the family home to do some odd jobs, and Pascal, with instinctive truculence, smokes in the house and muddies up the carpet; Johnny Flynn＊s performance shows how Pascal is savouring the sense that he has the rights of a disapproved-of boyfriend, and it is by rudeness that he will bolster this position. As for Moll, her troubled, unhappy nature is not calmed in any way by this new romantic excitement. Inevitably, the swirl of criminal violence comes closer to the couple and the film becomes more of a forensic thriller, with police interrogations and tabloid TV intrusions.The movie comes to a head with a final conversation at a beachside restaurant, an exhilaratingly clever and ambiguous scene in which we must decide what is happening and where our sympathies lie. Beast is a title which might appear to promise horror or melodrama and there is a little of both. But there is always something subtler going on, and it comes from the finely judged performances of Buckley, James and Flynn, and the intelligent, responsive way they are shot by cinematographer Benjamin Kracun and directed by Pearce.

Le Carr谷 was employed by both MI5 and MI6 before becoming a writer, but he said the service then was a kind of ※non-violent fairyland§ hugely different to the security services of today.Asked whether he would recommend being a spy, he said: ※It is is such a huge industry now, with so many different compartments, it is almost like saying: would you take up the law? These services have altered so vastly since my day.§If people are, though, ※by instinct a befriender, a seducer and a liar, in the sense of a gentleman who lies for the good of his country§ then MI6 is for you, ※but think of the second half of your life because not many people have one§.Despite Le Carr谷＊s new book , his appearance is, according to one review, ※the slimmest of cameos§.Nevertheless, it has been rapturously received. : ※The ingenuity and skill with which the thing is brought off is breathtaking 每 really, not since The Spy [Who Came in from the Cold] has Le Carr谷 exercised his gift as a storyteller so powerfully and to such thrilling effect.§The book tells the story of Smiley＊s right-hand man Peter Guillam, summoned to MI6＊s headquarters in Vauxhall to explain the events from The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, which resulted in the deaths at the Berlin wall of agent Alec Leamas and his lover Liz Gold.Le Carr谷 said Guillam, ※when I＊m feeling confused but willing§, was the character he most related to, but there were parts of him in all his characters. ※You can＊t actually make character without putting something of yourself in to each one, even the most larcenous and wicked, the most lecherous, the most pure. Each of them has, in his or her own way, something that you can relate to.§Le Carr谷＊s previous Smiley novels are set in the cold war, an almost unimaginably different era to which he said he did not hark back. He admitted being old-fashioned, writing every day with a pen. And although there will be no more Smiley he said he would continue writing and was working on his next novel. ※I would go on writing even if I knew I was not going to be published, ever.

"he 2017 Miles Franklin award winner will be announced on Thursday night, but I＊m not taking bets on who it＊s likely to be. Each shortlisted novel is by a first-time nominee. Each is of satisfyingly high literary quality and very different in voice, logic, focus and story.But they do have one feature in common: each includes as a key character an author, or authors. I＊m not sure I have ever read a shortlist where the protagonists of each volume shared an occupation. Of course all five include heartbreak, loss and death (that is, after all, de rigueur for literary fiction), but the focus on the lives and works of writers and on narratives about narrative, presents as though the Australian literary community turned as one to look inward and then wrote down what it saw.We have a worn-out, avant-garde novelist (Last Days of Ava Langdon by Mark O＊Flynn); an ambulance-chasing journalist (An Isolated Incident by Emily Maguire); ※famous Australian writers§ (Their Brilliant Careers by Ryan O＊Neill); and academics in linguistics (Waiting by Philip Salom) and engineering (Extinctions by Josephine Wilson).This book by poet and novelist Mark O＊Flynn channels the Australian-New Zealand writer Eve Langley, and opens with the rhythm and pulse of a prose poem:This, on the very first page, sets the tone for the rest of the novel, one that vividly renders the glorious Blue Mountains environment (and its small towns with their country values) and the portrait of a writer who might have been, should have been, no longer is. O＊Flynn presents his Langley/Langdon as immensely sympathetic and stunningly irritating. ※All her life,§ says the narrator, ※has been the pursuit of the perfect line.§While any writer must surely doff the cap to that pursuit, Ava＊s single-mindedness has been more destructive than productive. She valiantly channels Oscar Wilde, refuses to acknowledge that she is ancient and frail, ignores the squalor of her home, and flickers between hope and hopelessness about her writing. She is a damaged person, a dada artist. She has lost her family and friends and she dies alone. Still, Ava＊s imagination (to say nothing of her splendid dress sense) brings a degree of sentience to the world, casting it in a luminous light. O＊Flynn＊s novel brings to bear a cold but tender gaze on ※the last days§ of someone who, but for fortune, could have been an extraordinary Australian artist.Philip Salom, another poet, gives us Waiting. It relies on the skill of poetic diction and the narrative traction of strong characters, the ※looking awry§ that so often accompanies mental illness, and the urgency to connect, to find a safe haven in an unforgiving world. He juxtaposes two pairs of difficult people to propel the narrative. The first two are Big (a cross-dressing, over-performing ※crazy professor§) and his partner Little (quiet, crushed Agnes, the troubled lamb of god). They have effectively fallen out of history and are, Agnes reflects, ※two characters in a novel who have no further story§. The second pair, by contrast, are the inheritors of a further story: designer/landscaper Angus (coincidentally Agnes＊ cousin) and the linguist Jasmin. They are creeping by fits and starts towards a relationship, but unlike Big and Little who cling together for the most part in real intimacy, Jasmin and Angus struggle to connect, given their tendency to compete with each other and their misunderstandings of each other＊s values and professions. For Angus, the physical shaping of the material world is what matters. For Jasmin, it is the sociopolitical positioning of work that matters.The novel is set against the increasingly threatening qualities of bushfire in the Australian environment, and the increasingly constrained options for those who do not or cannot fit into middle-class conventions. The characters＊ stories play out, to an end that promises consolation, at least.With An Isolated Incident, we leave the poets and misfits and return to the ※real§ world: small-town New South Wales and the struggle to make a living, maintain an identity and retain hope for the future. Chris Rogers, a barmaid and sometime prostitute, is faced with the loss of her beloved younger sister Bella, whose body is found on the side of the road, raped and murdered. May Norman, an ambitious journalist, attaches herself to Chris to report on the story and the unfolding investigation. So far, so crime thriller.But actually, this is more an analysis of mourning, woven through with a biting critique of the social and legal context in which, in Australia, one woman is murdered each week, on average, by someone close to her. At one point May reflects on yet another appalling story of such violence, and observes: The unwavering attention paid to violence against women and to the commercial exploitation of suffering renders the title bitterly ironic: all these ※isolated incidents§ add up to a deeply felt and troubling novel.Josephine Wilson＊s Extinctions is the winner of Dorothy Hewett Unpublished Manuscript prize, so has already made a significant mark on the literary landscape. It offers a tragic portrait of the various ways in which extinction looms 每 environmental, personal, cultural.We see the sorrows, indignities and regrets of old age as viewed through the eyes of retired theoretical engineer Fred Lothian, who fills his home with designer furniture rather than with his family.We see the heartbreak of a wasted life, in his brilliant son, Callum, who was left with acquired brain injury following a car accident. And we see the struggle for identity in his adopted daughter, Caroline, who researches species extinction and is disconnected from her own Indigenous heritage. Together, these stories present an overwhelming narrative of loss, failure and distress. But there is the possibility of an alternative in the form of Fred＊s neighbour Jan. Though like Fred and his family she has suffered great loss, she brings a wonderful energy and resilience, and a refusal to resign herself to extinction. Instead, she presses Fred to start over, to find a more productive way to be.Finally, we come to Their Brilliant Careers: The Fantastic Lives of Sixteen Extraordinary Australian Writers, one of the funniest novels I＊ve read in a long time. O＊Neill sails close to the wind of defamation (were the original authors still alive), unmercifully lampooning the models for his ※extraordinary Australian writers§. Like a supremely confident standup comic he pushes the joke from initial humour through infuriating repetition to helpless laughter. And along the way he shows impressive knowledge of Australian literary culture so erudite readers can play the game of ※spot the reference§. We see the sexism that runs through literary culture. We revisit the poetry wars 每 ※a knife fight in a phone booth§ 每 in the character of Arthur rhutrA, an author of whom it was said that ※the only constraint he couldn＊t overcome was his lack of talent§.We bump into parallel-universe versions of Ern Malley, Australia＊s most infamous literary hoax, and radio characters Dad and Dave. We meet the litigious Stratford, self-proclaimed original author of works plagiarised and made famous by Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Joyce.We are confronted by the rightwing racist Edward Gayle (writer for the journal Quarter) and the communist Francis McVeigh, whose early memory of reading Marx＊s Manifesto ※terrified me so much I had nightmares for the next six months§. Literary giant after literary giant, publisher after publisher, is kneecapped by these excoriating and hilarious accounts of the players, their work, and the impossibly interwoven lives they lead.* * *There is a surprising degree of compassion in the narrative voice that relates each of these novels, even when they are also characterised by sharp-eyed and sharp-tongued commentary. The characters are damaged 每 as are most human beings 每 but (with the exception of some of O＊Neill＊s writers) they are rarely people of ill will.The narrators, in each case, maintain the distance required of an objective observer, yet cannot help but record small acts of humanity, the struggle to manage, to be recognised and to recognise others. This makes them, as a group, the most heartwarming selection of shortlisted novels that I have read for some time. 																																											"
"anadian soprano Barbara Hannigan opens this album with a reminder, in no shy terms, of what a stupidly seductive vocalist she is.

"his Bourne trilogy rip-off takes the solipsism of that character and removes all of his interiority and self-reflection, centring a film around a protagonist whose deranged psychological profile is ※exactly what the CIA has been looking for§. Bereft after his fiancee is killed by a group of jihadis during a beach holiday massacre, Mitch Rapp (＊s Dylan O＊Brien, who looks more like a school shooter than an American Assassin) grows a beard and trains himself in martial arts in the hope of tracking down and destroying the perpetrators.

O＊Brien＊s Rapp is compact and wiry, with the floppy hair and belligerent fixedness of a men＊s rights activist. It＊s shallow and self-congratulatory, refusing to justify its incessant violence with character development or genre spectacle.																																											"
"ven in her heyday, Anastacia was no pop ingenue. Thirty-two when she broke through with her 2000 disco-funk debut single , her self-possession, strong, severe vocals and impressive collection of tinted glasses stood in satisfyingly for the usual writhing coquettishness. She fell off the radar in the mid-noughties amid health troubles 每 but scored massive success with , which combined Evanescence-style melodrama with a stonking pop chorus. Evolution, her seventh album, is unlikely to propel her back into similar levels of stardom, but it once again provides a welcome alternative to the current pop status quo 每 a slightly nauseating sound that mixes nursery rhyme chants with loud, abrasive production. Managing to feel anthemic in a gentler and more pleasingly melodic way, its songwriting proves as robust as Anastacia＊s still inimitable pipes, genre-hopping between rock, dance and slower, musical-style numbers with dexterity and warmth.

"here are three reviews of  that need to be written.The first is Destiny 2: the campaign, the game that you can sit down and play through from start to finish. It＊s a genuinely good experience, with a plot that makes sense, characters who have actual personalities, and a narrative delivered through more than just text inserts and mission descriptions. Take the opening mission, Homecoming, which is already familiar to those who played the beta. It would be perfectly possible to write an entire review focusing on this 30-minute experience, a textbook in game design laid out perfectly for the player.You begin, unlike in the first game, with a fully powered-up guardian, dropped into the middle of an all-out attack on the Tower, last cradle of humanity in a far flung future. Over a snappy string of set-pieces, the game introduces new players to the core cast of Cayde-6, Zavala and Ikora Rey, teaches them the basics of combat and of their special abilities, and drops plenty of fan service in the background for returning players. Most impressively, the level silently communicates the importance of teamwork, matchmaking players into groups of three in the background before throwing them in a larger space where they get to see the effects of other classes＊ super abilities, and find out their own abilities get recharged when their allies succeed.A twist of the narrative later, and your guardian finds themselves wracked, depowered, and stumbling through the crumbling remnants of the Last City. The canny design doesn＊t end quite yet, with the game smoothly introducing a final few concepts (you try to jump over a ledge you can＊t quite clear, only to discover the game now offers ※mantling§, letting your character pull themselves up from near-missed jumps), and your character slowly finding their way to allies. Strings swell, a falcon soars, and you realise this is perhaps the first time Destiny has ever done more than telling a story: it＊s evoking a feeling.From there, admittedly, things plateau a bit. Most of the rest of the campaign is a fun romp, a getting-the-band-back-together clich谷 with a few diversions here and there, before everything comes together in an all-out raid on the City, and the end credits roll. Look: you aren＊t going to be writing letters home about this plot. Even for an MMO, it＊s fairly thin, lacking the epic sweep that players of more traditional online games like WoW or FFXV have come to expect. But it＊s the first time in the three years of Destiny＊s history that you can reasonably say to the sort of person who bought the  to play through the single-player campaign that the Bungie they know and love is back.But about three quarters of the way through the campaign, Destiny 2 (the single-player game) takes a short excursion, introducing you to its true form: Destiny 2 (the eternal experience). That＊s the second review that needs to be written.It＊s a far smoother introduction than that of the first game, which unceremoniously dropped you from the end credits back in the game world with no real explanation of how to progress, what the next goal was, or why you were still playing. Now, in the midst of the campaign, the game takes the time to introduce the activities you＊ll spend the next few months repeating, once the story is over: the patrols, the strikes and the crucible. By the time you do finish the campaign, you＊ll likely be champing at the bit to sink some real time into these things.It＊s when it comes to the variety and enjoyment of these activities that Destiny 2 shines. Compared to earlier iterations of the game, where players rapidly realised that one and only one gameplay loop offered valuable rewards, here Destiny goes out of its way to offer you an incentive to range widely over its cornucopia of delights. That hasn＊t stopped players finding a marginally more rewarding loop, even so (if you＊re a min-maxer, expect to spend a lot of time on Titan over the first few months), but it does mean the days of running in circles through Archer＊s Line on the moon desperately farming Helium Filaments are over.New clan features also mean the game is a far less lonely experience for those without many online friends, and a far more rewarding one for those who are used to playing with a group. Destiny rewards you for being in a clan 每 any clan 每 and then heaps further rewards on clans that play together.The core gameplay loop has always worked on a narrow level, because the Bungie team are, and always have been, the masters of making gunplay satisfying on a minute-to-minute level. Shooting aliens in the head feels good in this game, and when you start receiving exotic weapons in the latter half, it feels even better. But the wider loop, of continually getting new and better loot, spiralling your character towards the level cap, is also improved. It＊s no longer a toxic fruit machine, and the number of guaranteed rewards in the game is at a level where it＊s possible to avoid huge levels of frustration entirely. There＊s a chance, in fact, that it may be too generous: a game with a level cap of 300 should probably not see players reaching 293 within a week, before the raid was even released, as a member of my clan did. That＊s a hollow complaint, though, and if your only problem is you play the game too efficiently, then you＊ll probably find other things in its gargantuan world to occupy you soon after.The last review is for those who＊ve been clinging to the first game for three years, who just need to be reassured that everything＊s still on track: Destiny 2 is Destiny without the bullshit. Almost. Everything you hated about the first three years of the game has been refined, removed, or reappraised, and the game that was left was one that makes sense from toe to tip. And then Bungie added in just a little bit of extra bullshit, focused on endgame micro-transactions: Sparrows are now cosmetic items you receive randomly in the game＊s lootbox-style ※bright engrams§; shaders, received the same way, are now single-use items, received in packs of three to five; and the faintest whiff of non-cosmetic paid upgrades exists in the armour and weapon ※modifications§, which you receive in the same way and use to boost your gear. It＊s not the end of the world, but it＊s a small preview of where you＊re likely to feel greatest irritation most rapidly. Ultimately, how it plays out in the long term comes down to how free the game is with these drops: currently, it looks like the intention is only to soak those who really want one specific exotic emote, or set of shaders. If that remains the case, I＊ll get over it.																																											"
"here is a lovely start to  (BBC2). Well, it＊s not lovely for Colin, or really a start for him, more like an end, the end. It＊s his birthday; his wife and daughter are throwing him a surprise birthday party. Trouble is, the surprise party exposes the Big Lie that Colin has been harbouring. Not only is he cheating on his wife but he has a whole other family, a mistress and another daughter (also called Catherine Walcott, to avoid mix-ups). The shock of suddenly being so publicly found out is too much for poor Colin; he has a heart attack, and sadly dies. Surprise!The end 每 of the show 每 is rather nice, too. Colin＊s ashes are scattered, by his daughters, the Catherine Walcotts, in a layby. Not because it was a favourite layby, but because it＊s exactly equidistant between where the Catherines live, and it was all they could agree on. Meanwhile, in the same layby by happy coincidence, Colin＊s wife Tess is having sex with a man she＊s just met on the internet ( as it happens: it makes me proud to work where I do), in his car.Well, trying to have sex, it＊s not going that well. The Kia might have scored well on fuel efficiency in Which Car but it＊s rubbish for sex in the front. Plus Tess＊s kaftan is in the way a bit, and she＊s not really over Colin to be honest, even if he was a lying, cheating, hypocritical bastard. He does finally get a better send-off: his ashes swept up off the layby (along with the odd fag butt), packed into a distress flare and fired into the Manchester night sky. Aww.But this is not about Colin. It is about Tess (Rebecca Front). And it＊s about her love rival Marilyn (Siobhan Finneran). And it＊s about the two Catherines, Cathy and Cat (Ellie White and Lauren Socha, respectively). It is these four women who fill the bit between the start and the end, and they do so very well. A lot of the humour comes from the social chasm between the half-sisters. Cathy is in reinsurance; she＊s organised and prissy, and she has a dull fiance called Marcus (though that might be in jeopardy after he sent some inadvisable picture texts and it looks as though his penis is about to go viral, flapping about all over social media). Cat works at Deliveroo and isn＊t with anyone at the moment. ※Well, this summer I finally completed Tinder so I＊m just taking a bit of a breather,§ she tells her new sister. Finally completed Tinder! That＊s a very good joke isn＊t it? Hats off , who wrote it. And it seems Cat really has completed Tinder; she knows every minor male character on it, knows them very well.Perhaps surprisingly, Cathy and Cat do find common ground. Not just because they share genes and a dad, but also a love of Supertramp (even if that obviously came via him). Nothing bridges a social chasm quite like a good 70s guilty pleasure carpool karaoke singalong. Like a king without a castle, Like a queen without a throne, I＊m an early morning lover, And I must be moving on ＃ Lovely 每 and so very different 每 from White and Socha. Though perhaps unsurprisingly, it＊s Front who nicks the show off them. She wears the role like she wears that kaftan: exuberantly, with loads of colour and relish, and a bursting out a little.It＊s good to see a comedy pilot that is more about character and narrative momentum than it is about gags. And one that doesn＊t come with laughter included; you get to decide yourself whether to or not, almost like you＊re an adult. I am not convinced the premise screams six-episode series, but I＊d be delighted to be proved wrong. (E4) looks as though it totally fulfils the . Melvin Odoom, presenting, even says ※think of it as a public service§. Couple Charlotte and Darren both think they＊re better looking than the other. Darren is certainly buff. ※Someone call a vet cos those swans are sick, bro,§ says Melvin. About his biceps, obviously. (I know what it means as I get it quite a lot, too. Maybe I＊ll go on with my girlfriend, just so she knows she＊s punching too.) They take selfies and the public get to decide who is right. I think it can claim innovation, and maybe diversity. Plus it will inspire debate among viewers: she＊s hotter, no way, he＊s hotter ＃She＊s hotter! Charlotte. Well well. Wait, though: there＊s a further thrilling twist. Darren gets a style makeover, and then he＊s voted hotter! Don＊t you dare go telling me that＊s not important.																																											"
" was a man of infinite contradictions. In public, he exuded confidence, authority and the gift for leadership that enabled him to both found the  and overcome the manifold crises surrounding the early days of the National Theatre. Yet, having interviewed Hall countless times over the past 40 years, I also saw that he was vulnerable, sensitive and even sometimes strangely solitary. I have a vivid memory of travelling to Athens in the mid-1980s with a party of critics to see Hall＊s production of Coriolanus, with , staged in the Herod Atticus theatre. One morning we announced we were going to Athens＊ National Archaeological Museum. ※Do you mind if I come with you?§ Hall asked, almost apologetically. It was a sudden glimpse into the loneliness of a director once the task of getting the show up and running has been achieved.Long before I got to know Hall, or even write about his work, I had followed his career. I first saw his work at Stratford in the late 1950s when a slightly chilly Love＊s Labour＊s Lost was followed by a blissful Twelfth Night, a symphony in russet staged in Caroline costume, and an overwhelming Coriolanus, this time with .Given the two men＊s chequered relationship when Hall succeeded Olivier at the National, it is fascinating to recall how much the young director brought out of the great actor. This was vintage Olivier who gave us a Coriolanus full of emotional power, physical audacity and withering irony.When Hall went on to create the RSC, the production that defined the ensemble spirit of the company was undoubtedly , which offered a conflation, achieved by John Barton, of the three parts of Henry VI and Richard III.Today we expect to see the plays given in their entirety. But Hall＊s production was exactly right for the early 1960s. Its cynicism about power-politics coincided with a year of Tory disarray in which Harold Macmillan＊s sudden resignation provoked a period of unseemly back-stabbing. Its chauvinist portrait of the perfidious French reminded us of De Gaulle＊s peremptory veto of British membership of the EEC. Even the assassination of President Kennedy seemed to chime with the work＊s portrayal of power as something subject to arbitrary extinction. Hall＊s work for the RSC was vibrant, urgent and exciting. In 1965, against the advice of all his colleagues, he staged Harold Pinter＊s The Homecoming in the large Aldwych theatre: a production of meticulous precision, in which actors such as Paul Rogers, Ian Holm and John Normington applied their Shakespearean expertise to the ambiguities of Pinter＊s text. That same year, Hall directed a Stratford Hamlet in which a young David Warner seemed to echo the baffled alienation of a whole 60s generation. In between these productions, Hall directed Schoenberg＊s opera Moses and Aaron at Covent Garden with a cast of 300 and an on-stage orgy that induced me to get a standing ticket for the first night.Hall later confessed to me that he left the RSC too early, in 1968: his work was not done but he was exhausted and he had found, in Trevor Nunn, an ideal successor. Unlike King Lear, Hall always had the capacity to relinquish power and to discover talent in the next generation. On that trip to Athens for Coriolanus, I remember Hall gave me an extraordinarily candid interview in which he said he was aiming to leave the National and wanted Richard Eyre to succeed him. ※My only fear,§ he said, ※is that the board may think he is too leftwing.§ Happily, Eyre became the duly appointed heir.Hall＊s tenure at the National from 1973 to 1988 is a subject in itself and encompasses a wide range of work. I intemperately loathed his opening masque-like production of The Tempest, when the company was still at the Old Vic, and said it was one of the worst Shakespearean productions I had ever seen: a rash statement given some of the dreck of recent years. Hall went on to do masterly productions of Ibsen＊s John Gabriel Borkman, Pinter＊s No Man＊s Land and Marlowe＊s impossible Tamburlaine the Great. His work later went into decline with oddly neutral, unimaginative productions of Volpone, The Country Wife and The Cherry Orchard. It may have been because he was spreading himself too thin or because of the pressures in his private life.But he brought all his operatic instinct to Peter Shaffer＊s Amadeus in 1979 and thereafter recovered his lost form. Jean Seberg in 1983 was a massive musical flop but Hall＊s  and Anthony Hopkins, was magnificent. No production I＊ve seen has caught so well the idea that the play＊s two principals are steeped in a self-deluding dream or rendered the language with such crystalline clarity.Hall＊s final achievement was a sequence of Shakespeare＊s late plays that were very good at the National and even better when I saw them on tour in Tbilisi where they were stripped of their original set and costumes because of Soviet transport problems. It was a measure of Hall＊s rapt attention to the verse, as well as to the resourcefulness of the actors, that they transcended the dearth of decor.But what I most admired about Hall at the National was his tenacity in withstanding industrial action, persistent attacks from disappointed members of the Olivier regime and media abuse. This came to a head in 1986 with a lead story in the Sunday Times 每 headlined Laughing all the way to the bank 每 alleging that both Hall at the National and Trevor Nunn at the RSC were, in effect, exploiting their privileged position for their own commercial advantage. In fact, I think there were loopholes in directors＊ contracts that the Cork enquiry into English theatre, of which I was a member, sought to address: we proposed that no director should ever make more money from a commercial transfer than the producing theatre. But what struck me at the time, and does so still, was that the Sunday Times story was intended as an assault on the subsidised sector and used Hall and Nunn as convenient whipping boys.Shortly after this I made a long TV profile of Hall with Derek Bailey that gave me many insights into the man himself. I remember a rainy day filming at Hall＊s Sussex home where his young daughter, Rebecca, showed a remarkable capacity to entertain herself. Hall was also highly critical of his early work: especially his famous 1955 Waiting for Godot which, he said, was over-decorative and filled the silences with wispy fragments of Bart車k. But Hall also struck me as a mixture of the adventurous and the conservative: passionate in his belief in new writing but ultra-cautious when I challenged him on the National＊s failure to promote women directors.After he left the National, Hall＊s career was peripatetic and periodically productive: he seemed like a director in need of a stable financier. He occasionally found one and did wonderful productions such as a West End Wild Duck in 1990 with Alex Jennings. But the great dream of Hall in his later years was to revivify the Old Vic, and there was a time in the mid-1990s when this started to happen. He initiated a seven-day operation, created a regular company and, with the aid of Dominic Dromgoole, made new plays part of the repertory alongside established classics. It was a bold, imaginative idea and when it fell apart, because the Old Vic＊s owners decided to sell the building, Hall was palpably crushed.Fortunately he later found a permanent home at the  Royal, Bath, where he approached the standard repertory with fresh insight: never more so than in a Much Ado About Nothing that brought out the latent homosexuality in Don John＊s relationship to Claudio or in a Pygmalion that caught Professor Higgins＊s ruefulness, as well as delight, in seeing Eliza achieve a spirited independence.But, inevitably, there was a certain sadness in Hall＊s later years. I vividly remember doing a public interview with him at the Galway international arts festival in 2009. It was diplomatically suggested that we should meet for lunch in advance to map out the territory: something unheard of with the highly articulate Hall. On the day all went well until we touched on the subject of Shakespearean verse-speaking. ※People sometimes accuse me of being ＃§ said Hall and then suddenly words failed him. ※An iambic fundamentalist?§ I prompted and Hall, recovering his nerve, said ※Yes, that＊s it.§ It was a small moment but a hint of the onset of dementia.When I last interviewed him on his 80th birthday, he was mellow, reflective and told me that he had a lot of luck in his life and been blessed with doing the job he adored. What he didn＊t say was that he had also made his own luck and left the British theatre, through his work at the RSC and the National and his unremitting championship of the subsidy principle, infinitely richer than he had found it.

" is a master of the grotesque, perhaps best known for his expressionistically unreliable narrators, their overheated identities dying like flies on flypaper in front of the reader. His second novel, , was filmed in 2002 by David Cronenberg; his ninth is a love story set in London just after the second world war. We open with the funeral of famous actor Charles ※Gricey§ Grice. It＊s 1947, a bitterly cold day in Golders Green. England sees itself as ※morally magnificent and economically broke§. The dramatis personae immediately begins to scroll: Joan, the eponymous wardrobe mistress, Gricey＊s wife of 30 years, a ※striking-looking woman§ and a formidable one; their actor daughter Vera, soon to be a star, ※in dark glasses and a black fur coat§; Vera＊s husband Julius Glass, ※the former impresario§, who seems to have brought his mistress too, and looms ※close over his women like a kind of yellow marsh heron§.With a sentence or two, McGrath has caught our attention. The narrative hurries smoothly along, building the world, revealing the character of the characters. But the narrating voice is another matter entirely. Like the theatrical chorus the reader already suspects it to be, this cuts in regularly in the first person plural, to insist that what you＊re seeing isn＊t quite what you＊re being shown. Each time the narrative finds its stride, encouraging the reader to immerse in the wardrobe mistress＊s plight, there＊s a check, a qualification. It＊s a technique that might become irritating but that pays off steadily as it quantifies and reveals the darkness that underpinned Gricey＊s life. ※We＊d all loved Gricey,§ the chorus confides, as the funeral plays itself out, a little bit?of social theatre in itself. And then immediately: ※Some of us had, anyway.§That＊s going to be the puzzle, of course: who loved the dead man and who didn＊t? And who was Gricey, anyway? The last part he played was Malvolio, that ※victim of small minds. Driven half mad and shut up in a dark room.§ In her grief, his widow begins first to wear his clothes, then re-tailor them for Frank Stone, the young understudy who perfectly imitates Gricey as the puritanical narcissist of ; and who, attracted to the widow, takes on the dead man＊s part in other ways too. To these stories 每 the doomed romance and the tale of possession by , the furious dead soul of Jewish myth 每 is soon added a third: we＊re ushered into the milieu of street politics, antisemitism and continuity-fascism in  after the war.McGrath is good at London, love and bad weather. He＊s good at cups of tea, rented rooms both cold and stuffy, and packets of Senior Service. Expressed as a smell of soft coal and cigarette smoke, 1947 hangs over the book. He also writes some of the most nauseating, disquieting food you can imagine: ※A Spam-and-onion sandwich on lard, in thick slices, wrapped in newspaper.§ Meanwhile, his way with characterisation is very much his own, often more reminiscent of the arts biographer than the novelist. Julius＊s mysterious female relative Gustl is ※no materialist. She was German. Deep strains of Germanic thought and feeling coursed through her allegedly impure veins. She＊d read Kant and Schiller as a child.§So what＊s really happening in the wardrobe mistress＊s wardrobe? Has her?husband returned in some literal sense? Or only metaphorically, as an artefact of the daughter＊s incestuous infatuation, the widow＊s loneliness, the understudy＊s ardent mimicry? More importantly, perhaps, who was he when he was alive? Well, who are any of us, McGrath＊s chorus might respond. Constructs. Parts played. Every suit of clothes a costume, right until the final madness, the panic, the irreversible gesture. Because, as he says in his acknowledgements, ※this is a book largely about the theatre§. The kind of work in which Gricey acted 每 , the Scottish play, , plays that long ago accreted their own myth 每 is always a haunting of itself, and then the haunting of a haunting.Isn＊t that what actors like Vera and Frank and Gricey do? Bring things back? They haunt old plays or theatres and encourage old plays and actors to haunt them. They draw it all out from the seamy, rotting woodwork beneath the dressing room, out from the steamy narcissisms, pretensions and ambitions of their fellow thesps.  isn＊t just an entertaining ghost story, assembled by a master-manipulator to be full of narrative trapdoors, tantalising at one moment and agreeably grotesque the next: it＊s also an exploration of the deep mythology of theatre. Gricey＊s era was probably the last in which it was possible to be this sentimental 每 this florid 每 about the way acting connects us with a self-recycling past. McGrath himself seems ambivalent about the sentimentality he depicts. But there＊s no political ambivalence here: by the end of the novel, the icy postwar alleys, the shattered theatres and public houses are under the malign enchantment of a quietly resurgent politics. The plentiful mirrorings, the doppelgangers and  both real and false, make that plain, and make plain that fascism is also a kind of theatre 每 always already a?re-enactment of itself.M John Harrison＊s short story collection  will be published by Comma in?November.  is published by Hutchinson.

"raham Caveney＊s enthralling memoir is,?in part, about the ambiguous virtues of?social mobility. He?was born in Accrington in 1964 to?a mill worker, Kathleen, and a school groundsman, Jack, neither of whom moved beyond the same four-mile radius all their lives. A bright boy, he won a place at a Catholic grammar school. Like other bright boys of his class and generation, his education came as much through  and leftwing activism as through his schooling. He went to  in the early 1980s and embraced the heady abstractions of critical theory, writing academic conference papers on ※The Scandalous Mouth of Shane McGowan§. His intellectual journey, like that of , left him feeling semi-liberated but emotionally homeless.So far, so familiar. But this book is also about something else that hugely enriches it while deeply unsettling the reader. After writing a stellar school essay, Caveney began to be mentored by his headmaster, a cool, charismatic priest everyone called ※the Rev Kev§. The Rev paid him to sort through his bookshelves, took him to the theatre to see  and had earnest discussions with him about . And then he began sexually abusing him.The Rev carried on mentoring him, and abusing him (for exactly how long isn＊t clear from the nonlinear way the?story is told), until Caveney said ※enough§ 每 ※an enough born out of weariness, helplessness and a despairing kind of hope§. There followed years of panic attacks, drug and alcohol addiction and therapy. His parents died without knowing the truth.One of the many brave things about this book is its conflictedness. Caveney＊s intellect and wide reading become both a way out of his situation and what links him to his abuser. Both his parents think that a book can never be wrong and that all education is a one-way route to respectability. They are flattered by the Cambridge-educated headmaster＊s interest in their son. As an eager-to-please high achiever, their son also enjoys the unofficial education it offers him. The truly personality-eroding and life-destroying aspect of his abuse is its ambivalence: the way that ※corruption can not just coexist with tenderness, but can become part of its fibre§.Caveney＊s voice is by turns angry and analytical. He writes in a sort of displaced first person, addressing his abuser in bitter asides but examining his younger self objectively. He also superbly skewers the sentimental cant that embraces consoling simplifications and is ※deeply moved by itself§. ※We love our fucked up kids nearly as much as we despise the adults they become,§ he?writes.A quarter of a century ago Caveney co-authored an excellent work of pop cultural theory, . He still writes as a semiotician, reading the?signs and codes of social class and power relations. He notes how in the Socialist Workers Party that he joins as a teenager the worst sin is to make a comment that is ※out of order§, as if ※other people＊s thoughts, emotions and opinions were like the toilets on a?train§. When he arrives at university, he discovers that he has a ※background§ and that his middle-class peers have an ※upbringing§. The former is ※something out of which one stepped§ and the latter ※an ongoing, cyclical consensus§. And he learns that using the possessive pronoun subtly marks him out as northern and provincial 每 that it is somehow better to omit the ※my§ before ※dad§, ※mum§ or ※holiday§.Caveney reserves his most incisive textual analyses for the experience of abuse. Sexual abuse, he writes, is ※a crisis in genre§. Because his abuser is not a gothic grotesque but a charismatic and sometimes considerate teacher, he is left with no sense-making apparatus for it. The abuse of power that lies at the root of his ordeal is invisible and all-encompassing. When he goes to his headmaster/abuser＊s office to receive his A-level results in an already opened envelope, he grasps the dynamic straightaway: ※Your accomplishments are theirs (although you know that your failures will be your own).§The abused person must also confront the meagreness of words. Caveney is forced to communicate what has happened to him with ※this secondhand, jumble sale, ragbag thing called language§, and then to deal with the inevitable inadequacy of what people say in return. The least articulate responses, free of well-meaning evasion, turn out to be the most helpful. When Caveney steels himself to tell his story to a student friend, the friend responds with a long pause and the single word, ※fuck§. Caveney finds this word 每 ※a?singular declaration with lots of room for manoeuvre§ 每 therapeutic. It?※captures the mixture of outrage and futility§ he feels and is ※an excuse for the jaw to drop and the mouth to remain frozen§. It is the one word he later wishes (in?vain) to hear from his therapists.Caveney writes in free-associating mode, with short chapters and block paragraphs allowing for bursts of insight and sudden transitions. This impressionistic structure fits the story and its narrator, whose memories have been turned into fragments by years of drink, drugs and repressed trauma. But although this book flits from disjointed recollection to the near-present of his therapy sessions, it remains a gripping read (with, sadly, no cathartic ending).Despite its subject, this is not a depressing book. It is often bleakly funny and, alongside its troubling main theme, tells a more tender story of adolescent male friendship, unspoken parental love and music＊s redemptive power. (The book＊s title is a song by American indie underground band the Feelies.) Caveney may claim at the?end that being abused has left him ※needy, manipulative, petty, vindictive§. But his voice on the page is humane, big-hearted and without self-pity.This is, finally, a book about how abuse of different kinds thrives in an unequal world: how social deference and weird power dynamics lead to stories being untold. The middle-class students Caveney encounters at Warwick ※had been taught that they were interesting, that their stories were worth listening to. They accepted my curiosity as their birthright.§ It has taken much longer for Caveney to tell his story, but it is certainly worth listening to. This book is not flawless 每 its tone can sometimes be uneven and its namechecking of other authors and cultural theorists a distraction. But it feels as if it had to be written, and it demands to be read. Joe Moran＊s  is published by Profile.  by Graham Caveney is published by Picador.

"Has there ever been a depiction of necrophilia sweeter, more wistful, more emotionally nuanced than Patrick Brammall and Emma Booth＊s steamy affair in the first season of Glitch?That might not have been the intention of ABC TV＊S genre-ish, soap opera-ish, The Returned-esque paranormal drama 每 but it＊s hard to deny the result: a lovely, melancholic show about (or at the very least involving) romancing the dead.Or should that be ※undead§? Things are a little ... complicated, even if moments from the first season felt like a small-town version of Love My Way directed by George Romero. When I say ※affair§, I am actually referring to a couple 每 Kate (Booth) and fair dinkum cop James (Brammall) 每 who married. And when I say ※were§ I am referring to when I said ※dead§, in that Kate＊s death (from breast cancer) presumably nullified the marriage. And when I say ※necrophilia§ 每 well, Kate rose from the grave with six other similarly mud-covered and glassy-eyed locals in Glitch＊s very first episode. She spectacularly defied the natural order of things only to discover James married again, to her former best friend Sarah (Emily Barclay). At the start of season two, Sarah has just given birth to her and James＊ first child; as they say, these are tangled webs we weave.The audience is not all that much wiser as to why any of the characters returned from the great hereafter in the first place, meaning the first season spent approximately six hours introducing considerable mystery and resolving very little. We do know for sure that if this motley bunch (including a bible-bashing wife and mother, a former town mayor, and a first world war hero) venture too far from the cemetery, they bleed from their eyes then die (again). From the start the series producers and creators (including Tony Ayres and Louise Fox) discouraged use of the Z word, preferring spiffier, more ABC-worthy parlance such as ※the risen§ and ※resurrection drama§. So the ※zombie§ situation, not that they would admit there was one, felt a little like ※just don＊t mention the war§ 每 the big, grisly, undead elephant in the room.Fair enough, I guess, given both seasons are nothing if not tonally rich affairs: sumptuous Australian gothic elegantly directed by Emma Freeman, light years from the grubby thrills of midnight movies. The mood is almost unceasingly melancholic, with a finely modulated air, as if even exterior scenes were controlled with a high-tech air-con. The stylistic focus prefers closeups of roses and flowers (rising to life in the opening credits scene) to gore, violence or resurrected citizens groaning for brains.The big problem was 每 and is 每 twofold: 1) the plot took a very long time to go nowhere definitive, and 2) as this  correctly observed, the characters tend to be drop-dead boring. Most of us gave a lot of goodwill to the first season, partly because it was technically and tonally so well executed. But these characters are the kind of people you＊d want to shake to life, if they hadn＊t already re-emerged from their graves. Season one ended (spoiler alert) with a last-minute twist: the doctor helping out the group of undead, Elishia McKeller (Genevieve O＊Reilly), was/is dead herself. The writers (Louise Fox, Kris Mrksa and Giula Sandler) had ample room to flesh Elishia out, giving her more presence and a compelling history 每 which would have likely imbued the twist with greater impact. Instead her character comes across as half-developed. The writers were more interested in the love triangle between James, Kate and Sarah, with lines such as ※I never stopped loving you§, and the aforementioned sweet, wistful, emotionally nuanced necrophilia. In the second season Kate has a new beau, Owen (Luke Arnold) 每 and a new, mad scientist-esque doctor (Pernilla August) emerges to further reduce Elishia＊s screen time. The new episodes have trouble deciding what to focus on. The pursuit of teenager Kirstie (Hannah Monson) to find the man who murdered her shows promise but is developed half-heartedly. And, bizarrely, of all the things they could explore, the writers follow the potty-mouthed Paddy (Ned Dennehy) as he ... instigates a real-estate dispute. Glitch has a knack for answering questions nobody asked and delaying big ones everybody wants closure on. The key cast addition in season two (this review encompasses all six episodes) is Rob Collins as Phil. After he dies in an oil rig explosion, Phil comes back stomping around like an angel of death, giving unfortunate recipients the long kiss goodnight 每 a little like Javier Bardem from No Country for Old Men but with a supernatural element.Phil also comes across as a bit of deus ex machina, triggering confrontations to force dramas to come to a head, much as the police officer Vic (Andrew McFarlane) did in the first season. It feels as though Phil stumbled out of the  universe Collins also stars in; he even speaks in Cleverman-isms. Asked what his purpose is, Phil responds: ※What I＊m here to do. Cut the head off the snake.§ Collins＊ performance is fine, but again: an uninteresting character. This is despite the strong suggestion that every mention of him 每 and this applies to many other characters too 每 ought to be preluded by the word ※mysterious§.It is much easier to introduce a mystery than to satisfyingly resolve one. Despite admirable acting and production values, season two flounders 每 with not enough dramatic credibility to provide interesting soap opera, and not enough twists and turns to make compelling genre.

"The final instalment of the documentary taking a handsome gawp at very high places and the amazing things that live in them finds its way to the Andes. When dealing with some of the most stunning scenery in the world, narrator Douglas Henshall＊s breathless insistence that everything you＊re seeing is stunning and epic still feels, as with previous episodes, slightly unnecessary. But, in his defence, it is both of those things. The current iteration of the programme in which people you＊ve vaguely heard of cook things reaches the semi-final stage. In this episode, the remaining eight contenders are whittled down to six. In Poole, they are divided into two teams and given three hours to prepare lunch for 120 RNLI volunteers. The usual panic ensues, inflamed by a soundtrack more suitable to the climactic battle scenes of a Star Wars film. Written by sometime Sharon Horgan collaborator Holly Walsh, this sitcom pilot acts as a showcase for four brilliant, but often underserved, comic talents: Ellie White, Lauren Socha, Siobhan Finneran and Rebecca Front. The former two play sisters 每 one posh, one not 每 who only discover each other＊s existence after their father dies suddenly. Tension is inevitable, but it＊s nothing a Supertramp singalong won＊t soothe. Here＊s hoping for a full series.※I＊m humbled and I＊m proud,§ says Andrew of being included in his former foster father＊s will, to a disgruntled Stephen, who scoffs at the logical inconsistency. Business as usual in one way, then, for the Robert Webb/David Mitchell team in episode two of Simon Blackwell＊s dramedy, which involves a sly pop at the practice of baptism and sees Andrew stage a festival to help keep the pub afloat, while ramping up the sibling rivalry several notches. Channel 4 can never resist the temptation of lurid enticement when titling its shows, but this is a fascinating proposition. Two ordinary people have volunteered to be monitored for 24 hours with state-of-the-art equipment. As they go about their day, readings will be taken of their brain activity, heart rate, posture and glucose levels and the resulting data analysed, making for a unique and detailed MOT of the human body. The series that sees comedians undertaking wildly silly tasks on a competitive basis returns. This time around, the contestants are Aisling Bea, Bob Mortimer, Mark Watson, Nish Kumar and Sally Phillips, and highlights include Phillips revealing a hitherto unexpected link between shoving cake in your armpits and cuddling. Greg Davies hosts, expansively, with show creator Alex Horne acting as his hangdog foil. Verging on Radio 4 clever-clever at moments, but funny. This unexpectedly charming new series follows the notorious Odd Future rapper as he gets hands-on with some of the things that he loves, including sneakers, go-karts and ※breakfast§. This opening episode zeroes in on the painstaking business of stop-motion animation, with Tyler making his own loony toon with expert advice from the Robot Chicken studio and The Nightmare Before Christmas mastermind Henry Selick.

On the way they encounter hostile Apaches and vengeful railroad men, and come to a grudging mutual respect. Adapted from an Elmore Leonard story, it＊s intelligent and bloody.  (Bennett Miller, 2011) Wednesday, 1.15am, Sony Movie ChannelAfter the crazy sale that was football＊s transfer window, we＊ve had enough of money and balls, but this is a fascinating insight into the psychology of sport. It＊s a baseball film with little baseball action, telling the real-life story of Billy Beane (played by major leaguer Brad Pitt), coach of the lowly Oakland As. Fed up with losing his young stars to bigger clubs, Beane and Yale economics graduate Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) build a team based on statistical analysis 每 and it works. PH (Jacques Tourneur, 1947) Wednesday, 6am, Movies4MenThis classic film noir stars Robert Mitchum in one of his finest roles as private eye Jeff, haunted by icy femme fatale Kathie (Jane Greer). The plot twists through the California mountains, New York, Mexico and San Francisco, but it＊s the couple＊s fateful meeting in an Acapulco cantina that＊s the essence of it: Mitchum sipping beer and mulling over life as pain-and-nothing-but, catching up with Greer and a date with passion and death.

" is a writer famous for his seemingly unstoppable exuberance on the page 每 although, surprisingly, he has quite frequently spoken about his fragility when it comes to the writing process. In particular, he says he fears revealing anything he is still working on, when it is too ※delicate§. He tells a story of once showing an early part of The Moor＊s Last Sigh to a few people and how even though they said they liked it, the experience clammed him up for three months, during which he was unable to write another word.The way to get round such problems, he says, is that when you＊re writing, you must ※fool yourself into thinking it＊s a private act§. During the years he shuts himself away to work on his novels, he tries not to imagine any audience at all. It sounds like a sensible strategy. But after the instant success of Midnight＊s Children in 1981, putting the public＊s interest out of mind for the next one must have been a serious challenge. He must have been aware that his first paragraph, especially, would have to bear an unusual weight of expectation and excitement 每 I felt a frisson myself when I opened Shame almost 35 years later. And here＊s what I found:I＊m unsure how I feel about that first sentence. I like the cheeky not-quite-fairy-tale-feel. And now I＊ve read more of the book I understand the heavy irony in calling the sisters ※lovely§ and ※loving§. But when I first read it, I was mainly distracted by trying to work out exactly what an ※ill-proportioned dumb-bell§ looks like.But distraction may well have been part of the intent. The real power of this sentence is the way it softens us up for what follows. That familiar once-upon-a-time rhythm and the sense it gives us of flying above the map, makes the plunge into the dark cupboards 每 and extreme strangeness 每 of the next monstrous bit of prose all the more vertiginous. Who else would dare write like that? I can＊t think of another author who would get away with those interruptions. Who could bring in such dizzying circumlocutions. And then delay getting to the point still further by talking about the ※delay§ he has already caused. And then finally give us that closure with a gong-banging tricolon of rhyming spondees. It＊s outrageous.And I say that even before I＊ve started working on the meaning. Here too, the sentence is overloaded and full of delights. It＊s impossible not to start speculating about the nature of that ※tragedy§. I also started wondering what kind of place they lived in, where you could lose not just the china but the cupboard it was stored in. And then, oh boy, you realise it＊s a 1,000-piece China set, and it＊s travelled all the way over (to where? and when?) from tsarist Russia ＃ what kind of huge house must this story be set in? There are so many hints and allusions about wealth and loss and about soon-to-be-teased-out story strands that it left me reeling.Which made the punches of the next one-sentence paragraph land all the harder:※And one day their father died.§Only ※father§ in that sentence has more than one syllable. It＊s like a left and a right, a left and right, a left-right and a final killer left. As I say: outrageous.If Rushdie was nervous about how people might embrace the opening of Shame, he clearly decided to meet them head on, horns down. He＊s also, obviously, showing off. I can just about imagine there could be some readers who might not enjoy such an all-out assault of words. But I was immediately enraptured. These two paragraphs made me stop worrying about the shadow of Midnight＊s Children. And, better still, once he＊d pummelled me into submission, Rushdie then got down to the more straightforward and important business of storytelling.Reading a whole novel as excessive as that opening would be exhausting, so Rushdie sensibly smooths things out quickly. The third paragraph is still brilliant 每 but it＊s far more regular, as in this first sentence:There＊s far less to get worked up about there. And so it goes on through most of what I＊ve read so far. Every so often, Rushdie will let off a bright and fizzing firework 每 but not at the expense of the story and the deeper meaning.On this latter subject, it quickly becomes apparent that Shame is a book with a lot to say. It is a ※novel not totally removed from politics§, as Tariq Ali said with charming understatement, while. Behind that ecstatic language and giddy prose, there＊s a steady, cold anger. That intriguingly large house, which only has inward looking windows, and whole wings rotting with neglect, isn＊t just an enjoyable imaginative feat. It quickly starts to feel like a tragic metaphor. The novel may start with a wonderful unworldly fairytale feel 每 but it soon becomes an urgent commentary on real-world politics. It starts, in short, to feel like a book that matters for its own sake.																																											"

"rigitte Findakly begins her wise, touching and wonderfully vivid graphic memoir, , in the archaeological ruins of Nimrud, which lie outside Mosul where she grew up. Founded by the Assyrians more than 3,000 years ago, Nimrud holds a special place in her memory, for as a girl it was often to its dusty remains that her parents 每 her Iraqi dentist father and his French-born wife 每 would drive their family on Fridays, a picnic stowed in the back of their car. There she would climb on the ancient stones, and sometimes her father would photograph her by the huge man-headed winged lions that guarded what had once been?the city＊s palace gates.This was a long time ago: Findakly was born shortly after the 1958 coup in which King Faisal II was executed, and almost a decade before Saddam Hussein＊s Ba＊ath party came to power. Things have changed in the years since. In the 60s, the Iraqi government was so keen to preserve the site that those leaving it, and the ancient city of Hatra a little further away, were subject to searches so soldiers could check they had not removed some precious artefact.But no longer. Who would visit Nimrud and Hatra now? In 2015, , on the grounds that their ※idols§ were blasphemous.Findakly＊s memoir covers an extended period in Iraq＊s recent history; by the time it ends it is 2016, and the cousins she left behind when her family moved to France in the 70s have finally followed her out, worn down by years of war. Yet the half century ticks by with amazing ease, its author managing to tell both the story of a (complicated, fearful) nation, and that of one family of exiles coping with a new life in Paris. Some of this seeming effortlessness she owes to the warm, deft drawings of her husband, Lewis Trondheim, whose cartoons have a marvellous economy. Mostly, though, it is thanks to the dexterous way she flips between disjointed memories of her Orthodox Christian childhood in  and the holidays she spent there as a young woman, when the country was descending into totalitarianism.As the gap between the two time frames grows ever wider, there is a melancholy letting go. Although it was the Gulf war that put her return visits to an end, she knows that even had they continued, she would have felt increasingly distant from her birthplace: having become a French woman, she ceased to be cut out for the restrictions of Iraqi life. These days, Findakly＊s contact with Iraq consists solely of the sometimes painful phone calls she has with her relatives, now living in America, Canada and Sweden. Their Islamophobia, born of their experiences in a country where Christians are increasingly persecuted, is hard for her to hear. In her day, people got along; her mother could walk down the street with her head uncovered. But still, she will not argue. Their voices are all she has left of Iraq now. She is determined to go on loving them exactly as they are. by Brigitte Findakly and Lewis Trondheim is published by Drawn & Quarterly (?16.99).

"The impish asides, the buttery self-lampoonery, the sudden plunges from playful high register jig to conspiratorial rumble: the great broadcaster＊s custodianship of the cheerily cut-price panel quiz was a masterclass in versatility, a four-seasons-in-one-suit kaleidoscope of learnedness and twinkle, all delivered in a voice like molten tweed. He was, in a very real sense, Sir Telly Wogan.※Good game,§ he＊d say, chin cocked and bow tie set to stun, ※good game.§ And it was; its imperishable host 每 the fizzing knot of pent-up pizazz known, not unreasonably, as Brucie 每 presiding over the genre with an air of exultant menace: the impatient ad-libs and merciless herding of contestants bringing an element of incipient aggro to the knitwear and teasmades.

One of the finest (*gurns*) comic turns in TV history, courtesy of one of its few (*nudges bosom*) GENUINE GENIUSES.Conjoined fun-hub and expansively foreheaded kitemark of primetime superiority.

"hy is a talking cartoon horse making me cry? It＊s a question many of us might have asked ourselves as the new season of BoJack Horseman 每  about a version of Hollywood populated by talking animals 每 surfaced over the weekend.The characters, led by BoJack (voiced by Will Arnett), make terrible decisions about sex and dating, sell themselves short, and generally end up miserable in the funniest possible ways. It＊s a show at the forefront of a recent crop of animated TV series for adults that surpass most live-action shows this side of Twin Peaks in terms of sheer emotional ambition. There＊s BoJack, Adult Swim＊s critically lauded sci-fi series Rick and Morty, the Duplass brothers＊ Animals on HBO, and Archer, a workplace comedy about a spy agency that . In broad terms, TV is still embracing what critic Jenny Jaffe dubbed the ※§ 每 a show with an ostensibly comic outlook that trades in for pathos - but something special is happening in animation. With animated shows TV is able to flex different muscles. BoJack, for example, had a partly wordless episode last season that featured a gorgeous sequence of its titular protagonist, a washed-up actor and horse, chasing a baby seahorse through a cave filled with multicolored, glowing sea anemone. The effect was somewhere between Looney Tunes and Fantasia. Archer has had a dream sequence that has lasted two full seasons and counting. It＊s not that you can＊t do that sort of thing on live-action television (just look at the Sopranos for ambitious dream sequences), merely that it is so much harder to pull off and takes a lot of money. In cartoon sitcoms, as Archer demonstrates, you can use character as an anchor and change absolutely everything else without breaking the show.Rick and Morty, always gleefully profane, also seems as though it ought to be ill-suited to its stories＊ hardcore existentialist leanings. On paper, it sounds like an appealingly high-concept sci-fi series. It follows a bitter mad scientist and his dim grandson on the kind of spacefaring adventures you might see on Doctor Who or Star Trek, but, to give credit where due, in far weirder visual terms, with aliens who are .It is, in large measure, a cartoon about disturbingly genitalian interplanetary monsters, xenocidal gaseous intelligences, and plenty more who otherwise look like something HP Lovecraft sneezed. But like BoJack, Rick and Morty is better at plumbing some very deep intra-family emotional depths than nearly anything shot with an actual camera 每 in a recent episode, Morty＊s mother and sister get into a fight and are turned into giant, inside-out monsters; only then can they reconcile. Dan Harmon, who co-created the show with Justin Roiland,  this way to me before it premiered in 2013: ※If [Justin] says, ＆Well, I want there to be a giant testicle monster with testicles hanging off of it, and it has a vagina in the middle of it,＊ what I can provide is, ＆OK, what kind of story might make use of that? Does the testicle monster come in on page one, and what are we learning on page five?＊§ You, too, can learn valuable emotional lessons from testicle monsters, reader.Success breeds success on television, so it＊s easy to see how these shows stand on the shoulders of giants like South Park, The Simpsons, and Futurama. Without those proofs of concept, Rick and Morty, BoJack Horseman and Archer aren＊t possible. For Harmon, BoJack creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, Archer＊s Adam Reed and hopefully many more to come, the colorful and plastic trappings of genre fiction and children＊s fantasy 每  每 aren＊t incongruous or nonsensical. They＊re a new emotional country, fertile, welcoming and as big as anything you can think to draw.These shows are all formally ambitious in more abstract ways, as well; Harmon and Bob-Waksberg both seem to understand that stasis is built into the nature of the half-hour comedy 每 you＊re breaking the rules if you don＊t put things back where you found them at the end of 30 minutes. For decades, this has been a very comforting kind of television to consume. But what Harmon and co understand is that approach speaks to a kind of depressing, existential truth: most imperfect people can＊t change. Thankfully for a new generation of animators, they can. 																																											"
"The  judge Craig Revel Horwood has backed a call for the BBC to feature same-sex couples on its hit dancing show and predicted it could happen next year.His comments come after the  on Strictly. The broadcaster was responding to comments made by the Rev Richard Coles, a contestant on this year＊s show, who argued it made ※no sense§ that anyone would resist having dancers of the same gender taking to the floor together.On Monday, the judge said the tango was originally danced by two men. He told ITV＊s Lorraine show: ※I think same-sex couples can exist. You only have to decide who＊s going to go backwards really, that＊s the only difference.§ Asked whether viewers could see same-sex couples in future, he said: ※I hope so, I really hope so. In the world of competition there are same-sex couples ＃ So there＊s no reason why that can＊t happen. The Beeb have to decide whether they want to do that one year. I think it will probably happen next year. ※If you consider the tango was originally danced between two men anyway ＃ It＊s powerful, explosive, and the same can happen between two women. ※There＊s nothing wrong 每 I mean, you can get married now, can＊t you?§The judge, who has a reputation for being the harshest on the Strictly panel, added that it was ※great to celebrate anyone＊s sexuality§. ※It＊s not just about sex, it＊s about dancing,§ he said. Coles, who was one half of the 1980s band the Communards, is married to a man, and is among the 15 contestants taking part in this year＊s Strictly, which began on Saturday. He has been paired with professional dancer Dianne Buswell.He told Digital Spy he had a discussion with bosses on the show about same-sex couples taking part. ※I think this year would be a good year to do it actually, with the 50th anniversary of [the] Sexual Offences Act (which decriminalised sex between two men aged over 21),§ he said. Fellow contestant Susan Calman, who is a lesbian, had been criticised on social media for not having a female dance partner.  She responded on Twitter: Calman stressed that she had worked tirelessly for LGBT equality her whole life. ※Dancing＊s not necessarily about sex; it＊s acting. When I do a sexy tango with my partner I＊ll be acting and, fundamentally, I＊ve watched the show for years and I want to learn how to dance,§ she said.A spokeswoman for the  said over the weekend: ※Strictly has chosen the traditional format of mixed-sex couples and at the moment we have no plans to introduce same-sex couples in the competition.§																																											"
" is like a distinctive taste that you either love or hate. I have always 每 slightly against my better judgment 每 adored this exorbitant classic of a musical. First performed in 1971, it＊s about the reunion of a chorus line of Weismann/Ziegfeld revue girls, now middle-aged or older, gathering in an about-to-be-demolished Broadway theatre. The potential for humiliation 每 an unwelcome side effect of growing old 每 gives the storyline its weird, almost unpalatable edge, intriguingly taking the shine off sentimentality. Glamour is tainted by age, and many of the women, in their party best, are rueful about their vanished youth as they look back to find that they are, and yet are not, the same people they always were. The men, less obviously grappling with a loss of beauty, are as likely to feel they have taken a wrong turning. Do they have regrets? You bet. Did they marry the wrong person? You decide.The musical can be performed as a camp extravaganza, but as I watched Dominic Cooke＊s stupendous revival (the first full production since 1987), I was reflecting that while James Goldman＊s book is thin,  has his cake and eats it: his lyrics are sad and entertaining, sentimental and truthful. His music is as nuanced as the lives it describes. Vicki Mortimer has designed a backstage theatre with crumbling brick walls, castaway props and battered red velvet chairs, rescued from an auditorium. The set is dominated by a fire escape (useful for rising above old flames). It＊s a perfect setting for a piece focused on emotional salvage.Di Botcher sits at her former dressing room table and sings Broadway Baby. At first too weary to stand, and wearing clunky spectacles, she is incongruously dowdy 每 comic and poignant. What is wonderful is the way she revs into action, extending the line about wanting to be in a ※show§ until it acquires an extra syllable 每 an oh of yearning. Tracie Bennett＊s rendition of I＊m Still Here justifies on its own the price of a ticket. A slip of a scarlet woman, she starts anecdotally, with a worldly smile. She, too, sits for much of the song, but finishes on her feet on her own and at one point stops singing to shout: ※I＊m still here!§ 每 an eruption of defiant pain.Dawn Hope delights with her rousing Who＊s That Woman? and Janie Dee is slinkily poised, giving Could I Leave You? a punitive energy that grows out of stillness. The matchless  memorably undergoes emotional upheaval as Sally, starting as a nervous chatterbox, ending with Losing My Mind, paralysed by love for Ben, her former sweetheart. As Ben, Philip Quast is impressively unimpressive, the stuffed shirt who sings like a dream and belatedly shows he is made of flesh and blood.

Named after an Indian reservation of the same name, Wind River is the place where the corpse of a young Native American girl (Kelsey Asbille) is found, barefoot and frozen solid. With the help of FBI agent and Florida native Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen), Cory tries to figure out what 每 or who 每 she was running from. Written and directed by Taylor Sheridan (who wrote the screenplays for  and ),  is a violent, tense thriller, sparse and well paced, from its chilling, moonlit opening to a nerve-shredding episode in a dilapidated house that recalls Clarice＊s standoff with Buffalo Bill in  . Renner is on good form here (and rocking a hard-to-pull-off pair of dungarees) as the sensitive, protective Cory, and as a genre exercise, it works.However, for a film whose closing title card explicitly marks it as a project concerned with the rape and colonial injustice suffered by Native Americans, it spends a lot of time with intervening white people. It＊s more effective when it doesn＊t try so hard and addresses existential themes, rather than political ones, such as the burden of grief and the tough, isolating reality of Wyoming＊s frozen expanse.

Just as Rabih searches for?his buried heritage, Boulghourjian also seeks to uncover the history of his country＊s deep national trauma in the wake of the civil war.

The film is a major awards hope for the controversial producer Harvey Weinstein, who was once a guaranteed Academy favorite with Shakespeare in Love and Chicago but whose stock has fallen in recent years. ※Edison and Westinghouse＊s rivalry is the ultimate tale of competition driving ingenuity,§ Weinstein said of the film. ※Theirs was a battle of intellect, a race of creativity and technological innovation that we see echoed in the self-made inventors dominating spaces like Silicon Valley.§Cumberbatch has some fierce competition in the race for best actor: Jake Gyllenhaal is tipped for glory with his role in the Boston marathon bombing drama Stronger, also premiering at the festival.

"A Norwegian comedy charm offensive with killer performances and amazing plaits. owes as much to  as it does to Asterix and . A bunch of brilliantly talented Norwegians have made this ludicrously lovely sitcom in English (they made a Norwegian version too), so that we may access their dry-as-a-bone humour more easily.It＊s written and directed by Jon Iver Helgaker and Jonas Torgersen, and set in the village of Norheim in the year 790. The comedy comes from the juxtaposition of their ancient, brutal struggle for survival and the minor concerns we all obsess over nowadays.Acting village chieftain Orm (the superb K?re Conradi) orders all villagers to surrender their weapons to make them into an art installation, leaving the community cultured but defenceless. He is a scared little man 每 like all the best sitcom buffoons 每 running from his own shadow and desperately repressing his homosexuality while his muscle-bound wife Fr?ya goes on raids with the men and joins in the pillaging with abandon.Orm is sitting in as village leader while his brother (the much more impressive Olav) leads his warriors on a pillaging mission to bring back treasure and slaves. A dissatisfied captive kicks up a stink about the lack of facilities on board and gets a punch in the face. ※That＊s not really me,§ confides Olav to one of his warriors, ※＃ that fear-based leadership style§.Norsemen is often disgusting, gory, brimming over at times with widdle and plop, full of graphic violence and imbued with the spirit of stinking, bloody life in 8th century northern Europe. You can almost smell Norsemen, so juicily do the cast tuck into their parts.And the soundtrack＊s epic Thrones-like quality makes the ineptitude even funnier as Orm fires arrow after flaming arrow at a retreating funeral boat, missing every time. ※Try firing an arrow with really cold fingers before you start booing,§ he whines to the disgruntled villagers as the boat drifts out of sight, unlit.When events conspire to leave him in charge more permanently, Orm makes terrible decisions, including hiring a former slave as his ※creative director§ and tasking him with putting Norheim on the cultural map.David Brent-like in his self-delusion, he has a whiff of Captain Mainwaring when marshalling his troops and a hint of Basil Fawlty when he＊s covering up another boob. Conradi＊s performance is the impressive comic totem around which the others caper, rolling their eyes. ※This one＊s mine,§ he growls, arriving late to a battle all but finished by his colleagues. He then proceeds to beat up a 10-year-old girl - before she gets the better of him, obviously.If you are left uncharmed by Norsemen you are both heartless and immune to their heartily irreverent approach to situation comedy.

"n 1993, an artwork by Rachel Whiteread was the subject of the biggest scandal in British art since the notorious Tate bricks affair of 1976, when the gallery was publicly pilloried for having squandered public funds on a sculpture by  consisting of 120 firebricks. Ms Whiteread＊s work was , the concrete cast of a condemned terraced dwelling in the East End of London, which she had made under the aegis of the arts commissioner . House stood for only 80 days, but it was a remarkable lightning rod for debate, attacked and defended with equal fervour. The Liberal Democrat leader of Tower Hamlets council at the time denounced it with particular enthusiasm, calling it ※utter rubbish§ and ※§.Others, though, greeted it as a masterpiece and called for it to have a permanent life (which was not the artist＊s intention), comparing its destruction to the iconoclasm of the English Reformation.  wrote lyrically of the cast＊s uncanny ability to draw the viewer into ※the world of the photographic negative, with its phantom-like reversal of known fact; the world that Alice enters through her looking glass; the world that lurks behind the molten silver mirror in Cocteau＊s Orph谷e§. Meanwhile, it was sucked?into arguments about housing and the?fabric of London, about the British and their relationship to art, about political extremism and multiculturalism.The debate intensified that November as  the recipient of the Turner prize 每 a month before House was demolished. Her win, and the media attention focused upon her, was the watershed moment for the award: it transformed the annual event from polite art world contest into colourful national spectacle, ushering in the era when the prize would be won by a succession of celebrated (to some, notorious) British artists born in the 1960s 每 among them Damien Hirst, Douglas Gordon, Chris Ofili and Gillian Wearing.Looking back, as  of Ms Whiteread＊s work to date, the events of the winter of 1993-94 seem as distant as if they were a story about the Victorians. It is unthinkable 每 in the era of a well-established rhetoric about cultural regeneration, about the importance of art to communities and individuals 每 that a sculpture of this type would not now be greeted enthusiastically, or at least with equanimity, by local politicians. Ms Whiteread＊s House was, it turned out, the harbinger of a whole generation of new and striking public artworks from Antony Gormley＊s  (1998) to the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, host to a cavalcade of striking works beginning with Mark Wallinger＊s poignant  of 1999. The museum-going public, meanwhile, developed a taste for the novel and the monumental through Tate Modern＊s Turbine Hall commissions, such as the sodium-coloured sun and Turner-esque fog of Olafur Eliasson＊s  (2003)., assembled with grace and harmony in the galleries of Tate Britain, vindicates the few wise seers of the early 1990s who predicted that her sculpture would have great longevity and would take its place in the canon. Her sculpture is formally rigorous, deeply intelligent and remarkably consistent in its plumbing of the possibilities of the cast object. More than that, though, it is capacious and generous, allowing viewers＊ imaginations into its world, inviting rather than banishing associations and connections. If, in 1993, House offered an encoded commentary on ideas of home and homelessness, then Ms Whiteread＊s work still has a political bite. Her casts of rucked-up mattresses and leaning doors present a reminder of the language of the street, of the urban deprivations that have not left us 每 have perhaps become more acute 每 a quarter of a century after House.Ms Whiteread＊s sculpture, it turns out, was always thoughtful, grown-up and serious. Now the British public has caught up with it.																																											"
"I have to admit to a certain level of awe before the fandom of the author Lawrence Kelter for the film My Cousin Vinny. Kelter loves the 1992 film so much that 每 as  每 he managed to convince its screenwriter, Dale Launer, to let him write a novel continuing the story of Vinny and Lisa (first played by Marisa Tomei and Joe Pesci).※I said, ＆How about I take a crack at Vinny and Lisa and move their life forward in a book series?＊§ . After convincing a reluctant Launer, he then had to convince the Writers Guild and 20th Century Fox to let him acquire rights in the characters, a process he described as ※gruelling§.Kelter published book one of the My Cousin Vinny series earlier this year. The blurb explains: ※Hot on the heels of rescuing his cousin Bill and Bill＊s friend Stan from an Alabama electric chair, our wildly inappropriate hero Vincent Gambini heads home to Brooklyn, where he attempts to establish a successful law career ＃ Meanwhile, Lisa aches to have a wedding band placed around her finger and her biological clock is still ticking away like mad.§My Cousin Vinny isn＊t the story I＊d long to see continued, but surely this is the dream of all fanfiction writers: to have their work recognised and given the stamp of approval by the person who originally dreamed the characters up? I wonder how many of these writers get such green lights? I＊d say Kelter is in a tiny minority 每 and good for him. I＊d imagine that Kelter, and other My Cousin Vinny fans, will respond this news much as I did when I learned that  in her most recent trilogy. Yes, Hobb is the original author, but she＊d finished these beloved characters＊s stories in a pretty definitive way at the end of Fool＊s Fate. And she has been very clear about her views on fanfiction: no. Discovering that she＊d be returning to their lives more than 10 years on was pretty fantastic (and yes, the trilogy absolutely lived up to every hope I＊d had for it).Are there other stories I＊d like to see continued? Oh yes: I would return to the worlds of The Talisman and The Dark Tower in a heartbeat, but only under the aegis of Stephen King. I＊d revisit His Dark Materials and the story of Lyra Belacqua 每 but only in the hands of Philip Pullman. (.) These are books and characters that have a place deep in my heart 每 and I don＊t want them messed with by others. When it comes to characters whom I like, but don＊t feel so protective of 每 such as  (David Lagercrantz continuing Stieg Larsson) and  (Raymond Chandler＊s latest ghost writer being Benjamin Black) 每 then I＊m always up for a fresh sequel. If it＊s the right writer writing. 																																											"
" has warned the government not to turn its back on 21st Century Fox＊s bid for Sky as the UK prepares to leave the European Union, claiming Brexit makes it more important than ever that the country attracts investment.Murdoch said he was looking forward to going through the regulatory process on the deal if the UK ※truly is open for business§, and defended his track record as chief executive and chairman of Sky, saying that ※has to count for something§.The chief executive of Fox was speaking at the Royal Television Society convention in Cambridge on Thursday, two days after Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, confirmed the  on the grounds of media plurality and broadcasting standards, dealing a blow to the Murdoch family.In comments that will be interpreted as a warning to the government, Murdoch said: ※There is a huge opportunity for companies and countries willing to act decisively and capitalise on the economic and social benefit that this industry can create. Inward investment in the UK creative economy and the positive signal it sends to companies around the world is more important than ever as the UK prepares to chart its course outside the EU.※Indeed, the soft power of the UK＊s creative identity is going to be a big part of that story. So if the UK truly is open for business post-Brexit, we look forward to moving through the regulatory review process, and this transformational transaction for the UK creative sector becoming an affirmation of that claim.§The 44-year-old son of  said the government was refusing to meet him and admitted he was disappointed that Bradley referred the deal on broadcasting standards and media plurality. However, Murdoch said he was confident the deal would still go through and he was ※really looking forward§ to dealing with the CMA, which he described as having a ※reputation for probity and seriousness§.Bradley referred the deal on broadcasting standards after raising concerns about a lack of compliance procedures at Fox News and corporate governance at the Murdochs＊ companies. Letters between Bradley and Ofcom, the media regulator, show the culture secretary raised issues such as sexual harassment allegations at Fox News, the broadcaster＊s discredited story that the murdered Democrat aide Seth Rich was the source of leaked emails, and the risk of Fox trying to ※Foxify§ Sky News.However, Murdoch robustly defended Fox and Sky＊s track records. ※As the founder of Sky News, and we owned 100% of it for many, many years, there were no issues. When I was chief executive, no issues, and when I was chairman, and I am chairman again, no issues.※So the record has to count for something. Whether or not 30 years ago someone has a grievance about a political position that a newspaper took that is no longer part of the business is irrelevant to a process that should be transparent, that should be fact-based, that should be evidence-based, and that should get an answer that makes sense for the UK economy, for the creative economy, and for the thousands and thousands of people who work at Sky and 21st Century and just want to go and build something great.§He also said Fox dealt with allegations of sexual harassment at Fox News against Roger Ailes, the former boss, within two weeks of him learning of the claims.※The first we heard about the Roger Ailes allegations was a New York Times story that a lawsuit was about to be filed and then it was filed,§ he said. ※We looked at it, we hired an independent outside law firm to investigate it, we looked at the allegations and in less than two weeks we made the decision and we had to move on from Roger Ailes. That was actually not a hard a decision 每 what he did was wrong and you just have to say it clear and say it loud, that is unacceptable behaviour in an organisation.§Murdoch said he welcomed the ※mystery§ about his own views and that he did not discuss politics with his father, who has supported Donald Trump. ※I think it is ironic that in the US in some sectors they think I am a raging liberal environmentalist treehugger and here I am the rightwing demon who is going to Foxify everything. I am glad at that because I think mystery is an important part of an identity, and I prefer it that way.§Speaking after Murdoch, Bradley defended her decision to refer the deal to the CMA for an investigation that could last six months. Her decision meant she overruled Ofcom, the media regulator, which recommended that the evidence available did not justify a broadcasting standards investigation, and that Fox and Sky had a record of compliance in line with other major broadcasters.Bradley said: ※The threshold for reference that I have to take is lower than the threshold may be for the fit and proper test that Ofcom do. It is important that there is confidence in what decision is taken. I think given that there are non-fanciful concerns and given that the threshold is lower, it is important for public confidence that a full review takes place by the CMA.※I think now, let the CMA do their work, they are technical experts in competition and markets and I want them to look at the concerns that have been raised. You will see when we publish all the information on this exactly why the referral has been made.§Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader and long-time Murdoch critic, said the government ※must not now let itself by cowed by threats from the Murdochs§.He said: ※Succumbing to this kind of pressure would set a dangerous precedent. This whole episode goes to show that  risks leaving Britain in a weaker position when it comes to standing up against multinationals.§Fox is controlled by  and his sons Lachlan and James. If the bid is successful, Fox will then own all of Sky, and the satellite broadcaster will join the Sun, the Times and talkRadio in the Murdochs＊ wider British media empire, giving the family a bigger reach than any other news provider apart from the BBC.The newspapers are part of News Corp, which was split from Fox after the  scandal. However, Ofcom considered the businesses as one during its review of the deal because it stated that the Murdoch Family Trust was in control of both.																																											"
"n the heels of its most lucrative season yet, with a record-setting $1.37bn in ticket sales, Broadway has experienced something of a rebirth. From the success of  on the big screen to Hamilton on stage, there＊s a renewed interest in theater that＊s been reflected in a wave of movie-musicals and televised live-concert experiences.All of this seems, to entertainment industry insiders, like the chorus following a crescendo, with theatergoers re-energized and Hollywood producers awakened, again, to the crossover potential and creative possibilities of stage work. ※I think the snowball has been building for a long time,§ said Megan Kingery, a co-producer on the Tony award-winning hit musical Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812.Hamilton is often credited as the driving force of this trend; Lin-Manuel Miranda＊s bold blend of American history and hip-hop proved not just remarkably soluble, but also commercially viable, scoring a Broadway record in November for the most lucrative week ever, with $3m earned from just eight performances. Tickets for the show, which opened last month in LA and , can cost upwards of $500. But despite what looks like a rapid ascent, there are no overnight successes, especially in theater. Richard Kraft, the creative director and producer of Disney＊s La La Land in Concert at the Hollywood Bowl, believes the pop culture climate has warmed to musicals at just the right moment. ※We have an entire generation that grew up watching Disney animated musicals,§ he said. ※They have no problem with the notion that a character breaks into song to express their feelings. All we needed were a few good movies or stage shows.§※Shows like Glee, Empire, and Nashville, movies like Pitch Perfect and the Step Up franchise, even America＊s Got Talent and American Idol, have brought a musical sensibility to more mainstream entertainment that＊s reminded people how much they love people singing,§ adds Kingery.This year, studios and streaming services have sought to capitalize on this rebirth. Damien Chazelle, whose movie musical La La Land played no small part in this trend, has sold an eight-episode musical mini-series called The Eddy to Netflix. It＊s Chazelle＊s first foray into television and Netflix＊s first venture into original musicals. Hugh Jackman, who sang his heart out in the film adaptation of Les Mis谷rables, will helm the PT Barnum-inspired movie-musical The Greatest Showman in December. And the cross-genre embrace cuts both ways.※For too long, musicals were living in this specialty category,§ Kraft explains. ※We went through a period where musicals were living in their own bubble and something like  came along; a subject matter no one would think of, an approach no one would think of, done in a manner that was universally powerful.§The success of Hamilton has emboldened producers to try their hands at projects that might seem ill-suited for the stage. This spring, a musical version of the 2004 film Mean Girls, with a book penned by Tina Fey, will hit Broadway. And just a few months before, this December, the SpongeBob SquarePants musical, with songwriting contributions from Cyndi Lauper, Sara Bareilles, John Legend and David Bowie, will begin its first engagement in New York. But capitalizing on the familiar hasn＊t always been a successful strategy for theater; the recent adaptation of American Psycho  and it remains a difficult task to corral financing for smaller shows that lack star power.※It may become harder to get financing of an obscure little work that doesn＊t have any names attached to it or any commercial upside, but that＊s always been a struggle,§ Kraft says. ※But it＊s a more exciting time simply because people who are great in one field are willing to take the adventure of doing something for the stage.§Typical  distribution and revenue models 每 ※put a show in a theater and have people come see it,§ Kingery says 每 have also been subverted and accelerated in the process. NBC and Fox have announced plans to bring Bye Bye Birdie and A Christmas Story, respectively, to the stage for live concert experiences, and Kraft＊s La La Land in Concert, which premiered just months after the film＊s release, has plans to tour the UK, Canada, Mexico, Turkey, Italy and Switzerland.※There＊s now potential for streaming live productions, which is a conversation that＊s been accelerated,§ Kingery says. ※There＊s also the possibility for tours to start happening sooner than they might have in the past. It used to be that you would do a show and, if it was a hit, you might record a cast album. Now we＊re seeing the potential for the cast album to be not just a marketing tool, but also a revenue source earlier in the process.§And while Broadway has always been a source of rich material for film-makers, Hollywood＊s newfound willingness to appropriate theatrical works for its own purposes has, in turn, lured film talent to the stage.※The talent pool who consider themselves as Broadway performers has always been very narrow, but those walls are coming down,§ said Kraft. ※I have composers who have never thought of Broadway thinking, ＆Oh, what about doing that?＊ All of a sudden, it＊s no longer just a few blocks of New York and a little incestuous group of people making the same art over and over.§This enmeshing of theater and film has also been a boon for those who typically do stage work, too, making it easier to find work and sustain themselves.※The knowledge that you can make more money in Hollywood than you can in theater is not newly occurring to people,§ Kingery says. ※But there are more opportunities for composers and a greater pool of talent that＊s writing and working all the time that you can draw on. So if there＊s other media opportunities that can provide them with a way to stick around and stay writing, that only helps theater in the long run.§As long as the broad talent pools of Broadway and Hollywood continue their mutual embrace, Kingery and Kraft think this trend is sustainable, not least for the performers, writers, and composers who now attract the interests of Hollywood studio executives.※A rising tide raises all ships,§ Kingery says. ※Raising investment for theater has always been, and remains, a challenge. But one of the things that Hollywood financing allows theater to do is also to support the talent that goes into writing musicals. It takes years and years of dedication with very little financial reward.※But we＊re like a bad boy band,§ she adds. ※Nobody ever really goes away.§																																											"
" have teamed with , the Oscar-winning composer for The Dark Knight, The Lion King and Gladiator, on a new piece of music 每 called ocean (Bloom) 每 that will appear on a prequel to the BBC＊s flagship nature documentary series .The track is an orchestral reworking of Bloom, Radiohead＊s song from their 2011 album , with Thom Yorke rerecording his vocals for the new version. ※Bloom was inspired by the original Blue Planet series, so it＊s great to be able to come full circle with the song and reimagine it for this incredible landmark＊s sequel,§ Yorke said. The popular natural history series will , and will be scored by Zimmer.Zimmer, who also created the music for Planet Earth II, will also compose the theme and score for the new  series alongside Jacob Shea and Dave Fleming, his co-composers in music production company Bleeding Fingers.※[Zimmer] is a prodigious composer who effortlessly straddles several musical genres so it was liberating for us all to work with such a talent and see how he wove the sound of the series and Bloom together,§ Yorke added.Zimmer said: ※Bloom appears to have been written ahead of its time as it beautifully reflects the jaw-dropping lifeforms and seascapes viewers are introduced to in Blue Planet II.※Working with Thom, Jonny and the boys has been a wonderful diversion and it＊s given me an interesting peek into their musical world. They＊ve been incredible to work with.§The prequel video, spearheaded by BBC Worldwide and produced by BBC Studios＊ natural history unit, will feature exclusive footage that will not be shown when Blue Planet II is aired.The video will be simulcast globally on 27 September to coincide with the show＊s world premiere.James Honeyborne, Blue Planet II＊s executive producer, added: ※This collaboration between an iconic Grammy-winning band and an Oscar-winning orchestral composer is simply mouthwatering 每 and (ocean) Bloom doesn＊t disappoint.※It＊s an incredibly powerful companion to the scenes we＊ve spent years capturing. What a great curtain-raiser to the upcoming series that we just can＊t wait to share with everyone.§The new seven-part series will be broadcast later this year on .Blue Planet II will mark 16 years since the channel＊s natural history unit first set out to explore never-before-seen wildlife in the deepest and darkest parts of the world＊s oceans.

"wo weeks after my 20th birthday I married a man 每 a boy, really 每 who was a little older than me. We would not be married for very long of course, but I didn＊t know that then. I didn＊t even suspect it . I felt for him the kind of love where it seemed the very beat of my heart stopped when he was around. I couldn＊t sleep, I didn＊t eat. Today, though, when people ask why I married so young, I struggle to answer. Usually I say: ※That was just what you did.§※That was just what you did,§ is my feeble explanation for most of the big decisions of my late teens and 20s. At 18, I left home and worked full-time in a mail room and thought I was blessed 每 as a child, I＊d imagined I would be a barmaid. I bought my first house at 23, with my then-boyfriend. No travel, anywhere. Limited options and low expectations go some way to explain the exhilaration and relief I＊ve found in ageing. Exhilaration, because I can hardly believe my good fortune. I＊m still alive, somehow, and healthy. Is this really my job? My beautiful house, my wonderful husband, my very own dog? And relief, because those grinding years of poverty and worry and vulnerability are over and I stand now, clear-eyed, on the other side. Being 20 again, in a world of inter-generational tension, diminishing resources and boundless yet unsatisfying choices, would be a kind of nightmare.Unpicking this feeling is why I love the work of Briohny Doyle.Doyle＊s brilliant non-fiction book Adult Fantasy, published this year, asks the question: what does it mean to be an adult, right now? Do the priorities of previous generations 每 marriage, children, mortgages, education 每 even rate in a world facing climate catastrophe? Those of us who own homes are quick to respond to millennial concerns as though we＊re Monty Python＊s Four Yorkshiremen: ※We lived for three months in a brown paper bag in a septic tank.§ Instead, the question should be: if someone in their 20s now chose to make the same sacrifices as we did, would they achieve the same result? The answer, by all accounts, is no.Yes, this is the conversation that launched a thousand avocado toast jokes. In Doyle＊s hands, though, it＊s nuanced and engrossing 每 and it＊s not just about our current intergenerational social context. In essence, all good writing asks: How should I live? Doyle＊s work is important because this question must be continually asked and continually answered, throughout all of our lives 每 otherwise we＊re prey to the gasping, sitting-up-in-bed existential crisis and resultant sports cars and tummy tucks, broken marriages and burned bridges. That＊s what significant birthdays are for, and funerals of parents and dear friends, and those rare moments we stand, mid-point, and see our lives clearly both behind and in front of us. Our past pattern of failures and future logical extrapolations along a bone-wearying railway track of years. A writer who asks questions like these must get her own hands dirty, and there are intimate parts of Doyle＊s life exposed here. Adult Fantasy begins with Doyle＊s third-life crisis and her awareness that she＊s achieved none of the traditional markers of adulthood. Along the way, she meets with young adults with such a variety of lifestyles and priorities it almost seems as though the very term ※millennials§, and the way we bandy it about as shorthand for ※self-absorbed and entitled§, is like any other form of generalisation: lazy and stupid. (Imagine.) She＊s intrepid and brutal, but only towards herself. She spills her doubt and angst yet she sallies onward, never judging or whining, always entertaining, open-hearted and open-minded.In The Island Will Sink, her 2016 debut cli-fi novel, she＊s more playful, though still wry and blackly humorous. Ostensibly it＊s the story of Max Galleon 每 a husband, father and maker of blockbuster disaster movies 每 and his life as the world careens toward its conclusion. It＊s equally a field for her ideas to play out: the way technology and digital projections replace both genuine relationships and an intrinsic sense of self; the nature of memory and reality; and even our pop culture obsession with all things apocalyptic and the way this engagement substitutes for global action on the coming real thing.One of her many perfect details is Pow-Wow the Power Saving Panda, whose holographic image pops up everywhere and becomes angry or teary if the shower runs too long or the recycling is neglected. Orwell meets Disney; even our good intentions are used to manipulate us.Recent government policy toward millennials seems too malevolent to be real. In 2015 treasurer Joe Hockey advised that, if they wanted to buy a house, . But if they agree, and go to university, they＊re left with a debt of tens of thousands of dollars to be repaid at a lower earning threshold (changes legislated by, mostly, men who＊ve benefitted from their own Whitlam-era free education). the young people think.  So they work part-time, making coffee and clearing plates, in shops and behind bars. says the government. We＊re  and giving the money to our rich mates in . It＊s as if these clowns have a strategic goal to Make Australia Dumb Again.At the same time, we＊re using up resources like drunks locked in a cellar, swigging as fast as we can with both hands and with one eye on the door. We think we are somehow exempt from this basic law of existence: an ever-growing colony consuming and excreting on a finite petri dish will eventually drown in its own shit.Doyle＊s two explorations, non-fiction and fiction, are two sides of the same coin. Our lack of basic literacy in both science and media studies has lead us here. The fact that we can＊t tell real news from fake lies at the feet of our disdain for the humanities. If anything, her novel is the more important because it＊s wonderful storytelling and provides a philosophical and emotional context to understand the science.  If I were a millennial, I＊d be fucking furious. Doyle, by contrast, is smart and compassionate enough to look beyond the personal to the systemic. Look at the world we＊re bequeathing them. If you＊re a millennial, or you love one, or you hope to live long enough to see the world governed by them, you should be reading Briohny Doyle. 																																											"

"lly Garrett is a writer and body positivity activist who has delved into topics such as Kim Kardashian and true crime writing. She has been giving thought to the ※thorny§ issue of being accused of mutilating her body and reflects on the impact of the books she read just before she became a teenager. through applying it every single day since Easter. It definitely has irritated my eyes, my eyes are often red and runny and sore but I think it is worth it because my eyelashes look amazing. I＊ve never had good eyelashes and multiple people have thought I＊ve got eyelash extensions on so I＊m ignoring optical health recommendations and I＊m really happy with how they look.I＊m also really thrilled because I got my lips done. I recently got lip fillers and a little bit of botox in my forehead, the botox hasn＊t been particularly life-changing 每 I don＊t think I would get it again, maybe it＊s just because it＊s so subtle. But I am absolutely in love with the lips I have bought for myself. I think they look great. Only a handful of other women have noticed that I got them done so I don＊t think they look too fake 每 even though I really like that ducky fake lip look anyway. I have also been surprised by quite a few people I know who are into beauty, or into fun, feminist things, have commented that they＊re surprised I would get something done in the cosmetic surgery realm or said that they think it＊s akin to mutilation. I know it＊s a little bit of a thorny issue in terms of altering your body but I＊m really happy with how they look. Someone was talking to me about loving natural beauty and I think natural beauty is a sham, I don＊t think natural beauty exists. Unless you＊ve never had a shower or never had a haircut, you＊re not actually a natural beauty. We all do things to alter the way we look and just as soon as a needle is involved we start to get quite judgmental about it.  One of the things I loved about it is how she writes about being a fat woman. There＊s a few chapters in there that explicitly discuss her body and her weight and her experiences living in that body. But there＊s also a whole bunch of chapters that don＊t, that talk about her relationship with various pieces of pop culture and One Direction and Kanye West. For me, the way the book was structured and the way it talked about weight was very similar to what being a fat person is actually like. Your weight is sort of always there, your body is always there and it does shape a lot of interactions you have but it＊s not always something you＊re explicitly thinking about all the time. It＊s a book about her life and her body is part of that but it＊s also a small part of that.  It＊s not my day-to-day red lipstick, if I＊m going to wear red lipstick I actually wear a Bobbi Brown lipstick which is a bit more orange-y. Russian Red was the first lipstick I ever bought. It was from a department store in New York when I was 11 years old on a family holiday. I bought it from a beautiful make-up counter 每 it just seemed so exotic and grown up. I remember at the time my mum told me that it was the lipstick that Madonna wears, I felt so incredibly glamorous. I still have that tube 每 I don＊t think I will ever throw it out, which is deeply unhygienic. I think that＊s when reading felt its most magical. I＊m really nostalgic about the Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants series, I＊m nostalgic about the Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging series. I actually think they are the funniest books that have ever been written. They just present this picture of this teenage girl with a big nose and a gross family and all of the boys she has a crush on. They use this really unique language and lingo and all of the slang. I have a couple and sometimes I still might dip into one of those on a Sunday if I feel a bit sorry for myself. There＊s various dupes: Chi Chi is supposed to be just as good, but it＊s not, and that＊s my ride or die brow product. I also use the Anastasia brush, I think my brows really levelled up when I paired her number 12 brush with the Dipbrow. Her brand has been around for about 18 years and they were just this little brow salon until brows blew up and now they have highlighter palettes and eyeshadow palettes. I think her brow products are incredible. One day I would actually like to get my brows done at her studio in Beverley Hills. Kim Kardashian has had her brows done there.  but I love true crime books and I feel like every time I finish two or three of them I go back and reread Ann Rule＊s The Stranger Beside Me 每 her Ted Bundy book. I just think the story behind it, as well as her gift for true crime writing, is amazing. When she had been commissioned to write this book, she＊d written a couple of other crime novels and was working at a suicide helpline with Ted Bundy but we didn＊t know that Ted Bundy was Ted Bundy yet. The book, as well as documenting his killing and his murdering, also goes into her personal relationship with finding out it was Ted, I think that really ties into Ted Bundy＊s great gift for being a charming psychopath. People could have met him and known that he drove that tan Beetle, that was the Beetle picking women and girls up, but still not known it was him because he was so charming. So I think that is the pi豕ce de r谷sistance of true crime writing.																																											"
"The Australian actor  has been awarded more than $4.5m in damages, plus interest and court costs, in her libel case against Bauer Media.Wilson said the decision brought to an end a ※long and hard court battle§ and that she would not be keeping any of the money, which was the largest defamation payout in Australian legal history. In June a six-person jury found in favour of Wilson＊s claim against the publisher of Woman＊s Day and the Australian Women＊s Weekly.The jury had been asked to consider 40 questions and eight claims of defamation relating to a series of articles accusing Wilson of being a serial liar about her age, real name and childhood.At the supreme court in  on Wednesday, Justice John Dixon said the damages suffered by Wilson warranted a ※substantial§ payment and awarded the actor $4,567,472. Interest and costs would be determined at a later date.The award comprised $650,000 in general damages, including aggravated damages, and $3,917,472 in special damages for opportunities of screen roles lost because of the articles.※Today was the end of a long and hard court battle against Bauer Media who viciously tried to take me down with a series of false articles,§ Wilson said in a series of tweets on Wednesday afternoon.※The judge accepted without qualification that I had an extremely high reputation and that the damage inflicted on me was substantial. He said the nature of the aggravated defamation and the unprecedented extent of dissemination makes vindication of particular importance. The judge said he knew that the info from anonymous paid source was false ... and that Bauer Media traded recklessly on my reputation in order to boost its own profits.§Wilson said she was ※extremely grateful§ for the record sum, which she said was four times the previous Australian record, but the case ※wasn＊t about the money§.※I＊m looking forward to helping out some great Australian charities and supporting the Oz film industry with the damages I＊ve received,§ she said.Dixon said the extent of the defamatory publication was ※unprecedented in defamation litigation in this country§, because of the instantaneous distribution of the claims across the internet at the time when international media was highly focused on Wilson＊s success following the release of Pitch Perfect 2.※At trial and in the full media glare Bauer Media attempted to characterise its articles as true, trivial, or not likely to be taken seriously.※The jury＊s verdict established Bauer Media＊s publications had branded Ms Wilson a serial liar who had fabricated almost every aspect of her life.※The jury rejected the defences of substantive truth, triviality and statutory qualified privilege.§Dixon made special mention of an article written by well-known journalist, Caroline Overington, for the Woman＊s Day website.※Bauer Media published material by an award-winning investigative journalist as part of its campaign against the plaintiff,§ he said.The article ※conveyed that Ms Wilson is so untrustworthy that nothing she says about herself can be taken to be true unless it has been independently corroborated. Such a meaning is, self-evidently, very serious§.Dixon also found the $389,500 cap on Victorian defamation cases did not apply because Wilson＊s case warranted an award of aggravation.Bauer Media had failed to properly investigate the allegations against Wilson, Dixon said, and published them ※knowing them to be false§, from a source who required payment and anonymity and in the opinion of the editor ※had an axe to grind§. He added that the company repeated the allegations or foresaw the slurs would be repeated and that its conduct was orchestrated.On Wednesday morning general counsel for Bauer Media, Adrian Goss, said the company was considering the judgement.※Bauer Media has a long history of delivering great stories to our readers and we have a reputation for developing some of the best editorial teams in this country. This is what we are focused on,§ Goss said. ※It is about continuing to do what we do best and that is delivering great content to more than 85% of Australian women across the country via our iconic portfolio.§Wilson was seeking $7.093m in damages, including $5.893m covering the loss of one film role, and general damages of $1.2m. the ※extraordinarily large§ damages claim should be thrown out because Wilson had failed to prove she had lost work because of the articles. Media defence barrister Georgina Schoff QC told the court there was ※not one scrap of paper§ to prove the articles had caused Wilson to be sacked from two film roles and to miss two years of work as a lead actor.※You＊re not popular for long in Hollywood, you have a few years until you go out of fashion,§ Wilson said after the win. ※They took those two years away from me doing what I love, which is entertaining people and making people laugh.§																																											"

"The sight of a baby being shot is something which sets the tone, the feel, and the body language of this brutal and self-regarding Western from writer-director Scott Cooper, based on an unproduced screenplay by the late Donald Stewart, who scripted the The Hunt For Red October.It＊s undoubtedly a handsome-looking picture, slow of pace, with beautifully, even stunningly composed widescreen images from cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and a sinuous score from Max Richter. The violence of the white pioneer and the Native American in the old West are set up against each other, and (tacitly) declared to be of tragic equivalence, though eligible to be redeemed by gestures of good faith and unexpected romantic developments. The beauty of the landscape and the violence of its human inhabitants are evidently supposed, in their respective extremities, to add up to something. But what?It＊s not clear. And it＊s not clear if the performances, sincerely and forcefully intended as they clearly are, shed much light on the issue. , so often impassive beneath his whiskers, is an opaque presence, a monument of machismo and self-importance, and the Native American characters are too often ciphers, required to do not much more than provide the scene-setting for the white characters＊ emotional journey. Rosamund Pike is a dignified and commanding presence, however, and so is Q＊orianka Kilcher (from Malick＊s The New World) as Native American woman Moon Deer.Pike plays Rosalie, a pioneer woman whose homestead in New Mexico is attacked by Comanches and entire family is slaughtered, including her baby in that unthinkably grotesque manner. Beset with grief and horror, Rosalie is to come across army officer Blocker, played by Christian Bale, an habitually ruthless oppressor of the Native American peoples, though certainly someone possessed of military discipline. For political reasons, Blocker has been ordered to release dying Cheyenne chief Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) and accompany him to his homeland of the Valley Of The Bears in Montana so that he can be properly buried in the land of his ancestors. On the way, and with an accompanying party including Kilcher and a soldier played by Timoth谷e Chalamet, Blocker chances upon poor Rosalie and with a certain undemonstrative gallantry, takes it upon himself to be protector and lead her to safety with this group. They embark on an extraordinarily long and gruelling journey, which is to involve an encounter with a criminal played by Ben Foster.The final scenes of the movie show Blocker out of uniform and in civilian clothes, as if to imply that his redemption has involved moving away from his military life 每 whether that is temporarily or permanently isn＊t obvious. It sometimes looks as if Cooper thinks that his film can acknowledge and cancel the historical issues of white oppression simply by turning the violence levels up to boiling point, so that the shock of its cruelty, and the virulence of toxic masculinity, combined with the emollient beauty of the surrounding natural world and a growing emotional tenderness between Rosalie and Blocker, will somehow dissolve the great historical wrongs within a romantic narrative of learning and personal discovery. This is a little glib, although the film＊s immediate dramatic effects are potent enough and its response to the mysterious grandeur of the Old West is persuasive and heartfelt. A flawed, but interesting drama.																																											"
"ot that long ago I received a questionnaire through my door. How had the 1930s Bauhaus building in which I live survived the rigours of time? Who had designed it? Who was its first owner? And, the form went on, what were my memories of it?Circulated far and wide across Athens, the questionnaire and its findings are part of a vast inventory of 19th- and early 20th-century buildings that now stand at the heart of a burgeoning cultural heritage crisis in . At least 10,600 buildings are on the database and it is growing by the day.Against a backdrop of economic recession 每 the price of three gargantuan bailouts to keep the debt-stricken country afloat 每 home maintenance has become a luxury few can afford. With bank loans frozen and cuts and tax increases straining budgets, many of the buildings have been allowed to fall into disrepair, or have been pulled down altogether. ※In the present climate, people just don＊t have the money to restore them,§ says Irini Gratsia, co-founder of , the association of archaeologists and architects that is collating the database. ※There is a great danger that many will be demolished not because their owners want new builds, but because they want to avoid property taxes announced since the crisis began.§ Monumenta estimates that, since the 1950s, as many as 80% percent of Athens＊ buildings from the 19th and early 20th centuries have been destroyed.Now at risk are some of the last surviving examples of Greek neoclassical architecture and Greek modernism, the latter scorned as ※cement boxes§ when they began to fill the great Attic plain. Mostly constructed between 1830 and 1940, they comprise the rich architectural mosaic of a city 每 dominated by the 5th-century  每 that often goes unnoticed.※Just as they say Greece is not only Athens, the history of Athens is not only about the Parthenon,§ says Nikos Harkiolakis, a veteran culture ministry official who now heads an organisation representing owners of listed buildings.But the destruction of Athens＊ urban space is not new. More than any other major European metropolis, the Greek capital has been altered dramatically by the vicissitudes of its tumultuous modern history. The Bauhaus apartment blocks, like the one in which I live, were constructed in the 1930s, when modernism 每 reflecting social upheaval at the time 每 suddenly exploded. The handwritten deeds on my building, set out across 11 stamped pages of elegant handwritten scrawl, name its first owner, in 1934, as Panagiotis Merzotis, a merchant who owned two shops on its ground floor. According to a hand-drawn floor plan, the building abutted Ottoman and Roman ruins in the Plaka district beneath the Acropolis. Each of its three apartments measured 142 sq m 每 a typical size for the interwar years, when a vibrant generation of poets, painters and a mercantile middle class favoured modernist architecture for its elevators and central heating.The rapid urbanisation that followed a  during the second world war saw edifices both neoclassical and modern torn down almost overnight. Mine emerged unscathed 每 although, because of its proximity to the Parthenon, with which Hitler was obsessed, it did not entirely escape the tyranny of the Third Reich. On the morning of 27 April 1941, the tanks, motorbikes and cars of the Wehrmacht streamed into the square in Plaka in which it stands, turning the area into a depot; German military staff took over the top floor of the building. The civil war that followed caused yet more damage 每 still visible in the chipped, bullet-pocked facades.Even more damaging, however, was what came next. From the 1950s, under legislation since criticised as shortsighted and controversial, Athenians were encouraged to hand over their family homes in exchange for apartments in the multi-storey concrete blocks that replaced them. In the 60s and 70s, rural migration led to chaotic urban expansion as Athens was transformed into a megacity that now hosts up to half of Greece＊s entire population.The Athens of imposing neoclassical edifices 每 architecture first adopted with the arrival of the court of , the German-born monarch installed by Greece after it achieved independence from the Ottoman empire 每 has been virtually erased. ※If a building wasn＊t classified a ＆work of art＊, it stood to be demolished, and up until 1975 at least one was destroyed every week,§ says Harkiolakis. ※Those that survived are the very last to exist; they are architectural gems that must be supported.§Among those still standing in the city centre is a five-storey neoclassical building on Tsakalof Street that has been in the family of Spyros Mercouris for five generations. The 92-year-old belongs to one of Athens＊ most prominent families: his ; his sister, Melina, was an actor and culture minister. But that has helped little in his ongoing battle to renovate the building＊s facade. The task has been made harder by the fact that the building, like many others in Athens, and since been split into separately owned flats.※Navigating the labyrinthine bureaucracy has been a nightmare,§ says Mercouris, who acted as his sister＊s adviser in the 1980s when, as culture minister, she saved 182 buildings in Plaka that were at the point of collapse. ※From the outset it has been a labour of love.§Nikos Continis owns an 1870s two-storey neoclassical home in the graffiti-covered district of . ※Doing anything to the place is hugely costly, hugely time-consuming and seemingly neverending,§ he says. ※Getting permits to move ahead with any work can take years 每 and that＊s before anything you may want to do is approved by the government.§Roughly a third of Monumenta＊s database is comprised of listed buildings. Not all were constructed in the neoclassical spirit favoured by the Bavarian planners brought in by Otto to transform what was then a malaria-ridden village of no more than 5,000 residents. Many belonged to the school of eclectic architecture inspired by art nouveau and art deco 每 trends that would influence the architecture of most US cities in the 1920s and 30s.Apartment buildings inspired by the Bauhaus movement but given a Greek twist 每 with shuttered windows and enclosed balconies 每 proliferated across the capital as the bourgeoisie shunned neoclassical design for modern comforts. With their simplified designs, ornately decorated ironwork, delineated motifs and spacious marble halls, they are considered masterpieces in their own right., the Swiss architect widely viewed as the pioneer of the modern movement, particularly influenced leading Greek architects.※All these buildings are the legacy of architects who had studied in places like Paris and Germany and worked in the offices of men like Le Corbusier,§ says Gratsia. ※They are an invaluable part of Greece＊s architectural heritage and an integral part of the rich history of Athens.§Harkiolakis agrees, adding that for too long Greeks have been weighed down by the burden of their past. ※The Acropolis may belong to the world, it may be the symbol of European civilisation, its conservation may be ongoing and indeed excellent, but it cannot be the only recipient of [state] funding.§Both Gratsia and Harkiolakis worry that time is running out if Greece＊s lesser-known heritage is to withstand the test of time. Without urgent intervention in the form of government grants or EU funds, owners, they say, will simply lack the means to keep up with repairs. ※If we want to save these buildings, we have to reduce the taxes on them,§ says Gratsia.With more than 1,500 abandoned buildings in the historic heart of Athens alone, financial incentives are vital because restoration costs are often so high. ※The price of preservation is much more expensive than building from scratch,§ says Harkiolakis. ※In Italy the owners of listed buildings receive state help. In Britain you have organisations like the National Trust. In Greece not only do we have nothing, [but] bureaucracy is such that a permit to do the works in the first place can take between four to five years [to secure].§Since its abrupt start in late 2009, Greece＊s debt drama has been a lesson in loss. But as the country＊s financial crisis rumbles on, many also see it as a lesson of rebirth, of starting anew.In recent years, amid record levels of poverty and unemployment, municipal authorities have stepped in, linking up with private initiatives to rescue buildings from dereliction and collapse. Concerned citizens have similarly raised the alarm.Monumenta aims to promote and protect the capital＊s modern architectural heritage by ※raising awareness among authorities and owners§, a feat it hopes to achieve by integrating it into the daily lives of residents and visitors through workshops and tours. Other organisations have grand schemes to repurpose buildings and give them a new lease of life.Ominously, there are signs of a rise in non-Europeans investing in properties now selling at rock-bottom prices as a mean of securing a  residence permit.※I am hearing, increasingly, that American, Russian and Arab investors are snapping them up,§ says Harkiolakis. ※With everything that Greeks have been through, they may have no other choice but to sell them. It＊s that or demolition 每 the end of memories altogether.§																																											"
"nderage discos could be pretty strange in the early 1990s. You＊d get a blast of ; maybe even REM for the more sophisticated pre-teen. But you were also guaranteed to hear at least one example of speaker-rattling, drug-referencing rave music that borrowed samples of children＊s TV tunes for its hooks 每 samples that its pre-teen audience was too young to have nostalgia for.There was Smart E＊s Sesame＊s Treet, which reached No 2 in the UK and an improbable No 60 in the US in 1992. There was Trip to Trumpton by the respected breakbeat duo Urban Hype. In 1991, there was Mark Summers＊ Summers Magic,which started the trend by sampling The Magic Roundabout theme tune. And then there was Charly by , a track that led Mixmag to accuse the band of .Some people called this kind of music cartoon rave. Others called it toytown techno. Whatever the name, it proved a brief phenomenon, fading away by autumn 1992, to the delight of more seriously minded rave DJs. Yet this uniquely British sensation, where nostalgia met new electronic production tools and a sense of humour, helped to introduce a generation of children to the joys of electronic music, while many of its producers went on to considerable success.※At the time, bleep techno was all the rage. I saw Summers Magic as the antithesis to the dark side of that,§ says Summers. ※The illegal substances people were taking at raves at the time made them feel happy and light. I suppose when they heard something like Summers Magic, that sense of euphoria comes flooding back, [reminding] them of that bygone age when they were innocent.§Although derivative, these tunes were rarely cheap or cynical. Their success came largely from the ground up, as rave and pirate radio DJs picked up on the records and turned them into hits, the same route taken by more credible dance hits of the era like Liquid＊s Sweet Harmony. ※It wasn＊t manufactured, like we＊re going to put this cheesy thing out and have a hit,§ says Mark Pritchard, a respected electronic music producer who now releases on Warp Records and has collaborated with Thom Yorke. In 1991, Pritchard had a Top 10 UK hit with . ※Most of it was a bit naive and nostalgic 每 I think that＊s why the stuff doesn＊t feel as bad as it could do.§※They weren＊t records made by talentless people who got lucky,§ adds Billy Daniel Bunter, one of the most important DJs of the rave era. ※They were made by really great producers and engineers. I didn＊t play Trip to Trumpton, but the B-side,  became a seminal, hands-in-the-air rave classic.§Bunter thinks the same cartoon samples that put off some DJs allowed mainstream media to plug into the excitement of the rave era. ※This was a dream for Radio 1,§ he says. ※At 3.30pm you couldn＊t play [hardcore classic] Genaside II Narra Mine, but you could play Roobarb and Custard.§Pritchard＊s experiences are typical of producers who had runaway rave hits. Roobarb and Custard was made on a whim, and included on a white-label 12-inch with the hope of selling 500 copies. It ended up in the Top 10, and Pritchard appeared on Top of the Pops alongside Cliff Richard and Right Said Fred. ※It was pretty bizarre,§ Pritchard says. ※I had to do Top of the Pops, then carry on working as a chef.§Many rave acts had similarly surreal brushes with the mainstream:  once opened a shopping centre in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent and Liquid played a gig in Barry town hall, Wales, a show organised by the local council. ※Interviews were weird,§ says Chris Howell, a successful DJ, producer and label boss known as Luna-C and once a member of Smart E＊s. ※Journalists always asked what the inspiration for the song was, and you couldn＊t really say, ＆We were just clowning about＊.§Perhaps inevitably, the boom didn＊t last. Howell says it proved impossible to follow up Sesame＊s Treet. ※I voted for going very hardcore and underground,§ he says. ※I knew there would be no huge commercial success for us again. It was a novelty tune, regardless of our original intent.§ The best the band could hope for, Howell says, would be to forge a career as ※real hardcore artists§. ※But in the end, we went for a follow-up [Loo＊s Control] that was better made, better sung, a better ＆song＊ in every way,§ he says. ※Of course, it failed.§Some 25 years on from these funny, strange and oddly charming records hitting the charts, many of those responsible for them have achieved great things in music: the Prodigy are one of the world＊s biggest live draws; Summers runs a successful sample replay business, Scorccio; and Luna-C＊s Kniteforce label is a standard bearer for hard dance music.How do their creators feel today about those early hits? Howell opts for a mixture of vague embarrassment, pride, gratefulness, resentment, sadness and a little nostalgia, while Pritchard looks back on that period fondly. ※There was a time when I used to get a bit annoyed that people would go on about this tune like it was a joke,§ he says. ※But as many people say they like it as they don＊t. Even when I first met [dubstep pioneer] Loefah, he was like, ＆Oh, you did Roobarb and Custard 每 that was a wicked tune.＊§																																											"
"s Darth Vader would presumably agree, there is not much point being the most powerful figure in the Star Wars universe if you do not use that power to get your own way once in a while. When the evil Sith Lord first demonstrated his Force Choke technique to put the insolent admiral Motti in his place in 1977＊s , it came across as a ruthless but effective method of keeping his inferiors in line. But by the time Vader had murdered two of his top men, admiral Kendal Ozzel and captain Lorth Needa, for making a mess of things during the events of Empire Strikes Back, it began to look a lot more like a careless waste of resources.Something similar has been happening over at Lucasfilm, where president Kathleen Kennedy has now fired directors from three different prospective Star Wars movies since being hired by Disney to oversee the long-running space saga in the wake of George Lucas＊s October 2012 sale to the mouse house for $4bn. , the director of 2019＊s Star Wars: Episode IX. Before him, The Lego Movie＊s Phil Lord and Christopher Miller , while  believed to have centred on iconic bounty hunter Boba Fett. And don＊t forget that Kennedy also ordered Rogue One: A Star Wars Story＊s  two years ago.Why is it, then, that Star Wars keeps losing its directors?  that Trevorrow was pushed because the director of Safety Not Guaranteed, Jurassic World and The Book of Henry wouldn＊t play ball with Kennedy; because he was, to quote the report, ※difficult§. This follows on from reports that Lord and Miller got on the producer＊s dark side because they wanted to bring too much of their . Trank, to be fair, was fired because of his  每 even though the ill-fated superhero flick was a 20th Century Fox venture, word got back to Disney that the Chronicle director did not have the chops to pull off a major blockbuster.Intriguingly, the only film-maker who appears to have survived a creative struggle with Kennedy, albeit with his control over final cut hugely diminished, is Edwards, the British director who made his name on low budget sci-fi venture Monsters and has since directed the Godzilla remake and Rogue One. From an external perspective, there＊s a sense that Edwards is the last person to get into a row with anyone 每 he is as personable as they come. Ditto Ron Howard, the Oscar-winning industry vet who has stepped in to take charge of Han Solo.Perhaps this is the key to directing Star Wars in the era of producer-controlled cinematic universes. If you are willing to submit to the will of a higher power without the need for a choke hold or two from on high, then the keys to the kingdom are yours. But if you question the will of Lucasfilm＊s supreme leader, you may well find yourself staring into glassy-eyed oblivion. And yet there have to be questions over the roles of Kennedy and Lucasfilm in all this too, even if . One sacked director can perhaps be written off as poor luck, but three starts to appear an awful lot like abysmal planning. The Lucasfilm model for appointing Star Wars directors seems to have been ripped straight from the Marvel playbook: get a young director with one indie and one moderate mainstream success under their belt, and let them have a crack. But Star Wars has been around a lot longer than, say, Iron Man, and there are expectations surrounding the saga that cannot simply be dispensed with because the next director in line fancies shaking up the series＊ foundations. This is a cultural touchstone with roots going back to the very dawn of the blockbuster era.Moreover, Star Wars hasn＊t yet been established as an episodic, multiple-film ※cinematic universe§ in the same way as Marvel＊s, so individual directors don＊t have a tried-and-tested template to work from. It＊s a tougher job, and one that requires serious industry nous and a willingness to compromise to navigate.Who, then, should Kennedy be looking towards to replace Trevorrow? It needs to be a director capable of adding zing to the final part of the latest Star Wars trilogy without trying to reinvent the wheel. It needs to be a film-maker with vision and verve who understands how to work within set guidelines, a film-maker with courage but little in the way of ego. Would it be fair to say that it needs to be a director who looks an awful lot like JJ Abrams? And if the American film-maker doesn＊t fancy winging his way back across the Atlantic after his famous , there＊s nothing like a little dark side telekinesis to remind your minion that it would be advisable to buck up and get in line.

He spent two years recovering from wounds from a mortar that had all but taken him out after the Battle of the Bulge. My mother once told me that, after he had been discharged from hospital, he had gone to a bank, taken his prewar personality, put it into a vault, locked it, thrown away the key and never looked back.

My first memories are of his crutches and canes in the hall closet. One day, I was thoughtless enough to say: ※Why don＊t we ever play ball?§ He said: ※I＊m your dad, not your pal.§ Even into his 90s, the army provided him with two pairs of special shoes each year; otherwise he couldn＊t have walked any distance., my father announced he was leaving the family. At that point, we admired him as this eccentric, strong personality. He intended selling the plastics company he had acquired.

I remember feeling conflicted: half-admiring of him, half-loathing.Then came the recession of 1968 and the stock of the company that was buying him out fell from 53 to three. That all but broke him.

"hree volunteers from the outside world 每 Charles, a bartender; Chris, a museum associate; and Brian, a teaching assistant 每 enter New Folsom Prison in California. They are there, along with other visitors and trained facilitators, to experience and engage in group therapy over a ※four-day intensive§ with prisoners serving long sentences for violent and/or gang-related crime. Their interactions, conclusions and traumas are all chronicled in a new documentary called .For 17 years, New Folsom prison has shown the insight and intelligence to allow extraordinary therapeutic work to flourish within its walls. Like my experience in the UK of developing a new kind of therapy for violent and often gang-affiliated prisoners 每 on which I drew for my script for the  每 it is dependent on creating very high levels of trust with people conditioned by betrayal from early childhood.We are told in an early title card that prisoners on the programme ※agree to leave gang politics at the door, setting aside the racial segregation of the yard§. This bland statement belies the magnitude of the achievement shown in The Work. Some 50 or so long-term, maximum-security prisoners, a good many of whom might never be getting out and so have little to stop them, in a judicial sense, from acting violently, come together with no prison guards in a packed room for four days with unprotected outsiders. Instead of eating the volunteers alive, the prisoners deal with them in such a skilled, empathic and therapeutic way that each visitor appears to go through something not only healing, but also potentially life-changing.This is prison therapy of the most valuable kind, where the fruits of the internal work done by the prisoners are clearly visible in the way they reach out so adeptly and compassionately to help others. As one facilitator puts it: ※This whole process of going down into the wound is not an end in itself. We＊re looking for something 每 and we＊re bringing something back out of that descent.§ With no intrusion from a voiceover or from talking heads, the film-makers allow the audience to feel the power as the journeys unfold, as if we＊re in the circle with everyone else.The visitors don＊t know exactly what they are letting themselves in for and Brian, the teaching assistant, is initially sceptical: ※I＊m having, let＊s say, an impossible time not judging what the fuck＊s going on ...§ To start with, I struggled with the therapy-programme CEO＊s chanting at the opening session, with all the participants obediently responding on cue. It felt more like something you would find in a cult rather than a psychotherapeutic programme. But then the programme＊s co-founder, an ex-convict called Rob, placed things in a context I could understand: ※I have no idea what it＊s going to look like. I would be lying if I said I did. All I know is that there are a bunch of really intense, dedicated, committed men sitting in this circle, who are willing to go anywhere with you, however you need to go, in whatever way that looks like.§Within male prison culture, the antidote to being shamed, humiliated or disrespected is to become violent, replacing the feeling of vulnerable exposure with one of apparent force and potency. In a pivotal moment, one of the facilitators 每 Bharataji 每 describes how as a teenager he confided in a trusted male role model about a significant sexual experience. The teenage Bharataji felt that what he had shared was ※sacred§ and ※safe§, but the role model told everybody, and when Bharataji spoke to him, the man insulted him and dismissed his feelings as worthless.In a way that parallels the role model＊s betrayal 每 taking advantage of the vulnerability Bharataji has shown in sharing 每 Brian delivers a cruel, knee-jerk response. Bharataji understandably responds in a way that could be seen as violent, albeit in an emotional, not physical, way: he castratingly calls Brian a ※bitch§. Brian reacts. But the rest of the group, including Brian＊s two guides 每 Vegas, a former Bloods boss, and a remarkable partner guide whose name we＊re not given 每 maintain their focused presence.The only way you can achieve this in the heat of the moment is by having gone down deep into your own wound, found something, and brought it back. Otherwise, in some tiny, involuntary way, you＊ll be triggered and this will be picked up on. Then, a moment of emotional violence could build and destabilise into something much more damaging. As Vegas＊s partner guide puts it: ※Right there next to the wound, right there next to the pain. When we go deep, and we go down to the bottom. Right there next to where we hurt the most, is where our medicine is at.§																																											"
"eniz Gamze Erg邦ven is the Turkish film-maker hugely admired for her 2015 debut feature Mustang, about five orphaned sisters growing up in a patriarchal society. Hopes were very high for this English-language followup here at Toronto, but the result is a baffling and frustrating disappointment. There are sparks of interest and some powerful moments, but it is structurally disjointed, tonally uncertain, unfocused and unfinished, with some very broad drama-improv-class acting from the kids and a frankly unrelaxed and undirected performance from .The setting is Los Angeles, during the  riots, and the cops＊ trials are forever on TV in the background. The title appears to merge Rodney＊s surname with that of Martin Luther King Jr, and perhaps alludes to the heroic nobility of those hardworking people having to live their lives while dealing with racism. Halle Berry plays Millie, a woman in South Central who bakes and sells cakes while running in her apartment a refuge for runaways and disadvantaged kids. They range in age from around 6 or 7 to 15: the little kids are running around innocently enough, but the older teens are dealing with growing sexual feelings and the boys need some privacy in which to jerk off 〞 another oddly misjudged comedy scene, adding to the weird cutesiness and playfulness which undermines the desperate seriousness of what is about to happen.Millie is on her own, but she＊s strangely attracted to the highly improbable hunk who lives next door, Obie, played with a Brit accent by . (She has a fervent erotic dream about him, amusingly presented, and arguably no more random than anything else in this film.) Yet in the opening scene, Obie actually fires a pump-action shotgun out of his window, infuriated by the criminal disorder right by his house, so terrifyingly that Millie and the kids hide under their kitchen table. It sets his character up very strangely: we never see that gun, or really that temper, again.When the riots begin, Millie is beside herself with worry, and in fact seems to be beside herself with worry most of the time, understandably enough. In the violent chaos she is arrested, but then finally thrown out of the squad car 〞 in cuffs 〞 when the cops realise they have something more important to deal with. Obie happens entirely fortuitously to be driving past as she staggers, shackled, down the street, and it is the chance for him to give some gallant help. But later she and Obie have to drive out to stop their kids from looting some store, and she gets cuffed by a cop all over again, shackled with hunky Obie to a lamppost. But Obie somehow manages to break free by ripping off Millie＊s jeans, tearing them into strips to make up a rope 〞 because denim is so easy to rip with your hands 〞 and using it to climb up the lamppost and get himself free and then come back with his tools to rescue her (again). This weird larky scene is the single silliest and most improbable part in the film.Meanwhile, Millie＊s teen kids are involved in a tragic stabbing that has to do with sexual anxiety and sexual jealousy. It＊s a strange narrative counter-current, left hanging at the end of this relatively short feature, which fails to absorb its emotional implications or how this microcosm of violence and dismay fits into the sketchily imagined bigger picture.There are some powerful moments in Kings, certainly. The convenience store shooting of Latasha Harlins 〞 just days after the King beating, and without any prison sentence for its perpetrator 〞 is shockingly portrayed, and Erg邦ven shows the flashes of random hysteria and chaos that a riot creates. But it＊s a misstep for this talented director. 																																											"
"ust as Britain negotiates its inglorious retreat from Europe, and our political classes prepare to ratify the chaotic abandonment of a union intended to prevent another war, there seems to be a renewed appetite for movies about 1940. Christopher Nolan has just given us his operatic immersion in Dunkirk, and now  〞 who himself staged bravura Dunkirk scenes in his 2007 film Atonement 〞 directs this undeniably exciting and beguiling account of Winston Churchill＊s darkest hour in 1940, as Hitler＊s forces gather across the Channel, poised to invade. It is written by Anthony McCarten, who scripted the recent Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything.This is not so much a period war movie as a high-octane political thriller: May 1940 as House Of Cards, with the wartime Prime Minister up against a cabal of politicians who want to do him down. It＊s interesting for a film to remind us that appeasement as an issue did not vanish the moment that  took over as Prime Minister; despite the famous David Low cartoon, not everyone was right behind him, rolling up their sleeves. Here, his immediate enemies do not seem to be Hitler and Mussolini as much as Chamberlain and Halifax, agitating for a deal with the Nazis and scheming to undermine Churchill＊s cabinet and parliamentary position.They are played respectively by Ronald Pickup and Stephen Dillane, the latter having a malign mandarin impassivity. Dillane makes him a pretty unholy fox. Ben Mendelsohn plays George VI, who is also an appeasement fan at first, though the film gallantly makes him a Churchill convert, conjuring a scene between the two of them in which his job is to stiffen Winston＊s sinews. (This film incidentally doesn＊t make the mistake in The King＊s Speech of implying that Churchill sided with Bertie during the Abdication.)Darkest Hour has obvious similarities to the recent film Churchill, with Brian Cox; like that drama it imagines a pretty young WAAF figure as his secretary, for him to be at first grumpy and then soppy with - Lily James plays this part here. Miranda Richardson played the exasperated wife Clemmie in the Brian Cox movie and here it＊s Kristin Scott Thomas being exasperated and affectionate, helping the impossible old devil dress etc, in more or less the same way - although there＊s more here for Scott Thomas to get her teeth into. But this movie packs a much bigger and more effective punch, and that＊s down to a more ambitious scale, pacier narrative drive - and the lead performance. Every time I sit down to another Churchill drama, I promise myself I won＊t just roll over for another actor in the latex/Homburg/bowtie/cigar/padding combo and doing the jowl-quivering while speaking in the and the weird . And yet there＊s no doubt about it,  is terrific as Churchill, conveying the babyishness of his oddly unlined face in repose, the slyness and manipulative good humour, and a weird deadness when he is overtaken with depression. There is a scene (a bit fancifully imagined) with Churchill slumped in a bleakly lit almost unfurnished room, where he looks like something by Lucian Freud. He spends a fair bit of time down in the bunker-ish Cabinet War Rooms yelling at people: these are the ※Upfall§ scenes, which might get YouTube-subtitled in German in all sorts of irreverent ways. And it is here that Winston reaches his nadir, before the miracle of the little boats has manifested itself. He allows Halifax to send word via the Italians that Britain would be theoretically interested in the Danegeld-price: what might induce Hitler to hold back from Britain and its colonies? Oldman shows Churchill going into a kind of stricken shock.This is not to say that there isn＊t a fair bit of hokum and romantic invention. This film imagines Churchill needing to take a journey on the tube because his official car is held up in traffic. So he meets a quaint cross-section of forelock-tugging British and empire subjects in the underground carriage, from whom he learns something very important 〞 that he is absolutely right! There is room for a more sceptical movie about Churchill: something revisiting his performance during the Tonypandy Riots or the Siege Of Sidney Street. Or just something that acknowledges that he hated Adolf Hitler for the same reason he hated Mahatma Gandhi: they were both enemies of the British Empire. But Gary Oldman carries off a tremendous performance here, and it＊s impossible not to enjoy it. It＊s as if his establishment panjandrum George Smiley was suddenly infused with the spirit of Sid Vicious. 																																											"

"illary Clinton＊s  in the 2016 election has made headlines across the globe for its candid reflections on one of the most memorable campaigns in US history.Be it her disgust with Trump and his divisive campaign, or lingering wounds from her bruising primary with Bernie Sanders, Clinton holds little back in the 469-page What Happened.Below are 10 notable anecdotes from Clinton＊s book that shed light on everything from her humorous interactions at Trump＊s inauguration to what was running through her mind as the results poured in on election night.As Trump sought the Republican nomination for president, a photo of the real estate mogul posing with the Clintons  to Melania Trump became infamous. Trump＊s Republican opponents circulated the image to underscore his past donations to Democrats and his more liberal-leaning views.In the early pages of the book, Clinton explains the photo and her previous rapport with Trump:※I had known Donald Trump for years, but never imagined he＊d be standing on the steps of the Capitol taking the oath of office as president of the United States. He was a fixture on the New York scene when I was a Senator 每 like a lot of big-shot real estate guys in the city, only more flamboyant and self-promoting.※In 2005, he invited us to his wedding to Melania in Palm Beach, Florida. We weren＊t friends, so I assumed he wanted as much star power as he could get. Bill happened to be speaking in the area that weekend, so we decided to go. Why not? I thought it would be a fun, gaudy, over-the-top spectacle, and I was right. I attended the ceremony, then met Bill for the reception at Trump＊s Mar-a-Lago estate. We had our photo taken with the bride and groom and left.§Much ado has been made of Clinton＊s criticism of Sanders in the book, reigniting in many ways the internal feud within the Democratic Party over its direction. In addition to insisting Sanders is ※not a Democrat§, Clinton draws a contrast to her 2008 primary against Barack Obama.※Bernie had hung on to the bitter end, drawing blood wherever he could along the way. I somewhat understood why he did it; after all, I stayed in the race for as long as I could in 2008. But that race was much closer, and I endorsed Barack right after the last primary.§On the day she clinched the nomination, Clinton adds, ※Bernie was still more than a month away from endorsing me.§Clinton also felt hamstrung by the advice she received from all corners, including Obama, not to go after Sanders. ※My team kept reminding me that we didn＊t want to alienate Bernie＊s supporters. President Obama urged me to grit my teeth and lay off Bernie as much as I could. I felt like I was in a straightjacket.§There are some kinder moments: Clinton remains ※grateful§ for when Sanders memorably exclaimed in their first debate: ※The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!§She also appreciated that Sanders was the one to formally nominate her at the Democratic National Convention, as she had done for Obama eight years before: ※The final delegate count was 2,842 for me and 1,865 for Bernie. I know it couldn＊t have been easy for him to make that statement on the floor, and I appreciated it.§Clinton has often likened Huma Abedin, her longtime aide and right-hand woman, to a daughter. It is for that reason, Clinton writes, that she refused to sideline Abedin in the aftermath of James Comey＊s 28 October letter revealing that his agency was examining new emails potentially relevant to the previously closed investigation into Clinton＊s use of a private server. The batch of emails had been discovered on a computer belonging to Abedin＊s estranged husband Anthony Weiner, who was under FBI investigation for exchanging lewd messages with a teenage girl. (He  to transferring obscene material to a minor in May.)Abedin ※looked stricken§ by the news, Clinton writes. ※Anthony had already caused so much heartache. And now this.§※This man is going to be the death of me,§ Abedin said, breaking down in tears. Clinton hugged and consoled her aide, who started out with her as a 19-year-old intern in the early 1990s.※After more than twenty years working with Huma, I think the world of her, and seeing her in such distress broke my heart ＃ In the days that followed, some people thought I should fire Huma or ＆distance myself.＊ Not a chance. She had done nothing wrong and was an invaluable member of my team. I stuck by her the same way she has always stuck by me.§ Jason Chaffetz, a former Republican congressman from Utah, is best known for his relentless focus on Clinton＊s handling of the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, during his tenure as the chairman of the House Oversight Committee.At Trump＊s inauguration, Chaffetz was criticized for posting a photo of himself shaking hands with Clinton captioned: ※So pleased she is not the president. I thanked her for her service and wished her luck. The investigation continues.§But according to Clinton, she had mistaken Chaffetz for someone else:※I saw a man off to the side who I thought was Reince Priebus, head of the Republican National Committee and incoming White House Chief of Staff. As I passed by, we shook hands and exchanged small talk. Later I realized it hadn＊t been Priebus at all.§ Calling Chaffetz a ※wannabe Javert who made endless political hay out of my emails and the 2012 tragedy in Benghazi§, Clinton describes her reaction to his photo.※What a class act! I came this close to tweeting back, ＆To be honest, thought you were Reince.＊§ It wasn＊t just Chaffetz with whom Clinton had an awkward encounter on the day Trump was sworn in as president. At the post-inauguration lunch, she met then-Representative Ryan Zinke, who now serves as Trump administration interior secretary.Zinke brought his wife over to say ※hello§, Clinton writes. ※This was somewhat surprising, considering that in 2014 he called me the ＆antichrist＊.§She couldn＊t help but quip, ※You know, congressman, I＊m not actually the antichrist.＊§※He was taken aback and mumbled something about not having meant it,§ Clinton writes. ※One thing I have learned over the years is how easy it is for some people to say horrible things about me when I＊m not around but how hard it is for them to look me in the eye and say it to my face.§ In a lengthy middle section dedicated to the threat posed by Russia, Clinton takes aim at Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.It was his website that published emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee, as well as Clinton＊s campaign chairman John Podesta. Assange has rejected allegations that the emails published on Wikileaks came into its hands via the Russian government＊s interference in the 2016 campaign, but Clinton disagrees.※In my view, Assange is a hypocrite who deserves to be held accountable for his actions. He claims to be a champion of transparency, but for many years, he＊s been helpful to Putin, one of the most repressive and least transparent autocrats in the world.※It＊s not just that WikiLeaks avoids publishing anything Putin won＊t like and instead targets Russia＊s adversaries 每 Assange actually hosted a television show on RT, Putin＊s propaganda network, and receives adoring coverage there.§After she left the state department in 2013, Clinton writes, she and Obama kept in regular touch. They met a few times for lunch, eating jambalaya one summer on the terrace outside the Oval Office while dissecting the foreign policy challenges facing America.※But gradually, as 2013 turned into 2014, our conversations turned more frequently to politics,§ Clinton writes.※President Obama knew the challenges facing Democrats. He never took his reelection for granted, and while it was a resounding win in 2012 (the legitimately resounding kind), he knew that his legacy depended to a large degree on a Democratic victory in 2016.※He made it clear that he believed that I was our party＊s best chance to hold the White House and keep our progress going, and he wanted me to move quickly to prepare to run. I knew President Obama thought the world of his vice-president, Joe Biden, and was close to some other potential candidates, so his vote of confidence meant a great deal to me.§Clinton often revisits the role played by sexism and misogyny in her defeat, writing with the sort of freedom she seldom felt able to express on the campaign trail. She admits that past controversies, such as Whitewater, Travelgate and the email furore, played a part in the public＊s perception of her. But she argues that the backlash was partly because she is a woman.※Why am I seen as such a divisive figure and, say, Joe Biden and John Kerry aren＊t? ＃ What makes me such a lightning rod for fury? I＊m really asking. I＊m at a loss.※I suspect that for many of us 每 more than we might think 每 it feels somehow off to picture a woman president sitting in the Oval Office or the Situation Room. It＊s discordant to tune into a political rally and hear a woman＊s voice booming (＆screaming,＊ ＆screeching＊) forth. Even the simple act of a woman standing up and speaking to a crowd is relatively new.§Constantly pilloried for being insufficiently progressive, Clinton contemplated proposing a policy of universal income. She had drawn inspiration from a model in Alaska, under which oil revenues are used to fund an annual dividend for every man, woman, and child living in the state.※Once you capitalize the fund, you can provide every American with a modest basic income every year,§ Clinton writes while detailing the potential proposal. ※Besides cash in people＊s pockets, it would also be a way of making every American feel more connected to our country and to one another 每 part of something bigger than ourselves.※I was fascinated by this idea, as was my husband, and we spent weeks working with our policy team to see if it could be viable enough to include in my campaign. We would call it ＆Alaska for America.＊ Unfortunately, we couldn＊t make the numbers work.§ The idea of a basic income is one  has yet to embrace. Clinton said it was ultimately too unrealistic, but wonders what could have been given the populist wave sweeping the country. ※We decided it was exciting but not realistic, and left it on the shelf. That was the responsible decision. I wonder now whether we should have thrown caution to the wind and embraced ＆Alaska for America＊ as a long-term goal and figured out the details later.§Clinton had not even entertained the thought of a loss to Trump, describing herself as ※shell-shocked§ as the returns came in.※I hadn＊t prepared mentally for this at all,§ she writes. ※There had been no doomsday scenarios playing out in my head in the final days, no imagining what I might say if I lost. I just didn＊t think about it.§As Trump inched closer to victory, Clinton could barely breathe. She wondered to herself what might happen next. Although Clinton phoned Trump to congratulate him in what she characterizes as a ※perfectly nice and weirdly ordinary§ call, another part of her brain registered that her opponent led chants of ※lock her up§ and vowed to send her to prison as she stood beside him in one of their debates.A debate ensued in her hotel suite over what she should say in her . Her aides presented a draft that aggressively disavowed the bigotry of Trump＊s campaign. ※If we believe what we＊ve said for the past six months about the dangers this guy poses to our country, then you can＊t act like that＊s not true anymore,§ Clinton writes of their argument. ※People are scared and worried about what he＊ll do to their families. They want to hear from you.※A spirited discussion ensued. Eventually I asked the speechwriters to take another crack at a draft that was shorter and more gracious but not sugarcoated.§When all was said and done, Clinton writes, it was just her and Bill.※Bill was watching Trump＊s speech on television. He couldn＊t believe it. Neither could I. Eventually everyone left, and it was just us. I hadn＊t cried yet, wasn＊t sure if I would. But I felt deeply and throughly exhausted, like I hadn＊t slept in 10 years. We lay down on the bed and stared at the ceiling. Bill took my hand, and we just lay there.§																																											"
"＊s black comedy  has received a major boost in its Oscar prospects by winning the top honour at the .The film, which stars Frances McDormand as a mother who takes matters into her own hands when the police fail to find out who murdered her teenage daughter, was awarded the People＊s Choice award, ahead of , a biopic of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding, and Luca Guadagnino＊s gay love story . The victory is the second for the film since its premiere earlier this month at the , where it received the best screenplay prize.Three Billboards is McDonagh＊s first film since 2012＊s , a violent meta crime caper that starred Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson. Before that McDonagh directed the acclaimed black comedy , which starred Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as Irish hitmen hiding out in the Belgian city. Like that film, Three Billboards has received strong reviews from critics. In , the Guardian＊s Xan Brooks described it as ※an uproarious delight of a film that snaps the eyelids up like rollerblinds§ and praised McDormand＊s ※powerhouse performance§.Toronto＊s People＊s Choice award has become a reliable bellwether of Oscars glory in recent years, with four of its nine winners going on to win best picture at the Academy Awards, including The King＊s Speech and 12 Years a Slave. Last year＊s winner, meanwhile, was , which famously lost out to Moonlight for the best picture but won six other Academy Awards.Other winners at the festival included battle-rap drama , which won the People＊s Choice Midnight Madness award for genre, shock and cult cinema, and photographer Agn豕s Varda＊s , which won the People＊s Choice prize for best documentary. The Platform prize for international film, meanwhile, was won by Warwick Thornton＊s , a period western set in Australia＊s Northern Territory. ※It is a great saga of human fate, and its themes of race and struggle for survival are handled in such a simple, rich, unpretentious and touching way, that it became for us a deeply emotional metaphor for our common fight for dignity,§ a statement from the awards jury said.

"American rock music of the past 30 years might have looked very different without the influence of the Minneapolis trio . , who has died from cancer aged 56, was the band＊s drummer and also one of their chief songwriters, often locked in a creative tussle with the singer and guitarist, Bob Mould.The group set a relentless pace between 1982 and 1987, undertaking gruelling months-long tours in which they played shows almost every night, and releasing six studio albums and the live collection Land Speed Record (1982). Though their discs didn＊t score highly on the mainstream charts, they were a hugely influential part of a new wave of independent American bands that was springing up across the US. These included fellow Minneapolitans Soul Asylum and the Replacements, and Georgia-based , while Boston＊s Pixies and the grunge scene centring on Seattle would draw inspiration from H邦sker D邦＊s music and independent ethic.H邦sker D邦 released Land Speed Record on the New Alliance label, and their first studio album, Everything Falls Apart (1983), on their own Reflex Records, but went up several gears when they signed to the prestigious California-based SST Records, formed by Black Flag＊s guitarist, Greg Ginn. The group moved far beyond their limiting hardcore-rock origins with the double-concept album Zen Arcade (1984), writing material that incorporated psychedelia, folk and rock＊n＊roll (the album had been preceded by the single release of H邦sker D邦＊s scintillating cover of the Byrds＊ acid-rock classic Eight Miles High). Hart wrote or co-wrote 11 of Zen Arcade＊s 23 songs, including the peerless Pink Turns to Blue and Turn on the News. Rolling Stone magazine placed Zen Arcade at 33 in its greatest albums of the 1980s, and at .The following year, Hart was again in fine creative form with New Day Rising, contributing such highlights as The Girl Who Lives on Heaven Hill and Books About UFOs. The album reached No?10 on the independent chart in the UK (one place higher than Zen Arcade), where journalists had been quicker to appreciate H邦sker D邦＊s qualities than those in the US. Flip Your Wig (1985) did better still by reaching No?1 on the British indie chart, and such was the band＊s march towards more widespread appeal that in 1986 they signed to Warner Bros. Candy Apple Grey (1986) was their first album for their new corporate partner, and the singles from it, Sorry Somehow and Don＊t Want to Know If You Are Lonely, were written and sung by Hart. The latter was subsequently covered by Green Day.Warehouse: Songs And Stories (1987) proved to be H邦sker D邦＊s last, with the Mould-Hart rivalry reaching a peak. Hart recalled that Mould had declared that an equal songwriting split ※§, and, so, of the album＊s 20 songs, Mould wrote 11 to Hart＊s nine. The group split up acrimoniously following a tour in support of the album, with Hart＊s heroin addiction being blamed, though the suicide of the group＊s manager, David Savoy, just before the tour opened was a crippling blow.Hart was born in South St Paul, Minnesota, the youngest of three children. His mother worked at a credit union and his father was a teacher (it was a ※typical American dysfunctional family§, as he put it). When Grant was 10, his oldest brother, Tom, was killed in a car accident. Grant inherited his drum kit and record collection and began learning to play drums and also guitar. He cut his performing teeth by playing in bands in high school.He first met the future H邦sker D邦 bass player after he took a job at the Melody Lane record store. He met Mould in 1978 while working at Cheapo Records in St Paul, where Mould was a student at the nearby Macalester College. ※One block from my dormitory was a tiny store called Cheapo Records,§ Mould wrote on Facebook after Hart＊s death. ※There was a PA system set up near the front door blaring punk rock. I went inside and ended up hanging out with the only person in the shop. His name was Grant Hart.§After an experimental gig at the local Randolph Inn with Mould and some of Hart＊s record store pals (they called themselves Buddy and the Returnables), the H邦sker D邦 trio of Hart, Mould and Norton was born. As they worked up their material at local clubs in Minneapolis, the band were initially heavily influenced by punk and the hardcore rock coming out of California, but this was not particularly to Hart＊s taste. ※I didn＊t enjoy playing hardcore,§ he said later. ※It was just such a damn boring job for a drummer.§ With his hippy hairstyle and fondness for playing in his bare feet, Hart did not look the part of a hardcore rocker. The fact that both he and Mould were gay helped to further undermine existing rock＊n＊roll stereotypes.After H邦sker D邦 split, Hart released the solo EP 2541 (1988), followed by the album Intolerance (1989) and another EP, All Of My Senses (1990). In late 1989 he formed his own trio, the Nova Mob, who would release the albums The Last Days of Pompeii (1991) and Nova Mob (1994). Hart reverted to solo work, and released the live album Ecce Homo (1995) and Good News for Modern Man (1999). Hot Wax followed in 2009, and his last completed album was  (2013), a musical interpretation of a treatment of John Milton＊s Paradise Lost by the Beat poet William Burroughs.In October 2013, the film-maker Gorman Bechard released a film biography of Hart called . At the time of his death, Hart was working on a concept album about . A collection of early tracks, sessions and live recordings from the early days of H邦sker D邦, called , is due for release in November.

"he  is the last of the visiting orchestras to appear at this year＊s , and for the first of their two concerts, they gave us Mahler＊s , conducted by  and performed, somewhat unusually, with no companion piece. The symphony is one of the great tragic statements in music, though to some extent an air of mystery still clings to it. It is widely regarded as premonitory, both of the private tragedies 每 the death of his daughter; a diagnosis of a potentially fatal heart condition 每 that overtook Mahler shortly after its completion, and of the political and military catastrophes of the mid-20th century. Then there is the question, never fully resolved, of the running order of the inner movements: the andante and scherzo both reflect back on the conflicts of the first movement, though Mahler changed his mind several time as to which should be played first. Conductors are consequently faced with a choice as to how to proceed that inevitably affects the work＊s emotional trajectory. Harding placed the andante before the scherzo in an interpretation rooted in jolts and swerves between violence, lyricism and restraint. The opening march set the parameters with the initial lurch into brutality offset by some exquisite woodwind textures and a surge of intensity in the strings. The brass were over-prominent at the start, and the balance took a while to settle, but the development was relentless in its force until we reached the extraordinary moment of stillness and reflection at its centre. The andante had an uneasy beauty that darkened ominously as it went, while the scherzo, pitiless in its mockery of both the first movement＊s aggression and the tropes of early classicism, was bitter in its wit. The finale, however, which gathers the work＊s threads together in a narrative of assertion and defeat, was done with striking restraint, avoiding the overt ferocity that some interpreters bring to the work at this point. This was not so much a cry of desperation as a measured progression towards inevitable catastrophe, with nuances of colour and emotion carefully probed and the movement＊s structural logic laid bare. Gains in clarity sometimes came at the price of a lack of cumulative tension, but the final plunge into despair was disquieting in the extreme.																																											"

"hose impatient with high-end Britfilm period product might worry that this movie takes a rather picturesque view of disability issues, and for the first 20 minutes I came pretty close to this standpoint myself. But you have to give Breathe time to let its charm and its heartfelt decency grow on you. The film is about an important figure in the history of how we think about and respect disabled people 每 the wheelchair-use pioneer and polio survivor Robin Cavendish (whose son Jonathan is the movie＊s producer).Andy Serkis makes his debut as director, working from a robust screenplay by William Nicholson.  plays Cavendish, a rather dashing fellow in the 1950s who zooms around the place in his sports car and plays a splendid game of cricket, hitting a six that breaks the teacups set out by the clubhouse and roguishly calling out: ※Sorry!§ He spots a beautiful young woman among the spectators: Diana Blacker, played by Claire Foy. It＊s love at first sight, and marriage soon afterwards, and then a rather memsahib-like existence for her in Kenya (pronounced Keen-ya) because Cavendish is a ※tea broker§ there.But then one day Cavendish feels faint and collapses: he has polio, is paralysed from the neck down, and after he is brought back to England, the medical establishment curtly tells Diana not to expect her husband to live any more than a few months, and only as a prostrate patient who must be passive and obedient. But armed with love and courage, the Cavendishes demand more of existence than this, and Robin defies the grumpy doctors by using a new respirator-wheelchair invented especially for him. It is possible that for this role, Garfield studied Kenneth More playing the disabled Air Force pilot Douglas Bader in the biopic Reach for the Sky.It＊s a valuable and touching story, and it is extraordinary to think that so recently, disabled people in this position were treated like living corpses, there to be clinically warehoused and studied, and told to be grateful and mute. There is a chilling scene in which Cavendish and his friends are taken to see a facility in Germany that turns out to be some Kubrickian living morgue: white, brightly lit, with patients entombed in state-of-the-art medical sarcophagi.As for the central relationship, it is a matter of getting on with it, keeping love alive in the little things and staying cheerful in a very British way 每 which I＊m sure is a fair depiction of exactly how the Cavendishes coped. There is a delicate allusion to what might be called their conjugal intimacy 每 Robin says it is a matter of Diana ※doing all the work§ 每 although the business of other bodily functions is not shown. The lump-in-the-throat seriousness is offset with fun small roles, principally for Tom Hollander, who plays both Diana＊s twin brothers and provides some much-needed irony and cynicism. Hugh Bonneville has some fun with the role of scientist Teddy Hall, who invents Robin＊s wheelchair.The problem is that there is not much light and shade in the Cavendishes themselves 每 and certainly not with Diana, at times a rather thankless role for Foy (given far less to chew on here than as the Queen ). She is loyal, loving, often exasperated and sometimes angry 每 but it is still a pretty narrow emotional bandwidth. Robin has his own dark night of the soul, just after he is told that he will not walk again, but it is always clear that this bitterness is only temporary.And those who wonder if the British film industry will tackle the issue of Kenya and the Mau Mau uprising may not be entirely happy with the way that is invoked: a rather saucer-eyed anecdote around the Kenyan camp-fire about Mau Mau prisoners choosing a Zen-willed suicide for themselves in detention camps. Most accounts suggest Mau Mau prisoners died rather more brutally than that, yet this quaint image is later revived to evoke Robin＊s own stoicism when his own condition becomes too much to bear. At all events, Breathe is an affecting account of the quiet courage needed to battle the deadly spores of discrimination and condescension that came with polio.

"t the very beginning of last week＊s Toronto film festival, all I wanted to talk about with anyone was the movie I had just seen: ＊s crazily brilliant and audacious horror-thriller !, all about the couple, played by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, to whom bad stuff happens at an exponential rate.My friend Col Needham, founder and chief executive of the , smiled and told me: ※Do you know, I think it＊s a Schr?dinger＊s movie. Inside the box, there＊s a film that is very good and very bad at the same time.§ Perhaps in that spirit, the Toronto Globe and Mail noncommittally  for Mother!: one star (※for the Aronofsky agnostic§) and four stars (※for the Aronofsky acolyte§). I myself had been an agnostic since Aronofsky＊s previous, .Anyway, Rex Reed of the New York Observer got right off the fence. ※,§ he said, concluding: ※I hesitate to label it the ＆Worst movie of the year＊ when ＆Worst movie of the century＊ fits it even better.§ It has now received an , which hands out survey cards to movie audiences and collates the results from A to F. The grades have a good record in predicting box office. F for fail is very rare. Films that have got this market research badge of shame/pride include , William Friedkin＊s horror film , and Andrew Dominik＊s So it＊s official: Mother!is what some pundits call a Marmite film and opinions sharply divide between those who believe the Marmite analogy is a helpful metaphor and those who think it＊s a bland cliche, and I＊m with the latter. I have in the past written very enthusiastic reviews of films that have gone against the derision consensus. After my rave for Nicolas Winding Refn＊s widely panned and misunderstood , one pundit sweetly told me that a different viewpoint made things interesting, to which I remember sweetly replying that, yes, it would be very boring if everybodygot it wrong.But what seems to be the case with  is that it＊s not really a matter of critics disagreeing among themselves but the critics disagreeing radically with the audiences. So how could this extreme disconnect have happened? In situations like this, some might say that the CinemaScore audiences are rejecting pretentiousness, like the little boy in the fable, telling the emperor: ※Put some clothes on, puh-leez.§ But it＊s more about casting, marketing and storytelling.Fans of megastar Lawrence have come to expect something more mainstream, more Hollywood, more reassuring. . But she never had to deal with anything like the stuff that happens in Mother! If the film had been marketed lower on the radar, motoring along as a Euro-style shocker, keeping Bardem in his role but maybe recasting the female lead with someone like  or Imogen Poots, the fanbase reaction and exit word-of-mouth wouldn＊t have been as problematic. But the chemistry might have been all wrong between the leads, and indeed between the director and his female lead, and the film might not have been so electrifyingly good.In my review, I suggested the three films that Mother! has leaned on are Luis Bu?uel＊s , Roman Polanski＊s  and Lars von Trier＊s : it offers surrealism, horror, arthouse provocation. Those who don＊t like Mother! are those who don＊t get or don＊t like the third element, the deadpan black comedy it offers in the von Trier vein. But it＊s also the loopy unquantifiable mix. There is no obvious genre for Mother!, which makes it very difficult to market. ※Horror thriller§ doesn＊t really cover it, and straight horror fans would be disappointed because it doesn＊t conform.Then there＊s storytelling. Basically, cineplex audiences don＊t like surprises, and the whole point of this film is to up the ante again and again in a series of freaky quantum leaps in the third act. As a critic, I sometimes get into trouble for spoilerism, but really most movie trailers are pure spoiler: the customers have to be reassured that they know what they＊re getting. Even horror trailers give you a taste of the jump scare. Yet for obvious reasons, the trailer for Mother! doesn＊t want to give away the freaky crescendo. So audiences are shocked and upset in ways they didn＊t sign up for. Some unspoken, unacknowledged consumer contract has been violated.Something similar happened when some audiences for Michael Haneke＊s arthouse stalker nightmare  (2005) declared themselves to be discontent, because the trailer had led them to expect a conventional thriller. And of course a lot of it is compartmentalisation and blandness. Rosemary＊s Baby was and is shocking, but I suspect that in the 70s, mainstream audiences were not so balkanised, not so hemmed into genre and simply not so conservative. Movie customers could, at least provisionally, accept the violent or scary or challenging film that happened to be playing that week at your town＊s single-screen theatre.

There is , which did indeed deserve a dunce＊s cap of some kind. There is Richard Kelly＊s puzzler , which was flawed, but not utterly terrible. But Killing Them Softly was a very good drama-thriller. And Soderbergh＊s version of Solaris by Andrei Tarkovsky, despite being looked at askance by some critics who thought he had no business taking on such a revered classic, was actually a very interesting, intelligent and worthwhile film. But there again, it＊s a marketing mismatch. Audiences were sold a sci-fi with George Clooney and were baffled by what seemed to be a lugubrious and elusive tone.Great films that initially suffered derision and box-office disaster are a standard part of cinema myth. There is, for example, Charles Laughton＊s , which performed badly on first release and is now hailed as a classic. But there are plenty of films that flopped at first and turned out years later to be ＃ terrible.

"＊m not sure whether to review Micky Flanagan＊s comedy or weigh it. The  is doing 12 nights at the O2 Arena. He is the country＊s most popular comic and, by some measures, its most popular entertainer full stop. At one point in tonight＊s show, random cheering breaks out at the back of the O2 auditorium and Flanagan jokes that Michael McIntyre or Peter Kay must have set up a rival gig in the crowd. When you can joke, from a position of strength, that the best-loved comedians of this millennium are busking to pockets of your audience 每 well, you＊re a long way from Billingsgate fish market, where the young Micky once plied the family trade. Class identity, of course, is part of Flanagan＊s gargantuan draw. Not because he＊s an uncomplicatedly old-school, working-class comic, which isn＊t 每 or hasn＊t always been 每 the case. As  documented, Flanagan is something of a class chameleon, an ex-window cleaner turned university graduate, an Eastender now resident in East Dulwich, as apt to be found dissecting his new-found middle class habits as peddling the traditional values with which he grew up. That＊s slightly less the case with his new show An＊ Another Fing, which 每 as its title suggests 每 lays on the cockney shtick pretty fick. But Flanagan on stage is always more than a cheeky-chappy caricature. Yes, there＊s plenty of nostalgia here for the meat-and-potatoes verities of his youth, but it never curdles 每 as, in the hands of other comics, it can do 每 into neophobia. He jokes frequently about modernity 每 new men, their grooming and preening; millennials and their earnestness. But it＊s poking fun, not mockery; Flanagan never implies that his generation (or class) got things any more right than the ones that followed. This good-naturedness, this absence of anxiety or meanness of spirit, is surely key to Flanagan＊s wide appeal. Exhibit A: how he deals with the issue that besets any successful comic who bases their act on unpretentious Everyman appeal. ※I＊m fucking loaded!,§ he says by way of an opener: ※Shocking, it is!§ I＊ve seen other standups hamstrung by the difficulty of staying relatable while experiencing life-changing fame and fortune. Not so Flanagan, who defuses it with chutzpah and infectious self-irony. ※For the next couple of hours, you＊ve got to imagine I＊m just like you§ 每 pause for a laugh 每 ※but with money§. He makes it easy: the personality he presents on stage 每 well-meaning but workshy; shoots his mouth off, but a bit of a softy 每 is one with which many will readily identify. There are celebrity anecdotes here but (unlike, say, in ) not the remotest sense that Flanagan has gone native among the great and good. Soon enough, we＊re back with Flanagan in the family home, where his dog plots to usurp his wife from the marital bed and Micky screws up the courage to announce he＊s taking a year off work. That sabbatical supplies what passes for the show＊s subject, as our host disappears off the professional radar for 12 months. We＊re led to expect eye-catching stories from the front line of idleness. But what we get isn＊t much different from what we＊re used to, as Flanagan haunts local boozers, watches too much daytime TV and goes on holiday with his ageing dad. That latter anecdote, which closes the show, is a cracker, as fiftysomething Flanagan feels irresistible again (posing by the pool, dreaming himself Poldark) in the company of fellow Saga holidaymakers. ※Look at him using the stairs,§ he imagines the ladies drooling: ※Sexy bastard!§ Back in the real world, Flanagan＊s love life is altogether less dashing, as he pitches up at the newsagent to buy his wife a ※forgot-to-get-a-card card§ and fantasises about a morning after with Mary Berry. Research for his recent Sky show supplies failsafe material, meanwhile, on ※pegging§ 每 the new sexual frontier, apparently, for vengeful women and their nervous partners. Only occasionally does this drift into cliche or generalisation, as with the gag about women loving gift cards, or the deployment of hummus and quinoa as middle-class identifiers. More often, it feels as if Flanagan has weeded out lazy thinking, just as 每 with a routine  that make (poor) people look ※thick§ 每 he condemns it in others. I won＊t pretend to you that this is adventurous comedy. But Flanagan is smart, generous spirited, at ease with his own ridiculousness and purveys a democratic brand of humour the vast popularity of which it＊s impossible to begrudge.

"are is it that composers of instrumental music can get the time of day from the general public, but Hans Zimmer is a bona fide rockstar. His summer tour played to zealous fans throughout Europe and North America at venues such as Wembley Arena, Radio City Music Hall in New York, and a rousing set at Coachella. The Supermarine cue from his Dunkirk score has a ready spot on my iPhone＊s playlist and, although the 60-year-old Frankfurt native is a phenomenon deserving our respect, but maybe it＊s time to reel it in a little.The latest news is that Icelandic composer J車hann J車hannson has been  and Zimmer and It composer Benjamin Wallfisch brought in to finish the project. (Originally he was set to be providing additional material.) After a summer of tense, throbbing Zimmermusik, I＊m  beginning to get irked at the man who has altered what  these days.To be fair, Zimmermusik (which is fun to say, especially since you can listen to it in your ), doesn＊t all sound the same. Compare the wall of pounding, resonant percussion heard in Man of Steel to the peppy melodic line from Driving Miss Daisy. (Yes, that catchy, synthesized clarinet ditty was early Zimmermusik.) But in recent years the propulsive, repetitive themes that seem to already be playing before you notice them, which then bleed into the next scenes, are everywhere at the movies.There＊s a reason for this, and some of it is just human nature. When editors are putting a scene together they often use what is called a temp track: temporary music to help the picture flow until the new, original music is ready. Sometimes the temp tracks stick. (Ask Alex North, who was commissioned to write something for 2001: A Space Odyssey only to have Stanley Kubrick say: ※You know, Richard Strauss, Aram Khachaturian and Johann Strauss actually work quite well, thanks.§) One of the most common temp tracks is  from Zimmer＊s score to Terrence Malick＊s The Thin Red Line.Film industry people sometimes call this The Forbidden Cue because once it is in, producers will want it recreated. (Even Zimmer has had to tell his staff not to put it in .) With its ticking sound, emergence from quiet to loud and rising pitch that never quite reaches resolution, it＊s something that just works with almost anything dramatic.So many films try to ape this (perhaps from the inertia of its use in temps) that it is increasingly difficult to tell the acolytes from the original. Mad Max: Fury Road＊s score was composed by Junkie XL and Wonder Woman＊s score was composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams, but listen to the cues  and  from each one respectively and tell me they don＊t sound yanked directly from one of the Dark Knight soundtracks.Zimmer is fond of incorporating something called a  in his scores. It is like an aural version of an MC Escher illustration. At first you think a theme is rising in pitch, but because of multiple lines varying in volume, it just keeps repeating itself. Hollywood producers, never known to shy from flogging a dead horse, are currently so taken with Hans Zimmer that the contracts keep flying in with the regularity of .What＊s particularly galling in the  case is that this sort of bombast has nothing to do with Ridley Scott＊s 1982 film, save for the closing credits. Even worse, that film＊s composer, Vangelis, is still alive and kicking. His 2016 album Rosetta has all of the electro-noir that created the perfect mood 35 years ago. It＊s not that Zimmer can＊t still be brilliant (take a second look/listen at Interstellar; I doubt any of his copycats could come close) it＊s just that maybe it＊s OK to let someone else have a turn from time to time?

"Part of a huge fatberg blocking a 250 metre stretch of London＊s sewer network could go on display to the public after the Museum of  expressed an interest in obtaining a section of the 130 tonne mass of waste and fat.The museum, which is , contacted Thames Water about acquiring a section of the congealed block of wet wipes, nappies, fat and oil for their general collection following its discovery in a Victorian sewer in Whitechapel, east London. Engineers for Thames Water are using shovels and high-powered jets to remove the fatberg, which was found during a routine inspection earlier this month, and is one of the largest ever found in London＊s sewer network. Alex Werner, lead curator for the new museum at the Museum of London, told the Guardian the fatberg ※calls to attention the way we live our lives in a modern city§, and said the museum had been interested in acquiring a fatberg after similar discoveries in Kingston and Leicester Square.He said: ※It speaks to the breakdown in London＊s infrastructure as we transition between periods. The sewer dates back to the 19th century, and is struggling to cope with the number of high-rise developments and population increases. In 50 years＊ time, maybe it will be looked on as a historic artefact, because we＊ll have solved this problem.§ He continued: ※Our challenge is to think of a way to make it presentable to the public. We need to work out a way we can store it and display it. It＊s a bit like a specimen. We need to find a kind of fluid to maintain it for a long time. We have a bit of research yet to do.§ The Museum of London curator visited the site of the fatberg in east London on Wednesday and although he did not enter the sewer, he said hiding the fatberg＊s smell would be a challenge.※It＊s a horrid smell 每 fairly pungent. It＊s the smell you＊d expect from the sewer. I＊m back in my office now and I can still smell it around my nose.§He added: ※Thames Water have a really difficult challenge. It＊s a bit of a race against time to get rid of the blockage. All the surrounding basements in the area in Whitechapel could flood with sewage.§Sharon Ament, director at the Museum of London, said: ※Our year-long season, City Now City Future, explores what the future holds for people living in urban environments. It is important for the Museum of London to display genuine curiosities from past and present London. ※If we are able to acquire the fatberg for our collection I hope it would raise questions about how we live today and also inspire our visitors to consider solutions to the problems of growing metropolises. This could be one of the most extraordinary objects in any museum collection in London.§Thames Water says it spends around ?1m every month clearing blockages from its sewers in London and the Thames Valley 每 an average of three fat-related blockages every hour.Earlier this year, the company announced it was exploring whether it could use recovered fatbergs for biodiesel, but said the eventual solution would have to come from the proper disposal of waste by consumers and businesses.

"ound the trumpets! Let the angels sing! This, to paraphrase George Frideric Handel, is what  of 600 million at the wedding of Diana Spencer to the Prince of Wales. It＊s also pretty much what she  this morning. ※There＊s nothing more precious,§ she said, ※than hearing that glorious new-sounding bud§ of a young voice ※come to fruition as a flower§. When she teaches young singers, she said, and hears their ※beautiful voices§, she doesn＊t want to put her voice next to theirs. That, she said calmly, was why she would never sing again.By coincidence, I＊ve spent this week catching up on emails while listening to Dame Kiri sing Puccini and Verdi and Offenbach and Wagner and the Mozart opera 每 The Magic Flute 每 that first made her name. I don＊t know how you describe a voice like that. Like the finest shiraz you＊ve ever tasted? Like the richest, darkest chocolate mousse? Or perhaps, since we＊re all now talking gender fluidity, like the voice of God?It seems like a terrible loss to the world, but Kiri Te Kanawa is 73. The voice she built, through years of study and practice, has endured in a way so many people＊s talents don＊t. The average footballer, for example, has to retire at 35. So does the average dancer. Professional athletes generally last until around 33. And they＊re the lucky ones. Gymnasts rarely make it beyond their early 20s. That＊s also the time when most female models are dropped. According to some recent studies, adulthood now starts at 25. Some of these people, in other words, are retiring before they have even grown up.We don＊t usually think all that much about what happens when those people winning medals or matches, or plastered over magazines, are forced to leave that glory behind. Some of them are fine. David Beckham seems to have managed to . And he looks pretty cheerful in his posts to his 40 million Instagram followers, unlike his (also very talented) wife. Some former athletes, dancers and models build new careers, or businesses, or lives. But quite a few do not.When you＊ve spent most of your waking hours focusing on one thing, and?getting really good at that one thing, and being recognised and rewarded for doing that one thing, it isn＊t at all easy to know how to cope when that one thing stops. It gives you an identity. It gives you a sense of purpose. Oh, and it pays the bills. Two out of every five professional footballers are declared bankrupt . Many former athletes experience depression. Paul Gascoigne, Frank Bruno, Kelly Holmes and Andrew Flintoff have all talked about their struggles with mental health. And who wouldn＊t feel that, after double gold, the only way is down?Most of us don＊t shine in the way these people have shone. We haven＊t spent our teenage years getting up before dawn to plough up and down a pool or race around a track. We haven＊t learned to fill a vast hall with a trembling vibrato voice. But most of us have learned how to do something. We do that thing in our jobs. We＊re not stars, we＊re not CEOs, but we do our jobs pretty well. And when we lose that job, it hurts.Take it from someone who has lost a job: it really, really hurts. Employment in this country may be at near-record levels, but we are living through a revolution and some industries are being hit?more than most. Journalists are being ※disrupted§. Photographers and musicians are too. ※Disruption§ sounds great to the titans of Silicon Valley, but not quite so good to those who suddenly find themselves wondering how the hell to pay the rent.

"hy are there so many bad remakes of good movies? It＊s a fair enough question. When dealing with a text that has already proven itself functional, it takes an active effort to make it worse. The path of least resistance would lead somewhere agreeable if not extraordinary, perhaps not matching the given source＊s greatness but at least managing a respectable measure of success.Merely by achieving and then exceeding base competence, Michael Noer＊s handsome new rendition of  (itself an adaptation of one unusually determined French prisoner＊s 1969 memoir) puts the innumerable lifeless resuscitations of memorable properties currently clogging multiplexes on notice. Noer makes not bungling excellent material look like a relatively simple task: hire some good actors, make it look appealing, stick to what worked with the original, and you should be good to go, right? While his final product may be an imitation of the Dalton Trumbo-scripted genuine article, it＊s not an especially pale one. Noer＊s turned out a fine film in its own right, and political developments in the decades since the last adaptation have even lent the script a newfound significance. The story may not have changed, but the world into which it＊s getting released sure has.Multilingual readers have likely already identified the film＊s title as the French word for ※butterfly§, a symbol of freedom and hope to the Parisian jailbird who also claims the word as his nickname. Papi (Charlie Hunnam, all skin and muscle and bared teeth), as he＊s known to his buddies, comes into the film hot off a big safe-cracking score, and one wrong move later, he＊s framed for murder and shipped off to a remote penal colony in French Guiana. He doesn＊t intend on sticking around for too long, however, and promptly allies himself with odd bird Louis Dega (a vaguely narcotized Rami Malek). An accomplished forger, the wealthy Dega has smuggled a wad of bills into the prison through what we＊ll call intimate means, and Papi offers his protection for enough cash to bribe his way through a daring escape. The game is set.What follows is a solidly acted and attractively shot prison-break narrative, freighted with all the tragedy and triumph that the mini-genre can muster. Papi is stubborn, a virtue that energizes him on his long and weary path to salvation. The sadistic warden of the prison facility takes it upon himself to break Papi, and while his upper lip definitely un-stiffens after a few horrifying years spent in solitary confinement, he defiantly refuses to be cowed. He＊s locked in a brutalizing game where freedom is constantly yanked away from him every time he begins to catch his breath. It＊s frustrating, which is a good thing in this instance 每 the torturous closeness of liberation makes the audience share in Papi＊s plight.Buoying his spirits is his flowering friendship with Dega, an eccentric thoroughly unfit for the exacting conditions of their environment. Their bond forms slowly, vulcanized by mutual self-sacrifice in high stakes moments. While Hunnam sure ain＊t Steve McQueen, and Malek really, really ain＊t Dustin Hoffman, the pair take care not to overplay their sentimental hand, allowing a camaraderie to take shape while both men keep one another at a distinctly macho distance. To a modern crowd, the film doubles as a . The warden only gets away with the cruelest and most unusual abuses of fundamental dignity through a total lack of oversight due to their remote location. The slave labor that prisoners are forced to perform, the routine humiliations, and the recreational violence feel a bit more pointed in our era of heightened consciousness about the insidious prison-industrial complex. Any criticisms are far from searing, but it＊s an engaging side concern nonetheless.The film＊s merits (which, sadly, do not include originality) are self-evident. Hunnam and Malek both hold up their end of the deal. Noer, for his part, meets them halfway by conjuring golden-hued beauty for the jungle surroundings and a due griminess for the danker chambers of their holding compound. He doesn＊t overcomplicate things for himself, keeping the clunky dialogue to a minimum and focusing on the guiding light of Papi＊s indomitable willpower. 																																											"
"he Bank of England was founded in July 1694 in Mercers＊ Hall, with ?1.2m raised in subscriptions from a group of gentlemen. A century and a half later, this is how the American writer Henry Adams described London, the capital of the most powerful nation on Earth: ※Heavy, clumsy, arrogant, purse-proud, but not cheap; insular but large; barely tolerant of an outside world, and absolutely self-confident.§ He added: ※Everyone seemed insolent and the most insolent structures in the world were the Royal Exchange and the .§Fifty years after this, in 1901, a similar insight is provided by a Spanish philosopher, George Santayana, who was invited by a friend for dinner at the Bank. The dining room, he wrote, had a ※dingy Dickensian look of solidity grown old-fashioned, a bit shabby§. He noted the ※superannuated butler§ and a meal consisting of mock-turtle soup, boiled halibut, roast mutton, gooseberry tart, anchovies on toast and a bottle of claret and a bottle of port.Details such as these provide the foundation for David Kynaston＊s commanding history of the Bank of England. This is the ultimate account of the mother of British establishment institutions, replete with detail, meticulously researched, based on a series of interviews with key players and historians, alongside primary source material research, all logged in the copious notes section at the end.From the South Sea Bubble to the Napoleonic wars via the two world wars, the author paints a picture of an organisation that sought, wherever possible, to insulate itself from the outside world. Only when turbulence threatens its own walls does it take up cudgels, such as in 1780, during the anti-Catholic Gordon riots or in 1848, the year of revolutions across Europe. Kynaston describes the scene: ※The Bank took no chances. On Friday, 7 April, with the great Chartist demonstration due to take place at Kennington Common on the 10th, all able-bodied members of staff were sworn in as special constables.§For all the pomposity, the Bank was rarely sure of its place in the hierarchy. Over its first century, the 18th century, it was but one of many establishments that sought to issue and preside over the distribution of bank notes. As the British empire was gaining ascendancy, the Bank was sometimes seen as rapacious and gauche. David Ricardo wrote to John Stuart Mill in 1815: ※I think the Bank an unnecessary establishment, getting rich by those profits which fairly belong to the public.§One of the great strengths of this 896-page, one-volume tome is the acute portrayal of each and every relationship between Bank governor and prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer. The arguments revolved around issues similar to today 每 liquidity, money supply, growth and borrowing.Yet no matter what era, economic circumstance or political party, that relationship depended on the personalities of the three and more often than not it was infused with tension. William Gladstone, for one, could not abide the Bank＊s elite. He repeatedly sent them letters on the management of the national debt, requiring them to cut back on the Bank＊s internal remuneration. In other words, they were paying themselves too much. Where have we heard that before?Sometimes, the Bank listened to its political masters; sometimes, it ignored them, convinced it was impervious to pressure. No matter how long they survived, each governor ultimately depended on the political relationship. One, in the modern era, was Gordon Richardson. His last day coincided with Margaret Thatcher＊s first in office. She, like many prime ministers, wanted a new broom. He was, the author notes, ※the last of the governors to be treated 每 and, in his case, sometimes to demand to be treated 每 as akin to an eastern potentate§.What sticks out about this last phrase is its rarity. For reasons I cannot fathom, Kynaston chooses to denude this book of emotion and opinion. For sure it is a reference book, an authorised history, and some in the financial world will pore over the ※who said what to whom§ and the micro-detail of a particular chief cashier. But for the general audience, this is a bloodless read, inexplicably so, from a master socioeconomic craftsman. Each war, each trend, is reduced to a sentence of two. Instead they could have been woven into the narrative with much greater colour and context without diluting the core focus.By the mid 1990s, as globalisation takes hold and Davos Man reigns supreme, the ※cult of the central bank was gathering global momentum§. The stunning surprise of the first week of New Labour 每 granting independence to the Bank 每 is compellingly recalled. The book ends with the lessons of the financial crash, the recklessness and avarice of the bankers and the weakness of the Bank and the regulator, the FSA. These are my words, not the author＊s. He monitors all the detail, but barely hazards a comment, except to say by way of conclusion: ※For all our sakes, it is important that central bankers are seen neither as heroes nor villains.§I close the book, scratching my head.

"For Hollywood, summer has been a disaster movie. US ticket sales are the lowest in decades, the landscape is strewn with fatigued franchises and , and most studios don＊t have two blockbusters to rub together. Which is unfortunate because blockbusters are now the only game in town. Studios have steadily been painting themselves into a corner by releasing fewer, more expensive movies at the expense of mid-range drama, which has pretty much defected to television.Concurrent with this trend has been . Effects movies demand state-of-the-art projection and sound, 3D, , , all of which come at a premium. A night at the cinema is now a big investment, especially in the UK, which has some of the highest prices in the world. (The UK average in 2016 was ?7.41, but in a decent London cinema you＊re looking at over ?20). One problem is that the ticket price is the same whatever the movie. Punters want to get their money＊s worth, so you can hardly blame them for choosing the big-budget popcorn splurge on Screen 1 over the thoughtful indie on Screen 12. It＊s not a level playing field; more like a Premier League football team competing against the local minnows.So here＊s a suggestion: a two-tier cinema system. Your blockbusters in one league, and a separate circuit for lower-budget movies, with much cheaper tickets. For a long time, this was how movies operated. The term  now applies to anything vaguely low-budget and/or trashy, but from about the 1930s to the 1960s, B-movies  that second tier: cheaper, shorter films that often played before the ※A§ feature. A-movies were the prestige star vehicles; B-movies were often lowbrow, formulaic genre fare: horrors, sci-fi, action movies, often part of a series 每 in other words, the stuff of modern-day blockbusters.Now it＊s serious dramas that are the B-movies, pushed to the margins along with what we used to call ※arthouse§ movies: challenging, non-mainstream, maybe foreign movies. These are cinema＊s endangered species. So why not put them all in a separate type of cinema and charge half the price? It would be a cheaper night out for punters and a proving ground for new talent. Many directors and actors cut their teeth in B-movies, from John Wayne to Clint Eastwood, Val Lewton to , not forgetting , which pumped new blood into Hollywood the last time it needed a transfusion (Jack Nicholson, Coppola, Scorsese, , even James Cameron). It could do it again.																																											"
"In an ideal world there would be a commemorative plaque above the entrance of Liverpool＊s Echo arena. ※Here ended Girls Aloud, the last great girl band§ it would say. On 20 March 2013 Nadine Coyle 每 one fifth of the genre-bending, pop-reshaping rabble 每 was getting ready for the final night of the band＊s reunion tour. ※I was in hair and makeup,§ she explains in a north London restaurant, ※going through my nightly ritual.§ Rather than taking delivery of a good-luck bouquet, Coyle received some news via the band＊s PR and manager 每 . Not the more fashionable ※hiatus§, which they＊d already done in 2009, but a proper split. With the band working to majority rule, there was nothing she could do.※It was shocking. We＊d signed a new deal and recorded what was basically another new album.§ Confused, she marched into the venue＊s green room, ignoring video directors there to record the tour for posterity (a DVD), and confronted recent Celebrity  winner, and closest ally in the band, . ※I said, ＆Do you want to break up the band as well?＊ and she was like, ＆Oh fuck it, I can＊t be arsed with it, I fucking hate everybody.＊ That last show, all emotion was switched off as far as I was concerned, with any of them.§Further ignominy followed: it had been decided the split announcement would be made that same night. . ※A tweet?!§ Coyle roars in her thick Derry accent. ※I saw the draft and just said, ＆Remove my name from that.＊ We＊d been saying since the start we were properly back.§ In the end the tweet went out as the stage was being dismantled. After an end-of-tour party that lasted until the next morning (※[the band] wasn＊t drinking together, but we were in the same room§), Coyle posted her own tweet: ※You should know by now I had no part in any of this split business. I couldn＊t stop them. I had the best time & want to keep going.§ Aside from Harding, she＊s not spoken to the rest of the band since.Fifteen years after they formed via ITV＊s Popstars: The Rivals, and four years since the split, Coyle has reunited with Girls Aloud＊s unofficial sixth member, Howard Hughes-esque production genius Brian Higgins and his coterie of pop mavericks, AKA , for new single Go to Work. Alongside lyricist Miranda Cooper, Higgins masterminded 20 of their UK Top 10 singles, including ,  and , shredding the pop rulebook, spray-painting it neon and then painstakingly suturing it all back together to create a Frankenstein＊s monster-pop that made everything else 每 with its boring verse-chorus-verse structure 每 look decidedly pedestrian.※The desire to make very startling, very aggressive pop was just bursting out,§ Higgins tells me on the phone. ※The pop sound of the day was this Swedish R&B-lite sound which I loathed. I wanted to do something spectacular.§ That spectacular streak would include 22 singles and five albums in five years, a workload that inevitably led to the break in 2009. ※One of the heads from our label came to a London show [on that year＊s Out of Control tour],§ Coyle remembers, ※and none of the girls were really speaking to each other, and he said, ＆When you have 20,000 people out the front and no one wants to be here, that＊s the time to take a break.＊§Despite accusations in 2014 from Cheryl Cole that the hiatus was caused by Coyle＊s search for a solo record deal, she＊s adamant she initially just wanted a break. ※Cheryl had already got her deal, she was ready to go with her solo stuff. I had nothing set up for myself.§Even before the reunion was announced at a press conference in late 2012 problems appeared. Despite Xenomania creating all their singles, the band, minus Coyle, had decided their comeback song wasn＊t going to be glitter-bomb banger Something New but the limp, non-Xenomania ballad  (a No 97 smash when it was eventually released). ※I was in Disneyland and I was told that was the song they were going with and so I said I couldn＊t do the reunion,§ she says. ※＆Beautiful ＊cause you love me＊? We＊re beautiful anyway! But then I got a call back saying it was now Something New and I was like, ＆OK, let＊s do it.＊§ For Higgins that initial decision not to continue their mutual legacy still hurts. ※It＊s very difficult to talk about it in a certain sense 每 there were a lot of emotions.§Something New-gate aside, Coyle＊s decision-making hasn＊t always been so finely tuned. ※I tend to go with the flow and that flow can end up in great places or not so great places,§ she laughs. It＊s a trait that got her involved with supermarket chain Tesco which, in an unprecedented move for a non-heritage act, exclusively released her . ※It was a really stressful time,§ she says. Despite music becoming more accessible, Tesco didn＊t want the album available on iTunes, which would have been fine had the CDs been stocked in all of their shops.※They had to do online maps for fans trying to find it! I was like, ＆What do you want me to do, drive a truck around and hand them out to people?＊§ Without the infrastructure of a major label, Coyle took matters into her own hands, hiring her best friend as her assistant. ※She＊d just graduated from university so I thought, ＆Great, she can help.＊ She was a wreck at the end ＃ I was a wreck at the end.§ After all that, the album peaked at No 47.Shortly afterwards, having already moved to LA while still in the band, she bought and ran a restaurant in Orange County called Nadine＊s Irish Mist. Then, in 2011, during a nine-month stint in New York, she recorded a single, , even rebranding as Nadine 2.0. ※Did that song really come out?§ she asks. ※It did, didn＊t it? I may have been drunk a lot around that time.§Other impulsive flights of fancy included a duet with Westlife＊s Shane Filan; a stint in professional leg-wiggler  extravaganza; and, in late 2009, some gardening as part of a world record attempt for the most trees planted in one site in an hour (26,422, FYI). Even her decision to return to a pop landscape that has replaced the fizzing pizazz of those Girls Aloud curios with slower tempos and Spotify algorithms was more of a whim at first. ※Late 2015, I got into a taxi to meet a friend in Primrose Hill and the radio was playing song after amazing song,§ she explains. ※I thought, ＆Who do I know that does songs like this?＊ So I texted Brian.§ However, Higgins, and Xenomania, hadn＊t been making amazing songs since 2012, the year they created their last UK Top 10 single for X Factor also-ran Amelia Lily.  ※For five years of [Xenomania＊s] 21 years we＊ve been in the wilderness, just trying to work out in what way we could be amazing again,§ Higgins says. While on paper Coyle＊s flighty, Housewives of Derry persona seems at odds with Higgins＊s Rain Man focus, there are similarities, the reunion representing a return to her comfort zone. ※When I was 13 I＊d record myself on my karaoke machine and if I didn＊t like it I＊d record it again. I＊d do that for hours, making sure each line sounded just right.§ For Higgins, you sense this is about giving Coyle 每 ※a world-class vocalist§ 每 a proper stab at a solo career.※Nadine＊s going to have her go and that means a lot to me 每 that there are no regrets,§ he says. Ask them both what their expectations are for Go to Work and the answer is similar. ※I have none,§ Coyle says, which feels like something she shouldn＊t say too loudly in the corridors of her new label, Virgin. ※I＊m measuring success in different ways now,§ says Higgins, aware that those chart-dominating Xenomania days are behind him. ※It＊s a great peace of mind for me what＊s happening with Nadine.§ Whether Go to Work represents a kind of closure or the start of 每 wait for it 每 something new, Coyle＊s joy at being back is palpable. ※I＊m so excited,§ she confirms. ※I could cry when I think about how good it＊s all been.§ The day before our chat a speculative news story emerges suggesting Sarah Harding＊s CBB performance has nixed a possible  reunion. ※It hasn＊t been discussed, no,§ she replies, before spotting a magpie out of the window and offering a little salute. ※One for sorrow,§ she says. Would you ever get back together? ※To be truthful, I didn＊t want to break up in the first place. So I would have been sitting here with the other four. I was happy to continue.§																																											"
"This is the second summer my partner and I, and several friends, attended . We took in all sorts musically, from brass bands to techno. Being a bit of an old reggae fan my personal highlights included the awesome Toots and the Maytals, U Roy and Big Youth, as well as headliners and Two Tone legends the Specials. We also explored the nooks, crannies, alleyways, streets and squares in the various districts, which were populated with costumed actors and actresses; some of the structures, such as the Bang Hai Towers in the downtown area, were just stunning. Another highlight was the procession on the Sunday led by samba percussion group Batala and a cyberpunk truck. It was varied, stimulating and we will definitely be returning. The magnificent Florence & the Machine headlined this festival for employees and members of the workspace company , along with Two Door Cinema Club and Galantis 每 and camping, eating, meeting, playing and dancing in the great outdoors. DJ EZ was also on top form. The roller disco was good fun, but there were definitely some bruised legs on Monday morning. It was via taking photos at the Edinburgh fringe that I got back into photography, street photography specifically, having left it behind for nearly a decade. I have heard actors, comedians, performers generally say that the fringe is a great training ground for them, and it has been for me too. There are so many colours, strange characters and interesting moments all around you. This year I took my nine-year-old daughter to take pictures with me and she really enjoyed it, but did complain about the weight of the camera after a while. The highlight this year was Japanese dance duo RedRibbon. I usually only get to see street performers on the Royal Mile, and they were a stand out, with lots of dramatic movement and style. The is like the starting gun for the whole festival season in Edinburgh. The procession, which begins at the top of the Mound and winds its way down to Princes Street and on into the gardens, is very colourful and energetic. It＊s great that Princes Street is closed off while the parade goes by, packed full of dancers, painted bodies and the odd Chinese dragon or two. It＊s like a suspension of normal reality, like the fringe two weeks later, and always great fun. I go to  every June. It＊s held right in the city centre, and with the building behind being one big curve, the acoustics are amazing. I photograph the event for local media, so usually end up in the pit with all the other photographers. The Manic Street Preachers were amazing, but my favourite act this year was Bonobo. I had the new album on loop in the car and his sound is so infectious and soulful. This was only our second year at  and following 2016＊s mudbath this was a sunny, dry, delightfully relaxed experience. As a teacher I can＊t go until Friday after school is finished, and I also need to leave on Sunday to be ready for Monday morning. But it truly felt like entering a completely unique bubble for 48 hours. And that was perfectly summed up by Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips. I actually prefer this festival to the big Isle of Wight festival. Maybe it＊s because I prefer the music 每 world and folk 每 and plenty of interesting original acts that I haven＊t seen. It＊s also so uncrowded and laid back, with no queuing for anything. Of all the festivals I＊ve been to,  is up there with  and the 1970 Isle of Wight festival. I go with the group I play with 每 the Brighstone Barnacles. We do about 30 gigs a year locally and we were invited to play the woodland stage at Rhythmtree. We get a very friendly audience, and it was a thrill last year to have one of my heroes, Robyn Hitchcock, watch us, have a chat and later dedicate one of his songs to us. Highlights this year included the London African Gospel Choir performing Graceland. On occasions there was a lack of atmosphere, with great artists trying to whip up a sparse crowd basking in the sunshine, but then that gave this little girl the room to stand at the front playing her guitar! I shoot for a photography agency and have been working at festivals for about six years. I＊ve been to Glastonbury 11 times, but this was the first one I got to shoot. I always enjoy catching up with other photographers who I＊ve seen at previous shows and festivals.Getting to see the Killers do a secret set at Glastonbury was a personal highlight. After seeing and photographing Jain at the Troubadour in Los Angeles I was really excited to photograph her live, and Nadia Rose is also definitely a name to look out for. She really got the crowd going. This is a  new summer festival, and I＊ve been lucky enough to go to it since it started. I gets bigger and better every year, they have a knack of getting great bands to sign up for it. This year my favourites were the Charlatans and EMF. I＊m hoping they ask Arrested Development to join the line up next year, but one thing is for sure 每 I＊ll be back. My children are now 28, 20 and 16, and this was our eighth year of all going to . It＊s only half an hour away from where we live, but we would travel many more miles to go there 每 it＊s an amazing, varied experience, and the way it＊s laid out is very beautiful. It＊s very safe and the organisers do a fantastic job. Over the years we＊ve seen so many memorable acts. This year, for me, the highlight was seeing Fatboy Slim 每 the children, of course, had completely different ones. There is a real sense of community and no divide between ages; people just come together and have fun. No one even laughed at me dancing in the mosh pit with a crowd of teenagers. I＊ve been going to Glastonbury since 1997. The only two I＊ve missed in that time were when I was expecting my children. For the past few years I＊ve also worked there for the charity Festival Medical Services, which has been amazing. I usually go with my husband, and our children who are now three and five also come along. It＊s a bit challenging at times, and you don＊t get to see as many bands as you once did, but they love it as much as we do.The highlights this year were seeing Radiohead 20 years on, as they were headliners at our first Glastonbury; true to Radiohead fashion they played what they wanted to play, but some anthems at the end made the set. Also watching the Foo Fighters, who I don＊t profess to know many tunes of, was just awesome. Glastonbury never fails. We＊ll be ready for it again in 2019! 																																											"
"When a filmmaker sets out adapting a stage play, their first order of business is usually divorcing the text from its intrinsic play-ness. ＊s new treatment of RC Sherriff＊s celebrated first world war drama Journey＊s End goes to great lengths to obscure the fact that the action was almost entirely constrained to a dimly lit dugout shelter, visualising the trenches and battlefield originally left offstage. The great pathos of Sherriff＊s 1928 work unspools in this pressure chamber of near-death anxiety, as soldiers drink and fight and sullenly sit in silence while waiting for the heat of battle to come to them. The trouble is that during the considerable amount of time spent in that cramped subterranean hideaway, the audience can feel Dibb fidgeting to get out so he can do and show more. In this respect, his behaviour mirrors that of the young troops itching for action. What makes for a good serviceman, however, doesn＊t necessarily make for a good director. Dibb is working at cross purposes with himself, trying to communicate the claustrophobia of the dugout while simultaneously escaping it at every opportunity.For the men of C Company that inhabit it, the primary setting functions as a grim limbo, a liminal space where oblivion may not be present, but is definitely imminent. An introductory title card informs us that each squadron of infantry was required to spend six days of every month on the front, and the film plays out over the course of four such days. It＊s a time of unease, and perhaps Dibb is angling to capture that restlessness through his constant diversions: dream sequences and treks through the foxholes that feel aimless aside from proudly displaying the lads＊ workmanlike efficiency. (This adaptation, the fifth cinematic rendering of Sherriff＊s play, was commissioned as part of the United Kingdom＊s WWI Centenary Commemoration. To Dibb＊s credit, he evokes the somber spirit of nationalism more vividly than, say, a bronze statue.) The chaps of C Company fulfill all the classic war-picture stock roles, though Journey＊s Endis old enough that one could probably credit it with creating those clich谷s in the first place. Our boy is Lieutenant Raleigh (Asa Butterfield, whose childlike face is a crucial asset in his performance), a wet-behind-the-ears recruit getting his first taste of combat and offering the audience a surrogate in this unfamiliar environment. Marked for tragedy from the moment he naively describes the hell of war as ※frightfully exciting,§ his innocence gets eradicated in brutal fashion, and Butterfield acts with studied terror. Captain Stanhope (, a far cry from the young Laurence Olivier who originated the role) is Raleigh＊s school chum and a picture of his dark future, shell-shocked and self-medicating with pre-noon boozing. He＊s a cauldron of painful emotions: self-loathing over his slide into profligate alcoholism, angry at Raleigh for subjecting himself to a nightmare the boy can＊t yet comprehend, and haunted by the memories of fiery annihilation from an earlier skirmish. The character dynamics are still as rich as when Sherriff first realised them, and C Company＊s supporting servicemen add a few complementary hues to this portrait of militarised despair. (As a forgetful staff cook,  brings a more accessibly civilian viewpoint to the foreign terrain of war.) And yet Dibb＊s direction doesn＊t leave the actors enough room to breathe. His camerawork is indifferent in moments of repose, and when he shifts into intensity mode, his close-ups go individual moustache hair-levels of extreme. A drab colour palette and run-of-the-military score contribute to an all-around lack of distinction, too. It＊s almost as if Dibb doesn＊t trust the script, an odd hangup to have with material so thoroughly enshrined in the British dramaturgical canon.It is to this film＊s great misfortune that it has to exist in such close proximity to , a film that tackles, if not the same war, at least the same historical milieu and key ideas 〞 the gutting effect trauma has on young men, the distinctly British propriety of stiff-upper-lipped combat 〞 far more effectively. Like Dibb, Nolan understood that the anticipation of an unseen enemy can be far more excruciating than the immediacy of a firefight. Nolan made this approach work through a confident comfort with silence and stillness, two elements of which Dibb seems fearful. As a result, Journey＊s End winds up a restless film, searching for a way out of what should be its destination. Keep calm and carry on, right past the marquee.																																											"
"The last acting part for Sam Coombes, a steelworker, was Robin Hood in the annual rugby club pantomime.Over the next two weeks he has a rather weightier role in a professional production telling the story of how he and his comrades at the Port Talbot plant in south  successfully battled a closure that threatened their livelihoods, their community and a whole way of life.※It＊s a burden but a huge privilege,§ said Coombes, who has been given unpaid leave to take part in the  (NTW) play We＊re Still Here. ※This is a chance to tell the story from our point of view. It＊s the story of our fight. It＊s not gloom and doom. There＊s a long way to go, but I do feel the fight is being won.§ At the start of last year there was a distinct possibility that the Tata steelworks, which supports an estimated 18,000 jobs, .The people of Port Talbot did not roll over. A campaign called Save Our Steel was launched and after months of protests and talks , though at the cost of cuts to pension benefits.Journalists, industry analysts and academics continue to pore over the saga and its ramifications but this production, staged in a disused dockside factory, the Byass Works, is meant to tell the story through the voices of those directly involved.Writers and researchers from the NTW and the theatre company  spent months interviewing Port Talbot people about the steel crisis and turned their stories into an energetic, vibrant, sometimes loud, punky and sweary production. ※They have got the dialogue and banter bang on. It＊s just like being in work,§ said Coombes, a 29-year-old metallurgist, who followed his father and grandfather into the steelworks and will be back there at the start of October ※unless Steven Spielberg comes calling§. Coombes said the stories of working-class heroes were not told often enough. ※What happened last year is that we all got together and said: ＆No, we＊re fighting for what is ours. Not just the steelworks but the whole community.＊§While Coombes is part of the professional cast, the show also features members of the community appearing as themselves, among them Sian James, a college worker and the wife of Chris James, a steelworker, union rep and Labour councillor.She said the title of the piece summed up the mood of the town. ※The community came together and is still together. There is still uncertainty 每 what happens in five years, what will happen if  sell. But whatever happens next, the community will be ready to fight.§Four teenagers also take starring roles. Dylan John, 15, said the last 18 months in the town had been intense. ※The crisis made us picture a future without the steelworks. That was frightening,§ he said. Dylan doesn＊t see himself taking a job at the works 每 he would rather be an actor. ※But it is crucial for the future of our town.§, a co-director of the play, said Common Wealth had been thinking about creating a piece about working-class leaders when the Port Talbot crisis blew up. ※Media, politics and art are all being colonised by the middle and upper classes. It feels like the working class is being represented terribly,§ she said. We＊re Still Here is an attempt to begin to redress the balance. Up the road from the Byass Works, at the St Paul＊s community centre, regulars have been fascinated to watch rehearsals in the function room. The centre＊s administrator, Carol Powrie, said there was much more music and movement than she expected. ※You don＊t expect steelworkers dancing. That was a lot of fun. It＊s a powerful story but I think people are still worried, still waiting for bad news. I don＊t think people are confident.§ Canon Nigel Cahill, rector of the Aberavon parish in Port Talbot, said he hoped We＊re Still Here would boost the area in the same way as the , in which the Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, who grew up in Port Talbot, acted alongside local amateurs, did six years ago.※After the last production here in 2011 there was a marked improvement in people＊s cheerfulness, hopefulness and general attitude. Partly I think it was confidence that people were taking an interest in their town.§Of course, it is true that there are those in the area who do not share the optimism and idealism of those directly involved. At the Aberafan shopping centre by a raised section of the M4, many were unaware of the production and gloomy for the long-term prospects for Port Talbot.Michael Cosker, who used to be a crane driver at the plant and now runs the Rolls Choice cafe, said he felt the workers sacrificed too much in the pension deal that kept the plant alive. ※I think the men have given away more than they should have done,§ he said. ※Pensions like that are hard to come by. I understand it but it＊s a large price to pay.※The town is surviving. Business is not too bad. The thing about Port Talbot is that they are fighters. They will fight forever for what they feel is right.§																																											"
"ames who? While 007 has been on extended annual leave as a result of Daniel Craig＊s cold feet, Taron Egerton＊s thoroughly less urbane secret agent Eggsy Unwin has managed to thoroughly outdo him, with Matthew Vaughn＊s sequel to his doubling down on the qualities that marked its predecessor out from the superspy pack: more star-filled, more gleefully grisly, and reaching new heights of skyscraping silliness.It＊s a film so cartoonishly outsized that it almost renders the first film restrained by comparison. Whether that＊s a good thing depends on the viewer＊s tolerance for death-defying feats of illogicality, or action scenes that stretch to gargantuan lengths. Indeed, Kingsman＊s two-hour 20-minute running time could have been shaved by around a fifth, without losing a great deal. But, crucially, the visual wit that made the original feel so bracingly fresh is maintained, not to mention its fondness for turning the Savile Row air blue 每 if you＊ve ever hoped to witness  spitting out four-letter words like a Gatling gun, all while wearing a remarkable feathered suit, then this might be the gonzo spy caper for you.A manic opening fight scene in a black cab, between Eggsy and his old finishing-school nemesis Charlie, ups the ante immediately, a flurry of kicks, jabs and gravity-upending camerawork. Charlie, now menacingly equipped with a bionic arm, is these days in the service of new pantomime big bad, Poppy Adams, played with lysergic glee by . As the soccer mom-ish leader of nefarious crime cartel the Golden Circle, Poppy rules over the entire global drug trade, which she controls from a jungle lair curiously kitted out as a kitsch 50s utopia, featuring gleaming bowling alleys, diners and nail salons, but also, somewhat confusingly, robot dogs and a captive Elton John.If there were any doubts about Poppy＊s malicious intentions, they＊re quickly dismissed as she engineers an unhappy meeting between a henchman and a meat grinder, one of several gruesome scenes that comfortably earns The Golden Circle its grown-up rating. Poppy＊s grand plan is equally nefarious: she has spiked the entire planetary supply of narcotics with a toxin that causes the user＊s veins to turn blue and will ultimately kill them. There＊s an antidote, of course, but Poppy will only release it if the world＊s leaders legalise all drugs and in the process hand her an extremely lucrative monopoly to rule over.To allow her plan to go forward without a hitch, Poppy carries out a pre-emptive strike on the Kingsman, wiping out a large chunk of its network of superspies, and forcing Eggsy and Merlin (Mark Strong) to seek refuge at the home of their US equivalent, the Statesmen, a ragtag bunch of whiskey-hawking American agents who have seemingly been introduced for the sole reason of cramming in a handful of available A-listers: Jeff Bridges, Narcos＊s Pedro Pascal, Halle Berry and a somewhat underused .It represents a dramatic turnover of cast members from the fairly compact ensemble in the first film and, for much of The Golden Circle＊s first hour, there＊s a slight absence of the crackling character dynamics that provided some flickers of realism amid the preposterous whizz-bangery. Most sorely missed is the relationship between Eggsy and Colin Firth＊s delightfully avuncular mentor figure Harry Hart, who was offed, seemingly definitively with a bullet to the brain towards its end. Of course, if you＊ve glimpsed even the slightest bit of the promotional material for this sequel you＊ll know that Harry＊s demise wasn＊t as permanent as first assumed 每 Firth even appeared on the red carpet for The Golden Circle＊s premiere. Let＊s not give away the circumstances of his return but suffice to say they＊re in keeping with the rest of The Golden Circle, a film where the ludicrous is routine and notions of threat or danger are entirely absent. The extended, limb-cracking fight scenes feel even more procedural than last time around, a procession of impressively choreographed moves that are there to be admired rather than to chew your fingernails to 每 though, to be fair, most feature at least one visual flourish (such as Eggsy flat-packing his briefcase into bullet-repelling armour) that elicit gasps at its audacity. And that＊s The Golden Circle in a nutshell. Every crass or tone-deaf moment 每 including a sexual encounter between Eggsy and a socialite, played by Poppy Delevingne, that at best feels entirely misjudged and at worst a complete betrayal of Eggsy＊s cheeky but ultimately quite sweet character 每 is matched by a wonderfully droll one-liner or nugget of razor-sharp satire. (There＊s a delicious nastiness to the idea that a mass poisoning of the world＊s narcotics would be embraced by the US president because it allows him to let his country＊s users die and thus win the ※war on drugs§.) It＊s a film that is utterly maximalist, stuffed to the gills with gadgets, gimmicks, ideas both good and bad. An exhausting, exhilarating watch.																																											"
"here is now such a blur between film and TV that if any actor remains snobbish about the small-screen medium, ※it is their loss§,  has said.Cumberbatch was speaking after the first screening of the new BBC1 drama The Child in Time, in which he stars. The one-off drama 每  每 is due to air on Sunday 24 September.Cumberbatch said actors could not afford to be snooty about what work they took on. ※The lines are so fine, they are beautifully blurred now between what big- and small-screen is 每 unless you＊re talking about something which is episodic,§ he said.※If you give it enough air and space, it [TV] can feel cinematic, but I think those terms are so beautifully intertwined now that you can＊t always separate cinema and television. Fuck it, it＊s acting. If it＊s good material, it＊s good material.※The opportunity to do good work is there whatever the medium 每 radio, television or film or stage.§Cumberbatch plays a children＊s writer who goes through one of the most harrowing situations it is possible to imagine. He is in a supermarket paying for his shopping and when he turns around, his four-year-old daughter is gone.All involved in the project admit it is quite a hard sell, because it sounds so grim. But there are laughs and, as the drama unfolds, it is not unremittingly depressing. , who plays the wife of Cumberbatch＊s character, said friends of hers recoiled when she told them what the drama was about 每 because it sounds so miserable.※But it＊s not,§ she said. ※It is such a film of love and life and hope and being human.§Cumberbatch is one of the executive producers of the 90-minute drama. One of the most difficult scenes to film was the scene where Cumberbatch loses his daughter.It was tricky for practical reasons, director Julian Farino said, in that the store opened at 11am and they were meant to be out by then after starting filming at 6.30am.The fact Cumberbatch is such a huge celebrity meant filming on a London street presented its own issues. ※Running outside into a busy street and people going: ＆Can I have a selfie?＊ That was hard and difficult and it is very weird,§ said Cumberbatch. ※You＊ve just lost your child.§ The Child in Time is on BBC1 on Sunday 24 September at 9pm.

"T Rogers is an American dramatist fascinated by global issues. In  (2006), he dealt with the Rwandan genocide and in  (2010) with western attitudes to Afghanistan. Now in this new Tony award-winning play, which shortly moves into the West End, he tackles a historic moment in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Even if, , the play is a period piece, it is an engrossing reminder of a time when a negotiated settlement seemed a practical possibility. Like our own , Rogers is a dramatist who delights in process: in showing how things happened as well as why. In this case he follows the success of a Norwegian sociologist, Terje R?d-Larsen, and his foreign ministry wife, Mona Juul, in creating back-channel meetings in 1993 between Israeli and Palestinian representatives. The meetings are clandestine, danger-fraught but cautiously productive. Eventually, however, Ahmed Qurei, finance minister for the PLO, demands to meet an opposite number of equal status and it is only when he is confronted by Uri Savir, deputy general of the Israeli foreign ministry, that the talks really take off. The result is a historic handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat in a . It may all have happened long ago, but Rogers successfully immerses us in the crises of the particular moment. Above all, he reminds of the validity of Larsen＊s belief that the key to fruitful diplomacy lies in establishing human connections. Much of the action takes place in the drawing-room beyond the negotiating chamber, where official attitudes are relaxed, tempers occasionally fly but a Palestinian communist and an Israeli economist can join forces in rhapsodising over a Norwegian cook＊s waffles. But Rogers also makes brutally clear the duplicity needed to bring the two sides together. At one point, Larsen lies through his teeth, and risks his wife＊s future, by swearing to the Palestinians that he has an assurance that the Israelis will upgrade their delegation.This is a play where the drama lies in the detail. However there came a point, especially when the Israelis raised 200 questions as to what would happen if they ceded control of Jericho, when my head started to spin with information overload. Juul＊s final query about whether she and her husband were right to act as they did also raises big issues I＊d like to have heard fully debated. But, by re-creating the day-to-day toil and trauma of the Israeli-Palestinian meetings, Rogers asks whether gradualism achieves more in diplomacy than an unyielding totalism. Although Bartlett Sher＊s production has an epic sweep, it rightly puts the emphasis on the individuals involved. Toby Stephens brings out the vanity and self-regard behind Larsen＊s idealism, while Lydia Leonard as Juul seems a model of practical wisdom. Peter Polycarpou as Ahmed Qurei and Philip Arditti as Uri Savir brilliantly suggest men of sizeable ego and seeming intransigence who yet manage to achieve a genuine human connection and there is good support from Howard Ward as a raging Norwegian politician and Geraldine Alexander as a coveted cook. Time may have exposed the fragility of the 1993 accord but the play emerges as an instructive lesson about the primacy of the personal in global affairs. At the National＊s , until 23 September. Box office: 020-7452 3000. Then at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, from 30 September. Box office: 0844 871 7627.																																											"

"Michael Billington describes ※a certain sadness§ in Peter Hall＊s later years (＆＊, 13 September). But there was nothing sad about his Indian summer at Kingston. Sir Peter revelled in his role as chancellor of Kingston University, of which he was immensely proud. He loved the ceremonies, but more than anything he relished the chance to spread some of the privileges of his own Cambridge education through his uniquely creative rapport with his vice-chancellor, Peter Scott. And at Kingston＊s Rose Theatre he helped shape his ideal of a teaching theatre, where actors and academics would work side by side.For Hall, the Rose was Prospero＊s island, where the music he learned from George Rylands could be fused with the rigour taught by FR Leavis. Crucially, this ※wide and universal theatre§ was not the Globe, with those pillars he famously deplored. When he blessed the house with As You Like It in 2004, reviewers were dismayed that his chilling vision was not the comedy they liked. But Hall insisted Shakespeare＊s forest was a place of terror; and his 2010 A Midsummer Night＊s Dream took critics?aback by its starkness, and the fierceness with which Judi Dench＊s Titania decried climate change in the mask of an aged Queen Elizabeth. So, there was no sad falling off in Peter Hall＊s Kingston swansong. But equally, he did not go gently into his good night.																																											"

"hen I hand the  Queensland reins to Patrick Nolan in November, it will mark my last outing as an artistic director of an opera company, my fourth time at the helm in a 30-odd year career, as I leave to pursue new creative adventures.I confess in this time I＊ve been in and out of love with the art form, fascinated and bored by it. It＊s been the epicentre of my life and a strange planet whose language I don＊t speak. Like others, I am troubled by opera＊s gender imbalance, lack of diversity, the racism and misogyny of many classics. When , New York City Opera had just closed and San Diego had a near-death experience. Since that time, we＊ve seen industrial unrest at the Met and radical change at ENO. It has been a turbulent time for opera companies in Australia too, where  has made its mark. Charged with reimagining opera＊s future here in Queensland, it was sometimes hard to rise above the bruising criticism that Opera Queensland received when the review quite reasonably highlighted the poor financial health the company had been in for more than a decade. Still, we welcomed the review as a catalyst for change and reflection on the problems facing this complex and expensive art form. OperaQ has been in surplus since 2015 and is now working with Arts Queensland and the Australia Council on the structuring of the future funding for the company. I remain emphatically optimistic. These times of upheaval continue to bring out the industry＊s resourcefulness and creativity, and a reimagining of how opera can play a purposeful, even transformational, role in today＊s society.So how can opera survive the tectonic shift, re-centre its purpose and tackle its demons? I see it in the context explored by the outgoing head of the Arts Council England, Peter Bazalgette, . ※We＊re a species of story-tellers and story-listeners,§ Bazalgette says. ※Beyond the diversion of entertainment there are good reasons for it. It helps us to learn to read the emotions of others.§ Directing Theodora for Pinchgut Opera last November following Donald Trump＊s election reminded me of opera＊s function as communal catharsis; that the themes of ancient stories resonate in our lives. In the soldier Septimius we recognised a timeless moral tension. Forced to obey orders to find and punish Christian dissenters, he feels revulsion: ※Descend kind pity, heavenly guest. Descend and fill each human breast with sympathizing woe.§ From ancient Rome, via Handel＊s 18th century London, one empathic citizen speaks to another across the centuries.Theodora＊s final chorus, immediately following the execution of two Christian martyrs, is a devastating song of protest against an oppressive thought-regime. Uniting the Sydney chorus and the audience was a communal moment of recognition that our world＊s power axis had shifted.Bazalgette demonstrates how empathy works neurologically, and uses it as an argument for public investment in culture. He points to a 2012 Cambridge study concluding ※that interacting with a group through music makes us more emotionally attuned to others, even beyond the immediate setting.§ As an artistic director, I have experienced countless moments proving that statement true: hundreds of Queenslanders exploding with energy in the local choruses, who trained for weeks to perform in our regional tours; the ignited imaginations of kids playing witches in Dido and Aeneas in a school holiday workshop; and the faces of people experiencing the sheer power of opera voices up close for the first time, in a theatre, nightclub, field, riverbed or quarry.Creating these moments 每 evidence of the transformational power of music 每 is a state opera company＊s job. It＊s the way opera can reach through the ages. It＊s the way it has always survived tectonic shifts.To tackle its demons, it must also look to empathy. Despite a large female audience, opera is controlled largely by middle-aged blokes who commission other blokes to direct, conduct and design operas composed by dead white men. Some of my favourite composers are dead white men, but the world has changed. There are countless excellent women composers, conductors, directors, set designers and more. There are no excuses for the industry＊s casual bias.From behind the scenes to the stage, the misogyny and cruelty to women embedded in the opera repertoire has been written about often since Catherine Cl谷ment＊s excellent Opera: the Undoing of Women in the 1970s. Yet still opera narratives of rape, murder and abuse, or stereotypes 每 from Carmen＊s ※bad girl§ to Cinderella＊s ※good girl§ 每 go unquestioned by creative teams. I＊ve lost count of the number of times female performers have told me they love being directed by a woman who can deeply empathise with the female perspective on a role. But to show complex women on the opera stage is still seen as radical.The gender imbalance in opera doesn＊t just affect the careers of female artists; it has a profound impact on the contemporary audience＊s experience. Anyone who saw OperaQ＊s re-imagined Snow White by an all-female creative team, or the late, great Elke Neidhardt＊s brilliant Ring Cycle in Adelaide in 2004, or Kate Miller-Heidke＊s The Rabbits, would agree. If opera＊s purpose and means of survival is empathy, its value also lies in things that words alone cannot express. By combining music and drama, even the strangest story can transcend mere narrative to express a deeper meaning as allegory, myth, even legend. All these elements point to the most compelling argument of all for opera＊s survival: the artists, many of whom have dedicated their lives to honing their craft, an incredible 400-year-old craft, which we could lose forever if it is not handed down, like the universal human stories, through the generations.Opera has moments of sheer musical beauty that pierce the soul but its true luxury is the capacity of the human voice to affect and transport an audience. Even in the digital world, the pure human voice as an instrument of power, of passion, of grace and empathy, is unrivalled.																																											"
"ne of the overriding questions one has while enduring a particularly awful film is, with all of the talented out-of-work film-makers in Hollywood, just how on earth did get made? Did no one take the time to read the script? Couldn＊t someone spot the signs production? Didn＊t anyone try to all available copies of the film before it limped onto the screen? There＊s a certain sadistic pleasure in not only watching a ※so bad it＊s good§ movie (a hobby that＊s grown in popularity in recent years) but also to explore the tortured story behind the scenes.It＊s especially fascinating when the finished product emerges in total earnest, seemingly produced by a team of people blissfully unaware of the horrors they have inflicted on an audience. Not many films conjure up this playful curiosity quite as much as 2003 oddity The Room. It＊s a small-budget drama that developed a cult status for its stilted acting, nonsensical plotting and indefinable central figure Tommy Wiseau. It was released in just one theater in LA, with a two week extension paid for by Wiseau himself to ensure that it qualified for Oscar consideration. The compellingly strange details of its production were turned into a book, The Disaster Artist, which has now made its way to its inevitable resting place: the big screen.Greg (Dave Franco) is a 19-year-old struggling actor living in San Francisco. He struggles not just because of the impossibly competitive nature of the industry, but also because, well, he＊s not that good. In acting class, he＊s finding it hard to lose himself in a scene, a problem that is quite notably not shared by boisterous classmate Tommy (James Franco). The pair begin to bond, Greg envious of Tommy＊s apparent confidence and Tommy jealous of Greg＊s ※baby face§ looks. Tommy is a frustrating enigma: his age, place of birth and source of income remain a mystery, but his enthusiasm compels Greg to stick with him.After the pair move to Los Angeles, they both try plotting their individual routes into the industry, but Tommy＊s eccentricities and Greg＊s stiffness mean that their careers fail to take off. After yet another rejection, they hatch a plan: why not make their own movie? Tommy heads to his typewriter and before long, The Room is ready for production, with Tommy playing the lead and Greg nabbing a major part. But as the cameras start to roll, Greg discovers that he＊s underestimated Tommy＊s quirks and overestimated his talents.While it＊s not entirely essential to have seen The Room before The Disaster Artist, it does elevate the experience, the script answering longstanding questions hardcore fans have had for years. Franco, who, like Wiseau, also acts as director here, has crafted a loving tribute to the film, its fans and also film-making in general. There＊s a tendency to cast aside unfathomably bad movies, the belief that their lack of quality then dictates a lack of respect, but Franco has assembled a painstaking recreation and a detailed exploration into a story that might never have been told.In the past few years, Franco＊s career has turned into something of a joke: his tiresome need to provoke and his unfounded belief that he is a master of all trades means it＊s all too easy to forget his talent as an actor. But he is staggeringly good here, almost unrecognizable as Wiseau, nailing his strange mannerisms, unusual voice and awkward laugh while also delving deeper to inhabit a man whose deep-rooted insecurities are messily papered over with bravado. It＊s easy to laugh at Wiseau, and the film unavoidably does, but it＊s harder to make us actually care about him. It＊s an affectionately handled portrait of a difficult man, and we share the frustration and sympathy of other characters. As director, he does solid work, but peppers his film with some bizarrely picked pop culture references. Despite the film being set in the late 90s/early 00s, the music is all from the early 90s and, clumsily, a number of posters in the background of scenes are of films released years after.As the film starts to cover the meat of the story, the production of The Room itself, it becomes giddy, often hysterically funny entertainment. We follow Greg＊s increasing horror as he realizes just what he＊s got himself into and there＊s a sustained series of ludicrous, crowd-pleasing set-pieces in rapid succession. Franco has also recruited a strong cast of actors for the many small roles in the film, including , Alison Brie, Jacki Weaver, Sharon Stone, Melanie Griffith, Megan Mullally, Hannibal Buress, Judd Apatow, Bryan Cranston, Zac Efron and Ari Graynor.But the dazzle of the cast and the targeted in-jokes never take away from the film＊s core messaging about the importance of believing in one＊s own ability as an artist. Rather like last year＊s Florence Foster Jenkins, the finale shows that even a really, unarguably bad performance can bring unabashed joy to a crowd, and with awards buzz already circulating around The Disaster Artist, Wiseau might be heading to the Oscars after all.

"I could swear the shape of Bertie Carvel＊s face is actually changing as his character becomes ever more evil. Here, leering at Gemma and then Neil, he is basically made of triangles as his rat-faced gloating hits shrill new heights.For those of you happy to hitch up your skirts and chase after this melodrama charabanc of doom, keep up, because tonight＊s episode barely pauses at the lights. Gemma＊s spying, Simon＊s sneering, the shape-shifting Sian. Parminster is one messed up, mixed up town (and end destination for Warwick uni graduates).Poor Gemma will spend almost all of this episode stalking Parminster＊s autumnal pavements, looking for her lost son. Well, he＊s lost to her anyway. Tom doesn＊t want to speak to his mum and she doesn＊t believe it can just be her unbelievably embarrassing closeness to his teacher.Even while she is mid-stalk outside the school gates, lovely, understanding educator James asks her out again ※for breakfast§ as he has a free period first thing. His extra-curricular commitment to biological studies during said free period is admirable but after Gemma＊s shenanigans with Sian the night before, I＊d be tempted to ask him if he went to Warwick university, just in case.While Gemma is off probing work frenemy Sian over Tom＊s mysterious visit to the surgery, neighbour Neil is on a mission to find out about Simon＊s business dealings 每 which isn＊t easy since Simon and Neil＊s friendship hit the skids two years ago, about the time Neil slept with Gemma.He pretends to bump into Simon at work (Simon isn＊t that stupid) and the two men end up having a truly Shakespearean pint at the pub; Simon peering over the top of his glass like a modern-day Iago, suggesting weak Neil chats up that woman flirting with him across the bar.Having ruined Neil＊s marriage (with Neil＊s willing help), the grinning psychopath trips out of the pub only to have his half-cut ex practically fall at his feet. Naturally, he takes a picture of her looking a bit tired (the rest of us are probably thinking, ※That＊s me on a good day§) and she is suitably furious when he texts it to her the next morning.But just when we＊re having too much fun watching Simon and Gemma do the full bullfighting routine, our gaze is dragged back to the collateral damage, thoroughly chastening us for enjoying the fireworks. Poor Tom (I think I＊ll call him this from now as we＊re referencing Shakespeare a lot) is not only suffering anxiety and insomnia (if Sian is to be believed), he＊s becoming violent at school and even turning on his friends.This is perhaps the result of Gemma＊s truly unbelievable behaviour, stalking her son＊s friend Max who sits stiffly while she swigs his parent＊s wine having suddenly appeared at his window in the middle of the night. She grills him about Poor Tom, enormous wine glass in hand. Has he had sex? Does he smoke? I know the woman spends most of her down time lurking in bushes, but this is a bit much even for her.※He says he doesn＊t love you,§ says Max, shattering her world anew. Whatever Simon said to Poor Tom, she＊s thinking, it must be monstrously bad. Maybe he＊s just sick of his kippered, mood-swingy mum being consumed by vengeance and having sex with his teacher.Gemma is devastated. Simon is furious. Tom is a mess. And Kate might or might not be having an affair. Either way, everyone is miserable. Isn＊t it splendid?Whose side is Sian really on? What is she up to, meddling in Gemma＊s life without declaring her previous friendship with Simon. And what is going on at Warwick university? I＊ll leave you with this: I went to Warwick university. Trust no one. What is happening to Gemma＊s left hand? She keeps clenching it when she＊s driving. Is the space formerly occupied by her wedding ring actually burning, such is her fury? The carefully-timed arrivals of the estate agents at Gemma＊s door were a lovely touch. Imagine how much you＊d have to hate someone to send a plague of estate agents! ※What was she like? My wife, when you slept with her,§ Simon asks Neil over a pint of Red Ribbon. It＊s a line like that, verbal cape flourish followed by a small bow, that make me adore Bartlett＊s ludicrously juicy writing. I＊m delighted with Sian Brooke＊s character; another unknowable weirdo who drops little clues to who she might be but appears largely opaque, even when apparently oversharing. We do at least know she＊s now into women, not men. Sticking a pin in that. Gemma tells James she had a 28-year-old bit on the side for a while and she PAID him in order to keep him at arm＊s length. If you reversed the sexes, this would be a truly shocking revelation. Doctor Foster with her hair down is exactly like Doctor Foster with her hair up, just drunker and more promiscuous. May she throw away all her scrunchies.																																											"
"hat a Monday evening for Jack and Harry Williams, the creators of  and at least the second best Williams siblings in the world, who have two new primetime thrillers competing against each other on BBC1 and ITV, airing in the exact same slot. Perhaps it＊s just a big stunt to promote catch-up services, or even ITV+1, as surely the audience will be one and the same.From the title alone, (BBC1) sounds like the kind of Scandi noir crime drama that launches a thousand patterned jumpers. It＊s the meatier of the two, in many ways; it＊s gothic, it＊s gruesome, and it＊s all wrapped up in a reverse-time package (Rellik = Killer), that means we get to see what happened next, before we get to see what happened. Richard Dormer is grizzly DCI Gabriel Markham, who is supposed to be celebrating the capture of a serial killer attacking his victims with acid. You will note that Gabriel has also been scarred by the killer 每 so why is he drinking in his car, alone, dejected by his attacker＊s death, rather than jubilant that he has finally been stopped? Something, or perhaps everything, does not add up.The show lurches back in time a few hours, to the moment the suspect is shot, and this rewinding happens again and again over the course of the hour. It＊s an excuse for some nicely arty shots of time going the wrong way, but it＊s also an effective device used with some originality, and the way in which it reveals details about the protagonists＊ lives is neat. Gabriel is having an affair with his colleague Elaine Shepard (Jodi Balfour), but we don＊t know that he is married until the end of the episode. When he hands Elaine a key, it looks as if he is urging their relationship on; later 每 or, technically, earlier 每 we are shown him telling her he will give her the key back, to call time on what they are doing. Giving the audience these little morsels of intrigue is smart and flattering. We are trying to move forwards by watching Gabriel go backwards.As with The Missing, this is plotted so tightly that there is little room to breathe, and it hints at bigger conspiracies. There is a mysterious psychiatrist with OCD, a victim of a different acid attack who is suspected of involvement in the serial killer＊s spree, and a wealthy man with the kind of milk-bottle glasses that signal someone up to no good. Initially, I found the story a little cold, a little too clinical, a little pleased with its own cleverness, but by the end of the episode, I had been reeled in completely, and inevitably I am now desperate to know how it all fits together.(ITV) is less Luther-ish, and more similar to the final series of Broadchurch, in both its setting and its subject matter. Teacher Laura (Joanne Froggatt, always so good at portraying suffering) goes on a date with heart surgeon Andrew (Ioan Gruffudd); it goes well, and they end up outside her place, deciding what to do next. But when Laura wakes up the next day, she is horrified, distraught, and says Andrew raped her. Meanwhile, he has sent a text thanking her for the great night, and when the police arrest him on suspicion of sexual assault, he claims the entire evening went very differently, at least from his perspective. ※We＊re just seeing this completely differently, that＊s all,§ he tells her as she recoils from him, terrified.This is the nub of the drama: everyone has their own view of what happened. Laura says she told him no; Andrew says he even stopped and went to the bathroom to get a condom, and she didn＊t get up, or run away from him. But there are gaps in each person＊s story. Laura＊s memory is hazy. Andrew＊s account to the police, about asking to charge his phone after he had called a taxi, for example, does not tally with what we have been shown. The discrepancies may be small, but it is already starting to look as if he has something to hide. He is not the only one. This is a small town, and, as in Broadchurch, everyone＊s secrets are about to come to the surface.In its final few minutes, Liar swerved from the procedural path it seemed to be on and again proved that the Williams brothers are experts in intrigue. Frustrated by a growing sense of futility at the investigative process 每 the show is very good at showing just how much would be counted against Laura in a court case 每 and certain that it would come down to her word against his, she takes matters into her own hands and posts an accusatory message on Andrew＊s public profile. It takes a bleakly familiar story into unfamiliar territory, and though it is less showy than Rellik, it＊s just as gripping. I look forward to the next five weeks of getting wrongfooted by this elegant brain-teasing double bill.																																											"

"Stephen King has always had a complex relationship with Hollywood. Studios adore the writer＊s offbeat verve and creativity, yet have often balked at the more transgressive corners of his back catalogue. The latest Kingism to be left out of a big-screen adaptation is the infamous teen sex scene in the novel It, the movie adaptation of which has just  每 a new record for a horror flick. In the book, the six male members of the ※Losers Club§, battling to destroy the murderous titular villain, realise they can only win by having sex with their only female comrade, 14-year-old Beverly Marsh. King describes the encounter in excruciating detail. Given the youngest Loser, chubby Ben Hanscom, is aged just 11, it is unsurprising that Andy Muschietti and his team chose to avoid the scene altogether. The written word may retain an immersive quality that even the most hi-tech 3D screenings would struggle to match, but authors will always be given more leeway than their counterparts in film and TV. For the most part, this is a good thing 每 imagine the outrage at  if the younger characters from George RR Martin＊s original books had not been  for the HBO adaptation. Or imagine if , who left the project over creative differences, had made it into cinemas.If we accept that Muschietti＊s take finds the right balance between staying true to the novel and ensuring that studio execs find the film palatable, the question becomes how Hollywood can repeat the trick. There is a real buzz for King-style fiction on both the big and small screens (see Netflix＊s ), but when is filing off the author＊s spikier corners a matter of necessity, and when is it simple sacrilege?The enormous early success of Muschietti＊s film has  that Bill Skarsg?rd＊s Pennywise the Clown could be Hollywood＊s next great recurring horror villain, 2017＊s answer to the noughties＊  or any of the 1980s＊ iconic trio of ,  and . This, surely, would be an enormously wrongheaded approach. Moreover, it rather ignores the fact that King＊s novel is best adapted in only two parts, with studio New Line now keen to push the sequel into production as soon as possible.Talk of an  ※universe§, or anything that tries to spin the world presented in Muschietti＊s film into multiple new episodes, would be a violation of King＊s multilayered, warm-hearted source material, even if some would argue the Argentine director has already repositioned Pennywise as a common-or-garden horror boogie man rather than the symbol of childhood fear and repression that he is in the novel.Hollywood has already shown that it gets King wrong far more often than it gets him right, especially since those twin victories,  and . The Dark Tower, perhaps the writer＊s most eccentric and indulgent work, was at one point conceived as a trilogy of movies with two seasons of a linked TV show to join the dots. But after JJ Abrams and Ron Howard were both forced to admit defeat in their efforts to adapt the sprawling eight-book saga, it finally emerged as a  last month. It was roundly criticised for shaving off most of King＊s quirkiness and muddling elements from across the series into an interminable lifeless mulch.Are there areas of the writer＊s back catalogue that Hollywood might be able to plunder more successfully? One of King＊s greatest novels, the 1977 school gunman thriller Rage,  after it appeared to inspire a number of real-life shootings. However, it would be intriguing to see a remake of The Shining,  in Stanley Kubrick＊s 1980 adaptation. A better take on the excellent dystopian sci-fi novel,  (filmed in 1989 as an Arnie cheese-fest) would surely be welcomed in the post-Hunger Games era, and . Given the reception the director has received for It, few would argue against that proposition, especially if it means we don＊t have to put up with a run of ever-weaker sequels starring Pennywise the Clown. Some things are not meant to last for ever, and most of us would agree that classic horror rarely fares well when it has been hacked to bits and cynically reanimated in episodic form.

"LCD Soundsystem have reached the top of  for the first time with their new record .The cult New York act, who blend literate, self-reflexive lyrics with disco pulses, announced their retirement in 2011 with a show at Madison Square Gardens. They reformed this year, , who told frontman James Murphy that he should embrace his discomfort over getting the band back together.The No 1 record comes a decade on from Murphy attempting to score a No 1 with their second album Sound of Silver. He asked fans to buy the album in the first week of release, so as to send it to No 1 每 in the end, the 15,000 copies sold in the first week were only enough to send it to No 46. The band did, however, edge their way into the Top 10 with their album This Is Happening in 2010.The album reached No 3 , with Irish rockers the Script topping the chart with Freedom Child.

"orn in South Lanarkshire in 1976, Stuart Braithwaite fronted band Deadcat Motorbike and drummed for Eska before forming post-rock band Mogwai in Glasgow in 1995. The band, known for their slow-building instrumental tracks and use of distortion, were championed by John Peel and recorded seven Peel Sessions between 1996 and 2004. Their last album,  (2014), was praised in the  for its combination of  moments. Since 2015, Braithwaite has also been part of Minor Victories alongside Slowdive＊s Rachel Goswell and Editors＊ Justin Lockey; they released a self-titled album in 2016. Mogwai＊s ninth studio album,  is out now on Rock Action Records. They play London and Glasgow in December.I＊ve been listening to a lot of true-crime podcasts such as  in the past few years 每 it＊s been a bit of a bug. This one goes deep into the crimes and uses interview tapes and media reports. It＊s not always easy listening; some of them are harrowing, but it＊s been interesting finding out the background of people who commit dreadful crimes, because no one just wakes up one day and decides to be evil. One episode starts with the , and it＊s about a child abduction ring in the 80s that went right up to people in the White House. It was genuinely shocking 每 it felt like an episode of , but it all really happened.I＊m vegan so I usually use the  to find vegan restaurants, and I think this one is my favourite in New York; we go when we play New York and I went again recently when I was on holiday there. It＊s just an amazing restaurant and has all sorts of vegan American soul food. I was quite fond of the fake buffalo wings but it＊s all good. It＊s not super fancy or anything, just a really nice cafe with quite a low-key interior. It＊s also quite near Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan, so it＊s a nice walk around there.Mdou Moctar is a Tuareg songwriter who lives in Niger: he＊s one of the best guitar players I＊ve seen in years and his band just have so much energy. Everyone should see him play once before they die. I first heard his music on an amazing compilation called , on a label called , which was people in Africa sharing music through their phones. It was really low-quality MP3s, but this song of his 每 just a vocal, a drum machine and a guitar 每 sounded absolutely incredible. I saw him in London when he was playing at  in Dalston. It was more of a rock show than I was expecting 每 but it was really amazing.An earlier book by Gattis called , which is about the Los Angeles riots, is one of the most intense books I＊ve ever read. This new one is set during the bank crash of about 10 years ago, and really gets under the skin of the people who were the victims of that. It＊s about characters that are often under-represented 每 working-class Americans whose way of life is very different from mine, so you get a window into their existence. It＊s also a thriller: there＊s a guy cracking safes, and it involves police corruption. I＊ve not actually finished it yet but it＊s really good.I saw this at FrightFest at the Glasgow film festival. It＊s about a young kid living in New York, and he＊s obsessed with vampires to the point where he thinks he is a vampire and essentially starts behaving like one. He meets a girl who is displaced and who has to stay with her grandparents even though they are really terrible people. When he defends her from them, they start to build this weird friendship because they are both kids that no one else talks to. It＊s a really sad and beautiful film, even though it sounds kind of scary. I watch a lot of horror films 每 I grew up in the 80s, so I love , , .  is probably my favourite film of all time.This is a comic series written by Greg Rucka and drawn by Nicola Scott. It＊s a detective story but the main character, Rowan Black, is a witch. The people she works with don＊t know she＊s a witch, so she＊s solving these crimes but they also have a cult element to them. It＊s set in a fictional place called Portsmouth, which doesn＊t seem to be anything like the Portsmouth that I＊ve visited. Comics require dedication and I＊ve been too busy to keep up with everything, but this one really got to me 每 it＊s the best thing I＊ve read for a while.I visited the Isle of Skye earlier in the year每 it＊s one of the most beautiful places I＊ve ever been. My mum is from the Hebrides, so I＊ve spent a lot of time there. Skye has all these otherworldly natural phenomena like the Fairy Glen, which is spectacular 每 it feels as if somebody built it especially for people to visit. I think that＊s probably why it gets used in so many films. I＊d recommend it to people, except that there are already more , so maybe this isn＊t helping. But I still think, even if it＊s a bit of a squeeze, people should visit.																																											"
"here＊s little to like in this undercooked ※horror§ about three siblings who stage a bank heist and run into trouble when they encounter a haunted vault. Heavy on gore (we see someone kill themselves with a power drill), but light on story,  lazily relies on ＊s sinister 70s porn ＊tache and permanently furrowed brow to signal the direction of the narrative in lieu of a properly structured script. For a film that＊s a restrained 90 minutes long, it＊s dour, it drags and is drunk on its own incoherent mythology. Without real stakes, the scares don＊t land 每 fine, if it＊s meant to be a fun romp, but I only detected one joke (※The only thing that spooks me is a bad loan,§ says the bank manager).In terms of star power, Taryn Manning is the main attraction, trotting out the white trash act with which she＊s made her name (Pennsatucky in , and pregnant teen Mimi in the Britney Spears vehicle ), but she＊s gritting her teeth through the thankless role.

"f you shone a torch round the auditorium of London＊s Peacock theatre in early September, venue for ＊s annual showcase, you might find a higher than average number of scribblers. Not just critics, but agents, casting directors and others, marking up their programmes in hope of spotting a winner. BYO＊s participants benefit from workshops and professional coaching from those at the top of the operatic profession. Then they＊re out there on stage, exposed, before the bright lights of judgment.This may have its agonising aspects, but it gives a clubbable feel to BYO shows. This 30th anniversary they have paired ＊s  and, sung in English, Mozart＊s . Weir＊s 1990 opera, three Scottish Gaelic tales rolled into a 100-minute piece, provides an obligingly large cast of 26, with a similar number in the chorus. The tiniest cameo can reveal a potential star.That said, you needed your wits about you to work out who was who in , briskly conducted by James Holmes, confidently directed by Stuart Barker and stylishly designed, a fairytale scene taking place beneath wooden rafters, by Andrew Riley. Weir＊s love of folklore and myth spins its own magic. The score is alive with choral interjections, insistent percussion, solo fiddling. Weir＊s voice, as ever, is distinctive and approachable.Dramatically, matters are less clear, with verbal delivery from the singers not always as sharp as it should be. When the emphasis is on ritual and pattern rather than individual character, you need all the help you can get. The third story, The Stranger, is the most substantial: a handsome stranger arrives to woo a young woman 每 well performed by London-based Swedish mezzo Ida R?nzl?v. Her lover turns out to be the Devil (bass Timothy Edlin). From the large ensemble, some names to note: Ian Beadle (Bridegroom), Alexandra Lowe (Bride), James Liu (in the blink-or-miss role of Narration). had strong singing all round, and some good ideas in James Hurley＊s production, set in a grim, unfinished tower block designed by Rachel Szmukler. Unfortunately the piece outstayed its welcome. It felt sluggish in tempo. Jokes were in short supply, with barely a hint of its essential black humour. Long pauses between scenes were injudiciously accompanied by electronic noises off 每 a cork-popping party, a prolonged and noisy boom 每 whether to set the scene or to help pass the time (※it would have passed in any case§) wasn＊t clear.The Southbank Sinfonia, accompanying both operas, worked hard and efficiently, but Lionel Friend＊s tempi were too leisurely. A tightening of reins would have transformed proceedings, since the individual elements were impressive. All the women 每 Charlie Drummond (Anna), Samantha Clarke (Elvira), Lauren Joyanne Morris (Zerlina) 每 rose to their big moments, with, between them, plenty of talent ripe for development. Felix Kemp (Masetto) and, particularly, Adam Temple-Smith as Don Ottavio stood out, as did Christian Valle as the Commendatore, whose mighty bass made a lasting impression. Jake Muffett in the title role, though a little underpowered vocally, has bags of potential. The irresistible energy and wit came from Leporello, Glaswegian Michael Mofidian, also an imaginative singer.Two end-of-season Proms on the same evening ran the gamut, in scale and mood, of this magnificently sprawling festival.  conducted the  (1903-4, revised 1906), which requires a colossal orchestra. A cartoon, reproduced in the programme, shows Mahler with an array of percussion 每 whip, cowbells, hammer 每 clutching his head and saying ※My God, I forgot the motor horn§ 每 probably jolly funny in Vienna at the time.Some may have found Harding＊s slightly cool approach to this fate-burdened work, nicknamed ※Tragic§, unsatisfying, lacking sufficient conspicuous agony. Yet it released the buoyant qualities of this score 每 its generous, too often forgotten lyricism 每 saving catastrophe to the last. He chose the Andante-Scherzo order of movements; there are inexhaustible arguments for either. His decision convinced. The Viennese strings＊ lustrous playing of the opening melody came as balm after the shrieks and roars of the first movement. Horns, and all the brass, were fiery and brilliant. There were some blips in ensemble, but the pleasure in hearing these astounding players squashed all quibbles, without the need of a hammer blow (or as here, another of those disputed Mahlerian issues, two rather than three).The late Prom was playing Bach (broadcast live  and ). Solo instruments suit the Albert Hall. Without display, Schiff embarked on the C major prelude No 1 in the Well-Tempered Clavier Book 1. Two hours later, having traversed every key 每 counterpoint pure and limpid, voice-leading clear and sturdy, each tempo judged to perfection 每 he reached the final B minor fugue and stopped. If he used the sustaining pedal, it was so discreet you could not detect it. Not a muscle in his body appeared anything but relaxed, travelling deeper into the inexplicable mysteries of Bach＊s music. It was one of those unforgettable revelations. ∴∴∴ ∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴∴																																											"
"ideo games have always been funny. From the lumbering kidnap animation in Donkey Kong to the witty wordplay of the Uncharted series, developers have used every tool at their disposal to make us giggle while we shoot, jump, explore and accelerate. Sometimes the humour comes from the script, sometimes the mechanics, and sometimes it＊s just the emergent joy of competing against friends. Whichever, we all remember games that have had us doubled over our controllers, helpless with laughter.Here then, are the funniest games  ever played. Please share your own rib-tickling reminiscences in the comments. it＊s one of those rare video games that＊s actually designed as a piece of humour. From the very beginning, when you step out of a person-shaped suitcase into its cartoon cyberpunk world, the gags are fast, furious and sophisticated.  it＊s a black-and-white wild west adventure entirely populated by stick figures and sight gags. Much of the comedy comes from the way the script and mechanics work together with a delightful sense of wordplay, so that the ghost town is actually made out of ghosts and the needles you pick locks with are all hidden in haystacks.  it＊s a two-player espionage challenge that perfectly captures the look and slapstick humour of the Mad magazine cartoon strip it＊s inspired by. A lot of the laughs come from setting traps for your opponent and then accidentally tripping them yourself, prompting a range of lovely Loony Tunes-style death animations. Iit＊s the heartwarming tale of a paper-thin canine rapper who is taught the meaning of life by a karate-chopping onion. Enough said. it＊s a refreshingly original and light-hearted role-playing adventure where the overarching war between humans and monsters is undercut both by the winsome characters (such as pun-loving skeleton Sans and blushing crush-prone scientist Alphys) and the fact that enemies can be vanquished with a nice hug.  it＊s co-written by Douglas Adams, closely follows the plot of the book and radio series, and contains one of the most devilish challenges in the history of text adventures: the babel fish puzzle. It also starts with the best two inventory items in history: a splitting headache and no tea.  it＊s a multiplayer cooperative cooking game where the kitchens are highly impractical 每 and often moving 每 and you＊ve always got one hopeless friend who keeps setting things on fire. it＊s a game about having to repair the universe after your father 每 the King of All Cosmos 每 has destroyed it in a drinking spree. You do this by rolling objects into giant balls to make new stars. We can just leave it there really.  it＊s a turn-based military strategy game in which the military strategy involves holy hand grenades, banana bombs, weaponised grandmothers and exploding sheep. it＊s a frenzied series of microgame collections that trade in surprise and utter weirdness. Whether you＊re running away from a dinosaur or picking a giant nose, the humour comes in watching the cartoon scenarios then frantically figuring out what the hell you＊re supposed to do. you play as an octopus going undercover as a human dad. It＊s also the perfect example of humour through mechanics, as the requirement to control each of the character＊s limbs separately inevitably leaves him flailing around the screen, rendering even the simplest human task hilariously difficult.it looks like a serious assassination sim, but through its wonderfully open and pliable systems, it often makes you feel more like Mr Bean than James Bond. If you＊ve ever tried to stealthily kill a foreign agent only to accidentally squash a number of his party guests under falling spotlight, you＊ll know what we mean.  the combination of an open-world environment, a wonky physics engine and some gigantic bugs turned this okay skating game into the world＊s greatest accident simulator. Just type ※Skate 3 compilation§ into YouTube and watch the eye-watering chaos unfold. I it＊s a platform adventure written by Monkey Island scribe Tim Schaffer and set in a series of bizarre dreamworlds including a paranoid milkman＊s conspiracy laden suburb, a frenetic dance party and a metropolis inhabited by lungfish.  it＊s as puerile and gleefully offensive as you＊d expect, thanks to the close collaboration with Matt Stone and Trey Parker. There are anal probes, there are parental genital assaults and there are weapon customisation items called strap-ons.  you＊re a goat, clip-clopping around a glitchy urban environment ruining barbecues, destroying museums and licking passing trucks. It＊s also funny because Swedish developer Coffee Stain Studios made it as a joke and never actually meant to release it, but it did and now more than 2.5 million people have played. it＊s about a foul-mouthed binge-drinking squirrel whose attempts to get home to his girlfriend are continually thwarted by an embittered Prussian weasel. Released after a series of beautiful family platformers, Rare＊s mature-rated masterpiece remains one of the most subversive acts in console game history.  it＊s a brilliant Grand Theft Auto pastiche in which super-cop Chase McCain hunts crime boss Rex Fury through a cavalcade of deconstructed action movie cliches, daft characters and whip-smart one-liners 每 all of which gleefully whiz over the heads of its younger fans. it＊s a complete deconstruction of video game narrative conventions, allowing the player 每 as downtrodden office worker Stanley 每 to disobey and contradict the ongoing voice over exposition. It＊s like an interactive Franz Kafka novel, only a lot more enjoyable.  on the surface it appears to be a game about hitting people with a giant purple dildo, but in fact, when you delve deeper, you realise it is a game about becoming president of the United States, committing insurance fraud, repelling an alien invasion,  hitting people with a giant purple dildo.I its a British-made role-playing adventure and that means it has more fart gags, condoms and double entendres than it does monsters. The Fable series wonderfully challenged the po-faced pomposity of most fantasy games 每 and the sad thing is, we＊ll never see another. it＊s about incompetent organ removal, using a deliberately inaccurate physics model to render the player laughably ineffectual. Forget Drunk History, this is Drunk Surgery. every instalment takes place in a horrendous moral vacuum where thudding violence and high-speed vehicular mayhem are only ever a button press away. Even if you hate the sledgehammer satire of the scripts, you＊ll stay for the anarchy that comes whenever open-world environments, innocent pedestrians, zealous cops and freely available firearms collide.  it＊s a sci-fi shooter about rogue mercenaries guilty of massive war crimes but it＊s also a bawdy comedy that mercilessly mocks macho gaming conventions. Scripted by Marvel writer Rick Remender, most of the best lines are unquotable in a family publication, though we can at least rejoice in the fact that it features a giant robot dinosaur called Waggleton P Tallylicker. developer Will Wright intended his interactive reality TV show to be an exploration of urban life and relationships 每 but what did we do? We drowned our sims in swimming pools, forced them to pee on the kitchen floor and locked them in the cellar so that they could endlessly produce paintings for our profit. The Sims taught us that in video games, the real monsters are on  side of the screen. one of the greatest characters in the history of video games is a murderous computer that sadistically toys with the player at every opportunity. That character is of course Glados, a vengeful AI who sets all the physics tasks in this first-person puzzler, while calling you a monster, lying about cake and singing about science. The sequel adds a brilliant comic performance by Stephen Merchant as ineffectual robot assistant Wheatley, but it＊s Glados who steals the show once again 每 even when extracted into a potato battery. it＊s a loving tribute to swashbuckling Errol Flynn movies which brilliantly ridicules and subverts the conventions of its genre. Throughout the 1990s, LucasArts created a series of point-and-click adventures that would become legendary for their sharp sardonic humour 每 Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Sam and Max Hit the Road 每 but Monkey Island is the pinnacle, best known for the brilliant insult sword-fighting sequence, its eccentric characters and its gorgeous one-liners. No other developer and no other game could have made taken a line like ※that＊s the second biggest monkey head I＊ve ever seen§ and turned it into a moment of unforgettable comic genius. A triumph.																																											"

In 1948 George Orwell writes; in 1994 Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty go to the selfsame island . They vow not to talk about this event for 23 years, which takes us up to 2017 when they produce , a ※utopian costume drama§, supposedly written on the island of Jura in 1984 by Roberta Antonia Wilson using the pen name ※George Orwell§. The significance of the numbers 23 and 17 can be traced to the ※23/17 phenomenon§ mentioned in theIlluminatus! trilogy (1975), a series of novels that featured fictional conspiratorial group the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (who lend their name to Drummond and Cauty＊s earliest musical incarnation), written by Robert Shea and .※I expect the reader＊s palette is reasonably broad,§ Roberta Antonia Wilson remarks at the end of the first chapter of , ※so they will notice I have borrowed from two monuments of twentieth-century literature.§ The use of palette, the range of colours used by a painter, rather than palate, meaning a sense of taste, is curious. A simple mistake a more diligent editor might have spotted? Or something unconsciously deliberate, that the reader must take the role of artist in mentally ordering the material used? For there certainly is much creative reading needed to get through this book.There are flashes of playfulness 每 an?early alternative novel by ※George Orwell§ is , set in Scotland (which is particularly apt since there is currently a campaign to prevent such an industrial complex being sited on Jura). And one has to acknowledge the ambition in creating a utopian rather than dystopian setting. In  world peace has been achieved, there is sustainable energy, abundant food and universal social and religious tolerance. Everything is controlled by the ※Big Five§ corporations of Googlebyte, Wikitube, Amazaba, Facelife and Appletree, all headed by female versions of familiar chief executives such as Marcia Zuckerberg and Stevie Dobbs.We follow Winnie Smith as she muses that ※it would be great if there was a secret society that actually controlled everything§, which reflects that peculiar wishful thinking that inhabits the mind of conspiracy theorists. It was this cognitive dissonance that was pursued by the writers of Illuminatus! when the genre still had only cult status. In the 1980s and 90s the KLF channelled a hypnotic alchemy of arcane wisdom and pop culture references to take the music business by storm; by 2017 a post-truth world treats conspiracy theory as mainstream and internet message boards buzz with accusations that leading R&B acts are members of the Illuminati.Winnie＊s  testimony soon gives way to a frenzy of disparate backstories. The Beatles attempt (and fail) to end the Vietnam war, M＊Lady Gaga is driven around in a pink Rolls-Royce by Parker from , Banksy plans a Christmas No 1, Subcomandante Marcos appears on horseback on the Westway flyover, Vladimir Putin invades Poland and so on. There is a Discordian sense of chaos, a riotous subplotting against any dominant narrative, but we are never really involved as all is rendered as exposition or reported action. There is a running commentary, but we never get close to any of the characters. An impressive guest list continues: Nina Simone, Michelle Obama, Angela Merkel, Arthur Scargill, Bob Hoskins, EH Gombrich 每 but we＊re left thinking: what if everybody turned up and there was no party? The tone eventually becomes?timid?and apologetic, acknowledging that the reader might get ※totally bored with these knowing references§ and ※if you don＊t like the style 每 and I would hate it 每 then there is little I can do about it.§Which is a shame because they clearly still have a compelling story to tell. Their work forms a most intriguing chapter in the history of popular music and conceptual art. And Drummond certainly can write engagingly, as proved by his excellent memoir,  (2000). Fiction, of course, is another matter. Part of the problem here is that there is too much borrowing and simply not enough stealing.

"I was at a party with Arthur Laurents who was about to write a musical with  based on Romeo and Juliet. I asked who was doing the lyrics and he said: ※Gosh, we＊ve been thinking about that. We don＊t have anybody.§ Lenny wanted Comden and Green () but they were in Hollywood under a contract. Arthur asked if I＊d play for Lenny.I really wanted to be writing my own music as well, not just lyrics, but thought it would be nice to meet Bernstein. So I played him some of Saturday Night, about a group of kids at the time of the stock market crash. It was a very New York show, all colloquial. Lenny liked to intimidate people. He asked: ※Haven＊t you got anything poetic?§ I said, well, they＊re kids in Brooklyn in 1929. It wouldn＊t be terribly appropriate. But he liked what he heard.When we worked together, Lenny would sketch out something that was purple prose not poetry. It screamed: ※Look at me! I＊m being poetic!§ I＊d learned from , my mentor, that the whole point is to underwrite not overwrite because music is so rich an art itself. Poetry makes, generally, very poor lyrics unless you＊re dealing with a certain kind of show. It＊s too allusive, that＊s not what you want. When Lenny failed, he failed big. He was always jumping off the top of the ladder. When you＊re young, you want to take chances but you get discouraged by failure.

He＊s the only genius I＊ve ever met but he was demanding and easily offended. You came out scarred, but you came out with good work.There＊s a lot of plot in  but its scenes are probably the shortest of any book musical that＊s ever existed. Arthur packed so much into it. He also did something very smart. He said the trouble with street slang is that it dates. So he made up a lot of language and has the guys say things like ※riga tiga tum tum§. It＊s a sort of Alice in Wonderland language that doesn＊t date. There is almost no real slang. The simplest songs, like Maria, were the hardest to write. Gee, Officer Krupke was easier. I wanted to be the first guy to use a four-letter word in a musical. I did but the line became ※krup you§ instead. The record couldn＊t have been shipped over the state line if I＊d used an obscenity.We knew we were going to write a number about America for the Sharks and their girls. Lenny went on vacation to Puerto Rico and said: ※I＊ve been listening to this wonderful musical form called .§ He played this very fast tune and I said, boy it＊s going to be hard to shoehorn lyrics into that but I＊ll try. It＊s a very crowded lyric: some of it works and some of it doesn＊t. I found out, years later, that he＊d written the tune in his teens for an unproduced ballet called Conch Town. Someone at the Library of Congress sent it to me and said turn to page 17. I looked and found: ※yuh-duh-duh yuh-duh-duh durr-durr-durr.§ Lenny had made up this entire story to make it seem more spontaneous, then just pulled out an old tune that he liked.We opened out of town. By the time we got to New York the audience had heard the show was a ※work of art§ and sat as if at church. The first half hour was just deadly. They forgot they were at a musical until the girls came on and did some fancy dancing and shook their skirts for America. The reviews were great but the danger is always: don＊t get complacent.You know something? There aren＊t any fantastic rhymes in West Side Story. They＊re almost all day and may, go and show. It would have been betraying the characters if they＊d rhymed too well. I Feel Pretty still bothers me. It＊s just too elegant for a girl like Maria to sing.

I decided to perform My Man＊s Gone Now from Porgy and Bess, which is usually sung soprano but I＊m sort of bass baritone. Lenny chuckled when he asked me to do it again. He was either thinking, she has a lot of guts or she＊s pretty stupid.I loved playing Anita: she＊s a mother image to Maria, protective of her, but also saucy and passionate, very much in love with Bernardo. We had a whole cast of young, excited dancers and all that energy in a room feeds off itself. America was tremendous fun to perform because of the tempo, the Latin rhythm. Stephen＊s lyrics for that song are so biting and comical. I got letters from Puerto Rican people who had totally misunderstood it 每 they thought that I really meant it was an ※ugly island§ and didn＊t realise that Anita was joking to make a point. They were highly emotional about it.We were taught how to sing America so every word could be heard clearly. You had to put air through certain consonants and hit the ※k§ in ※like§ very hard. You＊re dancing at the same time so it＊s hard, but it＊s your job to make it seem easy. We desperately wanted to please our choreographer 每 that＊s how dancers should think.

But Jerry Robbins only allowed me to do the taunting scene 每 in which Anita is tormented by the Jets 每 once a day because he wanted to keep it as fresh as possible.

During rehearsals he＊d take breaks upstage and the girls would be all around him. One time I walked past Jerry and he was about to let Mickey have it. I said: ※Please, don＊t do it!§We came out of the stage door one night and there were six or so gang members who＊d come to take a look at the guys portraying their lives on stage.

" creepy clown has just . This year, horrors  and the fantastic  have thrived while other genres struggled to draw in the crowds. The Stephen King adaptation about the evil Pennywise has made nearly $180m (?134m) worldwide in its opening weekend, the biggest-ever opening for a horror. It＊s official: horror films are firmly part of the mainstream 每 for good or bad.The Conjuring ※universe§ kicked off in 2013, buoyed by the success of the . The supernatural sequels and spin-offs that followed its success have since magicked themselves into the worldwide top 30, a list that＊s more typically dominated by action, sci-fi and family films.  and  were both part of this phenomenon 每 the latter made it to number one at the US box office 每 and there＊s more to come: there are spin-offs called  (scarier than it sounds) and  in the offing, alongside. It seems audiences cannot get enough.So: why the stampede? Over to Ian Sandwell, box-office reporter at industry mag Screen International. ※There＊s always a core audience willing to turn out for a horror, and if it gets good reviews, it can cross over into the more general Friday-night crowd. Both Annabelle: Creation and It had built-in audience recognition, so that doesn＊t hurt. It is a genuinely good movie that＊s received some of the best reviews for a mainstream horror in some time. It＊s led to It being a film that can appeal across different audiences, from the generation terrified by the  to teenagers, for whom It might be their first-ever horror.§Cinema staff have noted the variety of punters pouring in to see . Picturehouse＊s Clare Binns points to the nostalgic influences in the 80s-set film. ※It＊s really a Spielberg/Lucas film for those that were too young for when those directors were cranking out their most iconic films. Stranger Things led the way.§Most contemporary horrors owe a debt to more sinister classics. Period horrors such as Annabelle have taken visual and thematic cues from supernatural 60s and 70s horror, while Get Out put a modern, racial spin on the genre with a Stepford Wives vibe, also owing a debt to Rosemary＊s Baby. The latter is echoed in , out this weekend.According to Alan Jones, director of London festival FrightFest: ※Horror is a cyclical genre. There＊s always one movie that kicks off another golden era. First it was Hammer, then Psycho, then Rosemary＊s Baby, then The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, Blair Witch, Hostel, Paranormal Activity, Saw, and now it＊s The Conjuring universe and It.§In terms of box-office success, the movie world is see-sawing between sub-genres such as slasher, psychological, paranormal, teen, comedy-horror, found-footage and . Remakes of Asian films have also made a significant dent in the box office: The Ring and The Grudge both place in the top 30 horrors of all time. And just as Last House on the Left and Night of the Living Dead helped popularise the genre in the 60s and 70s, indie hits still give studios fresh encouragement to produce mainstream horror.The rule can also work in reverse. ※There＊s a reason studios churn out horrors that are basically just loud noises without any thought to atmosphere,§ says Sandwell. ※It＊s because they generally pull in an audience on the opening weekend at least. But maybe It, which balances jump scares with likable, well-rounded characters and a genuinely creepy atmosphere, could lead to studios taking more of a risk when it comes to what constitutes ＆mainstream＊ horror.§While a film based on jump scares and young kids bonding seems relatively benign, the rise of so-called torture porn raises more troubling questions. I＊m a big fan of paranormal horror but found the extremes of Hostel and Saw, which contain extended torture scenes, the most challenging part of my otherwise rewarding job as a film critic. A teenage horror fan once told me: ※It＊s fine if you don＊t imagine it is happening to you.§ Aren＊t we supposed to be identifying with the characters we see on screen? And if we＊re not, are we becoming dangerously desensitised?Alice Haylett Bryan, a lecturer in film studies at King＊s College, London, says: ※Certain subgenres of horror are undoubtedly getting more extreme, but this is the case across culture as a whole, with computer games and television programmes such as The Walking Dead. We are now living in an age where real acts of violence, and indeed death, have been screened on Facebook and YouTube. Could it not be argued that this desensitises viewers on a more fundamental and concerning level?§If she＊s right, then perhaps this overall desensitisation is making younger people bolder in their movie choices. ※I see horror constantly regenerating and attracting a much younger audience who can now access content in the way we never could, and are getting intrigued by what the genre possibilities are,§ says Alan Jones. The good news for cinemas is that today＊s teens and twentysomethings watch horror on the big screen as well as on streams or downloads. Student Andrew Williams, 19, recently went to see It with his friends. He says: ※The best horror movies need to be watched in total darkness with surround sound and silence, but with other people around you so that there is an atmosphere of fear in the room.§ As for choosing what to watch: ※We decide as a group. Many of my friends don＊t love horror, so it has to be enticing.§With easy access to trailers and online reviews, it＊s easy to see how recent generations may be persuaded to shell out for cinema tickets when their parents and grandparents would have opted for DVD or video. Williams＊s experience also highlights the influence of peer pressure: young people have always been more inclined to use cinema outings as social experiences and may be led by dominant members of their social group. Mike Berry 每 a clinical forensic psychologist at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, says: ※Most people go in small groups to the cinema. Individuals apparently enjoy horror films more in the presence of a stronger character, and less when with someone else who is weak and frightened.§It＊s not just age that＊s altering: Jones says the gender gap is narrowing. ※The female demo at FrightFest has grown consistently over the years: now I＊d say it was roughly 60% male, 40% female.§ Picturehouse＊s Binns,says: ※Women are now just as keen to see and openly enjoy what was seen in the past as a ＆boys＊ subject matter＊.§ Steve Oram, writer and star of British horror comedy Sightseers, suggests: ※Horror has a much wider gender appeal these days. It＊s less for sweaty teenaged boys in shorts. And that＊s a good thing!§All in all, horror looks on the way to becoming cinema＊s most reliable profit-generator. But surely not everyone likes scary movies? Perhaps the typical traits of a horror fan are more common than we think these days. Berry says: ※There is a significant correlation between people who accept rule-breaking behaviour and have an interest in horror movies. People who watch horror films want to be frightened, excited and scared, yet psychologically distance themselves from the reality.§That＊s a change from the moral panics of the 80s and 90s. ※Twenty years ago,§ continues Berry, ※it was suggested people who loved the blood and gore displayed low empathy, with males often strongly identifying with the villain while ＆thrill watchers＊ displayed empathy with the victims, and liked the suspense of the film.§Berry also cites Carl Jung on the genre＊s more general appeal. ※Apparently, he believed horror films ＆tapped into primordial archetypes buried deep in our collective subconscious 每 images like shadow and mother play an important role in the horror genre＊. Others have argued that people watch violent horror films to relieve themselves of aggressive feelings.§Haylett Bryanpoints to the wider meaning of horror booms. ※The political and cultural climate undoubtedly influences both the production and reception of horror cinema. The success of Get Out and its exploration of the fetishisation and exploitation of the black body is testament to that. How horror cinema responds to the Trump presidency through the types of film produced, for example, will be very interesting. But across international horror as a whole, over the last 10 years or so, the rise in far-right political support has been reflected in narratives that allegorically or directly explore race, immigration and nationhood.§Gareth Tunley, who directed the British psychological horror The Ghoul, says: ※Horror writers have to tap into the subconscious in order to access anything remotely scary, so exploring the things the rest of society would prefer swept under the carpet or locked up in the woodshed goes with the territory.§So is there something about our current society that is driving people into the cinemas, seeking scares? Stephen Prince is professor of cinema at Virginia Tech. ※Whether or not the world is a more dangerous place today than in earlier eras is debatable. How many of us, for example, would choose to live in a time before antibiotics? But people today may feel they are under greater threats than ever before. Part of this is due to the interconnected world - the internet magnifies a sense of peril. More people in US die from car accidents than from terrorist attacks, but terrorism seems much scarier than cars because it gets plenty of news coverage.  films address questions that continue to haunt us, and these have to do with the frailty of the human body, the fragility of our hold on life, and the ambiguities about what a human being is and why people can＊t be trusted to remain reliably human.§As for the opening weekend of It, Margee Kerr, a sociologist and the author of , takes a topical approach. ※After weathering, literally and figuratively, two hurricanes and a political climate to match, we＊re all ready to escape reality for a while and fight a monster we know we can beat. There is a real sense of satisfaction when our fears are made real, at least real on the big screen, and we can celebrate their defeat.§※Maybe the worse things get in the real world, the more we need the emotional release of being scared half to death,§ says Tunley. ※When you＊re living in a world which may end in nuclear fire at any point, a bit of casual onscreen dismemberment seems an appealing bit of light relief.§Send in the clowns.

"his is life,§  told the Yorkshire Post in 1987, defending the film version of her play Rita, Sue and Bob Too. ※The facts are there.§ Dunbar was adamant about telling the truth in her work, insisting ※you write what＊s said, you don＊t lie§. Her second play, an unvarnished tale of a married man having an affair with his teenage babysitters, still has that startling matter-of-factness today.As a single mother living in poverty on a council estate in Bradford, Dunbar had a perspective that has rarely been shared on major stages. It＊s hard to imagine a play like The Arbor, the autobiographical script she wrote as a teenager, making it to the stage now. In another age of austerity, under another Tory government, putting on her work is an implicitly political gesture.Dunbar, though, was more concerned with everyday drama than with ideology. There＊s only one explicit political critique in Rita, Sue and Bob Too, and it comes from one of the play＊s least sympathetic characters. Bob tells his young paramours ※there＊s no hope for kids today, and it＊s all Maggie Thatcher＊s fault§. But the lecture＊s quickly dropped 每 Rita and Sue are far more interested in getting a ※jump§ than in chatting politics.Out of Joint＊s revival, directed by Dunbar＊s early champion  and Kate Wasserberg, preserves that unabashed pursuit of pleasure. The lights come up to the distinctive opening beats of , and between scenes the characters dance to a soundtrack of ,  and . No one throws themselves into it more than Rita (Taj Atwal) and Sue (Gemma Dobson), who enter with equal vigour into their menage a trois with Bob.The sex at the centre of the play is both joyful and mundane. The first scene, in which Bob (a swaggering, long-haired James Atherton) takes turns shagging the two girls in his car, is sex at its most unsexy. It＊s awkward, bum-jiggling and intensely funny. Yes, funny, despite the queasy undertones of a man in his late 20s seducing a pair of 15-year-olds. There＊s no judgment in Dunbar＊s play or in Stafford-Clark＊s and Wasserberg＊s direction, which in some ways 每 and despite the near-constant humour 每 makes it all the more appalling. When the girls get blamed and labelled ※sluts§, there＊s a bleak sense that this is just how it is.The Buttershaw estate, where Dunbar lived and died, and where she got the inspiration for her plays, looms large in this staging, as it does in all treatments of the playwright＊s life and work. It＊s there, exerting an irresistible pull, throughout , Adelle Stripe＊s compelling new fictionalisation of Dunbar＊s life. And in Clio Barnard＊s extraordinary 2010 film , which unsettlingly places interviews with Dunbar＊s family in the mouths of lip-syncing actors, while scenes from the writer＊s work are also staged in the middle of the estate, with residents looking curiously on.In Out of Joint＊s Rita, Sue and Bob Too, tower blocks rise up on either side of the stage, while the back wall shows a view of Bradford spread out beneath the moors. Tim Shortall＊s design, though overly literal in its evocation of Buttershaw, is a reminder of the limited horizon Rita and Sue have ahead of them. The reclining car seats manoeuvred around the stage are a fleeting symbol of freedom and fun; when things begin to turn sour, they get briskly removed. In another of the transitions, the older generation tug factory overalls on to a reluctant Rita and Sue, dressing them in the futures they were always destined for. The laughter begins to curdle.In some ways, though, there＊s an innocence to these scenes, underlined by the dorky dance moves and 80s party tracks. When I spoke to director  about his recent revival of Jim Cartwright＊s Road, set in Lancashire and written in the same period as Rita, Sue and Bob Too, he observed that the play depicts a community pre-heroin. As Dunbar＊s daughter Lorraine puts it in A State Affair, the verbatim play that revisited Buttershaw in 2000, if it was written today, then ※Rita and Sue would be smackheads§.Dunbar told the truth, but in the end it didn＊t make a difference. ※They＊ll forget about us all by tomorrow,§ she astutely predicted of the middle-class audiences fascinated by the drama of the Buttershaw estate. When Dunbar died of a brain haemorrhage in 1990 at the age of 29, she was stuck in the same poverty in which she was born. For the people Dunbar wrote about 每 and, as Barnard＊s film devastatingly shows, for her own children 每 life has only got worse. As Sue＊s mum recognises, the best that kids like Rita and Sue can hope for is to get their fun while they can.																																											"
"He is one of Britain＊s biggest actors, a Hollywood A-lister known for his performances in The Talented Mr Ripley, Sherlock Holmes and The Young Pope. Yet  managed to cause a security scare at a cinema in Bath last week after staff failed to recognise him.Bath Odeon employees were told to monitor a hooded man who was ※acting suspiciously§ by loitering in the foyer of the cinema last Wednesday. The cinema＊s manager had failed to spot that the man was Law, who was trying to keep a low profile while attending a screening of historical drama Detroit. Eventually cinema attendant Connor Walter recognised Law and asked for a picture with him, as well as giving the actor a hand-written message. Law later sent Walter an email thanking him for his ※kind note§.※I was working as the ticket tearer stood at the bottom of the stairs, and my manager told me to keep an eye on a man acting suspiciously with his hood up in the main foyer,§ . ※The man spent a good 10 minutes just standing around on the phone, then he came and bought a ticket from one of my colleagues and my colleague who served him the ticket did not recognise him. He came to the bottom of the stairs and I tore his ticket, I looked at his eyes and recognised him, then he said ＆thanks＊ and I just knew it was him within an instant. ※If I had not been working that night, nobody else would have recognised him as he was very unrecognisable with his black hoodie and beard,§ he said.After the screening Walter approached Law and asked for a photo with the actor, before slipping a note ※praising him for his work over the years§ into his back pocket. Walter later received an email from Law thanking him, and apologising for his swift departure.※From one movie madman to another... thanks for your kind note,§ Law wrote. ※Sorry I ran off.

"rom True Detective to , TV doesn＊t generally do nuance when tackling the sex industry. Sex workers are most often reduced to caricatures 每 the mute victim who exists solely to be either killed or saved, or the ※happy hooker§ who＊s chosen sex as a vocation.So it＊s no wonder David Simon＊s latest drama The Deuce, set in the New York sex industry of the 1970s, launched in the US to such rapturous acclaim this weekend. Critics praised its ※clear-eyed attention to detail§ and ※intelligence§, while Variety went so far as to call it a ※worthy successor§ to Simon＊s most famous work, the critically adored The Wire.But for all the pre-show hype about James Franco playing identical twins, The Deuce places women centre stage. And ensuring these women were not portrayed, in any way, as broken, was crucial. ※The female characters are fully rounded,§ says one of the show＊s writers, Lisa Lutz. ※They might make some bad choices, they might have some terrible experiences, but they are not silent victims.§ Along with novelist , in April Lutz joined The Deuce＊s writer＊s room 每 already populated by crime writers including [the programme＊s co-creator] George Pelecanos and . And this strong contingent of women, not just among the writers but the producers and directors too, goes a long way to explaining that nuanced, complex depiction of female characters.The show constantly plays with audience expectations. An early scene sees confident pimp CeCe pick the seemingly naive Lori straight off the bus from the Midwest. Taking her to his car, he attempts to dazzle her with his big city style, giving her the whole ※You＊re in New York now baby§ shtick. Far from being bowled over, she responds with a sarcastic eye-roll, snarking: ※Shit CeCe ＃ is this New York City, or did I fall off the fucking Greyhound in Cleveland?§※I read that scene and thought I＊ve got to write for this show,§ says Abbott. ※I loved how it took something we＊ve seen before 每 the innocent girl out of her depth in the city 每 and turned it on its head.§ That＊s not to say The Deuce shies away from the tougher moments. CeCe might tolerate Lori＊s snappy comebacks, but his abusive treatment of the other women in his stable makes it clear that the laidback charm is little more than a facade. Similarly, when the sweet-natured Darlene smartly turns her clients＊ failings to her advantage 每 convincing one regular to pay her double because they＊ve watched a movie rather than had sex, meaning she＊s been gone twice the time 每 her hustle is born of desperation: she knows her violent pimp Larry won＊t accept her earning less or dropping her guard to be kind. ※There are scenes which might be difficult to watch from a modern perspective,§ says Michelle MacLaren, who directed the opening and closing episodes. ※One of the first things George [Pelecanos] said to me was we want the 1971 version of this show, not the present-day one. We had to remember this is the pre-Aids era and certain things we take for granted now, attitudes towards women and sex, were not looked at as clearly in this time.§ Executive producer Nina Noble, a long-time collaborator of Simon＊s, admits that this difference in attitudes made her unsure how the series would be received. ※It＊s a fine line between wanting to explore the reality of the women＊s situations and yet also wanting to shy away from that reality,§ she says. ※We knew that, like The Wire, the key to success lay in the details.§ Despite the writers＊ extensive research, talking to many sex workers, especially people who worked in that era, Noble wasn＊t sure how people would respond: it is a challenging watch. ※The key to it is that it＊s never sexy or titillating. We＊re not trying to turn people on.§It helps that in addition to being unflinching and well-researched, The Deuce also has a dark and bawdy sense of humour. In the opener, Simon and Pelecanos smartly invert another trope when Maggie Gyllenhaal＊s entrepreneurial Candy finds herself dealing with an overeager teenager. It＊s a story we＊re used to seeing from the male＊s point of view; the coming-of-age ritual gone humiliatingly wrong. Instead, The Deuce gives us a short, sharp economics lesson from Candy. This isn＊t five minutes in heaven, it＊s business 每 and just because a customer is easy doesn＊t mean he gets the chance to go again. ※It＊s not afraid to show characters cracking jokes or being amused by the situations they find themselves in,§ says Lutz. ※That felt true to life, that even in terrible situations people often find something to laugh about.§Abbott agrees. ※We didn＊t want every episode to just be grim and hopeless for the women, because that would be unwatchably sad. But at the same time, if we made them all Holly Golightly＊s, tripping through their experiences without a care, it wouldn＊t work either.§Most crucially, the sex is never glamourised. ※Whenever a sexual transaction 每 one in which money changes hands 每 occurs, it is shot in a very matter-of-fact way,§ says MacLaren. ※This is a series that deals with misogyny, the objectification of women and the commodification of sex. For those themes to resonate, we had to shoot the action honestly.§It is that refusal to sugarcoat the story which gives The Deuce its power 每 and has led to those stellar reviews. ※It offers a total immersion into this complicated world in a way that is both entertaining and interesting,§ says Noble. And like all of Simon＊s best work, it refuses to provide easy answers. ※There is definitely a version of this show where there are no female writers and all the women are victims or perfect,§ says Abbott. ※But that show wouldn＊t have  in charge.§																																											"
"lack lives are too easy to take in America because we don＊t want to question why people are so afraid of black and brown people to begin with,§ says Yance Ford, bluntly. ※And that＊s what I want Strong Island to do.§When Ford began making his documentary, 10 years ago, this was not a question that the US was particularly interested in asking itself. In the intervening years, following a succession of slayings of innocent and unarmed African Americans, it has become part of a national conversation 每 although it is turning into more of a national argument. What began for Ford as an intimate, personal film now finds itself part of that argument.※When I started this, it was: ＆I have to get this burden off my chest,＊§ he says. ※Then, in 2012, when  was shot, everyone came out of the woodwork like: ＆Your story＊s so relevant! So relevant!＊ I saw the word ＆relevant＊ in my Facebook feed, like, a million times that year. Then I jumped off social media, but I wasn＊t able to turn off the world. It kept happening and happening.§Ford＊s documentary focuses tightly on the taking of a single life: that of his elder brother. One night in April 1992, William Ford Jr, a 24-year-old African American, was shot dead by Mark Reilly, a young white mechanic. Ford was unarmed. He had gone to Reilly＊s Long Island auto-repair shop to pick up his car. They got into an argument. There were no witnesses to the shooting itself, although there were plenty of people around, including Ford＊s friend Kevin Myers. When the police showed up, they treated Myers, and the dying Ford, like criminals, rather than victims. The shooter, meanwhile, was discreetly spirited away from the crime scene.※Just wait till we get to court,§ said Ford＊s mother as they buried William. But the case never went to court: an all-white grand jury decided, behind closed doors, that there was no basis to indict the shooter. It was a simple case of self-defence and ※reasonable fear§. That＊s just about all the Ford family were told. The case file remains sealed.Strong Island is not an investigative documentary. Ford＊s attempts to speak to those involved with the case are rebuffed. Questions about official procedure, conduct and extra-judicial influence go unanswered. The film is more an anatomy of an injustice 每 one that many African American families will recognise.Ford registers the slow, devastating impact of the incident on his family. Their father died after a stroke within a year of William＊s death. His mother, Barbara, speaks eloquently and movingly of her loss, and the silence that fell over the grieving household. She died in 2012, during the production of the film. Ford believes that 20 years of ※stress and self-blame and second-guessing and disappointment and anger§ contributed to her death.Meanwhile, Ford himself 每 now a transgender man 每 was then a student coming to terms with his sexual identity. ※I pivoted from going to the counselling centre to figure out how I was going to come out [as a lesbian] to my family to going to the counselling centre to figure out how I was going to deal with my brother being murdered.§What makes Strong Island stand out 每 and what earned it awards at Sundance, Sheffield and other film festivals 每 is its combination of universal resonance and personal authorship. In the former instance, it is an emblematic tale of shattered faith in the American dream. We learn how the Ford family moved north to escape the ingrained discrimination of the south, where Ford＊s grandfather died of an asthma attack in a ※coloureds only§ doctor＊s waiting room, yards away from medical help. We learn how Long Island＊s racism was better concealed 每 how black families were permitted to buy property only in a few tightly zoned areas. His parents became public-sector workers: his father worked on the trains; his mother taught female inmates at New York＊s Rikers Island prison. William was also a teacher, and was training to become a corrections officer when he was shot. These were people who believed that American society would provide for them if they played by the rules.※She expected it to work out,§ Ford says of his mother. ※But we＊ve seen that, however strongly you buy into the American dream, however many of the rules of blackness that America draws for you you follow, no matter what you do, who you are, where you are, you are not safe, and that＊s quite a heavy thing to realise,§ says Ford.In the latter case, Strong Island avoids standard documentary techniques and establishes its own unique aesthetic. Ford trained as an artist and architectural welder, and worked as a documentary series editor before and during the film＊s long production period. He has clearly had time to think about it. The story is punctuated with carefully composed tableaux that express the unsayable: a blind, flapping in an empty room; a time-lapse cloud bursting over the family home. And in several striking scenes, Ford addresses the camera directly and frankly, his shaved head looming out of a black background and filling the frame. ※I＊m not angry,§ he says to the viewer at one point. ※I＊m also not willing to accept that someone else gets to say who William was. And if you＊re uncomfortable with me asking these questions, you should probably get up and go.§ It is an arresting device, both confrontational and confessional.※I had a list of 10 rules when we started Strong Island, and one of them was: ＆Yance will never appear on camera with sync sound,＊§ Ford laughs. ※I sort of did that director＊s trick of: ＆Let＊s just shoot it anyway, even if we＊re never going to use it.＊§ He was being interviewed by other film-makers for those scenes, he explains. Just like his own subjects, he didn＊t know what questions he was going to be asked. His responses surprised him: ※I was saying things out loud that I had never said before.§At one point, for example, Ford talks about how he has never wanted to see an image of his brother＊s killer. As a result, he says: ※I think he looks like, no offence to present company, every white man I＊ve ever seen ＃ he looks like anybody, anyone, everyone. He＊s everywhere.§It＊s a bold admission. Did he think twice about putting it in? ※No, because it＊s true. What black people are almost always called upon to do, and we saw this with the Charleston shootings [in which nine churchgoers were killed by a white-supremacist in 2015], is to forgive and offer redemption. I have  interest in forgiving anybody. I have  interest in telling a redemption story. I have no interest in giving Mark Reilly any space in this film. When you shoot my brother, you＊ve said everything to me that you have to say.§But is there a danger that characterising all white people as potential killers is mirroring the racism he is calling out? Isn＊t such ※othering§ only strengthening the racial divide?※I＊ll tell you why I don＊t think it is,§ he says. ※White communities, and I exempt  white communities from this, have power over their representation. White people have the ability to define themselves, to exert their agency in a way that they get to be believed. No one believes black people. No one. Until a white person vouches for them. That＊s what so many of these murders have in common: ＆Strong, scary, big, black, angry, out-of-control＊. How many times are we going to have to hear that about a black person? So I reject that it＊s an othering.§It is no cause for celebration that the ※relevance§ of Strong Island, and other films presenting the African American experience, continues to grow. The first time I spoke with Ford, it was already clear that the Trump administration was set on rolling back Obama-era reforms to the criminal justice system. In July, attorney general Jeff Sessions, for example, announced plans to reinstate mandatory minimum sentences for minor drugs offences such as marijuana possession, which have disproportionately affected black and Latino citizens. Since then, we have had President Trump＊s pardoning of sheriff Joe Arpaio, not to mention heavily armed Nazis, Klansmen and white supremacists marching through Charlottesville, a grotesque spectacle compounded by Trump＊s failure to condemn them.※The imagery is straight out of the south from which my parents fled,§ says Ford when we speak again. ※They could have been marching towards a cross to set it on fire.§ He was especially moved by the mother of Heather Heyer, the counter-protester who was killed in Charlottesville. Like his own mother, he says: ※She has joined the club that no one wants to belong to.§ ※In perhaps the darkest moment of her life, at her daughter＊s funeral, that she was able to rise to the occasion and provide a clear moral voice for our country shows how the burden of bearing grief and surviving and living with the homicide of your child is also coupled with the unbearable responsibility of stepping into the role of spokesperson.§As for the presidential pardoning of sheriff Arpaio, Ford notes that it is ※a de facto admission of guilt. To use such a powerful tool to essentially undermine the courts to support a man who has been judged, after years of investigation, to be wilfully violating human rights, engaging in racial profiling, who was voted out of office by his district, but who still doesn＊t think he＊s done anything wrong. It＊s horrifying.§ These incidents do, at least, provide incontrovertible proof of the racism in US society whose existence Ford and so many other African American families have asserted for decades. In the past, it was denied; now it is acknowledged and accommodated, which is even worse.I am reminded of the quote attributed to Martin Luther King, which President Obama had embroidered into a rug in the White House: ※The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.§ In the Obama era, it felt as if that was starting to happen; now, less so.※Now it＊s more: ＆Will it or won＊t it?＊§ Ford agrees. The counter-narrative is already pushing back, he says. He expects to be in the line of fire himself when Strong Island is released. ※And I will push right back against it,§ he says. ※Because I can do now in 2017 what my family was unable to do in 1992, and I am bound and determined for that arc to bend towards justice for my family.§What has become starkly clear is that it doesn＊t just bend itself.※Some people gotta bend it!§ he says with a smile. ※You know, I＊m a welder. I know how to bend things. You just need a little bit of heat over a long period of time.§																																											"

"here＊s nothing more dangerous than a writer whose feelings have been hurt.§ The speaker is Joan Castleman, the charming, enigmatically discreet and supportive wife of world-famous author and New York literary lion Joe Castleman. It is a fascinating and bravura performance from Glenn Close, in this hugely enjoyable dark comedy from director Bj?rn Runge, adapted by Jane Anderson from the novel by Meg Wolitzer. Perhaps it＊s Close＊s career-best 每 unnervingly subtle, unreadably calm, simmering with self-control. Her Joan is a study in marital pain, deceit and the sexual politics of prestige. It＊s a portrayal to put alongside Close＊s appearances in Dangerous Liaisons and Fatal Attraction. This is an unmissable movie for  fans. Actually, you can＊t watch it without becoming a fan 每 if you weren＊t one already.The Castlemans are on the plane to Sweden, ready for Joe to get the Nobel prize. Yet they are being pestered on the flight by a certain Nathaniel Bone, part stalker-fan, part parasitic hack who wants Joe to cooperate with a warts-and-all biography he is planning to write. Joe gives him the contemptuous brush-off but Joan cautiously advises a more diplomatic treatment. It is a key moment in this hugely enjoyable drama when things begin to fall apart. Jonathan Pryce is excellent as the cantankerous and conceited old writer, a man now childishly addicted to praise and luxuriating in his colossal quasi-Bellow reputation.  is the insidious and dangerous Bone. Max Irons plays Joe＊s moody son David who also has plans to be writer, desperately needing the old man＊s approval and yet prickly and resentful at Joe＊s sorrowing criticisms of his work 每 criticisms which do not convey any great reassurance that his son has chosen the right career. And there is an unsettling moment in his Stockholm hotel suite when the great man appears not to recognise the name of one of his own characters. Is Joe succumbing to dementia?And of course Close plays Joan, a woman much loved and admired within Joe＊s circle of acquaintance: supportive helpmeet, mother 每 soon to be grandmother 每 and deeply affectionate spouse, apparently happy with a life lived in the titan＊s shadow. Yet everyone is aware of a difficult truth; despite Joe blandly telling people at these cocktail parties that his wife ※doesn＊t write§, Joan had her own literary ambitions as a young woman. Joe＊s moment of Nobel triumph appears to be triggering a late-life crisis in Joan.Flashbacks to the 1950s and 60s show her as a co-ed taking a creative writing class with the young, insufferably pompous and married Professor Joe Castleman 每 who has himself only published minor short stories. She flirts, babysits his children and submits an outrageously seductive short story to his class, entitled The Faculty Wife. Things go as expected and soon Joan is wife number two, with a perennial suspicion that as Joe＊s eye once roved to her, it could rove on to other people. Joe continues to stray, right up to the Nobel ceremony 每 and the film＊s present-day section is set in the Clinton 1990s, when denying having sexual relations with younger women had become a political trope.The film shows how Joan＊s own literary ambitions began to wither in that sexist time and place: Elizabeth McGovern has an amusing cameo as an embittered minor author who advises her to give it all up. Later she gets a job as a reader in a publishing house whose smug and cynical editors are looking for ※a Jewish writer§. Shrewdly, she puts Joe＊s manuscript forward and his journey to greatness has begun. The intrusive and insistent Bone thinks he has figured out the secret of Joe＊s success and that of their troubled marriage. The drama resembles something like John Colapinto＊s About the Author or James Hadley Chase＊s Eve. Yet for all Bone＊s investigative excitement, the movie shows he still does not fully understand the truth about them, and perhaps Joan has herself not fully understood the nature of her wifely submission until that moment. The final plot turn can be read as a parable for patriarchal politics and the artist＊s prestige: when people read novels, they are not merely responding to a text, they are consuming the artist＊s prestige and reputation, which is itself a created performance. It is a smart, supremely watchable and entertaining film, and Close gives a wonderful star turn.																																											"
"ongratulations Karen Bradley! The secretary of state for culture, media and sport has become the first Conservative in office since John Major to stand up to Rupert Murdoch in his quest to expand his global media empire. Mrs Bradley had been considering the bid by 21st Century Fox, effectively controlled by the Murdoch family, to buy the remaining 61% of Sky, the pan-European broadcaster and internet services provider, that it does not already own. She had been minded to refer the bid on the grounds of media plurality to the competition watchdog 每 the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) 每 on the advice of the broadcasting regulator Ofcom, the prospect of which would hardly cause Mr Murdoch much lost sleep, since his  with  web giants like Google. When it came to broadcasting standards, Ofcom dismissed concerns over the Murdochs＊ commitment to the taste and truthfulness of his companies＊ output. This opens up a new front against Mr Murdoch, who has expressed a wish to make . The ※Foxification§ of Murdoch＊s UK news station is something, the culture secretary correctly points out, that should be investigated. What is remarkable is that Mrs Bradley has done the right thing by looking at the questions of character, culture and criminality that the rest of the world fixates on when dealing with the Murdochs. Ofcom, on the other hand, has questions to answer about its apparent naivety in dealing with the takeover. When Ofcom discovered that Fox News had no code of compliance despite broadcasting in this country, it allowed Fox to produce one and abide by it. Just a day after Fox News put in a place its code, it ran a  story, politically significant in the US, besmirching the reputation of a murdered Democratic National Committee official, saying he had been a traitor. The story , but four months on, no action has been taken against those responsible. There has been no apology to the dead man＊s family, who publicly explained that claims of . In August Fox News, acting CEO Rupert Murdoch, was taken . If actions can be interpreted as an admission of wrongdoing, then Fox News is guilty. But so is Ofcom. The regulator failed first to police Fox News and then to recognise that the legal threshold for referring the bid on grounds of broadcasting standards was low, and easily met in the case of the Murdochs. That was a mistake by Ofcom 每 and one the culture secretary could not repeat.This is not the end of the matter, it is the end of the beginning. The CMA must reassure the public that it will act without fear or favour, and prove it is capable of running a high-profile, complex and politically sensitive inquiry. The scope of the investigation must include how the Murdochs seek to influence politics. . In this country peers have raised concerns that the TV viewing, internet and phone records of  were the Murdochs to own 100% of Sky. While impartiality laws govern broadcasters, net neutrality rules, in force in the UK as a result of EU law, prevent the misuse of gatekeeper powers over the internet. Above all, the CMA will need to gauge the Murdochs＊ commitment to standards. There must be an emphasis on whether it is right to concentrate so much media power in the hands of the Murdochs, with their companies＊ history of  and .																																											"

"∴∴∴∴∴Mental health is poorly enough understood today, so how did people deal with psychological disorders before we even had the language to identify such conditions? That＊s the central question in , which follows Senua, a Pict woman, as she embarks on a quest to rescue a loved one from the Norse underworld.The mythology of gods and demons fits too easily with Senua＊s troubled perceptions and the game does an exceptional job of conveying that to the player, questioning the legitimacy of what＊s happening.

"o shrinking violet when it came to letting her wishes be known,  was never more oppressively assertive than in deploying her band of biddable grandchildren to raise Europe from discord into bliss, yoked together by royal alliances through which the liberal vision of the queen＊s revered late husband, Prince Albert, would mature and flourish. Peace would be guaranteed throughout a continent that had been torn apart by Napoleon＊s depredations. Britain, working hand in gilded glove with a unified Germany (led by Victoria＊s eldest daughter and an enlightened imperial spouse), would naturally enjoy supreme control.That was the idea, and it was partly due to Victoria＊s manipulative energy that seven of her 42 grandchildren eventually became crowned rulers. Much of the pathos of Deborah Cadbury＊s absorbing book stems from our knowledge of what happened next.At home, Victoria naturally began by seeking a suitable wife for the Prince of Wales＊s eldest boy. George, the obedient younger brother, was dispatched to sea while the English throne＊s dissolute future heir was pressed upon the queen＊s favourite granddaughter, the beautiful and motherless Alexandra of Hesse. Eddy (short for Albert Edward) was ※good and affectionate§, the young man＊s grandmother beseeched a reluctant Alexandra, while shooing a handsome Russian grand duke away from her equally lovely sister, Ella.Both schemes failed. Ella, laden with jewels that annoyingly outdazzled those adorning England＊s own incomparable monarch, married her Russian Sergei. Eddy, rejected by Alexandra, found himself conscripted into an alliance with the pleasingly anglicised (she grew up in Richmond) May of Teck. Dear May was so much better suited to the English throne than ※eine kleine deutsche Prinzessin§, Victoria tactlessly crowed to her eldest daughter, Vicky, herself the widowed mother of three Prussian princesses.Fate outwitted her latest matchmaking plot. In January 1892, six weeks before his wedding, Eddy unhelpfully died of diphtheria, leaving his fiancee stranded, if not altogether bereft. Briskly reslotted into a marriage with the next in line, the accommodating May became one of Victoria＊s success stories. As Queen Mary, consort of George V, her notoriously acquisitive habits as a guest proved less important than the conscientious fulfilment of her royal role. King George, though he regretted being deprived of his own heart＊s choice (※Missy§, the future Queen Marie of Romania, was snatched away by a Russian mother whose matchmaking skills vied with Victoria＊s own), might have done a lot worse.Anarchy was the brooding giant that overshadowed Queen Victoria＊s manipulative scheming in her role as ※universal grandmother§. Cadbury＊s book opens with the shocking 1881 assassination of Tsar Alexander II. When Alexandra of Hesse, supported by her tricksy German cousin Willy, the future kaiser, agreed to convert faiths in order to marry Nicky Romanov (this was a real love match), Victoria felt terrified. Her fear increased when the sudden death of the groom＊s powerful father (Alexander III) precipitated Nicky into a role for which everyone perceived the weak young man to be woefully unsuited. ※May God help them,§ wrote the ageing queen. It was as if, in 1894, Victoria had foreseen what was to come.What followed was shock upon shock. Elizabeth of Austria was stabbed to death in 1898 (with a meticulously sharpened industrial needle). The Prince of Wales narrowly escaped being murdered in 1900, the year King Umberto of Italy was killed. In 1905, Elizabeth of Hesse＊s Russian husband, Sergei, died when his royal carriage was blown to bits. In 1906, a bomb narrowly missed Ena, the youngest of Victoria＊s granddaughters, bloodying her wedding dress during celebrations of her marriage to the king of Spain.The fall of the Romanovs occupies the superb last pages of Cadbury＊s book. Alexandra of Hesse had lost the support even of Ella long before she herself faced a firing squad in 1917, huddled with her children in a dank cellar. Shot at again and again, the Romanov women mysteriously eluded death. Later, as the corpses were hauled on to a truck, a sudden spew of diamonds revealed the secret of the Romanovs＊ survival. Each dress was densely lined with jewels, concealed for their ill-fated flight.Dynastic mergers, we may deduce from Deborah Cadbury＊s account, offer no defence against the whims of history.

"et inside an apartment in war-torn Damascus, this lean thriller feels more like a play than a film. Though the mood is tense and claustrophobic, it＊s all a little too abrupt. The house＊s cramped kitchen becomes a makeshift panic room, with nine tenants squashed into one room as gunfire ricochets around the building＊s exterior. In charge is Oum Yazan (Hiam Abbas), a stern matriarch who protects her ageing father, young children and maid, as well as a neighbour, Halima, and her newborn baby, with the fierceness of a lioness. The apartment is her home and ※no one will force me out of it§, she declares. In contrast to Yazan＊s cold fury is the tender rage that spills out of the rosy-cheeked Halima (Diamand Bou Abboud). Abboud＊s physical performance is particularly brilliant 每 frightened and fidgety, a startled rabbit fighting for her life. Though it＊s not gratuitous exactly, at times the film is difficult to watch; director Philippe Van Leeuw captures both the everyday horror of living through war and the lurking threat of sexual violence.

" young woman stares at you through binoculars at the beginning of this exquisite selection of drawings and paintings by . She holds them firmly against her face, obscuring its upper half and casting her mouth and chin in shadow. Instead of her eyes looking back at you, a pair of glistening dark lenses protrude from her skull like the huge eyes of an inscrutable insect.It is a disconcertingly modern alienation device. Instead of being gazed at, this woman gazes: the more you look at the frills of her black and pink clothes, the more she scrutinises you. Is it a feminist statement, a conceptualist joke? This masterpiece, drawn in 1869, is at the very least a confession of the artist＊s unease with his own voyeurism. The tension it reveals 每 between the urge to look and the fear of being looked at 每 is a clue to the art of Degas, an enigma who hides himself in cold ecstasies of colour.In 1971, close to the end of his life, Picasso etched a filthy series of satirical portraits of Degas visiting a brothel, just to look. He portrays Degas as an obsessive voyeur. This was not a slander: Degas did create a series of voyeuristic studies of a Paris brothel in the 1870s and Picasso collected them. This exhibition reveals how close to the knuckle Picasso was. It culminates in a superbly sensual and entrancingly strange display of the uninhibited nudes Degas created late in his career.Sir William Burrell was not quite as singleminded a collector of Degas as Picasso 每 nor, sadly, did he own any of the great impressionist＊s brothel scenes 每 but the Glasgow shipping magnate had a very good eye for the rich variety of media Degas uses and the uncanny intensity of his vision. This free exhibition sensitively mixes treasures by Degas from the Burrell Collection in Glasgow, currently closed for refurbishment, with some of the National Gallery＊s choicest examples. The result is a ravishing, revealing window on Degas＊s inner world. critics used to talk about Degas as if he was sexless. This self-proclaimed celibate, who according to his contemporary Manet was ※incapable of loving a woman§, has been bowdlerised and sentimentalised so that we can think of his depictions of ballet dancers as an artistic safe space. Think again. This exhibition puts his ballet dancers next to his nudes and the comparison is unsettling. What was the difference, for Degas, in watching dance rehearsals and visiting a brothel? In both cases he was just looking, but in neither case was that voyeurism innocent.In his 1898 pastel Dancers on a Bench, he observes as performers adjust their shoes and take a rest: as one of them leans forward to hold her ankle, he coolly contemplates her cleavage. In After the Bath, a sketch in charcoal and pastel from the Burrell, he uses a fantastically chunky style to render a woman＊s wet hair and naked back.The chance to directly compare the carnality with which Degas depicts women having their hair brushed, or drying themselves after a bath, and the physical energy of his dancers reveals what a complex and tantalising visionary he really is. There is nothing timid or repressed about his art, but there is something transcendent and mystical in it. Degas distills so much into the experience of looking that it becomes at once erotic and sublime, a kind of religious rapture.The bodies he draws can escape gender entirely. The National Gallery＊s own After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself is based on a drawing of a male nude by Michelangelo. As she bends forward to towel her shoulder, we look at the line of her spine dividing her fleshy back. This is derived from one of Michelangelo＊s most homoerotic designs 每 and this exhibition shows it is far from the only Degas to do so. Flanking it are two equally sculptural studies of gender-ambiguous backs from the Burrell.Woman in a Tub looks back to Michelangelo＊s Crouching Boy and forward to Francis Bacon. Its nude is both male and female, athletic and frail. Huge buttocks loom out of a green bathtub that looks like a bronze dish, set against a hellish, erotic red, as if this were a wall painting from Pompeii. Degas looks and looks until he sees the essence of the human condition. What begins as voyeurism ends up seeing into the depths of what it is to be alive.																																											"
"Dishonored＊s new standalone adventure has quite the setup: you have to murder a god.Throughout the five year history of this steampunk stealth adventure series, this eponymous deity, the Outsider, has been at the centre of everything 每 dealing in regicide, revenge and all the juicy stuff in between. He＊s an omnipotent force who watches and intervenes from the void 每 a mysterious place between worlds 每 giving mortals like Billie Lurk, our new protagonist, spectral powers.In , protagonists Corvo Attano and Emily Kaldwin each had their own unique abilities to reflect their personality, gifted by the Outsider himself. This time, Billie has a newly imbued quadruplet of magical skills that suit hers 每 similar in function to what you＊ve played before but with subtle interesting twists. Displace allows Lurk to place a ghostly marker so she can instantly teleport out of danger, or to get to hard-to-reach spots; Semblance allows you to literally steal the face of an unconscious guard or civilian, using it to walk around concealed under a guise for a temporary period; and Foresight freezes time, allowing freeform disembodied perusal of your surroundings to mark guards and targets to keep track of them on your HUD.Finally, and most amusingly, you can listen to rats. The swarms of rodents offer up interesting titbits of information on the wider world and your current mission in eerie high pitched voices, and it plays directly into Lurk＊s backstory as a street urchin. Death of the Outsider also introduces a major gameplay refinement that makes your powers recharge over time, rather than require potions to power up. This removes the frustrating need to scavenge for resources, which detracted from the empowerment in the previous two games.Lurk＊s sudden promotion to leading lady is extremely welcome 每 she＊s always been one of the more intriguing personalities in an already interesting cast, and her journey from life on the grimy streets to being one of the most skilled assassins in the isles is one that deserves a spotlight, even in a story that＊s referential rather than original. Death of the Outsider also includes Billie getting back her arm 每 an appendage she spent Dishonored 2 without 每 and learning more about the Outsider himself as you find a viable route to killing him.The five-mission adventure begins with an extraction. The most infamous hired killer of them all, the legendary Daud, has been captured and is being tortured to subdue his incredible void powers. You have to rescue him and, in true Dishonored fashion, it＊s very much up to you how you do so. A year since Dishonored 2 launched, it takes this single introductory mission to get back into the mindset of how best to play a game like this 每 complex options lay everywhere for you to exploit and explore. Even the habit of looking up for multiple routes around each level takes a while to sink back in. Few games offer such systemic freedom, both in their environmental layouts and in terms of open-ended objectives, and it＊s best played at a slow pace to soak in the multitude of different avenues of completion.The next four missions make up a mostly great but inconsistent campaign. The third 每 a hazy dusklight bank heist 每 is the clear standout, and one of the most memorable set-pieces in the entire series. Options lay open from the get go, but it＊s when you finally crack into the bank itself that things get interesting. You can put staff and guards to sleep while you pursue a particular route of completion, making the mission incredibly tense and exciting thanks to incredible sound design, the presence of clockwork sentinels unaffected by sleeping gas and the ability to wake individuals up if you accidentally nudge them while you＊re manoeuvring.Despite the odd dip elsewhere in the game, there＊s largely enough freedom for you to enjoy spending time in developer ＊s beautifully detailed worlds, which its environment team revel in, creating grand interiors and dimly lit streets that ooze with an inimitable saturated style. Open hub levels make a return, too, meaning you get moments of respite before a proper mission, in which you can indulge in purchasing goods and upgrades from a nearby black market dealer 每 or you could break in and steal all the wares for yourself.Here you can also find the new additional optional contracts. These are essentially extra objectives that lie off the critical path, or parameters for completion for which you can earn extra coin. The bank heist mission challenges you to get in and out with the prize without harming a human being, for example, which at first seems like a standard ghost run, but soon proves challenging when you try to manipulate the bank＊s ultra sophisticated Jindosh-designed mobile vault without alerting anyone. To have yet more moving parts in a mission could＊ve been overwhelming in practice, but Arkane makes smart use of its objective markers to always allow you to hide things you＊re not interested in.It also avoids overwhelming players by streamlining certain parts of the experience. That means the removal of any meaningful progression of Billie＊s powers, which fits a shorter story but does lead to a sense of stagnation by the final level. Perhaps the most questionable omission is the Chaos system. This is essentially a moral compass that, in previous games, follows you depending on the choices you make and changes the outcome of certain events and even transforms entire levels. While its removal makes more sense if you considered Lurk＊s already established moral sensibilities, it definitely reduces the player experience.In the end 每 and, according to the creators this is definitely the series＊ coda 每 Death of the Outsider successfully sees out one of its most intriguing lead characters and one of its most powerful villains in a worthwhile adventure. Across six or so hours, this standalone indulgence doesn＊t add much truly new, instead relying on tweaks of its existing formula . But it delivers strong missions and an excuse to continue skulking around this fabulous and hugely atmospheric world.																																											"
"n 2002 I did a production of , a little known Phyllis Nagy play, at the Southwark Playhouse, London, where I was artistic director at the time. Suffering the usual press night nerves, I was doing my best to charm the arriving critics, when I saw the towering figure of Peter Hall coming through our modest little courtyard. My heart stopped and soared all at the same time. The legend himself. Founding director of the RSC, former artistic director of the National, Peter was the embodiment of a walking institution. And here he was, a giant in our tiny studio theatre, dressed then as he always was: dapper with a magnetic, shy smile.The next day he called me, took me out for lunch and asked me to join him as his associate as the  Company took up residence at Theatre Royal Bath. From then on he became my mentor, father figure and friend, and I absolutely adored him. I called him Peteski.We would rehearse in London with our company of shared actors, and then move to Bath for weeks on end as we mounted the season. Away from home and often from family, we would have lunch and dinner together almost every day and talk and talk and talk. He would tell me stories and share lessons he＊d learned: art, politics, life.Above all, he taught me never to be afraid of not knowing the answer, to trust that the director＊s job was to find it along the way; that the writer was always the most important person in any rehearsal room, alive or dead; that hearing the music in everything you direct is always the key; and that family was the most important thing in the whole world.He absolutely loved his sprawling family and never was there a more proud parent. In our first season, in 2003, I directed his daughter Rebecca in what was to be her second professional job playing the lead in a DH Lawrence play, , before Peter was to go on to direct her in  Peter came to watch our last run in the rehearsal room. I sat with my heart in my mouth while we waited for his reaction afterwards ... he rose from his chair, neatly suited, of course, and reached for a handkerchief to dry his eyes before he could speak. He knew then just how good an actress Rebecca was going to be, and for the only time in our 15-year friendship he was lost for words.I miss his warmth, his generosity, his kindness; his desire always to see the best in others; his power and his strength; his devotion to his work, to his family and to his wife, Nicki; his irrepressible energy; his naughty sense of humour; that big toothy smile and those crinkly eyes 每 always so warm, so inviting. Your legend lives on, Peteski.																																											"
"en years ago, during a question and answer session following a performance at London＊s Queen Elizabeth Hall,  told the audience that, in his opinion, most contemporary dance was boring. It was a combative statement that did little endear him to his fellow choreographers, but since then he has created a body of work which, while veering wildly between the thrilling and the baffling, has never been remotely boring.His big productions, works such as (2007) and  (2010), set to thundering percussive scores composed by Shechter himself, were as much rock concerts as dance pieces. They raged against demagoguery, totalitarianism and the death of truth. Specific targets for Shechter＊s fury included the state of Israel, in which he grew up, and his mother, who, he announced on the soundtrack of  (2009) ※left me when I was two years old§. These vengeful, noirish works were as compelling as they were physically deafening, but in pieces such as  (2012), a misfiring collaboration with the sculptor Antony Gormley, and (2016), a formless ※attempt to make a piece without thinking§, featuring dancers in gold unitards shouting ※Motherfucker!§ at the audience, Shechter seemed to have lost his way., which revisits Shechter＊s familiar, apocalyptic stamping ground, is a strong return to form. Choreographers have described feeling pressured to constantly reinvent themselves, but the best work, as in other artistic disciplines, is often born of an assiduous mining and re-mining of the same strip. Shechter＊s artistic vision has always been bracingly pessimistic, and the territory that he has made his own is a place of entropy, an end-time landscape of roaring winds and enclosing shadows, in which men and women caper frenziedly as extinction draws ever closer.In , Shechter gives us a ragged phalanx of the lost, battling against a maelstrom of sound and enclosing darkness. An onstage sextet plays Shechter＊s Tchaikovsky-inflected score, backed by a recorded, and very loud, percussion track. In response the dancers shuffle, shudder and whirl with manic abandon. Arms are supple-wristed and outflung, hips and shoulders are loose, centres of gravity are low. Overcome by death or exhaustion, bodies fold like string puppets.As in his earlier work, Shechter seems to be expressing an anguished loss of belief. In personal integrity, including his own (※I cheated on my wife,§ his recorded voice tells us in his 2016 work , ※I fucked someone else§), in society and its institutions, and in the consequential nature of human life when faced with the vast indifference of the universe. In his impression of a fatally fractured society, of a centre that cannot hold, we see our own panicked times reflected. There＊s a repeated motif in  of men dancing with female corpses. They carry on the lolling, floppy bodies of dead women and whirl them around, limbs flailing, to sugary waltz tunes from . Again and again in Shechter＊s work we see this hopeless striving for order 每 for things as they were before 每 in the face of chaos and collapse.If all of this sounds grim, and the ultimate danse macabre, Shechter＊s choreography is often very beautiful. Impulses ripple through swaying bodies, arms and fingers unfurl, light catches the turn of a neck. There＊s a wonderful moment when the 10-strong cast stand motionless, arms and fingers outstretched. It＊s not a freeze, it＊s a suspended moment of rapture, and it makes you wonder if, despite everything, things might just turn out all right.Much of the credit for the dramatic look of must go to the lighting designer , who paints the stage in downpouring washes of darkness against which the dancers glimmer and flicker. At times it＊s like watching scraps of old film that have been haphazardly lashed together. There＊s a sense of narratives starting to unfold, then cutting away and dissolving.Tom Scutt＊s set, which we rarely view except in near-darkness, consists of a half-dozen movable monoliths. These might be tombs, memorials or standing stones. At times they constrict the performers like prison walls. They＊re clearly central to Shechter＊s vision, but their appearance tends to signal the points at which the piece loses shape and forward momentum.Like many an auteur choreographer, Shechter too often stays his hand when he would be better advised to cut, and cut deep.  is in two parts with an interval, and in both halves Shechter ignores natural end points and lets the work meander on so that its impact dissipates. There＊s too much repetition, and too much trundling around of the set. This is a piece with many virtues, but it gives the impression of having been expanded to fill a full-length programming slot, rather than edited to its most telling and dramatic length. Cut to the bone, and perhaps to a single act,  could be Shechter＊s defining work. But it＊s not there yet.																																											"
"Late-night hosts on Wednesday addressed the fallout from Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, the latest developments in Robert Mueller＊s Russia investigation, and the violence against the Rohingya minority in Myanmar.※Last week, members of congress returned from their summer vacations, which were awesome,§  began. ※Paul Ryan blew off some steam in Venice while Mitch McConnell made his annual trip to Melbourne beach. But now Congress is back and demanding answers: why didn＊t Equifax tell us they＊d been hacked? Why can＊t Don Jr pick one lie and stick with it?§Bee mentioned Ted Cruz＊s Twitter gaffe, in which the senator ※liked§ a pornographic video on social media website.※The Texas chugger gave Twitter its most joyful night since , but he isn＊t the only Republican having a bad week,§ Bee continued, referring to the many members of the GOP who were shocked by Trump＊s decision to strike a deal with Democrats to raise the debt ceiling for three months.The host then showed several Fox News clips describing the GOP response to the deal, each of which characterized Republican politicians as ※blindsided§ by the news.※Woah, knock it off with the incendiary language, Fox,§ Bee said. ※If you say ＆blindside＊ one more time, Sandra Bullock will magically appear and force you to move in with her until you become a football star.§Bee continued: ※But of course, the big news is Mother Earth＊s quest to murder us all. Did you know that everything west of the Rockies is on fire? Maybe not 每 it＊s hard to go full CNN on an inferno 每 but a solid month of hurricanes? That, they got.§Bee showed footage of the CNN broadcaster Chris Cuomo, which saw him braving the storm and talking to residents of affected areas.※Is this really necessary?§ Bee asked. ※We＊re not all Rush Limbaugh. We will believe you if you report on the storm from indoors.※I make fun of Chris for caring about people＊s safety because I am an asshole, but preparedness and good information saves lives, whether it was Governor Scott and his army of sign language interpreters, or firefighters checking in on vulnerable residents, or police reminding folks not to fire guns at the hurricane,§ Bee quipped.※State officials did everything they could to keep people safe, and that includes something they did way back in 1992 after Hurricane Andrew: Florida enacted six building codes to make sure that every marine theme park, strip joint, and combination thereof was built to withstand extreme weather.※As our EPA chief keeps telling desperate coastal mayors, this is not the appropriate time to talk about climate change,§ Bee said. ※The appropriate time will be when we＊re on all on a space station trying to figure out how to turn our poop into protein bars.§Seth Meyers of NBC weighed in on the latest in the Russia investigation, which the special counsel  has escalated in recent weeks.※Now after a long summer of bizarre missteps and scandals, Trump is dealing with everything from hurricane clean-up to keeping the government funded,§ he said. ※And on top of that, there are new details in the rapidly escalating Russia investigation. The special counsel in that investigation, Robert Mueller, is now reportedly focused specifically on Trump＊s decision to fire former FBI director James Comey.※According to Axios, Mueller is burrowing in hard on the obstruction of justice angle,§ the host explained. ※Republicans close to the White House say every sign by Mueller is that he＊s going for the kill.§Meyers then showed an image of Mueller, adding that ※he looks like the police chief from every 1950s noir film§.※Mueller＊s investigation seems to be moving very quickly, and has ensnared not only Trump but some of his closest aides, such as his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner,§ Meyers continued. ※Kushner repeatedly failed to disclose meetings with Russian officials and now it looks like even some of Trump＊s own lawyers knew Kushner would be a liability.§The host then showed news reports claiming that the president＊s lawyers, expecting Kushner to find himself in legal jeopardy, had begun drafting Kushner＊s resignation letter.※Jared Kushner resign?§ Meyers asked. ※But then who would be in charge of US-China relations, US-Mexico relations, criminal justice reform, opioid crisis management, veteran care reform, the White House Office of American Innovation, revamping the entire federal government, painting the Easter eggs for the Easter egg hunt, and peace in the Middle East?§ talked about Myanmar, and what the UN＊s top human rights official has called ※textbook ethnic cleansing§.※Let＊s take a moment and talk about the Nobel peace prize,§ Noah began. ※There＊s nothing more prestigious that you can win. It＊s like getting an Oscar for being a good person instead of acting like a good person. But the peace prize is on my mind because, recently, Myanmar has been popping up on our news feeds.※It＊s a country of 50 million people situated between India, China, and Thailand. And right now they＊re having issues with their leader, , who is a Nobel peace prize winner. But lately, there are people saying that she should be forced to give her prize back because, well, there＊s no peace.§Noah then went on to detail the Myanmar military＊s crackdown on the minority Rohingya Muslims, who say they have been tortured, executed and raped as their villages were burned. At least 370,000 Rohingya have scrambled across the border to Bangladesh.※Yes, Myanmar＊s army is systematically targeting the country＊s minority Rohingya population, which is a horror beyond belief. What＊s even more unbelievable is finding out who the villains are,§ Noah added, expressing disbelief that a Buddhist regime could be a violent one given Buddhism＊s core principles.※Now, already the idea of a violent Buddhist is a mind-fuck,§ he said. ※What＊s just as twisted is a peace prize winner watching the violence and going, ＆shrug emoji＊.§ Noah showed footage of a recent interview in which Aung San Suu Kyi said ※ethnic cleansing is too strong a word§ to describe the events taking place in Myanmar.※I feel like you＊ve already lost the argument when you＊re saying, ＆Hey, we haven＊t killed enough people yet for it to be called ethnic cleansing. Think of this as more of a light ethnic dusting,＊§ Noah added. ※Myanmar is the kind of country where the president doesn＊t control the military. So some people would say there＊s nothing she can really do about it. But a leader with this kind of moral standing, I think New York subway rules should apply: if you see something, say something.§※And I will add this: if you do say something, try not to sound like ,§ Noah added, referring to Aung San Suu Kyi＊s claim that there was fear ※on both sides§.※Did you hear that? She just both-sided ethnic cleansing,§ the host said. ※I bet Trump was watching that like, ＆This woman is disgusting.＊ Because of her views? ＆No, she stole my lines§																																											"
"t the dawn of the 20th century, the American sociologist and campaigner WEB Du Bois argued that African Americans needed more than industrial training to vanquish inequality in the wake of slavery, declaring: ※The Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men.§※The problem of education,§ , ※must first of all deal with the Talented Tenth; it is the problem of developing the Best of this race that they may guide the Mass away from the contamination and death of the Worst, in their own and other races.§For the New Orleans-based writer and academic Ladee Hubbard, it＊s an idea that chimes strangely with our era of blockbuster superheroes and Black Lives Matter, of Avengers Assemble and Donald Trump.※It does sound like a superhero group,§ Hubbard says, ※though that was not at all what he was talking about.§Du Bois＊s suggestion resounds through Hubbard＊s debut novel, The Talented Ribkins, where 72-year-old Johnny discovers his niece Eloise is the latest in the family to possess a peculiar gift. The father who died before she was born had an uncanny ability to climb walls, while Johnny himself has a mysterious facility for making maps of places he＊s never seen. Aunt Simone can alter her appearance any way she wants, while Uncle Bertrand can spit fire. When it emerges that Johnny and his family used to fight injustice alongside a man who ran so fast they call him Flash, and a woman with a right fist like a hammer, it becomes clear that with Eloise＊s own great power must also come great responsibility.There＊s plenty of hard reality to be found in The Talented Ribkins alongside these unconventional superpowers. The novel is set in motion when a dodgy property dealer realises Johnny hasn＊t been entirely accurate with the claims he＊s been making for expenses, and gives him a week to scrape together $100,000. So Johnny and Eloise set off on a road trip to dig up loot he＊s stashed in some of Florida＊s less glamorous locations, pursued by a couple of heavies the crooked businessman has put on his tail. But like Colson Whitehead and Mohsin Hamid, whose novels 每 The Underground Railroad and Exit West 每 also move beyond the literal, Hubbard realised the story she wanted to tell needed more than straightforward realism.Hubbard says these fantastical elements all emerged organically: ※The story is about a young person visiting all these people that are older than her and that she greatly admires,§ she says, ※so there＊s a natural tendency to see them as greater, more heroic figures, as larger than life.§But the Ribkins＊ superpowers are also part of a wider story. ※What is presented as the real is often so disingenuous,§ Hubbard explains. ※There＊s an official history of how things were, of how people interact, what their histories are in relation to each other, and the truth is 每 for a variety of reasons 每 not included in that. You＊re aware of it because people tell you, they whisper things in your ear. That＊s part of the whole thing about these [characters] being outside the parameters of the normal, of the natural, because that＊s the only way you can actually see them. They don＊t fit into the official narrative of history.§When Johnny and Eloise visit Flash in Tallahassee, they find a family scrapbook filled with photographs and news clippings that chart the contested history of race in the US. But the album isn＊t really an account of the past, Hubbard writes, instead it is ※an annotated manual on the art of reading between the lines§.As a professor at Tulane University in New Orleans, where she has spent more than a decade teaching on , Hubbard is all too aware of how often black culture can only be studied by looking at the margins.※So much is left out of official narratives of history,§ Hubbard explains, ※and yet so much is retained through stories and oral histories.§More than a century after Du Bois called for a Talented Tenth to ※uplift a people§, the discrimination that forces difficult choices on the Ribkins isn＊t so much the subject of the novel as an immutable fact about the world they inhabit, an inhuman context within which they struggle to find humanity.※That＊s the reality,§ Hubbard says. ※That＊s part of what everybody is trying to cope with and work through. It＊s definitely there in the novel, but it＊s intentionally in the background. You take that as a given.§Hubbard began working on the novel when she went back to college to study creative writing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2012, and started developing a short story she＊d published a couple of years before. Despite the central role played by inequality in The Talented Ribkins, Hubbard insists she wasn＊t writing out of anger, but from love for the characters she describes, many of whom are drawn from the inspirational and heroic figures she has known personally. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1970, as a child Hubbard spent every summer with her grandparents in Florida. ※There＊s a lot of my grandfather in Johnny,§ she says, ※and that＊s someone I really admire.§She may have lived in New Orleans since 2003 as well, but she still hesitates to call herself a southern writer.※I don＊t know, maybe ＃§ she laughs as she grapples with the notion. ※I live in the south and I have been writing about the south. I guess I am, at this point.§ Perhaps the description feels so unexpected because, as a woman of colour, Hubbard admits she＊s a long way from the traditional stereotype of the southern man of letters. ※There are a lot of southern writers who are not old white guys in linen suits, but maybe they don＊t get so much attention. Maybe the image needs updating.§When Johnny takes Eloise to see the Hammer, she reminds him that a storyteller ※can＊t really dictate a moral§. If, however, there is a moral to be found in The Talented Ribkins, it＊s about ※doing the best you can with what you＊ve been given§, says Hubbard.※Maybe not always having the answers, maybe feeling very alienated at times, not always knowing what you should do, but you keep trying ＃ and hope that someone understands what you＊re trying to do.§																																											"
"he story of an 18-year-old woman writing one of the world＊s most defining horror novels is a tantalizing proposition, and a quick scan of Mary Shelley＊s exhaustive Wikipedia page clues one into an unconventional origins tale. But in this faithful new drama, named after the author, there＊s a dogged, and perhaps lazy, belief that merely reciting the details will be enough, an added spark never quite arriving in tow.Mary (Elle Fanning) is a wayward teen spending more time reading scary literature than helping out with chores back at home. She clashes with stepmother Mary Jane (Joanne Froggatt) but shares a warm relationship with stepsister Claire (Bel Powley) and father William Godwin (Stephen Dillane), a renowned political philosopher and novelist. She also shares a strident streak with her late mother, the forward-thinking feminist Mary Wollstonecraft. When Mary encounters handsome and rebellious poet Percy Shelley (Douglas Booth), her life takes a dramatic turn that takes her across Europe, encountering love, betrayal, tragedy and, ultimately, inspiration.As the English language debut of Haifaa Al-Mansour, the first woman to ever shoot a Saudi Arabian feature film 每 the acclaimed comedy Wadjda 每 there＊s something respectable and sturdy about . Fanning is a convincing actor, no matter what the role, and she puts in a solid turn here, vulnerable yet feisty, romantic yet rational, and we can understand her internal processing of the events that led her to write Frankenstein. In familiar period territory, there＊s also an interesting focus on a side of early 19th-century society we don＊t often get to see: raucous, hard-drinking teenage debauchery.Throughout there＊s a debate over the efficacy of an open relationship and there＊s a loose, freewheeling attitude towards sexuality. But the film stops short when it could go much further. There＊s an overwhelming politeness, an awareness that this will be aimed at an audience who still prefer their costume dramas to be family-friendly. It means then certain elements are sanitized, such as the character of Lord Byron whose bisexuality is hinted at but never explored, and the sex scenes, which are suggested rather than visible.As the other two members of the party, Booth and Powley acquit themselves well enough but as with Fanning, they＊re hampered by a script that offers mere surface characterization and some clunky dialogue. While the intricacies of their swinging sexual relationships prove intriguing, they end up dominating so much of the film that the far more interesting story surrounding the creation and controversial ownership of Frankenstein feels like something of an afterthought. Shelley＊s mistreatment by the literary elite because of her gender is a compelling, uniquely frustrating element and the film deprives us of the suitably grand exploration that it deserves. It＊s a long film but at times, it feels like it could have benefited from the extended structure of a mini-series.Mary Shelley is a diverting enough biopic that features decent performances through an often vivid lens, but given the unusual facts of the author＊s life, a far more offbeat and far less rigid film could have been made here. Shelley＊s fascination with the macabre and her progressive feminist ideals feel at odds with such a conventionally told tale. Al-Mansour has all of the pieces but she doesn＊t quite bring her film to life.																																											"
"ew pianists are more closely identified with a single work than . Though over his short career he played and recorded a vast range of the keyboard repertoire 每 from William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons to Schoenberg and his pupils 每 it was the music of JS Bach, and the  in particular, with which his name became indelibly linked. Gould made two studio recordings of the Goldberg, the second in 1981, just over a year before his death at the age of 50, but it was his earlier recording, made in 1955 and released the following year, that acquired legendary status, and defined him as an outstanding musician of the 20th century.Gould famously gave no public performances after 1964, opting to work only in the studio. Since his death, his recorded legacy has maintained his stature. In the forefront of that have remained the two Goldberg recordings, which Columbia/CBS, and later Sony Classical, have re-released in many different editions. This latest concentrates exclusively on the 1955 recording, and is the most exhaustive yet, including every take from the sessions, presented variation by variation.It constitutes detailed documentation of Gould＊s quest for his ideal Bach performance 每 his obsession with every detail, his insistence on getting the articulation of every semiquaver in every bar exactly as he imagined it, sometimes to the audible exasperation of the producer, Howard Scott. There are multiple takes of every variation, each subtly distinct in tempo and nuance, from which the definitive performance as it eventually appeared on LP was later spliced together. Taken together they also demonstrate the unwavering virtuosity of Gould＊s playing, and the startling clarity he seemed effortlessly able to bring to the densest contrapuntal textures.It＊s sumptuously packaged. As well as the complete sessions, which take up five CDs, the set includes a disc containing Gould＊s 1981 interview on the Goldbergs with the critic Tim Page, and the final edited performance, both as a facsimile of the original 1956 LP, remastered and pressed on high-density vinyl, and as a CD. There＊s also a fascinating coffee-table book, copiously illustrated, which includes all the original sound engineer＊s tape sheets and transcripts of exchanges between Gould and his producer, printed in parallel with an Urtext edition of Bach＊s score.Unless you＊re a Gould completist perhaps it isn＊t a must-have, but it is an extraordinary document, meticulously assembled, and as a bit of a Gould fanatic myself I found it totally compelling. In any case, one or other of Gould＊s Goldberg recordings, and preferably both, should be in every CD collection.																																											"
"Peter was a man for all seasons 每 he could play any part that was needed. He told me once, ※I＊m going now to see somebody in the government and of course I＊ll put on my pussycat face.§ That is what enabled him to bring about such radical change. Consider what he did with the  at Stratford, which no one before him had been able to do.When he started with the RSC, he said, ※Now that I＊ve got this position, I can＊t do it alone,§ and asked me to help him run it with the respected French director Michel Saint-Denis. I was very young at the time. It was typical of his generosity and his vision. It＊s no use being open and generous and having vision unless you have a very concrete knowledge of what＊s needed: what must be changed, what the opposition could be, how far you can go and when you just have to wait patiently. He had all these gifts. Peter＊s wasn＊t a highbrow theatre or a lowbrow, popular theatre but the truly Shakespearean art of blending all those things. We were very close friends. He was warm, affable, generous. The secret to Peter was that he had a great simple and engaging charm which was one of his natural assets. That＊s what made him so persuasive.  had absolute authority and, as a heavyweight of the theatre, real presence. With those wonderful Fedora hats that he wore, he had an old-school style and always looked debonair.After I had secured the rights to , Pam Gems＊ play about the iconic French singer, I thought shall I dare ask him to direct? It was a play with music and he wasn＊t known for music theatre. I wasn＊t sure if he＊d be keen on that 每 or on working with me. I introduced myself, told him I was looking for a director, and his eyes lit up and he gathered me up in his arms. He put together an amazing cast and we took it on tour then into the West End.There were never any strong words when you worked with Peter as he created an environment that was calm and fun. He was full of gentle encouragement. But he didn＊t beat around the bush either. He had the brightest mind and a clear view of what he wanted. Later, he asked me to do Moli豕re＊s comedy The Misanthrope. He knew I wanted to develop as an actor and gave me the chance 每 I＊ll always be grateful for that. It was my first major role in a West End show that wasn＊t a musical. He told me, ※It＊s rhyming couplets, darling. Think of it as singing without the music.§ For me, that took away the fear of doing something classical.A few years ago there was a party for him at the National. I＊ve never seen so many stars under one roof. It was a privilege to know him.Peter was an absolute smoothie, the most charming and diplomatic man. Especially with that beard, you could imagine he would have made a fantastic Elizabethan courtier.By the time I met him, in the mid-90s, he＊d left the RSC and the National but was still producing a very large number of shows. There was always something on the boil. He wanted to do a farce and he came to me with An Absolute Turkey, a Feydeau play he＊d translated with his wife, Nicki Frei. He was very easy to get on with and it was fascinating to find out that he＊d seen other productions I＊d done. He saw everything and would make a note of which actors might be appropriate for him to bring together. I was cast with Felicity Kendal and Nick Le Prevost. On virtually every rehearsal day, he＊d arrive and say, well now, this is too long. We＊ll have to cut this down. This would happen on a Monday and we＊d all nod. And then we＊d get to the end of the week and he still hadn＊t cut it. And it would happen again the next Monday. And the next. As he＊d done the translation himself, he found it difficult to cut. ＊s plays are like pieces of clockwork. It＊s very difficult to take them apart. Peter liked farce and went on to work with Eric Sykes on a very funny production of . We had similar backgrounds. When I was an undergraduate at Cambridge, I was involved with the Amateur Dramatic Club and there was a photo of him on the wall there, saying this was where he learned to make all his mistakes. There wasn＊t really any school of drama at Cambridge - it＊s always been the case that undergraduates have organised it for themselves and so they take on that sense of controlling the reins. He wasn＊t a jobbing director. He left university with the idea that the Royal Shakespeare Company could be a showcase for his ideas and intentions. He certainly led out, from Cambridge, a line of directors like Sam Mendes and Nick Hytner who probably owed a great deal to his pioneering ability to play the politics of theatre.Peter was an extraordinarily energetic, imaginative director 每 if you left him in the corner of a room he＊d direct a play 每 but he was also a great campaigner. He never stopped arguing for the role of subsidised art in a civilised society and its ability to change people＊s lives. At the National he was incredibly supportive of the director  and the cast of Howard Brenton＊s The Romans in Britain at a time when the theatre was attacked on all sides for putting on what some called filth. He did what an artistic director should - he backed his team. And of course it became a very successful show in the National＊s biggest theatre, the Olivier. He left the National an immeasurably healthier place than it was when he started, which was mostly down to his ability to fill a theatre with shows that people wanted to see, or perhaps - more interestingly 每 shows that they didn＊t know they wanted to see.It feels contradictory to call him a traditionalist, because there wasn＊t much of an agreed-on tradition before he came along. He was propelled by his desire to bring Shakespeare into the centre of the country＊s life - and in that he was largely successful. He wrote a book about verse speaking and was dogmatic about the principles of spoken verse. There have been fashions since where people have worked against those principles, but the fact that there is even an argument about how Shakespeare is spoken is basically down to him. Anyone who＊s tried to run a building with three theatres in it will tell you that the first rule is don＊t put anything on in the largest space that 12,000 people don＊t want to see. And yet he staged, to great acclaim, Tony Harrison＊s Oresteia - three long plays performed in masks and in verse. I was in my teens when I saw it, and it remains one of my most memorable theatrical evenings.Sir Peter created 19 productions for Glyndebourne. The first was La Calisto in 1970, the last was Cenerentola, in 2005. As a young boy my early memories of him were simply of this bear-like figure in the theatre. His 1973 Marriage of Figaro was the first opera to make a real impact on me. He also did the best Don Giovanni I＊ve ever seen. With Thomas Allen as the Don he managed to get the perfect blend of danger, menace and charm.He was a hugely versatile director. His characterisation and the detail were spectacular, and above all he was a fantastic story-teller. Musicians adored him - any singer loves to have someone who really challenges them and works with them to create something extraordinary, and that＊s what Peter did, time and time again. His 1981 production of Britten＊s Midsummer Night＊s Dream, created with designer John Bury, was a work of pure magic, a perfect Glyndebourne piece. It＊s still in our repertory, and was revived only last year, when audiences voted it their favourite opera of the season. I wish we could have kept all his shows but we haven＊t got big enough cupboards.When he directed Carmen for us in 1985 it was with his third wife Maria Ewing in the title role. She was a rather hot-headed Carmen, perfect for the part, but working with her could be tricky, not least for my dad [George, the then Chairman] and also for Peter, as she occasionally didn＊t turn up for rehearsals. But she pulled it out of the bag, and gave a memorable performance. I＊ll never forget her act-two dance with the castanets.Peter threw himself into everything he did but always had a twinkle in his eye and a sense of humour. There was an insecurity about him too which was endearing - he knew what he was doing, but he would wrestle to get it right in the rehearsal room. He loved his food and would always arrive in time for breakfast in the canteen before rehearsals. And I remember him pontificating over many lunches about how troubled he was by the lack of subsidy for the arts. My father always said that was his tenure as artistic director - 1984-1990 - was golden era at Glyndebourne. In fact during that decade the demand for tickets grew so much that my dad made the decision to build a bigger theatre. 																																											"
"An art dealer who worked and socialised with rock stars, Hollywood A-listers, supermodels and wealthy investors has been jailed for stealing paintings and sculptures over three decades. Jonathan Poole, 69, was sentenced to four years after being compared in court to the protagonist of the Hollywood art heist film The Thomas Crown Affair.  Poole, who worked out of two galleries in the Cotswolds, specialised in selling artworks created by music stars such as John Lennon, Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and jazz great Miles Davis. The prosecution suggested that Poole, from Poulton, Gloucestershire, may have been using the money to fund a gambling habit, service debts or was stashing it away for his future.Poole admitted 26 offences of theft and fraud against nine victims involving artworks worth about ?500,000.James Ward, prosecuting, asked Gloucester crown court to imagine his clients＊ shock when they realised the international art dealer they trusted was a ※professional thief of some ability§.Ward said: ※His life＊s work has been as artist and art dealer. He was trusted by the wealthy individuals who invested in art. ※He was trusted by internationally acclaimed celebrities such as Ronnie Wood, Miles Davis and John Lennon.§Ward quoted Picasso 每 ※We all know that art is not truth§ 每 and compared Poole to the leading character in The Thomas Crown Affair. He said: ※Both Thomas Crown and Jonathan Poole stole the paintings in broad daylight. Whilst Thomas Crown stole as a challenge because his world had become too safe, Jonathan Poole stole either to fund a gambling habit, or to stash away money for later life.※Some of the artwork involved is still missing. Where is the money or the artwork he stole? Is it, like the Nazi gold train, hidden 每 only to be utilised in years to come?§Court two was turned into a makeshift modern art gallery during the hearing to display some of the paintings connected to the case that police have recovered.They included large works by German artist Sebastian Kr邦ger, including one of the beat generation writer William Burroughs dressed as a gunslinger. Also exhibited in court were four pieces by Lennon, including one called Peace and Love.Poole, who was representing himself after sacking his defence team, said that at the peak of his 40-year career he was organising an exhibition almost every week, name-checking actor Anthony Hopkins as someone he worked with.He said his business had started to struggle with the advent of the internet. ※People would come and if they liked something they would look on the internet and find a better price for it.§Poole has a degenerative condition and mobility problems. He said for the last five years he had been living in a single room and insisted he had none of the missing pieces. ※I don＊t have any art apart from my own,§ he said.Judge Michael Cullum said Poole had clearly had a successful career. ※Your professional credentials and knowledge were highly regarded,§ he said, but added that an aggravating feature was that he had clearly been trusted by those he had stolen from or defrauded.Cullum seemed to take a swipe at some of Poole＊s wealthy clients, saying many people would be surprised they did not always appear to keep careful track of the artworks they owned. He also said the prices of works painted by celebrities 每 and featuring famous people 每 were ※inflated§.The court was also told about a client called Richard Fenton, who had inherited three bronze horses from his aunt, Beryl Ellis. Fenton took the pieces to Poole because he also specialised in animal sculptures.Poole promised to sell them and subsequently told Fenton they had been taken to Singapore. ※To this day the pieces have never been returned and their location is not known,§ Ward said. Poole＊s known victims include the Dire Straits bass guitarist John Illsley. Poole sold two paintings by Miles Davis, owned by Illsley, but never passed the proceeds of the sale to his client. Poole＊s own brother Nicholas was also a victim. Poole was born in London but brought up in Zimbabwe. His own work, usually wildlife studies, has been exhibited at the Royal Academy in London and in galleries worldwide. As well as creating his own work, Poole had a sparkling 40-year career as a dealer during which he won the trust of the rich and famous. While art by rock stars was his niche, he also specialised in work by the French sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) and Kr邦ger.  Much of his business was legitimate and he was well-respected but police found that he would also promise to sell some pieces for artists, collectors or investors but not pay them the proceeds or return the works. Poole told some clients their art had been destroyed in a flood. He strung others along for months or years with excuses. Some wealthy clients appeared to simply forget he was supposed to be selling their work.DC Steve Crilley of Gloucestershire police＊s major crime investigation team said many of the artworks had been  每 though it is understood that Yoko Ono was approached about the Lennon works whose ownership is not known and did not want them returned.  Crilley said: ※Poole was once a successful man and his victims trusted him to take care of their valuable artwork. ※Sadly, he has now tarnished his good name and he will have to live with that shame for the rest of his life.§ 																																											"
"f nothing else, Fernando L谷on de Aranoa＊s latest film Loving Pablo has given us the sight of a corpulent Javier Bardem hustling nude through the jungles of South America, semi-automatic rifle in hand, desiccated buttocks practically flapping in the wind. It＊s a bizarre scene, kind of funny and kind of pathetic, and thoroughly memorable. If only Aranoa could conjure another scene, even another image quite as surreal.Because everything about Pablo Escobar, the paunchy cocaine baron Bardem effortfully portrays in this adaptation of the memoir Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar, was larger than life. Already dramatized everywhere from Netflix＊s Narcos to a movie-within-a-movie on Entourage, his story brings him from humble beginnings as the most ruthless kingpin in  through a stint as a publicly elected (well, ※publicly elected§) official to his inevitable fall from power.Aranoa＊s film attempts to put a new spin on this colorful tale by telling it through the perspective of that memoir＊s author, Escobar＊s longtime mistress Virginia Vallejo (Pen谷lope Cruz). But even with the newscaster-turned-accomplice calling the shots, Escobar remains the star of the show.As with the Lorraine Bracco＊s point-of-view move in Goodfellas, the film places a greater focus on the notion of unwilling complicity than most in the gangster genre, but still struggles to produce much original insight. In adherence with an apparent rule that all crime sagas must begin in , we first join Virginia as Pablo＊s empire crumbles and she takes asylum in an undisclosed location with DEA protection, represented in the film by a savvy agent courtesy of Peter Sarsgaard.Though that one scene all but lays out the entire plot before the movie itself can do so, we tumble back in time nevertheless to the first fateful meeting between the star-crossed lovers at a swanky party on Pablo＊s compound. While that sequence is not technically a shot-for-shot remake of Leonardo DiCaprio first laying eyes on Margot Robbie in The Wolf of Wall Street, squint your eyes a little and it might as well be. Pablo proves irresistible to Virginia. Not that he makes it easy on her 每 besides rocking a gut that could conceal a regulation bowling ball, he makes stomach-churning threats against her life and in what might be an even crueler move, forces her to purchase a diamond necklace for the wife he won＊t leave. Even when he intimidates or verbally abuses her, however, she comes back after he does something thoughtful, like brutalizing the ex-husband that won＊t sign Virginia＊s divorce finalization papers. Until, as the opening scene informs us upfront, she doesn＊t.The film features Virginia in enough scenes that we＊re made to believe Aranoa has a sincere interest in her reluctant moral compromise, but she＊s only ever a mirror through which we catch the reflection of Pablo. The voice-over narration coming from Cruz (another tick on the Goodfellas homage checklist) does the audience the service of walking them through an intricate culture of drug trafficking, and provides direct insight into her estimation of the rapidly deteriorating situation.But those thoughts almost always revolve around Pablo and his endless complexities. He turned the Medell赤n region of Colombia into a war zone where street kids get a cash reward for every slain cop＊s badge they turn in to the cartel. At the same time, he funneled a great deal of his blood money back into the local economy and defended the nation＊s poorest citizens when no one else would. For a film ostensibly about Virginia, she＊s left with little to do besides fret, stray, and return while Pablo lives his life.At least Cruz and Bardem appear to be having a ball with the 80s milieu and their characters＊ outsized personalities. The costuming and hair, from Bardem＊s curly black hairpiece to Cruz＊s eternally fluffed-up coiffure, add a bit of color to the routine, and Bardem＊s fat-neck prosthesis is weirdly transfixing. And the heat really rises when their fiery attitudes mix and threaten to combust; though the script is in English for what Bardem has confirmed were wrangling-a-budget reasons, their spats spark with such passion that a viewer can nearly hear the Spanish behind it.But Aranoa＊s film forces these two diverting performances into regrettably done-to-death beats in a familiar rise-and-fall narrative. Like Escobar himself remaking the coca business in a bold, new and highly lucrative vision, Bardem and Cruz succeed by doing things their unique way. Aranoa, not so much.																																											"
"The first verse of the civil rights anthem We Shall Overcome is no longer under copyright, a New York federal judge  on Friday.Described as the ※most powerful song of the 20th century§ by the Library of Congress, the  the existing copyright holders was brought last year by the samewho had successfully disputed longstanding ownership claims over Happy Birthday to You.Lawyers leading the class action against the Richmond Organization and Ludlow Music, claimed We Shall Overcome was an adaptation of an African American spiritual and therefore in the public domain and had only later been adopted by folk singer , copyrighted, and established as an anthem of the 1940s labor protest movement.They pointed to Seeger＊s 1963 memoir in which he wrote that he＊d been advised by his music publishers: ※If you don＊t copyright this now, some Hollywood types will have a version out next year like ＆Come on baby, we shall overcome tonight.＊§The song＊s first known printed reference in the February 1909 edition of the United Mine Workers JournalElements of the song, which  referenced in his final sermon, have also been traced to a Beethoven hymn.In her decision, US district judge Denise Cote wrote that the existing copyright holders had not clearly identified the original work on which their derivative was based nor demonstrated that changes Seeger allegedly made to the first 每 and identical fifth 每 verse rose to sufficient originality to merit copyright protection.Earlier versions of the song give the lyrics as:Lawyers seeking to protect the copyright claimed that Seeger had changed the first verse 每 altering ※will§ to ※shall§ and ※down§ to ※deep§.※The phrase ＆we will overcome＊ is about strength and determination, force, action; ＆we shall overcome＊ is about faith in the future despite formidable obstacles,§ claimed Paul LiCalsi, a lawyer for the copyright holders. The opposing lawyers described a change like ※will§ to ※shall§ as ※patently trivial and insignificant: the words are at most different grammatical variations of the future tense. Folk music does not observe such grammatical formalities; rather folk music is filled with lyrical expressions that do not conform to grammatical rules or norms.§ Judge Cote＊s decision was limited only to the first verse. The justice did not rule on other aspects of the case, including who really authored the song or if the copyright had been fraudulently obtained. The initial effort to free We Shall Overcome had been by the production company behind which had planned to use the song in the Lee Daniels-directed film but could not meet the $100,000 price tag.The film-makers claimed they had originally wanted to use the song in several scenes, including scenes depicting the 1963 riots in Birmingham, Alabama, the 1965 riots in Selma, but had been ※repeatedly stonewalled and rebuffed§. The copyright holders countered that the song＊s royalties hadto the preservation of civil rights movement documents and African American focused arts and cultural projects.

"here＊s a lot going on in Wim Wenders＊s latest, and arguably most accessible, film, Submergence. It＊s a love story, it＊s a spy thriller, it＊s an underwater adventure, it＊s about terrorism, it＊s about climate change, it＊s about being ghosted by text (!). But ultimately 每 sadly, predictably 每 it＊s also a bit of a mess.Adapted from the novel by JM Ledgard, it focuses on two people brought together by a chance encounter. James (James McAvoy) is a Scottish spy about to embark on a dangerous mission in Somalia. Danny (Alicia Vikander) is a professor and a bio-mathematician about to head to the bottom of the ocean to explore what lifeforms might exist. They find each other at a plush hotel in France, both taking a chance to relax before embarking on their high-risk missions. There＊s an instant frisson and in the space of a few days, they fall in love, eager to see more of each other once they return. But when James is kidnapped by jihadists, Danny is left waiting for a text message that might never come, unaware of his predicament as she prepares for her deep dive.What＊s most frustrating about Submergence is that the stage is so readily set for a sweeping, elevated and intelligent romance. There＊s a handsome set of beautifully captured locations, an occasionally lush soundtrack, a source text filled with a rich tapestry of social issues and intrigue and a central pair brought together and torn apart by their high-risk professions. But in trying to do so much, Wenders＊s film ends up doing so very little.Right from the outset, it＊s clear there＊s a problem with Erin Dignam＊s script, stilted and confusing dialogue sounding as if it＊s been mistranslated. Dignam was also responsible for Sean Penn＊s unholy flop The Last Face, a film that similarly squandered two talented actors on a misfiring romance. This isn＊t quite so staggeringly awful but there＊s a clear commonality: neither film seems to understand courtship. The scenes of the couple flirting and building a watertight bond need to be hugely impactful as we＊re supposed to believe as an audience that within mere days, a relationship is forged. But it＊s tough to invest in, despite the very best efforts of the actors involved.There are interesting details along the way, especially with regards to the unusual gender dynamic between the two. In the scenes of affection between them, Vikander assumes the more traditionally masculine position and her character is the more sexually forward, brushing off the idea of a relationship initially as she is too busy with work. McAvoy, an ever-reliable presence, is more physically tentative yet emotionally open and there＊s a frisson between them that works even when their dialogue lets them down (it might be related to her job but is ※What ocean is your favorite?§ ever an acceptable chat-up line?). When the two part, McAvoy＊s character gets the far more interesting storyline as he falls deeper into a jihadist community, unsure of his fate.Depressingly, Vikander＊s character, who had spent so much time talking about the potentially world-shifting importance of what she might find in the ocean, spends the rest of the film checking her damn phone to see if he＊s texted. The origins of life be damned! Where can she get some signal? It＊s repetitive and regressive and she finds it an understandable struggle to maintain our investment in her fate. It＊s also another curious misstep for the Oscar winner, after the much-delayed period turkey , her brief period of picking roles in adaptations of unlikely and unfilmable literary love stories hopefully coming to an end.There＊s something to be admired about a film that can gracefully defy simple genre categorization but Submergence feels like a clumsy melange, a confused adaptation made by people who don＊t seem quite sure what they have on their hands. 																																											"
"ny adaptation has to add more to its source than it subtracts. While Simon Block＊s stage version of the late ＊s celebrated 1979 TV film expands on the domestic lives of its main characters, it still feels, even in this loving production by his wife, , like a respectful homage to a great original that really belongs on the screen.In the age of satnavs, I＊m not sure whether London cabbies still require the encyclopaedic knowledge of the urban maze that they once did. But the play takes us back to a time when aspiring drivers had to memorise every street within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross. The main focus is on the morose, jobless Chris, driven by his ambitious girlfriend, Janet, to become a cabbie. We also follow the fortunes of the high-flying Ted, who hails from a long line of Jewish taxi drivers, and Gordon, a cowboy handyman for whom exploring the  streets is largely a chance to rat on his wife. But the story＊s most magnetic character is Burgess, the God-like examiner at the Public Carriage Office who holds the applicants＊ futures in his hands. Steven Pacey conveys perfectly well the quirky obsessiveness of a man who rejoices in his power and tends his moustache as lovingly as the Japanese bonsai tree on his desk. It is a carefully studied performance but it cannot banish the memory of Nigel Hawthorne in the TV film, whose habit of biting off hard consonants hinted at the secret sadism of a man in the grip of an id谷e fixe. Fabien Frankel and Alice Felgate are good as the young couple, Chris and Janet, and a reminder of a time when, for those without a pad of their own, sex could be a hazardously furtive affair. Ben Caplan as the uxorious Ted and James Alexandrou as the errant Gordon are also inherently plausible. The play retains the wit and lightness of Rosenthal＊s writing. He has created, in Burgess, a character whom Ben Jonson would have recognised and we see how the dogged application process required of would-be cabbies damages home lives. Yet it feels perverse to adapt to the stage a work that depends on the visible presence of London＊s labyrinthine streets and, in an age when the black-cab driver is no longer king, it has the aroma of a period piece.

This is a short, sharp shock of a film, written and directed by Potter: a theatrical drawing-room comedy starring  on tiptop form, playing a government minister who is hosting a party at her elegant London townhouse, along with her husband, played by Timothy Spall. It＊s like a stylish play by Simon Gray or Anthony Shaffer, with a neat punchline twist that leaves you laughing over the closing credits. For my money, this is the film of the year: Armando Iannucci (Veep, The Thick of It) directs an icily brilliant, ruthlessly satirical and mordant comedy about backstairs intrigue at the Kremlin after Stalin dies in 1953.

Iannucci has written the script, alongside David Schneider and Ian Martin. The new film from the Zambian-born and Cardiff-raised film-maker  made a fierce impression at this year＊s Cannes Film Festival. It＊s a tale of dogma and corruption in the land of the director＊s birth, a satirical and surreal account of absurdity and sexual politics.

"ax Stafford-Clark is leaving , the touring company he has led since 1993. It will take theatre years to catch up with the example he set through his work there.He is moving on at a moment when the industry is finally beginning a sincere engagement with gender representation and with cultural and regional diversity; when the question of what it＊s like to be middle-class has been overtaken by the exploration of how big the world is. No theatre could really claim to have been doing that even five years ago, but it＊s what Out of Joint always did.The list of productions first commissioned and directed by Max for Out of Joint is extraordinary. The Steward of Christendom and Our Lady of Sligo turned Sebastian Barry＊s family history into the voice of a country. Caryl Churchill＊s Blue Heart changed the way people thought about form in the theatre. David Hare＊s verbatim play The Permanent Way was a beautiful, shocking evocation of the damage done by market forces. Mark Ravenhill＊s era-defining  heralded the last exhausted gasp of the Major government, stripping away the gloss of a culture to show what was underneath. You can add to that list Robin Soans＊ Talking to Terrorists and Mixed Up North, JT Rogers＊ The Overwhelming and Out of Joint＊s masterpiece, an . Big-city dwellers might struggle to understand just how much Max has mattered. There is so much great work around, and changing fashions have meant that from time to time he has been shunted into the sidings. For those of us who grew up in the sticks in the 90s and 00s, though, Out of Joint＊s work was the only attempt that anyone seemed to make at a sincere intellectual engagement with our communities. His commitment to speaking for and to as many people as possible outstripped others＊ because it never arose from a funding incentive. It was just his heartfelt, instinctive vision of the job of the theatre.He always championed female writers: almost half of his company＊s productions were written by women in an era when other directors of his generation 每 and younger 每 argued that the plays weren＊t there. He wove a commitment to diversity into the fabric of his company, touring everything he made and staging work that spoke up for the whole of the nation.Serious theatre today owes a great deal to Max＊s decision, early in his career, to withdraw from the artistic directorship of the Traverse theatre in Edinburgh in order to set up the Traverse  Workshop, on the grounds that a theatre could never flourish without a production line. So much of the workshop model of play development at the heart of our modern theatre starts there. He has continued innovating ever since, holding the industry＊s hand in the fire.I first got interested in the theatre through reading about Max＊s earlier company, Joint Stock. This touring ensemble created plays full of life and passionate intelligence that seemed to care about the country they played to. I wish I could have seen them. Instead, I went to see Out of Joint and was transfixed by the discovery that theatre could be about my world now, not just the rich, dead and famous. Six years later, I became Max＊s assistant.When I worked with Max, I saw how much he piled on himself to play that role as the conscience of the culture. He spent hour after hour engaged with the Arts Council, arguing for the importance of what he did ; he travelled the country, opening productions and leading post-show discussions; he was probably the only person on the A-level syllabus who gave workshops in schools on a more than monthly basis. And he did it all while coping with the impact of a severe stroke. Max is the most driven of all theatre＊s workaholics, and the most competitive. He used to race people through the phonetic alphabet, to see who got to the end first, for fun. He and I had a reading race once, to see which of us got through the most books in a year. I beat him, but I had to get above 200 to do so, and he only had one good eye after the stroke. It was all a way of focusing his need to be thinking, acting, moving forwards.He concludes his time at Out of Joint with a tour of Andrea Dunbar＊s , which he commissioned and directed at the Royal Court more than 30 years ago. He has always been the kind of director willing to pick up the work of a teenager from a Bradford council estate and make it the centre of the world. 																																											"

"scar-winning monologue-spinner ＊s decision to dominate not one but two seats behind the scenes for his directorial debut Molly＊s Game makes complete sense to anyone who＊s ever seen an Aaron Sorkin film. Because while at times he plays very well with others, with age he＊s become the sole author of his work, unwilling to share the stage with anyone else. Steve Jobs was a suffocating example of this, a set of fine actors and an accomplished director drowning in Sorkinese.Tidily removing at least one competing force, he＊s made himself the main architect of what should technically be his magnum opus. His choice of subject is an initial surprise: tabloid-dwelling ※poker princess§ Molly Bloom. Surprising because Sorkin＊s track record of writing female characters has been patchy to say the least and he＊s been under fire on numerous occasions for what＊s been perceived as hostility towards the opposite sex. On the press tour for Steve Jobs, he claimed that this film was something of an amends-maker: the true story of a strong-willed woman unfairly treated and underestimated because of her gender.The facts of Bloom＊s life certainly give him a lot to work with. Played by  from the age of 20 (a stretch) to 32, we first meet her at the end of one journey as another is about to begin. Bloom was a supremely talented skier, close to making the Olympic team but an accident left her in search of another opportunity. Moving from Colorado to California, she gained employment as the personal assistant to a man who runs underground poker games on the side. She quickly and quietly became the brains behind the operation, corralling and controlling the A-listers who congregate weekly to play. But cut to present day and she＊s waking up to find the FBI outside her door, waiting to take her in. Sorkin＊s script glides between the two timelines as Bloom recounts her ascent and descent within the high-stakes poker world to her lawyer, played by a shakily accented . We also get glimpses of her childhood and a fractured relationship with her therapist father, embodied by a grizzled Kevin Costner. In a bloated runtime of 140 minutes, we get a lot, arguably too much. Sorkin is spellbound by his subject, fascinated by the many details of her admittedly impressive life, but the magic he clearly feels fails to translate on screen. The experience of watching Molly＊s Game feels a bit like hearing a long, rambling story from someone high on something, a frantic, exhausting splurge of information that never truly justifies its existence. Rapid-fire dialogue is an easily parodied Sorkin trademark and as his films begin, it often takes a minute to adjust to his rhythm. In his finer works, there＊s an elegance that accompanies this speed but in Molly＊s Game, it＊s frustratingly absent. In the first scene, we＊re bombarded with an overstuffed, overwritten voice-over, delivered with dry disinterest by Chastain, and it becomes his crutch throughout, oversharing exposition with surprising clumsiness. There＊s a slickness missing, a sass that would turn Bloom into the Erin Brockovich-style figure that Sorkin seems to see, and the scenes that should sizzle tend to fizzle out instead. Chastain is clearly a fine actor (as showcased in both The Help and Take Shelter) but is so often miscast; whether it be as a gothic villain in Crimson Peak, a Polish animal lover in The Zookeeper＊s Wife or even as a doggedly determined operative in Zero Dark Thirty, she struggles to disappear into her characters. This is another role that, despite apparent effort on her part, she just doesn＊t sell. There＊s a liveliness that we don＊t get from her line delivery and while the script keeps reminding us that Bloom is a magnetic figure, Chastain doesn＊t convince us that such an assertion is true. Her scenes with Elba are also lacking a vibrancy, there＊s an electricity that we crave and it＊s only in the last stretch that we finally get something, in a strongly performed argument between the pair.As a director, Sorkin is competent but uneven. He attempts a few gimmicky flourishes (a video game-esque display of the cards being held in a poker game and some other pointless on-screen graphics), but otherwise it＊s a plainly told tale matched with a hopelessly dated rock score. The visuals do little to distract us from the indigestible amount of information being thrown our way and the absurd two-hour-plus length focused entirely on a character who Sorkin sees as a crusading hero but fails to come across as anything more than a resourceful entrepreneur. Even when she adopts a serious drug addiction, it＊s told in a sprightly grit-free manner, Sorkin missing the chance to delve that much deeper.While it＊s refreshing to see a film about a woman succeeding in business, it＊s disappointing that it starts and ends with an underwhelmed whimper. Molly＊s Game is sadly one without any winners.																																											"
"n 1934 the Daily Mail called , founder of the British Union of Fascists, ※the paramount political personality in Britain§. The BUF was then enjoying a wave of popular enthusiasm and its membership was up around 34,000. Blackshirts marched through British towns and cities, and new recruits were encouraged simply to fall in behind. There was high unemployment in Britain at the time, particularly in the north, and Mosley＊s appeal was in part the promise to restore jobs. A charismatic megalomaniac of immense wealth, convinced he was born to rule, Mosley also attracted support from middle-class Tories. They shared his vaunted pride of race, love of country and his commitment to law, order, free speech and ※English methods§.Jews were not admitted to the BUF, but Mosley was not at this time a rabid antisemite. He said national pride had no need of the ※delirium of race§. But he came to realise that a movement requires a scapegoat, and that Jews fitted the bill. He said as much to , in Sieff＊s own home, and to his surprise was at once thrown out. Meanwhile BUF marches, meetings and street violence continued unabated, and it was Mosley＊s hope that political disorder would eventually precipitate a crisis that would sweep him into power.It had happened in Italy, and of course in Germany. Mosley had married into a family, the Mitfords, some of whom were on the warmest terms with senior Nazis in Hitler＊s inner circle. The F邦hrer was present at Mosley＊s wedding to Diana Mitford in Berlin in 1936, as was the most pro-Nazi of the Mitford sisters, Unity.It has been evident for some time that a violent element of the American far right identifies closely with the European fascism of the 1930s. These neo-Nazis repeat the slogans and ape the beliefs. They are extreme nationalists. They are antisemitic, anti-immigrant, Islamophobic and racist. Straight-arm salutes and swastikas are displayed with pride, and there＊s a readiness among them to march, chant and fight in the streets, even to drive a vehicle at speed into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters.The demagogue is indispensable to any fascist movement if its members are to be inspired and held firm to their commitment to take to the streets and spill blood. Fascism does not arise?from rational sources. It does not require rational argument to sustain its followers. Fascists are deaf to reason. They sneer at reasonable argument. It is the role of the demagogue to arouse and direct their rage towards the scapegoat, most commonly the racial Other.This was apparent recently in Charlottesville, in the US, and the demagogue who excited the murderous rage that day, and later excused it, was Donald Trump. Trump is still clinging to public office. Mosley, on the other hand, saw his movement flag and fail. Although he was vastly more intelligent than Trump, and of a far higher level of political sophistication, he was not swept into power on a wave of violent disorder, as he had hoped. Instead he was sent to prison when war with Germany was declared in 1939, along with a number of his lieutenants.That was not the end of it, of course. Fascism is one of those creatures which, once its head has been cut off, soon enough grows another one. Little remembered today is that at the end of the war, with German cities in ruins, Hitler dead and nazism seemingly destroyed, Mosley and his men were released from prison. Undeterred and unrepentant they went straight back to what they＊d been doing before the war.They marched through the East End of London, where they had earlier found their chief source of working-class support, and also their chosen enemy, the Jews. They held public meetings, speeches were made, the message loud and clear that Hitler had not only been right, but had not gone far enough, and had left ※the job§ unfinished. Jewish servicemen, returning from war, were at first astonished and then outraged to discover that what they＊d fought against was flourishing in their own neighbourhoods. They heard men shouting anti-Semitic invective on the streets they＊d grown up in. They found swastikas crudely smeared on the walls of buildings in Bethnal Green, Stoke Newington, Maida Vale, Kilburn and elsewhere. They hit back.The 43 Club was founded in early 1946. It was comprised, at first, of tough, well-trained Anglo-Jewish former servicemen. These men set about disrupting the public meetings of the resurgent fascist movement. They also infiltrated it, at great personal risk, to gather intelligence 每 to learn their enemy＊s plans so as to then sabotage them. They fought the fascists on the streets of British cities, and attracted increasing numbers to their cause. They were disciplined, principled and restrained. They were highly effective tactically, and didn＊t hesitate to use brute force when it was required. By 1949 the fascist movement in Britain was effectively finished. Mosley had moved to France.Much of this is told by a founding member of the 43 Group, Morris Beckman, in an extraordinary book called , published by the History Press. It＊s a story of heroic resistance, also a kind of secret history of that rather murky period. I?have borrowed heavily from Beckman＊s account of that resistance in my new book, . It is a novel of the London theatre in those years, and of the simultaneous revival of fascism in Britain. I end the story in a graveyard, with a kind of echo of the Nazi salute. Fascism may at times seem to fade away but it does not?die. Whenever it raises its head, as?Beckman and his friends understood?and as did those protesters in Charlottesville, it must be resisted. Its?head must be cut off, yet again.is published by Hutchinson.																																											"
"n recent years, London duo  have shrugged off their post-dubstep past and started to create songs that shepherd synth-heavy post-punk into the present day. On their third album, the band＊s instrumentals radiate wit and warmth, like mid-80s New Order sloshing around in a sun-kissed sea 每 but it＊s as a foil to some of Britain＊s most idiosyncratic artists that Mount Kimbie really prove their mettle. Marilyn, their collaboration with Micachu, produces a masterly melange of outside-the-box melodies, ＊s hyper-emotional pipes meet creepily corrupted gospel on We Go Home Together, while the brilliant You Look Certain (I＊m Not So Sure)＊s chit-chatty vocals (courtesy of Andrea Balency, the band＊s touring singer) recall post-punkers such as  and the Raincoats. The record＊s other highlight, Blue Train Lines, sees the duo reprise their hugely fruitful alliance with , artfully tempering the latter＊s cracked howl with neat motorik drums and restrained synths that hover politely on the fringes of white noise.

"his tennis film feels like a two-hour baseline rally, and it＊s not just the rackets that are made of wood. It is all about  between supercool Swede Bj?rn Borg and the superbrat challenger from New York, John McEnroe 每 played respectively by Sverrir Gudnason and Shia LaBeouf. It culminates in their first, titanic Wimbledon confrontation in the 1980 final. That really was an unbearably tense contest, but at the end of this film my nails remained salon-fresh. The awful truth was that for all their rivalry and wildly different styles, there wasn＊t any needle between these two men personally, no tension, nothing outside the tennis court for us to get excited about.Really, almost any other pairing of characters from this film would have been more interesting: there is McEnroe/Peter Fleming, his compatriot player and supposed friend on whom John might have played nasty gamesmanship tricks in the changing room. There＊s McEnroe/McEnroe Sr, the demanding dad and professional lawyer who drove him hard. And there＊s Borg/, the coach and mentor played by  with a perpetual look of priestly sorrow.Bergelin was Borg＊s tough trainer from when he was a teenager, the man who beat out of the young Swede precisely that kind of immature tantrum for which McEnroe later became notorious: telling him to focus his energies on the game. Borg＊s real-life son Leo plays the young star between nine and 12 years old. There is one startling scene where the later-teen Borg, after a stern rebuke, storms off into some remote Swedish woodland for a dark-twilight-of the-tennis-soul, raging at the game and at himself, smashing away at the splintering bark with his racket. This scene may have been inspired by Andy Samberg in the comedy Hot Rod, doing his famous cathartic dance in the forest.Actually, the film does show the adult Borg getting cross with Bergelin, even firing him. But it＊s so banal, you wonder if anything has happened at all. ※You＊re acting like a baby, treating the people who care for you like dirt!§ shouts Lennart. Is he? I must have missed that. All I could see was him being bland. You find yourself waiting for something to happen that isn＊t a tennis match, and the tennis itself conforms to the rule that tennis on film isn＊t exciting. Something about the grammar and structure of movie editing cancels the rhythm and cumulative drama of tennis itself.Well, LaBeouf is good casting 每 really, the only possible casting 每 and he channels McEnroe＊s simmering resentment and winner-rage plausibly enough. (I wonder if there were any real-estate moguls in New York around that time for him to model himself on?) As for Borg, Gudnason is certainly an eerie lookalike. But his performance seems set on showing us that underneath that bland, slightly dull exterior there was a ＃ well, let＊s just say he seems the complete master of his personality. Borg suppressed his temper to become a great tennis player; but then McEnroe did the opposite and he＊s a great player too. So what＊s the life lesson here? What＊s the point? They＊re both great players, great guys, and there＊s a kind of self-cancelling evenness at work. The sweatband remains dry. Duels or sporting contests or grudge matches of any sort can make successful cinema: there was , about racing drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and of course  about the famous interview. Audiences have yet to see the forthcoming Battle of the Sexes, with Emma Stone and Steve Carell as tennis players , fighting to see whether men＊s or women＊s tennis is better. However that comes out, it＊s a tennis film which has the advantage of being about something other than tennis. As far as this goes, Borg and McEnroe have all the bromance chemistry of Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst in the notorious romcom . It feels like someone＊s been over-diluting the Robinson＊s Barley Water.																																											"
"he news that the US＊s best political satire show in recent years is signing off during the most  in living memory might not feel quite right. At first, anyway.After HBO announced on Wednesday that ＊s seventh season would be its last 每 bringing to an end the inept and self-sabotaging career of Selina Meyer 每 you can＊t help but feel for those who will struggle to get their fix of (fictional) political incompetence.Meyer, the senator turned vice-president turned president turned ex-president, was a perfect foil for contemporary American politics. Self-obsessed, myopic and utterly useless 每  created a politician who was so ridiculous she was hard to believe, until the  happened.For Louis-Dreyfus, Selina Meyer provided a second huge role following the once-in-a-career success of . It also meant the best actress in a comedy series Emmy was hers for as long as she stayed in the role. (If she wins at this month＊s awards it will be her sixth consecutive Emmy for playing Meyer.)Veep not only mastered the art of political satire, it did that rarest of things: it became a successful cross-Atlantic adaptation. Arguably, only The Office and House of Cards managed that transformation with anywhere near as much grace 每 giving up none of the original＊s snap while translating it for an American audience. Veep took ＊s expletive-punctuated approach to politics and morphed Whitehall into Washington without losing any of the wit.Even after the showrunner and creator Armando Iannucci , the team managed to retain the same layer of profane political polish, as Meyer attempted to free Tibet and cling on to her accidental presidency. HBO executives lavished praise on the show and understood the producers＊ decision to bring it to a close after its seventh series, which is currently being shot. But after the shambolic antics of some in the Trump campaign and the Democrats＊ courting of  (she turned them down), it＊s hard to avoid the feeling that life was imitating satire.Speaking after he left the show, Iannucci said: ※I＊m so glad I don＊t do  any more because I don＊t know how I＊d respond to the situation in America now.§ And that was the problem: political life shifted suddenly and violently.The show set out to point out the foibles of the political system 每 the advisers, the inscrutable wonkishness of Washington, the focus-group tested cynical policy decisions 每 but in the current political climate, that all seems rather quaint and appealing rather than funny.Louis-Dreyfus recently admitted that  ※rocked [the show＊s] world§, and that Veep wasn＊t supposed to be a direct take on real-life politics. But to continue without addressing the current situation would make the show feel like a period piece from the pre-Trump world, when politicians acted like politicians.As Veep announces its departure, it leaves a satirical scene in rude health. Louis-Dreyfus＊s former stomping ground  with its lampooning of the Trump White House;  after the inauguration of a president who begs to be mocked. Even in the current political climate 每 where even in the annual doldrums of August, there was a civil war in the White House and impending nuclear war has seemed only a tweet away 每 Veep＊s legacy is secured, which, let＊s face it, is the only thing Selina Meyer ever really cared about.

"Muscular, honest, funny 每 The Queen is Dead has all the most endearing traits of the Smiths dialled up to the max, and is thought of by many as the band＊s masterpiece album.

"You＊ve read the books, you＊ve seen the movies, you＊ve bought the merch, now see the considerably less interesting life story of the writer behind ＃ You could insert pretty much any literary classic next and chances are a prestige biopic has been made about the author. In recent years, we＊ve had , ,  and . We＊ve even had Lifetime＊s predictably shonky .You can see the appeal of literary biopics. They come with built-in brand recognition, an established fanbase and a vague lustre of highbrow respectability and awards-friendliness (as with ). They are also another excuse to revisit historic Britain at its most jolly decent and imperially mighty, which never hurts. But invariably these biopics end up as heavily fictionalised tales of imagination triumphing over personal adversity, dutifully ticking off the events that inspired the fiction. All the better if they＊re a children＊s author since you can incorporate a cute kid and jazz up the visuals with flights of fantasy.That＊s pretty much what we get with the imminent Goodbye Christopher Robin, which stars  as AA Milne, returning from the first world war and working his traumas into therapeutic ursine whimsy. It promises to be a similar story with the , a man whose decades at an Oxford writing desk were somewhat at odds with his Middle-earth sagas in the excitement stakes. For all their testaments to the power of the imagination, these movies often represent the opposite: the scraping of the barrel of English literature. Like the empire, our stories once held sway over the world, but they＊ve now been adapted and reinterpreted so many times we＊re sick of hearing them.Fewer more so than Winnie the Pooh. After it acquired the rights in the 1960s, Disney squeezed as much honey as possible out of poor Pooh, via scores of movies, TV shows, cuddly toys, lunchboxes 每 you name it. All this teed up a  which got so toxic that people talked about ※the curse of Pooh§.

"he humble gif is turning 30. The multi-purpose bitmap image format has established itself as part of internet culture, so much so that people have almost stopped arguing over how it is pronounced (overwhelmingly it is with a hard g, although the inventor of the format says ).The gif, or graphics interchange format, was created by programmer Steve Wilhite, who longed for an image format that could be used across different computer platforms. At the time, in 1987, this included the likes of Atari, Apple and IBM. Plus modem speeds were slow and images took a long ＃ time ＃ to ＃ load. In the beginning, gifs on the internet were mostly used as design accents for websites, before their current widespread use as the internet currency for expressions and feelings 每 so-called ※reaction gifs§. Indeed, gifs are part of the online trend for expressing ourselves without proper words, alongside emoticons, emojis and abbreviations. The cry-laugh emoji was named , but ※gif§ . Meanwhile, Facebook added gifs to Messenger in 2015, and to celebrate the big 3-o will . Even Twitter, which is well known for introducing , surprised us all by adding the in-platform gif function in 2016. Gif keyboards are also now common, with Apple adding one to Messages in iOS 10 and Google＊s Gboard launched with gif support in 2016. The expansion in web-based, app and downloadable gif editors means many more people are making their own gifs too, with pre-existing ones catalogued in online repositories such as .So, where does the gif go from here? Well, there have been some pretty darn creative innovations in the format to the point it is becoming a , with . In honour of the gif＊s exit from its heady 20s, here are some iconic examples (and some personal favourites):Deal-with-it gifs have been around a long time, and are now so popular that list pieces have collated the best ones. They usually consist of a pair of pixelated sunglasses dropping onto a nonchalant character imploring the viewer to, well, ※deal with it§. The first use was a  in 2010 on the site Dump.fm. But I am particularly fond of the Ferris Bueller inspired version above.Dancing baby was born way back in 1996 by two animators at a video games company.

The popcorn-eating trope is a well known reaction to observing a good old online argument or Twitter beef. Fortunately, there are many popcorn-eating gifs.

Second most popular is . ※Dumpster fire§, shorthand for complete disaster, is truly a term for our times. In particular, a gif of a dumpster fire in Los Angeles was wildly shared in the run-up to Donald Trump winning the 2016 election. Another popular fire-themed reaction gif is a scene from Community in which . is aBritish illustrator, and in 2016 went viral with her gif featuring drawings of every single one of Bowie＊s hairstyles from 1964每2014. One of the most beautiful gif forms is the cinemagraph, which features a single animated element in an otherwise static shot. There are way too many examples, from traffic moving along New York streets to milk being poured into coffee, but all of them are transfixing. One of my all time favourites is the cunning raccoon stealing food from underneath the noses of two cats before scampering away. This cat-burglar was popularised circa 2013 on social sites Imgur and Reddit, where it took off on . Of course people have had fun with it, adding their own narrations.

"n the end, the  were dominated by three shows: The Handmaid＊s Tale, Saturday Night Live and Big Little Lies. None of these programmes were perfect 每 far from it, in fact 每 but there＊s a good chance they＊re the ones people will talk about whenever the subject of 2017 comes up in the future.The Handmaid＊s Tale, for its occasional lapses into unintentionally hilarious grief porn and the uncomfortable early ＆＊ publicity angle, was  by the nature of the current US administration. Big Little Lies marked the moment when all the key Peak TV signifiers 每 movie stars, glamorous locations, graphic sex and violence 每 finally left the orbit of grizzled white male anti-heroes. And Saturday Night Live? A vote for Saturday Night Live was a vote against Trump, even though it was also sort of .In truth, last night＊s ceremony did feel a little like the product of a hobbled field.  每 a breathtaking series that at times absolutely redefined the parameters of episodic television 每 was rendered ineligible until next year. The Leftovers 每 one of the most painful, funny, perfect shows of the last decade 每 failed to receive a single nomination. And some of the shows that did win felt like the product of ingrained viewing.When it comes to comedy shows, Emmy voters seem to be perpetually stuck three years in the past. Not so long ago, it clung to Modern Family despite a notable and inescapable drop-off in quality. And this year, it honoured Veep＊s worst series in the face of several far funnier shows. Veep has one series left, so its victory next year is already all but confirmed, though at least its demise might force voters to watch some new comedies for a change.Most deserved award of the night? Ann Dowd by a light year. Though Elisabeth Moss hoovered up the lion＊s share of the Handmaid＊s Tale＊s highlight-reel anguish, Dowd nailed the impossibly contradictory demands of her character with breathtaking ease. Her Aunt Lydia made you vacillate between hatred and pity, and few performances could match her thrumming intensity.The least deserved? It＊s hard to see past SNL＊s reliance on big names for key roles. Alec Baldwin and Melissa McCarthy＊s Trump and Spicer made plenty of headlines, but neither were particularly nuanced 每 especially when compared to the dead-on Trump impersonation Anthony Atamanuik has mastered over on the President Show 每 and the whole season felt like the uncomfortable moment when the Not Ready For Primetime Players became the Waning Movie Stars Slumming It For Clicks. Still, at least Kate McKinnon won something. Special mention should go to Charlie Brooker, who won best TV movie and best TV movie writing for the San Junipero episode of Black Mirror; an episode that managed to introduce soaring uplift into what until that point had been a relentlessly sludgy palette. If nothing else, its victory should .Most of all, though, how nice to live in a world where Elisabeth Moss and Nicole Kidman won awards in the same year, but not for their infuriating Top of the Lake series. Big little comforts indeed.																																											"
"n Monday 27 July 2015, at 4.35am, Victoria Derbyshire was in her kitchen, with the kettle on, Googling ※inverted nipple§ before leaving home to present her daily BBC2 . Google came up with a list of explanations, one of which was breast cancer. It is usually best to ignore online diagnoses but, in this instance, her preliminary search was right. By 29 July she was having a biopsy, by 31?July it was confirmed she had breast cancer, and on 24 September she had a single mastectomy. And at this point she did something unusual: she made a  sitting up in her hospital bed in an NHS gown, after coming round from the operation. Pale, then suddenly smiling, she held up two pieces of card. On one, she had written: ※THIS MORNING I HAD BREAST CANCER.§ Then she showed us the second: ※THIS EVENING I DON＊T!§Watching the video, you notice she talks as if she feels she has had a narrow escape. She takes little breaths between words, as though resisting speechlessness. ※Today I had a mastectomy and I feel 每 all right 每 I can＊t believe it.§ There is relief in her pronunciation of that slightly questioning ※all right§. She looks from side to side, as if bad news might be lurking in the room. She describes the NHS team as inspiring, shows us the black arrow inked on to her right wrist (to make sure the surgeons did not operate on the wrong breast), and has an impressive shot at explaining breast reconstruction 每 the tucking in of the implant, the pulling down of skin, the hammocky mesh over which skin will eventually grow 每 although she casts around for the word ※reconstruction§, almost lost to morphine.It is extraordinarily plucky and self-possessed to turn a vulnerable, private experience into reportage. She announces that she wants to do it not only because she is a ※pretty open person§ but because more than one in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lives. ※Obviously, I have looked up those stats,§ she adds, like the journalist she is. The video was the first of an illuminating series (all on YouTube) documenting her ,  and emotional reactions to treatment in an attempt to ※demystify§ the disease, learning as she went.The public response, with messages from the medical profession as well as fellow cancer patients, has been overwhelming. Derbyshire has inspired countless tweets, emails and column inches. And now there is a book: . Once past the title (who thought that was a good idea?), it＊s as easy to read as it must, at times, have been hard to live.Cancer writing has become an industry, but this is a book that is more reportage than memoir; it distinguishes itself with its informative immediacy, taking the temperature of every moment. It does not belong on the same literary shelf as the columns of Ruth Picardie, Christopher Hitchens or Jenny Diski, for whom writing came first 每 cancer simply a subject that could not be ignored. In intention, Derbyshire＊s book is closer to Sophie Sabbage＊s wonderful . Sabbage resolved, on the advice of a consultant, never to allow herself to become a ※patient§. Derbyshire is similarly determined to hang on to being a journalist. The result is unusually upbeat, not least because she seems, with any luck, to have seen cancer off.When she walks into her publisher＊s offices, she is precisely as she appears on television. She is 48. Piquant face, pointed chin, bright smile, glossy hair. Being herself is her forte on TV. And she is natural in her videos too, talking to the camera as though to a friend. This morning she has come straight from presenting her programme, wearing a crisp, candy-striped T-shirt and smart blue trousers. She has changed only her shoes, swapping heels for white plimsolls. She is chirpy, smiling, focused. I watch as she gracefully adjusts to being interviewee, not interviewer (she has done her homework, asking a friendly opening question about my sons).You might assume, if you didn＊t know better, that talking to her would be like chatting to a neighbour. But you have only to watch, to take just one example, her recent handling of a  between housing minister, Alok Sharma, and the residents of Grenfell Tower to recognise that this Bafta-winning journalist is an impeccable professional 每 and fearless. She tells the minister to stop talking in ※platitudes§. She calmly keeps the peace, hushing the shouting, raging, heartbroken residents. Seeing that she is on their side makes you feel on hers. You also detect the steel in her, a steel tested by cancer.As she sits down, I ask if she were to make a 10-minute video diary right now, what she would say? ※I＊d start with a health update because I had my check-up yesterday 每 and all is good, touch wood. That is a big hurdle, every six months. Talking off the top of my head, I can＊t believe I＊ve had cancer. I＊m here now 每 alive, happy, healthy. It＊s almost like it never happened, yet it＊s absolutely vivid in the front of my mind. And then, depending on your diagnosis [she seems to assume her viewers all have cancer], I＊d say, ＆If I can get through this, so can you.＊ That wouldn＊t last 10 minutes, but that would be my opening gambit.§When she started out on her treatment, she tells me, she knew nothing about cancer. She is about to say more but interrupts herself with a statement that sounds planned: ※Everything I say has a caveat, which is that every diagnosis, cancer and treatment is different. I＊m not speaking on behalf of everyone. This is purely my experience.§ She continues: ※What matters is the mundanifying of cancer 每 although that is not even a word.§ It is now, I say, and she laughs: ※But you know what I mean? The normalising of it. Cancer shouldn＊t have this uber-powerful status.  can be manageable, you can go to work, have a?drink if you want to, pick kids up from school. I didn＊t know you could do all those things when you had cancer. I＊d no idea, so that was the big surprise for me.§What most needs demystifying, she believes, is cancer surgery and breast reconstruction. She remembers exactly how she felt making her mastectomy video: ※I was recording through the night, I was on such a high.§ Morphine? ※Partly, but mainly I was on a high because I was alive.§Not everyone has been equally admiring of that video. In her book, Derbyshire draws attention to Deborah Orr＊s critical  in which she suggests that Derbyshire oversimplifies cancer. Disarmingly, she wonders, in the book, whether Orr is right. Orr, who has had breast cancer, chafes against what she defines as the ※tyranny of positivity§. Does Derbyshire recognise that positivity can be negative?※I felt stung by her column because I＊d given an honest account post-mastectomy. I wasn＊t faking it. And, hey, guess what? When I started chemo it was a bit more shit, and I didn＊t gloss over that either.§ And I then remind her how, pre-surgery, she felt a morbid fearfulness that was anything but positive. She even took the precaution of writing individual letters to her young sons 每 Oliver (now 11) and Joe (eight) 每 in case she didn＊t make it through the operation. She adds: ※I＊ve no idea if being positive has any impact on recovering from breast cancer.§Turning her experience of cancer into journalism was helpful to her because it gave her ※another purpose, apart from being a cancer patient. It felt a natural decision, partly because, over the decades, people have shared some unbelievably personal experiences with me.§ As you watch her chemo videos, it becomes clear that the most personal physical issue is her hair 每 she is far more obsessed with losing her hair than losing a breast.※Losing your hair makes you look like a cancer patient. I didn＊t want to look like a cancer patient. I didn＊t want people to feel sorry for me. I＊m not saying I wanted people to be unkind, because many people were gorgeous to me. I just didn＊t want to be pitied.§I had never seen a ※cold cap§ (a hat designed to prevent or reduce hair loss during chemotherapy) before watching her  每 demystification in action. Not that it＊s reassuring. It looks like a penitential helmet, seems to be far more painful than the chemo itself and, when she takes it off, leaves shards of ice in her hair. In retrospect, was it a mistake to persevere with it? ※No, it was worth it psychologically＃ I kept about a third of my hair and could say to myself, ＆I still have some hair, I＊m vaguely in control.＊§ She also demystifies wigs, even showing how to shampoo one. But I tell her I have a friend, being treated for breast cancer, who, after watching the  in which Derbyshire takes off her glossy, convincing wig to reveal the return of her own hair, felt indignant because Derbyshire＊s new hair looks fantastic, better than the wig. ※That is her perception, isn＊t it? But my whole life, I＊d had long hair＃ § So you were not aware how great your new hair looked? ※No way! Are you joking? Viewers sent me amazing messages saying, ＆It must be nice to have a new haircut.＊§ But she explains there is nothing nice about a haircut ※imposed on you by cancer and?chemotherapy§.Would she describe herself as vain? She exclaims in an endearing whisper: ※No, I wouldn＊t! To be honest, if you look at some of those video diaries, there is no way you could say I was vain. Jesus Christ! I think about myself going to work with a swollen face because of medication, my eyes and nose streaming because of chemotherapy, no eyebrows, no eyelashes, wearing a bloody wig and going on national TV.§It is one of the nice things about Derbyshire that she never takes offence. And, in spite of her professional steel, I can see that in private she is soft as a marshmallow. In a  made on 1 May 2016, after her 13th radiotherapy session, she looks anxious. ※I don＊t know why but I＊m having a real wobble today,§ she says, ※I＊m just thinking about 每 and I＊m sure this is completely normal, I＊m sure everybody who has ever had a cancer diagnosis will think this 每 I＊m thinking about what if this cancer comes back?＃ I don＊t know why this is in my head today, I don＊t know what the reason is. I can＊t think of anything rational.§It＊s a commentary that stops one short: why does she say her fear is irrational? Surely she is looking into the eye of a particularly frightening truth? Momentarily she looks dismayed, then rallies: ※I didn＊t acknowledge it at the time, but you have just made me see that and you＊re right.§ She was ※irritated with myself§, she elaborates, for ※wasting time§ with depressing thoughts while her treatment was still ongoing.At one point, talking about her working life, she highlights the importance of ※going with the unpredictable§. This was her approach to cancer, too. And it is one of the most powerful things about Derbyshire＊s videos that they reveal that, just when you might expect to feel elated or when it might be convenient to feel extra-calm, you might find yourself ambushed by gloom. Preparing for her final chemo session, she remembers: ※I felt different to what I was expecting. I＊d built up to the last session. I woke at six, thinking, ＆Oh my gosh, it＊s the last chemotherapy; I＊ll never have to wear that cold cap again. Thank goodness, this is another major part of the treatment that is going to be behind me by lunchtime.＊ But when the timer went off, I was in shock. I raised my arms in the air＃ Oh God, I＊m going to cry 每 sorry.§ She wipes her eyes. ※And I just put this blanket over my face because tears started to come. I didn＊t say anything. Mark [Sandell, her partner] was sitting opposite me, and once I＊d got up to hug him he said 每 typical him 每 ＆It feels like just yesterday you were diagnosed.＊§ And that made them both laugh because it was the opposite of the truth.There is, potentially, a limbo at the end of cancer treatment. ※I＊d spent seven months concentrating on the day ahead every day,§ says Derbyshire, ※focusing on the next bit of treatment and, suddenly, the major part of it is over and it＊s just processing it in your head.§ She was saying to herself: ※What the f- and whoa＃ I can＊t believe we＊ve just got through that.§ She drove home with Mark, holding hands. ※We were saying with disbelief, ＆We did it.＊ And then he went to pick the children up and I couldn＊t stop crying, I was texting everyone.§ She couldn＊t wait for the kids to come home, started to make tea for them and then suddenly realised: ※There were no more tears. I＊d cried all the tears out of me.§Mark, a former editor of the World Service＊s  programme and now an executive producer, was ※amazing throughout, caring and funny 每 which was brilliant§. He was doing the practical stuff ※like a single dad§. The toughest times were after chemo because ※I was in bed and knackered and grumpy§. Her understanding of her boys and their emotions is moving. After telling them about her diagnosis, she writes: ※Both boys are now looking at us. Neither asks any questions, which is very unusual for them. It could be because we＊ve been too casual or because they understand completely or because they don＊t quite understand enough.§ Later, there were ※definitely stresses§. ※Joe cried in class, and when he and Oliver came to see me after surgery I had these drains coming out of me and they were so quiet. They just asked, ＆How are you Mummy?＊§And how are they, these days? ※They appear unscathed but I＊ve no idea in the long term. They were pretty robust 每 they took their lead from us.§ She was as honest with them as with us: ※I introduced them to the nurses and doctors. They went into the chemotherapy suite so they could see it was light and airy and not a scary place.§ I suggest that if her handling of the Grenfell meeting is anything to go by, she must be a super-calm mum? ※Pretty much, although not when the boys come in from football and tread mud into the carpet 每 it feels like . I do lose it, but no more than most parents I hope. I＊m pretty straightforward.§Derbyshire was born in Bury, Greater Manchester, the eldest of three children, and has talked openly about growing up with a physically and verbally violent father with whom she is no longer in touch. Having a violent parent, she now says, ※definitely had an impact. There is an example and you decide: we＊re not going to follow it because it＊s shit. I think that is partly what has given me the absolute determination I＊ve always had that our family unit would be strong, that we＊d be together. Mark＊s parents separated when he was 11. So did mine 每 I was 16. My mum was the significant person in my life, and thank God for her and the love she gave me and my brother and?my sister.§There is no mistaking how crucial family support has been to her experience of cancer, and she makes a point of not forgetting Gracie, the family＊s black spaniel. Purchased a month after diagnosis, Gracie makes guest appearances in some videos, frolicking across the green grass of Middlesex: ※Whether I was on a high or experiencing a crushing low, Gracie would be determined to lick my face.§Derbyshire is a worker 每 she made her name on Radio 5 Live as co-presenter of the breakfast show for 16 years before moving, in 2015, to BBC2 and the BBC News Channel. Cancer has not altered her attitude to her job. She describes herself as a good listener and a compassionate person with a ※nothing-to-lose§ attitude to journalism. She is forensic, ※sweats the small stuff§ professionally, but will concede that she now has a ※sense of perspective that means I＊m not wasting any time on pointless anxieties, annoying people or on things that go slightly wrong 每 it＊s all fine§. She laughs. ※I＊ve always lived to the full but now I＊m squeezing life out of every second. I want to spend more time with family and friends 每 they＊re the most important part of my life. But I＊m saying yes to more things. I want to embrace everything.§Embracing everything includes the gym twice a week to offset the side-effects of Tamoxifen 每 she had a rough start with the hormone-based drug. ※I＊d wake up feeling like an old woman 每 not good. I was never a gym person but I＊ve worked out that exercise helps alleviate joint pain. Now I feel about 35; I＊ve so much energy 每 and no pain.§ I ask if she worries about people less lucky than herself in terms of their diagnosis or support.※Cancer is a lottery,§ she concludes, ※in terms of whether you survive or not. I know that and am so grateful. There aren＊t enough words to express my gratitude. I have friends who have died of cancer. It＊s outrageous and unfair.§ But who is she grateful to? When she thanks NHS staff for saving her, does she not reflect that they work as unflaggingly for patients they can＊t save? She opens her arms wide, somewhere between rueful shrug and appreciative surrender: ※I＊m grateful to＃ the ether＃ to Lady Luck＃ I＊m grateful to＃ whoever rolled the dice for me.§																																											"
"his week the email from the Man Booker＊s publicity team arrived, with its announcement of the shortlist: three Americans; two debuts; two formerly shortlisted authors; one winner of a major prize set up in opposition to the Man Booker; and one grand old man. Curious indeed, I thought, and then, as?my more reptilian brain kicked in, I?started playing the odds. Horse-trading? Who pushed for what? Why were names such as  whittled off the longlist?As a literary editor for many years, and a former judge, I have sometimes joked with friends that the year that I correctly predicted the Man Booker result was the year I?judged it. It is, delightfully, unpredictable. The longlist did seem like a mix-tape of greatest hits (thankfully nobody put on ) 每 and yet the only two surprise tracks are on the shortlist.With a different set of judges each year, it is a fool＊s errand to try to guess the eventual winner. So I have always had?a simple formula: never judge the books 每 study the judges.In the infamous year of having a?former spook looking at literature, the prize nearly collapsed under the banalities, until a tried-and-tested victor was put in place ().

"emma Brockis and Wendy Hubbard＊s ambitious production is set during the English civil war and the interregnum that followed. It＊s told by a troupe of the king＊s actors who are blown hither and thither by changing times. This is a show about show: what is monarchy but a form of theatre with its protagonists lavishly costumed up?Initially we find ourselves in a chocolate-box theatre with the king as a gold-masked god at the centre of an -style court . We watch like respectful courtiers from afar. But then it＊s out of our seats and we are ushered backstage, where Charles I is meeting his end. As the trappings of kingship are removed in preparation for his execution, he becomes a vulnerable man, like any other. We stand, a silent mob. He may be the focus, but we hold the power. At least for now. When we return to the main auditorium after the king＊s execution, the lavish mock theatre has been replaced by a graffiti-splattered wall. It soon becomes clear that puritan rule is trampling on both political and creative freedoms. The people are no closer to power.As Melanie Wilson＊s superb sound design evokes warning bells or sirens, Kingdom Come embraces the radicalism of the  and the real possibilities for change that were lost in the mid-17th century. It unfolds like a series of tableaux of history paintings by old masters, with the detail and the perspective always shifting.  This dense, playful evening is at times like one of  and also recalls the immersive work of the  (of which Brockis was a member), though it＊s done on a far bigger budget. It is not always entirely digestible, but is performed with real grit and commitment by a remarkable cast who tell of a nation divided and how when people try to take back power it so often slips through their fingers. A show that lightly points at the parallels between then and now, it could hardly have premiered in a more pertinent week, as the  in what the prime minister called a ※historic decision to back the will of the British people§ 每 but which potentially gives ministers sovereignty over the parliament elected by the people.

"Last year,  took issue on Twitter with a Guardian writer who had described him as the ※§, and you can see his point. Ten years ago, Carner would have been a worthy cult figure, but in 2017 his debut album Yesterday＊s Gone made the Top 20. He has clearly benefitted from the way grime＊s resurgence has raised the profile of and broadened the audience for UK , but artistically he has little in common with  or . His lyrics are introverted, self-effacing and regretful, filled with small, telling details rather than braggadocio; his music is downbeat and wistful, employing samples similar to the library music played in the background of the TV testcard. Yesterday＊s Gone is a hip-hop album filled with subtlety and nuance; it gradually works its way under your skin rather than clobbering you around the head. It might be unlikely to win the 2017 Mercury, but that has nothing to do with its quality and everything to do with last year＊s winner. However much the judges claim all that matters is the music, they＊re unlikely to reward two  albums on the trot for fear of accusations of genre bias. ※Sometimes I think guitar bands aren＊t cool any more,§  vocalist-guitarist Juliette ※Jules§ Jackson told me earlier this year, a hint of self-deprecation peeking out from behind her canny frontwoman persona. Luckily for her, the twentysomething London four-piece are one of the few UK acts making guitar music feel fresh again, as this debut album shows. Its energy and grungy fuzz are complemented by a pop polish inspired by the band＊s love of everyone from Toni Braxton to , who they often cover live. Although Jackson and bandmates Celia, Soph and Fern happily recall 90s female-fronted acts, the Big Moon have a feminist agency that those bands sometimes lacked, especially when singing about a guy drinking pineapple juice to make his semen taste better (Cupid) or losing the feeling in your nipples (Silent Movie Susie). While it＊s an outsider bet 每 it peaked at number 66 in the charts 每 Love in the 4th Dimension is wry, retro and a definite contender. Like all the best musicians, ＊s brilliance spills out of his records and infects the culture at large. Whether furnishing Love Island with storylines or making the news with his bald political commentary, the Croydon rapper has contributed energy, intelligence and humour to the national conversation in a way that the other nominees could only dream of (laughing at Galway Girl doesn＊t count). But all that is just a bonus 每 his album  was both a commercial and artistic triumph, proof that Stormzy has worked out how to take grime mainstream without compromising its darkness or subtlety. It also confirmed the rapper＊s status as the best UK lyricist in a generation 每 his tracks are dense, clever and hugely funny, operating on a far higher plane than comrades like Skepta. Considering the latter won last year, a victory for Stormzy is the only one that makes sense 每 he reminds us of the joy of a performer with an actual personality. Since ＊s first Mercury nomination, for her 2014 debut , the poet/musician/playwright/novelist has hurtled from largely unknown outsider to (at time of writing) bookies＊ favourite, which reflects her enduring ability to capture a shifting zeitgeist.  sets a cast of ordinary Londoners and their daily struggles against a global backdrop of greed, alienation, xenophobia,  and anxiety about the future. The album gives wider context to everyday lives while underlining the human cost of distant political decisions; at the same time as giving a powerful voice to the rise of  now gathering pace around the world. Let Them Eat Chaos would work as spoken word 每 indeed it＊s a simultaneous volume of poetry 每 but with Tempest＊s words (※the people are dead in their lifetimes, dazed in the shine of the streets＃§) darting over an edgy, mesmeric backdrop of minimalist electronics, electro-folk and post-dubstep, it would be a deserving winner.One of the stated aims of the Mercury prize is to ※provide a snapshot of the year in music§, and ＊s debut album  does that better than anything else on the shortlist. Empowered in part by the breakthroughs of last year＊s winner Skepta and this year＊s nominee Stormzy, black British music has become ever more cosmopolitan, drawing on US rap, west African pop and African-Caribbean dancehall. J Hus embodies that current diasporic tendency, and does so with the leg-humping horn of an adolescent puppy. He constantly underlines his ugliness, and then shows it to be no barrier to receiving oral sex while eating breakfast cereal; he devises the filthiest, most brilliant use ever of ※cat got your tongue§. But he also shows that ※sometimes I＊m evil§ on the ferocious drill of Clartin, and reflects on crime and poverty with bracing candour throughout. Invariably it all gets routed back to women, such as when he laments not being able to receive nudes on his brick phone. J Hus is 2017 in a snapshot, and his roadman lust would make him a hugely charismatic winner.Jazz at the Mercurys is like the vegan option at Mr Hogg＊s XXL Jumbo Steakhouse: everyone＊s happy for it to be on the menu, but there＊s zero chance of anyone plumping for it when it＊s time to order. Which is perhaps understandable 每 the Mercury prize after all is about the new and exciting, and  is often perceived as something for the Friday night BBC2 crowd to nod sagely along to (see also: folk). However, that way of thinking dismisses the fact that several recent jazz selections have been thrilling 每 most notably last year＊s Channel the Spirit by , a violently danceable album of Sun Ra-ish astral skronk. This year＊s jazz effort,  by twentysomething trumpeter Laura Jurd＊s quartet Dinosaur, isn＊t quite as out there, but it＊s still worth celebrating. Mixing the bleary sounds of ＊s 70s electric period with flamenco, folk and even a bit of experimental math-rock, it＊s the sort of deft, inventive fare that confounds stereotypes of the genre. At a time when jazz has some commercial relevance thanks to ＊s  collaborations, a Dinosaur win would feel of the moment and would honour the prize＊s tradition of swinging the odd curveball (such as 2009 winner ). If nothing else, it would be better than sodding . Given the company  keeps 每 ,  每 the south London producer doesn＊t seem like an underdog.  extensively sampled one of his songs.  solicited his input on her recent album A Seat at the Table. As a quavery soul man, he first made his name as one of s many voices. Sampha＊s own debut is an uncommon beauty, touched by the quicksilver of greatness and a deep sense of unease. It is indelibly coloured by his mother＊s death from cancer and his fears for his own health. Process is not the debut of a smug international jet-setter, but the internal weather report of an uncertain human, original and full of unexpected little rustles, koras and east Asian tones. Combining tear-jerking piano ballads 每 the conventionally beautiful (No One Knows) Me Like the Piano 每 with restless avant-garde touches, it is full of love: filial, romantic and thwarted.

"Late-night hosts on Tuesday addressed the the internet mayhem that ensued after  inadvertently ※liked§ a pornographic clip on Twitter, and also the latest at secretary Ben Carson＊s department of housing and urban development, a government agency crucial to helping communities rebuild in the wake of hurricanes Harvey and Irma.※After the devastation caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, dozens of cities and millions of Americans are beginning the rebuilding process,§ began NBC＊s Seth Meyers. ※In doing so, they＊ll have to rely on assistance from the federal government, specifically on agencies like the department of housing and urban development known as HUD.§※To lead the agency, President Trump appointed former Republican presidential candidate Dr ,§ Meyers continued. ※Now, regardless of what you think of his politics, Dr Carson＊s own story is remarkable. He was raised by his mother, he had to work several jobs to make ends meet, and he went on to become one of the most respected pediatric neurosurgeons in the world.※But his qualifications to lead HUD were rightfully questioned almost immediately after Trump announced his nomination,§ the host explained, adding that in addition to a total lack of government experience, Carson opposed some of the agency＊s fundamental intentions.※During his confirmation hearing, senator Elizabeth Warren questioned Dr Carson about whether or not the Trump family would benefit financially from his tenure as HUD secretary,§ Meyers said. ※And Carson gave this unfortunate answer.§The host then aired a clip from Carson＊s confirmation hearing, in which he responded to Warren＊s questioning by saying ※it will not be my intention to do anything to benefit any American§.※And so far, he＊s succeeding!§ joked Meyers. ※Carson wasn＊t just making bizarre statements. He was also making changes at HUD, which critics have called a near dismantling of the agency. An investigation by ProPublica in New York magazine, for example, found that ＆new leadership was often actively discouraging initiative on the part of employees＊ and ＆actively slowing down new initiatives＊.§Meyers went on: ※When HUD isn＊t busy hiring unqualified people, they＊re not hiring people at all. According to employees, and this is something secretary Carson also admits, almost all of the top legal jobs below him are still not filled.§※All of this is especially troubling right now because more and more people will come to rely on HUD as it faces its greatest challenge yet under this administration,§ Meyers said, before explaining how vital the agency was to disaster relief funding after Hurricane Katrina. ※Although Carson has promised that his agency would take care of families left homeless by the storm, thanks to his boss, the money may not be there to do so in the future.§Meyers then detailed the agency＊s 13% budget cut, which equals a $6bn reduction in its funds.※Money to help homeowners and business rebuild after disaster goes through HUD＊s $3bn community development block grant program that Trump has proposed getting rid of altogether,§ the host explained. ※And it＊s not just HUD.§※While Trump is busy praising agencies that are helping with disaster relief, they＊re also the same agencies whose funding he wants to slash,§ Meyers said. ※Now is not the time to cut back on disaster relief programs, especially not when hurricanes are lining up like they have numbers at a deli.§ focused on the day＊s lighter news: in a short monologue, the Daily Show host turned his eye toward senator Ted Cruz, who ※liked§ a pornographic clip on Twitter late Monday night and woke up to an internet firestorm.※Big news in the tech world today,§ Noah began. ※Apple announced the new iPhone 10. But who cares? Because this is the technology news that we＊re interested in.§Noah then showed a news clip about the senator＊s unfortunate gaffe, including the detail that the account whose hardcore pornographic clip he liked was called ※sexual posts§.※Of course Ted Cruz would search for porn by typing sexual posts,§ joked Noah. ※That is the most generic, lame way to search for pornography. What else does he search? ＆Uncovered swimsuit areas.＊ ＆Reproduction showing the outside parts.＊§※Everyone is freaking out about this and they＊re calling it a possible scandal all because a politician may have watched porn,§ Noah said. ※Come on people, it＊s no big deal. Everyone watches porn. It＊s part of being a normal human being, which is exactly why we know Ted Cruz didn＊t do it.§The host continued: ※He＊s pretending to like porn as a way to blend in with the rest of the human species. I know what this is. Trying to seem relatable as your first move into the 2020 presidential run. We＊re not buying, it, Ted Cruz. You don＊t watch porn. We know you got hacked.§																																											"
"每 John Denver Grey Gables always reminds me of the hotel in . Endless echoing corridors and unoccupied conference suites. Run by a skeleton staff for invisible guests. It is almost certainly haunted. The bones of previous residents moulder in the spacious grounds. Captain, Jack Woolley＊s unattractive bull terrier, is here with his own headstone and the ashes of Caroline, the former owner, nourish a cherry tree. ※No better place for her final rest§ as her sorrowing widower put it this week and, indeed, there is a sense of mausoleum about the place. Grey Gables is the nearest thing to a white elephant you will find outside Whipsnade Zoo.  Perhaps, you feel somewhat wildly, if they painted the gables a cheerier colour? In this sombre setting, Matt and Lilian said their last farewell because she is to Wed Another. ※I＊m glad I got to see your suite. Goodbye, Tiger!§ ※Goodbye, Pusscat!§ This affecting parting was observed by a scandalised Adam, who may have misunderstood the reference to seeing Matt＊s suite.  Since Caroline died, rumour has been rife that Grey Gables is to be turned into luxury flats and its staff (mostly left over from earlier storylines) forced to find gainful employment for which they are frankly ill fitted. However, Caroline＊s widower has decided not to sell (※I am going to move permanently into the Grosvenor Suite§) and Ian, Grey Gables＊ gay chef, celebrated this good news by telling Adam he wants to have a baby.  One way and another, it has been a thoroughly trying week for Adam. Another child 每 adopted, fostered or surrogate 每 will add to Ambridge＊s already extraordinary collection of odd tots. I am not one to gossip, as you know, but Henry was born by sperm donor, Jack by rape, George needed genetic testing to establish his paternity and one poor kid is called Mungo. Several are illegitimate, two are South African and you can throw in a couple of Bulgarian girls if Roy screws up the courage to propose to Lexi, a formidable strawberry picker, who sounds as if she was born swinging a sickle. Now, on a brighter note, would anyone like the recipe for Jennifer＊s guava and mango meringue?																																											"
"The government has changed the preferred route of a road tunnel designed to restore peace and tranquillity to  after protests by druids, archaeologists and conservation experts. There was an outcry that the 1.8-mile tunnel would pass too close to precious barrows and ruin the view of the sun setting at the winter solstice, a crucial date in the pagan calendar.  On Monday the government said it was now planning to shift the tunnel an extra 50 metres away from the prehistoric monument to try to ease the concerns of the scheme＊s critics. But the proposals, announced as part of plans for a ?1.6bn upgrade to the route in and out of the south-west of England, are still very divisive, with sceptics arguing that precious ancient features will be destroyed and the site＊s world heritage status could be at risk.There is also concern that the cost seems to be rising. In January it was widely reported that the cost would be ?1.4bn. The Department for  said the estimated cost had been revised upwards, to ?1.6bn. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, said the investment in road improvements, including eight miles of dual carriageway as well as the tunnel, would be a huge boost to the region. ※Quicker journey times, reduced congestion and cleaner air will benefit people locally and unlock growth in the tourism industry,§ he said. The planning process for the scheme will begin next, and construction could start in 2021 and take five years. The culture secretary, Karen Bradley, said: ※This investment will help make the visitor experience much more enjoyable. With over 1 million visitors a year, Stonehenge is one of the jewels in the UK＊s crown and it is important that we preserve it for generations to come.§  The government said the tunnel would be at least 1.8 miles long and would follow the existing route of the A303 but a further 50 metres from the site than was proposed earlier this year. It said the modification meant the tunnel would avoid important archaeological sites and would not intrude on the view of the setting sun from Stonehenge during the winter solstice. Building either shorter or longer tunnels has been considered. A shorter one would succeed in making Stonehenge more tranquil but the siting of the portals 每 the entrances and exits 每 would damage other important monuments within the world heritage site. A longer one is seen as prohibitively expensive. A tunnel of 1.8 miles is being presented by the government as a good balance, delivering benefits to the site but still affordable. One of the main benefits would be that at the eastern end the road dives underground before a feature called the Avenue, believed to be a ceremonial approach to Stonehenge from the river Avon. This would allow visitors and pilgrims, for the first time in decades, to safely follow the route their forebears took.  Organisations including the site＊s custodians, English Heritage, and the landowner, the National Trust, were concerned that under plans released earlier this year the western portal was too close to a neolithic and early bronze age feature called the . The two bodies, plus Historic England, backed the government＊s new tweak. They said: ※We believe the amended route can, if designed and located with the utmost care, deliver a lasting legacy for the world heritage site and restore peace and tranquillity to the Stonehenge landscape. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reunite this ancient landscape which is currently severed by a huge volume of road traffic. ※The route announced will ensure the winter solstice alignment will be unspoilt by lights and traffic from the road. We also want to see the globally important archaeology protected, the settings of the ancient burial sites respected and the views between those sites restored. It is now critical to ensure that the benefits of this new route can be realised through careful design and mitigation of archaeological risks, particularly at the western portal of the tunnel and the approach road.§The AA welcomed the announcement. The motoring organisation＊s president, Edmund King, said: ※Stonehenge＊s ancient circle, created by the can-do attitude of prehistoric builders, has become a monument to modern-age indecision where plans and consultations to ease traffic congestion have gone round and round. ※This improvement is long overdue, not only for the millions of holidaymakers heading west but also for the essential businesses that use this strategic route. Reducing congestion near Stonehenge will greatly benefit the environment and the economy.§ expressed anger, especially in light of concern from the heritage body Unesco over the plans for a tunnel. The alliance＊s honorary secretary, Kate Fielden, said: ※We are shocked at the indifference to . The project needs a complete rethink, not a minor tweak which still threatens major harm to this iconic landscape.§ Fielden said the damage to the site would be huge. ※There will be deep cuttings, a four-way highway, faster traffic, signage. The potential risk of loss of Stonehenge＊s world heritage status casts shame upon our country and those responsible for caring for our heritage.§The proposals will now be subject to what is likely to be a lengthy planning process.

"Rellik sounds like the name of the latest Scandi-noir detective with a fondness for schnapps. But by now you probably know it＊s also killer, backwards 每 a clever encapsulation of the latest high-concept crime drama from  (creators of , One of Us and ITV＊s Liar) because Rellik is a serial killer story told backwards, its narrative parcelled out in brief chunks in the style of films like Memento.As DCI Gabriel Markham, an acid-scarred, bitumen-throated cop fuelled by vengeance, Richard Dormer (AKA Game of Thrones＊s one-eyed flaming sword-swinger Beric) is the nominal star. But Rellik wants to turn everyone into detectives, forcing us to piece together its moonwalking murder mystery from clues as we go.After a summer where the closest most of us have come to a brainteaser has been working out the latest acrostic in a Trump resignation letter, processing a serial killer investigation seems a big ask. So let＊s do it together. In a back-to-front story, the opening scene 每 introducing Gabriel as a scowling insomniac who has a case-breaking brainwave while grabbing booze at an all-night garage at 3am 每 will presumably end up being crucial. With zero context beyond rolling news stating ※acid murder suspect shot§, Rellik immediately lurches into gothic, with Gabriel clambering into a graveyard on a stormy night before clawing at the resting place of Edith Grey to retrieve a pill bottle. Only a few minutes in and our scarred hero has already had a Shawshank moment of rainy catharsis. How did we get here? That＊s when Rellik introduces its signature effect: a queasy montage of reversed footage to signal its first time jump backwards. Suddenly it＊s 10 hours earlier and the acid murder suspect Steven Mills (Michael Shaeffer) is loitering outside a primary school. When Gabriel attempts to bring him in, things go badly wrong, and Mills is sniped with such force his body flies over 10 feet into the school pond. Despite him being unarmed, the cops see this as a win 每 all except gloomy DI Shepard (Jodi Balfour), who has a debrief with Gabriel in his car. There is a suggestion that their relationship predates his acid attack.Another rewind, five hours this time, and we meet three possible suspects (four if you count the great Ray Stevenson as Gabriel＊s harried boss DS Benton). A city slicker with Kingsman glasses (played by Paul Rhys) hustles to catch a plane. An irate therapist is pulled out of a session to see a newsflash. And in a brief cutaway, we glimpse a scarred woman in hospital, a tear rolling down her cheek.Stuck in traffic, Gabriel also gets to lay out what seems like Rellik＊s mission statement as he deduces the sorry backstory of a drug-addicted windscreen-washer: ※If we go back far enough, if we can understand why people do what they do, if we can understand the motive, then maybe we wouldn＊t spend so much time chasing our own tails.§ The police are closing in on the school, and we realise the action is about to sync up with Mills being shot, which surely means ＃＃ another time jump, back three hours and 33 minutes. This is where we belatedly see some actual police work, with Mills＊s wife Beth and daughter Allie brought in for questioning while Gabriel＊s team search their home. Shepard and Gabriel learn that, after a previous violent episode, Mills had been diagnosed with schizophrenia but has long been managing his condition with medication. There are three frantic voicemails from Mills on Beth＊s phone, and when he calls again Gabriel convinces her to set up the fateful primary school meet.Mills makes Beth promise to meet her mother with him, and Gabriel zeroes in on that remark. It turns out that her mother, Edith Grey, has been dead for years. This is a satisfying lightbulb moment for armchair sleuths, who can connect that name with the gravestone in the opening scene. But there are also other juicy clues being dangled: what＊s the significance of the charred aftermath of a small fire in the police station? And why, according to his browsing history, does Mills have an obsession with porn featuring sleeping women?Another five-hour rewind and we witness a missed rendezvous between Mills 每 wounded and scared 每 and his psychiatrist Isaac Taylor (Paterson Joseph), the therapist we saw earlier, at a roadside cafe. Taylor has some rather pernickety ways: he＊s a man so wary of other people＊s skin cells that he carries surgical gloves and disinfectant wipes wherever he goes. Useful for avoiding infection, or for avoiding leaving DNA evidence?We also, belatedly, get a look at an actual murder scene in a derelict warehouse. Shepard reveals that the victim was killed before acid was poured on their face, which doesn＊t fit their pattern. Gabriel also notes that it hasn＊t been staged in a playground ※this time§, which suggests some grim crime scenes in the weeks to come. A charged encounter between Gabriel and the scarred woman, Christine, reveals he considers her his prime suspect, and likely the person who attacked him with acid.There is a final rewind, albeit one that crams in two rug-pulling moments. It＊s early morning and we discover Gabriel has a previously unmentioned wife and teenage kid (and that his wife is aware of his affair with Shepard). And we witness a panicking Mills being coerced into committing murder while being filmed, even if he does manage 每 after a frantic, gunshot-punctuated scramble 每 to flee with a bullet wound and the data card. A data card that ends up in a pill bottle in his mother-in-law＊s grave.So what happens if we review what happened in the right order? In the course of one rather eventful day, Steven Mills was forced to commit murder, presumably 每 but not definitely 每 by the actual serial killer. Mills managed to escape with evidence that could clear his name but contacted his therapist Isaac Taylor instead of going to the police. Gabriel promised his wife he＊d break off his affair with Shepard but that didn＊t go to plan, and neither did his attempts to bring in Mills alive. But he did manage to recover that vital data card at the death 每 we just won＊t get to see how he uses it until the final episode. That all-night garage with a ※HELLO§ sign where the ※O§ is calculatedly on the blink is an early indicator that we are deep in heightened Luther-style cop-noir territory. The unexpected fisticuffs between two cops 每 later revealed as the result of tension over their gay workplace affair 每 felt a little superfluous, but perhaps each episode will have its own subplot that can be tied off to maintain a sense of forward momentum. We know the killer apparently attacked Gabriel with acid, scarring half his face, but it has had time enough to heal for him to return to active duty, suggesting the investigation might stretch back weeks or even months. Considering we＊re travelling back in time, it＊ll be interesting to see how episode two handles the traditional ※previously on Rellik§ montage. Shouldn＊t it be ※later on Rellik§?																																											"
"1776 was an annus mirabilis for English and American prose, a year to compare with 1859 (Darwin＊s ; Dickens＊s ; Mill＊s ). In February, Gibbon published the first volume of his ; while in March a brilliant intellectual, a star of the Scottish Enlightenment, single-handedly invented the subject of modern political economy with  which swiftly became established in the minds of intelligent readers as . When the first edition sold out in six months, the story went round that another celebrated Scot, the philosopher David Hume, was now joking that  probably required too much thought to be as popular as Gibbon＊s .Gibbon, in fact, was full of generous praise for his rival. He wrote to the Scottish historian and philosopher Adam Ferguson: ※What an excellent work is that with which our common friend Mr Adam Smith has enriched the public! An extensive science in a single book, and the most profound ideas expressed in the most perspicuous language§.Smith＊s work, indeed, was every bit as singular as Gibbon＊s. Although it provided a comprehensive and magisterial treatment of its subject, it was also a work of robust common sense, intelligible to any careful reader, braiding history, philosophy, psychology, and sociology in a compelling tapestry of theory and experience. Smith, writes one commentator, was concerned to improve ※the human condition in practical ways for real people§. This was a book that had begun as a series of lectures delivered to audiences in Glasgow. Smith＊s friend Hume, joking aside, declared that the book had ※depth and solidity and acuteness, and is so much illustrated by curious facts, that it must at last take the public attention§.For Smith, in a doctrine that would have been music to the ears of any energetic new Americans, a nation＊s labour is the source of its basic means. Moreover, Smith argued, there is an intrinsic value to the division of labour, where labour was the sole determinant of price. This simple proposition becomes complicated in more advanced societies by the intervention of wages, profit, and rent, three elements that complexify the basic economic model. Combined with Smith＊s wide-ranging, lucid, and profound exposition, there＊s also his assault on the mercantile system, an outmoded throwback that he conceived as restrictive, repressive, and inimical to individual self-expression in the marketplace.At the heart of  is the provocative suggestion that self-interest is perhaps the only criterion of economic behaviour, and that the universal, unfettered pursuit of self-advantage was the only sure guarantee of general welfare. Arguably, it is the collision of Smith＊s ideas with the political ambitions of the American revolution that would, eventually, make a decisive contribution to the development of western capitalism.Crucially, for Smith, a civilised society is a trading society. There＊s a famous passage in book 1 where he argues for the natural place of competitive trade.Accordingly, Smith＊s opening theme is that the regulations imposed on commerce are ill-founded and counterproductive. In Smith＊s day, the conventional wisdom was that gold and silver was wealth, and that countries should boost exports and resist imports in order to maximise this metallic treasure. It was Smith＊s transformative insight that a nation＊s real wealth lies in the constant traffic of goods and services thereby created 每 what we would call the gross national product. To maximise this, he argued, government should not restrict an individual nation＊s productive capacity, but set it free.Another central theme was that such productive capacity rests on the division of labour and on the accumulation of capital that such activity makes possible. Huge efficiencies can be gained by breaking production down into a multiplicity of small tasks, each undertaken by specialists. In book 1, Smith cites the example of pin-makers.The division of labour, he demonstrates, will leave producers with a surplus that they can exchange with others, or use to invest in more efficient labour-saving machinery. It was ideas of this kind that persuaded later readers such as  to describe  as providing the ※scientific backbone to liberal sentiment§, declaring that it was the ※classic English philosophy of history§.Smith＊s third theme is that a country＊s future income depends upon this capital accumulation. The more that is invested in better productive processes, the more wealth will be created in the future. But if people are going to build up their capital, they must be confident that it will be secure from theft. The countries that prosper are those that grow their capital, manage it well, and protect it. Smith demonstrated that this system is automatic. Where things are scarce, people are prepared to pay more for them; there is more profit in supplying them, so producers invest more capital to produce them. Where there is a glut, prices and profits will be low, and then producers switch their capital and enterprise elsewhere. Industry thus remains focused on the nation＊s most important needs, with no need for central direction.But, says Smith, the system is automatic only when there is competition. When governments grant subsidies or monopolies to favoured producers, or shelter them behind tariff walls, they can charge higher prices. The poor suffer most from this, facing higher costs for the necessities that they rely on.  also says that competition and free exchange are under threat from the monopolies, tax preferences, controls, and other privileges that producers extract from the government.For all these reasons, Smith believes that government itself must be limited. Its core functions are to maintain defence, keep order, build infrastructure and promote education. It was the duty of good government to keep the market economy open and free, and not act in ways that might distort it. Enter George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams et al.  was, of course, published in the year of the Declaration of Independence. This strange fact lends added significance to Smith＊s prediction that the Americans ※will be one of the foremost nations of the world§.※Compared, indeed, with the more extravagant luxury of the great, [the blacksmith＊s] accommodation must no doubt appear extremely simple and easy; and yet it may be true, perhaps, that the accommodation of an European prince does not always so much exceed that of an industrious and frugal peasant, as the accommodation of the latter exceeds that of many an African king, the absolute masters of the lives and liberties of 10,000 naked savages.§																																											"
"he question of whose disobedience, and what kind of disobedience it is, are at the heart of this absorbing and moving love story from Chilean director Sebasti芍n Lelio, his English language debut, following very quickly on the heels of his film A Fantastic Woman which has been a festival-circuit hit this year.Rachel Weisz,  and Alessandro Nivola are at the top of their game, perhaps especially Nivola in a supporting role; he achieves a sympathy and maturity that I have never seen from him before.The drama takes place in the Orthodox Jewish community of north London. Weisz is Ronit, a young woman we see initially in New York: a photographer evidently living a fashionable and bohemian lifestyle. Out of the blue, she receives some bad news from back home, and Lelio shows that her first impulse is to try to anesthetise the pain with drink and casual sex. But the truth must be faced up to, and a much-feared homecoming is necessary. Because she has learned of the death of her father, a much-respected rabbi: a fierce, potent cameo for Anton Lesser. It was partly to escape the stifling rigidity of her father＊s values that Ronit fled London for a secular life in New York in the first place: defiant, relishing freedom, but nursing a wound of guilt for breaking her father＊s heart; she was an only child and he a widower. Ronit was all he had left.Back in London for the various ceremonies - the very epitome of the religious observance and obedience that she had wanted to get away from - Ronit feels all eyes on her: curious, and disapproving, but in a way cowed by her authentic connection with this revered religious leader. People have a habit of remarking, in tones of awe, how much she resembles her late mother. Weisz conveys her grief, her disorientation, her borderline-hysterical need to mock the pieties. Ronit is disturbed most by two friends from the old days, from whom she senses a nervous disapproval. One his Dovid (Alessandro Nivola), her father＊s favourite pupil, a virtual adopted son who is now a much admired young rabbi himself. The other is Esti, beautifully played by Rachel McAdams, who was Ronit＊s only ally in youthful rebelliousness back in the day. But now Esti is married to Dovid and Ronit is clearly shocked by how much older they seem, how much more conservative, how greater the gulf is between them, and by that token how much more intense her loneliness and grief then feels. But Lelio＊s drama is not simply about this, because it is clear that Esti is not in fact so estranged from Ronit as first appeared, and this homecoming triggers a new independence of mind in her that makes everyone very uneasy. The truth is that Ronit and Esti were more than friends - and it wasn＊t just religion she was fleeing but forbidden love. They could easily be more than friends again and the movie adroitly lets us decide just how open a secret their relationship always was. There an overwhelming passion and eroticism to this reunion, especially in contrast to the dutiful marital lovemaking between Dovid and Esti which Lelio had already shown us: trying of course for a baby. In the bedroom, before sex, Esti had listlessly removed not just her clothes but her wig: the badge of female piety. One of Ronit＊s most misjudged attempts at diplomacy is to try wearing a wig herself, a temporary gesture which succeeds only in irritating everyone and reminding her late father＊s friends how much they still resent her desertion. The poignancy of her dad＊s modest family home and his death bed, moved downstairs to the front room in his final days, reinforces the severity and austerity of Ronit＊s family background - and also how sensationally transgressive her renewed affair with Esti is. McAdams herself is excellent at suggesting how with sheer force of will and learned piety she had got her life together while Ronit was away and is now a schoolteacher. We see her leading a class in discussing Shakespeare＊s Othello. The choice of play interestingly leads the audience to wonder how Dovid is going to take the news of his wife＊s adventure. Dovid himself is a wiry, muscular warrior of the faith. But he is not a tyrant or a bully and he is himself conflicted in various ways about Ronit＊s reappearance. Rather daringly, he is teaching the Song Of Songs in his own scriptural class and permitting candid discussion of its erotic qualities. The drama is expertly controlled by Lelio, lit and shot in muted and subdued colour tones by cinematographer Danny Cohen and it has a very interesting musical score by Matthew Herbert; its musing and almost playful woodwind figures cut against the expected sombreness and obvious melancholy to contribute to this sense of disorientation and subversion. This is richly satisfying and powerfully acted work. 																																											"
"Holger Czukay, co-founder and bassist with pioneering German rock band Can, has died aged 79. He was found by a neighbour at his apartment, converted from Can＊s old studio in Weilerswist near Cologne. The cause of death is currently unknown. His wife Ursula had died in July, while his former bandmate  每 with whom he created Can＊s fabled driving rhythm section 每 also died this year, in January.Can were part of a 1970s movement rather insensitively dubbed ※§ by the British music press, alongside bands including , Faust and , who paired the strident rhythms of rock＊n＊roll with psychedelic, exploratory new forms. Following a period of study under composer Karlheinz  in the early 1960s, Czukay played on nine of Can＊s albums as well as engineering them, including their celebrated Tago Mago and Ege Bamyasi, before leaving in 1977 to go solo.He went on to collaborate with numerous celebrated musicians 每 he and Liebezeit played on the ＊ debut album, while he recorded the Balearic disco classic Snake Charmer with New York DJ Francois Kevorkian, U2 guitarist The Edge and Public Image Limited＊s Jah Wobble, and also made a pair of collaborations with Japan singer .Czukay is also celebrated for his experiments with sampling before the advent of digital samplers, cutting up and splicing tape into recordings. He also pioneered what he called ※radio painting§, using shortwave radios to record random snippets of sound and pasting them collage-style into recordings; ※rhythm boxing§ was his description of how he used drum machines. His most recent solo album was Eleven Years Innerspace in 2015.Can partly reformed in April without Czukay 每 Irmin Schmidt and Malcolm Mooney performed with the London Symphony Orchestra, Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore and others as .

"n , offers what＊s billed as a ※personal encyclopaedia of the world§, addressed to his unborn fourth child. Here are, as if written daily, a series of reflections on diverse subjects with say-what-you-see titles: ※Wasps§, ※Plastic Bags§, ※Chewing Gum§, ※Labia§, ※Flaubert§, ※Toilet Bowls§, ※Loneliness§, and so on. Sixty of them, 20 per month, each month prefaced with another letter to their recipient.And it really is, I＊m afraid, the most colossal load of old cobblers. On the final page of the introduction 每 a twee little fugue, solemnly quoted in the publicity material 每 he declares: ※I want to show you our world as it is now ＃ you will experience things for yourself and live a life of your own, so of course it is primarily for my own sake that I am doing this: showing you the world, little one, makes my life worth living.§Well, yes. Except that on the previous page, in the course of a discussion of what makes life worth living, he has declared that opening a door is the big thing: ※Yes, the door opens, like a wing, and that alone makes life worth living.§ Do make up your mind, you ludicrous beardy, you want to say.But, then, obviously, the question arises as to how far Knausgaard is in on the joke. A bit, perhaps 每 but not far enough; not by a long chalk. He strains for effect: he overstates, he generalises. On page 53, he announces: ※Most of the body＊s interior, its organs and moist cavities, is pale in colour.§ On page 73 he＊s considering the ※reddish§ colour of the lips as compared to the ※white, yellowish-white, brown or black skin stretched over the rest of the face§, and says the colour is ※characteristic of the interior of the body§. Well, it＊s one or the other 每 or neither.He＊ll either offer a questionable saying: ※Nothing can live in airtight space, therefore nothing can die in it either.§ Or he＊ll hymn the ineffable beauty of something 每 a lone plastic bag, a child blushing, a thunderstorm, a puddle of vomit, a vacuum flask (there are a lot of candidates presented for ※the most beautiful thing I have ever seen§). Or he＊ll wonder at the limits of human knowledge. ※Perhaps,§ he writes; ※maybe§; ※I don＊t know.§ This could be seen as properly and movingly tentative; but it reads on the page as merely arch.On teeth, he writes: ※Nothing that enters the baby, mostly milk but also a little mashed banana and potato, bears the slightest resemblance to teeth, which in contrast to the food are hard. Yet this must be what happens 每 that certain substances are extracted from the partly liquid, partly soft nourishment and transported to the jaws, where they are assembled into the material used to make teeth. But how?§ As the hip-hop duo  sung on ※Miracles§: ※Fucking magnets: how do they work?§Knausgaard has, declaredly, written these little passages in haste, day by day, taking inspiration from and in the moment. He hopes to capture, I suppose, the associative drift of consciousness 每 the way in which memory and emotion and habituation and happenstance meld and play off each other as a person goes through the world. He doesn＊t need to be consistent; only faithful to the truth of the moment.But there＊s a difference between cultivating that approach and simply writing the first thing that comes into your head, and I＊m not at all persuaded Knausgaard has clocked that such a difference exists. The result is a style of almost spoken-word looseness, replete with run-on sentences (※In nature there are no frames, all things and phenomena merge into one another, the earth is round, the universe is infinite and all time is eternal§). There are repetitions (※the child lies there on the changing table, and suddenly a shiny golden rivulet begins to trickle out of the crevice between its legs if it is a girl-child, or a shiny golden fountain-like spurt rises from the boy-child＊s little nozzle§), cliches (※white as snow§) and half-thought-out apothegms.Is it true, in more than a bumper-sticker way, that the spirit of an artist ※rebels against conformity§? Can he be intending to make us laugh, or simply being careless, when he says that a pair of boots ※fit me like a glove§? Does his mother really drive a car to work ※by the sweat of her brow§? (Though these may, to be fair, be the translator＊s fumbles rather than the author＊s). At one point he earnestly announces: ※Behind the lips, the teeth stand fence-like, hard and impervious, and behind this fence a grotto yawns: the mouth, the oral cavity.§ Look at ※yawns§, there. Here is a dead metaphor disinterred and reburied in a pauper＊s graveyard. Of course it yawns: it＊s a mouth.Knausgaard is interested in the ※foreign§, the unknowable, the exchange between the body and the world, memory, the unnoticed strangeness of the quotidian. He seeks to re-enchant the world by making us notice afresh what we fail to see because it＊s so familiar.The main issue, I think, is a clash of styles. Where the writer as open floodgate might be well suited to the baggy autofiction-fleuve of his , a sort of torrential mudslide in which garlic and sapphires will float up by serendipity for the reader to admire as they pass, the snap essays here are a tighter form. He wants to be aphoristic; but aphorism requires a concentration and precision of meaning that is the opposite of the style on show. He＊s simply not paying attention hard enough.So the general pattern of the pieces 每 the swerve from a concrete image into a metaphor or memory or general statement about existence 每 aggregates a series of indistinguishable muzzy epiphanies. We meet animals (frogs, porpoises, adders, badgers, jellyfish) whose sense world makes them alien and thrillingly unknowable. We meet human-made objects (bags, tin cans, petrol) whose quiddity makes them stand bafflingly apart from the gestalt of nature around them. We meet natural phenomena (the sun, lightning, pain, birds of prey) whose uniqueness reinvigorates Knausgaard＊s sense of his consciousness in the world. But these lose their particularity as they pile up.A good comparator might be Nicholson Baker＊s 2003 novel . There is the same framework of a sheaf of short reflections 每 in Baker＊s case, the daily predawn ruminations of his narrator at a fire in the dark. But Baker is precise where Knausgaard is vague, funny where Knausgaard is sentimental (※little one,§ he calls his daughter, and talks of ※your little foot§). And Baker hits a note-perfect tone of ingenuous curiosity, quite his own, where Knausgaard more often comes across as merely fey.It＊s not all bad. Some of these pieces work 每 most often those in which he offers a specific, oblique emotional charge rather than a pontification. The voltage always goes up where his relationship with his father comes in 每 a memory of his father killing a snake, for instance: ※he seemed to hate it more than any other thing. I had never seen him like that before, and never saw him like that again.§And we do learn a bit about Knausgaard himself. We learn that he likes Juicy Fruit chewing gum, that he struggles with head lice, plays ※Fingerman§ (in which his first two fingers walk about the place like a little man) to amuse his children, kept his dead father＊s binoculars and wellington boots, learned to drive at 39 and still drives a Volkswagen Multivan, that he once wet the bed as a teenager after winning a pineapple-eating competition, prefers tinned peas to fresh, and that  is his favourite novel. If so, you would think he could have learned from the care with which Flaubert made prose.  is published by Harvill Secker. To order a copy for ?12.74 (RRP ?16.99) go to  or call 0330 333 6846.

"The absence of Game of Thrones means the question is: will the rebel robot western  continue HBO＊s domination? It leads the pack with 22 nominations, but Netflix has three shows in contention and Hulu could scrape its first best drama win for its stunning and terrifying adaptation of Margaret Atwood＊s The Handmaid＊s Tale.But first, a look at the no-hopers: Better Call Saul proves more excellent the further it gets from Breaking Bad, but that show didn＊t win , so creator Vince Gilligan may still have to wait for another late bloomer. Meanwhile, House of Cards becomes more ludicrous and messy with each passing season 每 and if it didn＊t win the last few years, .There is some fresh blood in the category: Netflix＊s royal family saga The Crown took the , and has 13 nominations here. It was sumptuous television (and surely the only show to ever dramatise Britain＊s great smog of 1952), but it didn＊t get America watching and weeping together like This Is Us, the breakout network hit of last autumn. But it was the 80s nostalgia, the return of Winona, the welcome to Millie Bobby Brown and the terrifying underworld of Stranger Things that really got everyone talking this year 每 and is surely the favourite here. A quick glance at the history books suggests this category is Veep＊s for the taking: once Emmy voters coalesce around a comedy, they tend to stick with it 每 witness the five-in-a-row victories for Frasier and Modern Family, as well as three consecutive victories for 30 Rock. Veep meanwhile, has taken home the spiffy gold statuette for the past two years, and when you consider that Julia Louis-Dreyfus has won the lead comedy actress gong for the past five years, it＊s fairly clear that HBO＊s satire of governmental incompetence is very much an Emmy darling.Veep＊s likely dominance masks the fact that this is a hugely strong category, full of shows at the top of their game, from Mike Judge＊s brilliantly caustic revenge  the nerds, Silicon Valley, to the remarkable socially conscious sitcommery of Black-ish, and Aziz Ansari＊s delightfully digressive everything-com Master of None. (It＊s only really Modern Family, now thoroughly in decline, that is letting the team down here.) Best of all, of course, is Donald Glover＊s fever dream of a 30-minute comedy, Atlanta, the first season of which felt like the sort of once-in-a-generation work that should win everything going, but sadly won＊t. If the  go the same route as the Golden Globes, Claire Foy will walk away with this for her brilliant, aptly buttoned-up depiction of Queen Elizabeth II. Evan Rachel Wood could well be in contention, too, for her portrayal of the big-eyed prairie bot who morphs into Dolores the lawless.But if there＊s any justice, this is Elisabeth Moss＊s for the taking. She＊s an Emmys favourite 每 nominated eight times before 每 but this fully deserves to be her first win. Her depiction of Offred in Margaret Atwood＊s hellish dystopia of Gilead was haunting, agonisingly timely and made all the more impressive because Moss played much of the part in silence. Elsewhere, Viola Davis is an outside bet, while Keri Russell and Robin Wright feel like also-rans.It＊s hard to look beyond one of NBC＊s emotional hit This Is Us in this category. Sterling K Brown or Milo Ventimiglia would be worthy winners in a section which is lacking a real stand-out frontrunner. The category has a history of sticking with dark and brooding portrayals of American masculinity (Jon Hamm＊s Don Draper; Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad), which made Rami Malek＊s win last year feel like a well-deserved bit of recognition for the type of performance that doesn＊t often chime with Emmy voters.A curveball could come in the form of Anthony Hopkins for his performance as robot whisperer Dr Robert Ford in Westworld, but a more justified winner would come from the category＊s perennial no-hopers. Kevin Spacey (House of Cards), Liev Schreiber (Ray Donovan) and Matthew Rhys (The Americans) have perfected the art of showing up in a tux and being mostly ignored. Of the three, Rhys probably deserves it for his brilliant performance as a Russian agent in The Americans. It＊s long been a favourite with critics, and with its finale airing this awards cycle maybe, just maybe, Rhys will pull off a piece of award-season espionage. The smart money will be on Jeffrey Tambor for this one. He managed to wrestle away this category from Jim Parsons of The Big Bang Theory in 2014 and hasn＊t given it up since. This Emmys category doesn＊t treat auteurs very kindly, which might mean Donald Glover 每 the showrunner and star of critical favourite Atlanta 每 and Aziz Ansari might be out of luck. Louis CK was always overlooked for Louie and Ansari and Glover are very much of the same lineage, putting a focus on quality and originality with their respective shows. Glover＊s wins at the Golden Globes might give him an edge, though.Elsewhere, Anthony Anderson is the most likely of the other contenders for his perplexed patriarch in Black-ish, while Zach Galifianakis＊s clown comedy Baskets has as much chance as the Insane Clown Posse being invited to the ceremony. Likewise, William H Macy is always there to make up the numbers. This one is a three-way race, with the Emmys voters likely to stick with what they know but surely tempted to recognise two of the most inventive auteurs making television today. In which the unstoppable force of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, victor in this category for the past five years, goes up against the immovable object of Emmy voters＊ love for Hollywood royalty in the form of Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda. Could one of the Grace and Frankie duo halt the Veep VIP＊s march towards a record-breaking sixth consecutive win? It seems unlikely, given that the presence of both performers in this category is likely to split the Grace and Frankie vote.Instead, the most likely person to steal Louis-Dreyfus＊s comedy crown is probably Black-ish star Tracee Ellis Ross, who won the corresponding Golden Globe for this category in January 每 though that perhaps shouldn＊t be a harbinger, given that it＊s been nearly a decade since anyone took home both awards in the same year. Special mention should go to long-time Louis CK collaborator Pamela Adlon, one of the most underrated comedy performers around, whose work on the smart, ribald and completely heartbreaking Better Things deserves recognition. There＊s a divine irony to Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon vying for the accolade just as their Feud characters Joan Crawford and Bette Davis were at each other＊s throats over the 1963 Oscar for Baby Jane. At least they both got nominated this time. In the Big Little Lies camp, you＊ve got Reese Witherspoon＊s peppy, bitchy whirlwind of energy Madeline.

"Spiralling up a hill in the heart of Caracas is a playful, ambitious building that once embodied Venezuela＊s dreams of modernity, power and influence, and was f那ted by Salvador Dal赤 and Pablo Neruda.Today, its crumbling concrete shell houses the headquarters of Venezuela＊s intelligence services and the country＊s most notorious political prison. It has become a symbol of national decay, bankrupt dreams and faltering democracy.Slums on the surrounding slopes obscure the aging Buckminster Fuller dome that tops its elegant coils, but the building can still be seen from around the capital, and casts a long shadow of fear.El Helicoide 每 as it was named in a nod to the geometry that inspired it 每 was conceived in the early 1950s as a shopping mall that would embody Venezuela＊s wealth and confidence. Its curving lines are created by more than two miles of ramps in an interlocking helix, designed as a modern take on the high street.The design included space for 300 boutiques, and parking spaces for each. There were also plans for a hotel and galleries. But the building was never finished, and the shops never opened. Instead, areas earmarked for the sale of luxury goods were turned first into shelters for the homeless, then prison cells, police headquarters and eventually even torture chambers, described by former inmates as ※hell on earth§.Several Venezuelan governments tried to remake El Helicoide as a museum or cultural centre, but all the efforts ended in failure. Its cells have never been as crowded as they are today, after months of street protests against the government of Nicol芍s Maduro  violent. Support for his government has collapsed in the face of  and medicine, hyper-inflation and spiralling violence.The president blames foreign sabotage for the country＊s problems, even though Venezuela sits on the world＊s largest oil reserves, and he has responded to the unrest by , convening a legislative super-assembly to sideline the opposition controlled parliament, and even openly flirting with .Celeste Olalquiaga, a cultural historian who grew up in Caracas, said: ※El Helicoide is a metaphor for the whole modern period in Venezuela and what went wrong.§ She has  to document its extraordinary history and  about the mall-turned jail.The transformation from icon of Venezuela＊s hopes to emblem of failure and repression was slow and complicated. It began with a coup, stretched over decades of dictatorship and democracy, through the rule of 14 presidents and several cycles of oil boom and bust. Someone looking for bad omens might have found one in the name of the hill where it＊s built, Roca Tarpeya; the Tarpeian Rock was an execution ground in ancient Rome.But after the project was unveiled in 1955, the first years of planning and construction were ones of steady progress and optimism. El Helicoide was so internationally celebrated that it was praised by Neruda, and Dali reportedly offered to help decorate the interior. But a 1958 coup that ousted the dictator Marcos P谷rez Jim谷nez from power swept away dreams for the mall along with much else.El Helicoide was actually a private project, but P谷rez Jim谷nez had become so famous for his grandiose construction plans that most Venezuelans assumed the dizzying mall was a state effort. As the country tried to move on from his brutal rule, everything associated with the ex-president was tainted 每 and that included El Helicoide. Without funding or support, the project collapsed and the near-finished building sat empty for years.Meanwhile, Caracas was changing around it. Wealthy residents of the city moved east, and slums expanded south, until they all but engulfed El Helicoide.The concrete shell, poured but never finished, became embroiled in legal action between the developers, the government and store owners who had made downpayments to purchase their space. Eventually in 1975 it came under government control.The lead Venezuelan architect Jorge Romero Guti谷rrez had sunk so much of his once considerable fortune into it that its failure all but bankrupted him. It also damaged his reputation and destroyed his spirit, said Alberto Sato, an architect and professor based in Chile.Sato tracked down Romero 每 a personal hero of his 每 when he first came to  in the 1970s. He found a man bankrupted and broken by El Helicoide＊s failure, who had largely abandoned architecture.That was his country＊s loss, says Sato. ※He was a type of madman, incredibly visionary,§ pointing out that El Helicoide is one of the few Caracas buildings distinctive enough to identify easily from the air. ※I think that he was one of the most important architects of the 1950s in Venezuela, but his work wasn＊t treated as it deserved.§The building＊s first permanent occupants did not move in until the mid-1970s, and could hardly have been further from original visions. When landslides swept away swathes of a nearby town, the government moved five hundred newly homeless families into temporary shelters on the ramps.Conditions were extremely basic: neither electricity nor water supplies had ever been installed, and so the building offered little more than protection from the elements.But that was attraction enough though for those who had lost everything, and before long, 2,000 families 每 10,000 people 每 were crammed into the ramps, said Olalquiaga. Conditions were grim, and it soon became a centre for drug trafficking, prostitution and crime.In 1982, the families were cleared out, and Sato worked on a project to turn El Helicoide into a cultural centre. Romero wanted little to do with the building that had ruined his reputation.※He was too old, too tired, to have any real hope. I remember him saying ＆It＊s cursed, you are not going to be able to do anything there,＊ § Sato said.Romero turned out to be correct, at least as far as Sato＊s project was concerned. After a change of government in 1984 and a foreign currency crisis, El Helicoide slipped back into disuse. Worried about squatters returning, the government moved the secret police in the next year.Different iterations of the intelligence and security forces have been based in the building ever since 1985, with top floors serving as offices and the lower two as a jail. The cells are tiny and cramped, partly because of the deceptive nature of the building itself. It may look like a futuristic cruise liner, but most of its bulk comes from the hill that defines its basic form. The actual building is no more than the ramps spiralling up to the summit and back down.※When you visit El Helicoide you realise that between the rock, which takes most of the centre of the site, and the ramps, there is very little useable space,§ said Olalquiaga, who was allowed inside on a visit in 2015.※It＊s very anti-climactic, like a building equivalent of the Wizard of Oz. From outside you see a huge thing, but from inside you see that it＊s kind of small,§ she said. ※I call it a living ruin as it＊s semi-abandoned.§Even the indefatigable populist president  was defeated by El Helicoide, which he described as both ※cursed§ and ※very important§. At one point he ordered the intelligence services to leave and promised to turn the ramps into a social centre, but the officers and their prisoners never did depart and the grand project never materialised.There are no records of who was jailed in the early years. The first man known to have been held for his views was an astrologer, Jos谷 Bernardo G車mez. He was arrested the 1990s for forecasting the impending death of the country＊s then president, Rafael Caldera (who was then in his late 70s) 每 a crime that seems almost as strange as the building where he was held.※I was held prisoner at El Helicoide 21 years ago,§ said G車mez, who is still reading the stars. ※In those years the government (the president) reacted in this way because I had shared my astrological readings at a private event for businessmen.§ (On his release in 1996, El Nacional newspaper quoted G車mez defiantly clinging to his reasons for seeing mortality in the alignment of Pluto, Uranus, Mars and the comet Chiron, though Caldera lived on until 2009.)Since then, hundreds of others have followed in G車mez＊s footsteps, including both regular prisoners and those locked up for their political views. Rosmit Mantilla, an LGBT activist and opposition politician, said: ※The Helicoide is the centre of torture in Venezuela. It＊s a hell on earth.§ , he spent two and a half years imprisoned in the building.He endured psychological torment and physical abuse, but believes he was spared the most extreme torture thanks to an international campaign for his release. He decided to compile a record of what he saw and heard from fellow prisoners, and has worked to raise awareness since his own release in November last year.He describes a routine of overcrowding and malnutrition, psychological pressure and sparse rations as universal. Some endured worse treatment.※There are at least three rooms used for torture, and we couldn＊t sleep because we would hear the screams all night: people who would appear and disappear,§ he said.Prisoners include both men and women, kept on separate floors. Tortures reported to Mantilla include people being beaten, electrocuted, hung by their limbs, forced into stress positions and forced to plunge their face into a bag of faeces and breathe in. Problems of overcrowding are now far worse. After months of political unrest and street protests, there are currently thought to be more than 300 people crammed into cells that already felt crowded with 80, according to the campaign group (A Window on Freedom). El Helicoide makes an unusually high-profile prison for political detainees: a landmark building visible from across the city. But the secret police are so unambiguously proud of their unique headquarters that in 2007 they issued a series of stamps to celebrate it. The fate of El Helicoide 每 built amid dreams of prosperity, but now in a state of slow decay 每 reflects Venezuela＊s recent history. Spellbound by the promise of easy oil wealth, the country＊s leaders focused on gleaming trophies and forgot the people they ruled, most of whom are still living in desperate poverty.Olalquiaga still hopes the building can be rescued from decay and its grim new reputation, by a government more dedicated to serving its people than controlling them. ※What should happen is the one thing which has never happened, the communities that surround it should be asked what they want,§ she said. ※El Helicoide has suffered for all kinds of reasons, and it could and should be re-purposed. I don＊t think things are doomed.§																																											"

"ordan Cardy, a 21-year-old who goes by the name of , inspires the sort of fevered devotion that often seems to follow those with his initials. His fans start arriving six hours early for the launch of his debut album, Scum, gathering in the cold and damp, graffiti-covered tunnel beneath London＊s Waterloo station. One of the first to arrive is 16-year-old Saskia, who deftly explains Rat Boy＊s appeal. ※He sings about being poor quite a lot, and I find that really relatable,§ she says. ※He＊s singing about things everyone our age is feeling.§The list of topics covered on Scum includes: signing on, fake IDs, worrying about a third world war, getting sacked from Wetherspoons and ※living off mum§, Critics often compare Rat Boy to oik-rock precursors such as , the  and early Blur 每 both Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon appear on the record 每 but his fans also see more highbrow influences. ※He reminds me of Salvador Dal赤,§ says 16-year-old Luke. ※His style is always a bit weird and abstract.§Rat Boy is not merely reflecting millennial fears back to his fans; he is refracting their world through a surrealist prism. Through his hand-drawn artwork, the videos he storyboards himself and the fake radio station that plays between songs on his album, he has built a Technicolor universe, populated with garish characters and brands, that is inspired as much by Grand Theft Auto, Tarantino movies and  skateboard videos as it is by indie bands.The launch is a chance to bring this fictional world to life, so in keeping with his aesthetic it＊s being held at a skatepark. Loitering by the ramps clutching boards are a couple more fans, Lennon and Gene Gallagher, sons of Liam, bickering as only a pair of Gallagher brothers can. While they cannot agree on who started listening to Rat Boy first, they both say his style is as important as his music. ※That＊s what got me into him,§ says 16-year-old Gene. ※I didn＊t used to skate until I watched him, now I do. I thought: ＆If I want to wear the clothes, I＊ve got to skate.＊§Rat Boy himself rolls into view doing skateboard tricks. He has the word ※Love§ freshly tattooed across his throat and is dressed head-to-toe in his own branded clothing, from his Scum socks to his baggy red Scum hoodie. Like everything else in Rat Boy＊s world, he designed them himself. He traces his reluctance to relinquish creative control to his childhood growing up in Chelmsford, Essex, in a home where his mum hand-painted patterns on the floorboards while his dad transformed the hunks of metal in the garden into custom cars.※Our house looks mental, my dad＊s got 30 years＊ worth of clutter,§ he explains. ※He collects bits and pieces and then builds race cars. Maybe it＊s because it＊s cheaper, but it＊s also because he likes making stuff, and I do too.§He first managed to get his hands on a guitar the summer after he finished primary school, and a couple of years later, aged 13, he caught the ear of Tom Pullen, a music-production teacher at Chelmer Valley High. ※Jordan was the sort of kid who＊d get in trouble at school because he＊d take his acoustic guitar everywhere,§ remembers Pullen. ※He was on my radar straight away. I wanted to help him out because a lot of the time the kids who are grade-eight piano get all the attention, while people like him get left behind.§Rat Boy had no problem filling sketchbooks with snatches of lyrics or doodles but struggled with exams. It wasn＊t until he was 17 that he was diagnosed with severe dyslexia. ※I was quite nervous in school about writing, but now I treat it as a good thing,§ he says. ※I can＊t sit down and write a song, but I write when I＊m out, and I think that＊s why my lyrics focus on the subjects they do.§As well as the usual teenage hijinks, those subjects include a string of references to Brexit, Theresa May＊s rise to power and entrenched social inequality. ※I get inspired by what I＊m angry about,§ he says. ※You look around and see people with so much money, and people with absolutely nothing. How does that happen?§Musically, he says he is ※obsessed§ with the production-focused hip-hop of  and Kanye West, and Lamar returned the compliment by sampling the 2015 Rat Boy track Knock Knock on his song Lust. Rat Boy, who had previously worked with that track＊s producer DJ Dahi, heard it for the first time when Lamar＊s record was released. ※I don＊t really know much about it, all I heard was that Kendrick got played my demo and then they cut the vocal out of it,§ he says. ※It was fucking weird, because it was [Lamar＊s debut album]  that inspired me to try and tell a story through my record.§The doors of the launch party swing open and Rat Boy is swarmed by members of his growing cult. They grab him for selfies in front of a wall covered with pages torn from his sketchbooks, each filled with lyrics or the gnarled faces and customised cars that appear in his videos; more ideas than could ever be captured by an album alone.※It＊s cool not to just have a band any more,§ he says. ※That＊s kind of boring.§																																											"
"o one could accuse the London Symphony Orchestra of underplaying the appointment of its new music director. Ever since it was confirmed in 2015, after months of rumours, that  would be returning to his native shore after 15 years as artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic (where he still has one more season in charge), the LSO and the Barbican Centre, where the orchestra has its London home, have been laying plans for his arrival in what increasingly seemed likely to be less of a straightforward inaugural concert than the musical equivalent of a coronation. So we have This Is Rattle, a 10-day festival that includes talks, exhibitions and specially commissioned art works as well as a series of concerts, launched with a full orchestral concert that was also relayed on a big screen in the Barbican＊s sculpture court outside.As far as the orchestra is concerned, the arrival of a new music director is certainly timely. Whether or not the new concert hall that is being planned as a long-term part of the Rattle package is ever likely to be built, the orchestra itself has been badly in need of someone to take hands-on charge of it for some years now.Rattle＊s predecessor, , who stepped down as chief conductor at the end of 2015, seemed to take a rather laissez-faire attitude to orchestral training and the sound it produced. In the handful of concerts that Rattle has conducted as a guest since his appointment was announced, there was already a huge improvement in many aspects of the LSO＊s sound, a transparency and refinement which obviously were there already but waiting for the right conductor.Though Rattle is also conducting both Berlioz＊s The Damnation of Faust and Stravinsky＊s three great Russian ballets at the Barbican next week, there＊s a particular emphasis on British music in this celebration. Four leading British composers, , ,  and , have each been invited to curate a programme including their own music alongside other works they admire. Rattle also included a piece by each of them in this opening LSO programme, before ending with  Enigma Variations.Only one work was brand new: Grime＊s Fanfare, which was not the brassy ceremonial piece the title might suggest but a fizzy little showpiece for all sections of the orchestra, which turns out to be part of a much bigger LSO commission that Rattle and the orchestra will premiere next spring. Two of the others were pieces that Rattle has known for a long time 每 he toured Knussen＊s Third Symphony with the CBSO in the early 1980s and gave the first performance of Ad豕s＊ Asyla in Birmingham 20 years ago. Both are precocious works that wear wonderfully well: there＊s the profundity of Knussen＊s busy, compact score with its moments of stillness that seem to conjure up vast harmonic spaces, and the astonishing confidence and surety of Ad豕s＊s teeming, sometimes jaw-droppingly virtuosic instrumental writing.If all three pieces do seem to map out a great deal of common ground in contemporary British music, then Birtwistle＊s Violin Concerto, which was phenomenally well-played by Christian Tetzlaff, for whom it was written seven years ago, very much inhabits its own musical world, just as, in a very different sense, the Enigma Variations must have appeared to stand apart in British music at the end of the 19th century. Utterly different pieces but both superbly played by the LSO here, with everything placed so precisely by Rattle, even if occasional phrases in the Elgar seemed just a shade too manicured and self-consciously shaped. As a whole, though, the concert was hugely impressive; the start of this new era for the LSO could hardly have been more auspicious.																																											"
"Sir Peter Hall, the former director of the National Theatre and founder of the , has died aged 86, the theatre said.He died on Monday at University College hospital in London, with his family at his bedside.During a career that spanned more than half a century he staged the English-language premiere of Samuel Beckett＊s Waiting for Godot and the world premiere of Harold Pinter＊s Homecoming.In a statement, the  said it was deeply saddened to announce the death of ※one of the great names in British theatre§.※Peter Hall was an internationally celebrated stage director and theatre impresario, whose influence on the artistic life of Britain in the 20th century was unparalleled,§ it said. He founded the RSC in 1960, aged 29, leading it until 1968.※The RSC realised his pioneering vision of a resident ensemble of actors, directors and designers producing both classic and modern texts with a clear house style in both Stratford and London,§ the National  said.After being appointed director of the National Theatre in 1973, Hall was responsible for the move from the Old Vic to the purpose-built complex on the South Bank.※He successfully established the company in its new home in spite of union unrest and widespread scepticism,§ the theatre added. After leaving the NT in 1988, he formed the , and in 2003 became the founding director of the Rose Theatre Kingston. Hall was diagnosed with dementia in 2011.Former directors of the NT were among the first to pay tribute. Sir Nicholas Hytner, its director from 2003 to 2015, said: ※Without him there would have been no Royal Shakespeare Company, the National Theatre＊s move to the South Bank might have ended in ignominious failure, and the whole idea of the theatre as a public service dedicated both to high seriousness and popularity would not have seized the public imagination. He was a man of great warmth, and mischievous wit.§Sir Trevor Nunn, who was NT director from 1997 to 2003, said: ※In originating the RSC, he created an ensemble which led the world in Shakespeare production, but which triumphed to the same extent in presenting new plays of every kind. Not only a thrilling and penetrating director, he was also the great impresario of the age.※He alone had the showmanship and energy to establish the three-ring circus of our unique National Theatre on the South Bank.  is a legend, whose legacy will benefit many generations to come. And yes, he was my beloved friend for 50 years.§Sir Richard Eyre, NT director from 1988 to 1997, called Hall the ※godfather§ of British theatre. ※Peter created the template of the modern director 每 part-magus, part-impresario, part-politician, part celebrity,§ he said. ※Like countless directors, writers and actors of several generations I have much to be grateful to him for.§Rufus Norris, the current NT director, said: ※We all stand on the shoulders of giants and Peter Hall＊s shoulders supported the entirety of British theatre as we know it. All of us, including those in the new generation of theatre-makers not immediately touched by his influence, are in his debt. His legendary tenacity and vision created an extraordinary and lasting legacy for us all.§Hall＊s prolific work as theatre director included the world premiere of John Barton＊s nine-hour epic Tantalus in 2000 and the London and Broadway premieres of Alan Ayckbourn＊s Bedroom Farce in 1977.Other landmark productions included Hamlet (1965) with David Warner, Antony and Cleopatra (1987) with Judi Dench and Anthony Hopkins, The Merchant of Venice (1989) with Dustin Hoffman, As You Like It (2003) with his daughter , and A Midsummer Night＊s Dream (2010) with Judi Dench. His last production at the National Theatre was Twelfth Night in 2011.He was also an internationally renowned opera director, and was artistic director of Glyndebourne from 1984 to 1990, directing more than 20 productions. He worked at many of the world＊s leading houses, including the Royal Opera, the Metropolitan Opera and Bayreuth where, in 1983, he staged Wagner＊s Ring Cycle to mark the 100th anniversary of the composer＊s death.He is survived by his wife, Nicki, and children Christopher, Jennifer, Edward, Lucy, Rebecca and Emma, and nine grandchildren. His former wives, Leslie Caron, Jacqueline Taylor and Maria Ewing, also survive him. There will be a private family funeral and details of a memorial service will be announced at a later date.The actor Toby Stephens : ※So sad to hear of the death of Sir Peter Hall. He gave me my first break as an actor. A great director and shaper of British theatre.§Other actors tweeted their gratitude to and respect for Hall. Patrick Stewart wrote: ※He transformed classical and modern UK theatre and gave me a career.§Laurence Fox tweeted a picture of himself with Hall, Hall＊s daughter Rebecca and Brenda Blethyn. The executive chairman of Glyndebourne, Gus Christie, hailed Hall＊s productions as ※timeless§. The playwright Sir David Hare said: ※Every living playwright owes him a debt.§ 																																											"

"※No Trump! No KKK! No Fascist USA!§When Green Day chanted the repurposed lyrics from Texan punk trailblazers MDC＊s 1981 song Born to Die , it gave the burgeoning anti-Trump, anti-fascist movement the slogan it needed 每 and it would soon appear on placards, T-shirts and be chanted by protesters in their thousands in months to come. It was a tiny piece of punk history writ large on American cultural life 每 but it only gave the merest hint of US hardcore punk＊s influence on the current political landscape. As political commentators struggle to nail down the exact nature of ＊s masked legions, they＊ve overlooked one thing: Antifa has been critically influenced by hardcore punk for nearly four decades.From the collectivist principles of anarchist punk bands such as Crass and Conflict, the political outrage of groups such as the Dead Kennedys, MDC and Discharge, Antifa draws on decades of protest, self-protection and informal networks under the auspices of a musical movement. Mark Bray, author of , says that ※in many cases, the North American modern Antifa movement grew up as a way to defend the punk scene from the neo-Nazi skinhead movement, and the founders of the original Anti-Racist Action network in North America were anti-racist skinheads. The fascist/anti-fascist struggle was essentially a fight for control of the punk scene [during the 1980s], and that was true across of much of north America and in parts of Europe in this era.§ ※There＊s a huge overlap between radical left politics and the punk scene, and there＊s a stereotype about dirty anarchists and punks, which is an oversimplification but grounded in a certain amount of truth.§Drawing influence from anti-fascist groups in 1930s Germany, the UK-based Anti-Fascist Action formed in the late 70s in reaction the growing popularity of rightwing political parties such as the National Front and the British Movement. They would shut down extreme-right meetings at every opportunity, whether it be a march or a gathering in a room above a pub. Inspired by this, anti-racist skinheads in Minneapolis formed Anti-Racist Action, which soon gained traction in punk scenes across the US. Meanwhile, in New York, a movement called  sprung up.The term ※Antifa§ was adopted by German antifascists in the 80s, accompanied by the twin-flag logo, which then spread around Europe, and finally pitched up in the US after being adopted by an anarchist collective in Portland, Oregon. For Thomas Barnett, singer with popular hardcore punk band , his punk ethics and the direct-action philosophy of Antifa go hand in hand, and, with Trump＊s presidency emboldening the extreme right, the stakes couldn＊t be higher: ※This isn＊t just a raft of right-wing ideas 每 this is actual hate and violence, and the destruction of entire sections of humanity. Of course, I don＊t believe in the false equivalence [between Antifa and the alt-right]. I think anti-fascists＊ pre-emptive street violence against Nazis is righteous and important.§Many adopt direct-action tactics, whether it be the recent Antifa protests across the US, the black-block tactics employed during the WTO and G7 protests around the world, or even the decision made by  to leave California to join the YPG, the far-left Kurdish guerrilla group battling Isis. ※Punk itself wasn＊t a direct influence on my joining a guerrilla group, of course, but punk did help to cement my radical politics. Being in a community with a certain degree of consciousness and solidarity between people helped immensely in that regard,§ says Belden.Bands, record labels, zine writers and venues around the world have co-operated to create a network that exists entirely outside of the mainstream, providing an off-grid template for Antifa activists to draw from. In America, there is , a young band with heavy Antifa leanings from the Trump heartland of West Virginia. In Oakland, Antifa-related punk/oi! band  have taken part in benefit shows for protesters involved in the events at Charlottesville. In Texas, Antifa are  for victims of the Houston floods. ※There＊s definitely an overlap between the leaderless politics and the DIY ethos and the notion that ＆if there＊s a problem in our punk scene, we＊re not going to be able to count on the mainstream to necessarily give a shit,＊§ explains Bray.Strike Anywhere singer Barnett says: ※It＊s also about community self-defence. The punk experience is like the flow of water. You can put up dams, you can run it underground 每 it will still get through. It also carries on the folk tradition that was speaking truth to power before there was even electric power.§ If there was ever a person unafraid to speak truth to power, it would be Jello Biafra, former singer of the Dead Kennedys and the man responsible for their 1981 call-to-arms . So it might come as a surprise that he is withering in his criticism of Antifa＊s actions in recent months.※I＊m not down with confronting [the extreme right＊s] provocations of violence with actual violence. I mean, self-defence is one thing, but going to a Trumpist rally with the express purpose of beating up fascists 每 what does that accomplish? Who＊s the fascist now? It plays right into their hands,§ he says.※More than ever, we have to keep our heads right now. And I am all about freedom of speech, but I think protesting these people non-violently is the way to go, because it lets the targets of the fascist speakers know they＊re not alone and lets the fascists who show up know that there＊s an awful lot of people who are not down with them, and a chorus of raised middle fingers is better than showing up with some kind of a weapon. Escalating the violence is not the way to go.§With his current band, the Guantanamo School of Medicine, he has updated his 1981 song and called it , but it comes with a caveat: Trump is the target, not his supporters. ※I usually talk about the song on stage for a while before we play it, pointing out that almost everybody in the audience, especially if we＊re playing in Texas or Southern California, know people in their family, close friends, at school or work, whatever, who think that Trump is really cool. And I point out that the last thing we should do is to dismiss these people as rednecks or stupid or ＆I＊m not going being your friend anymore, fuck you＊ 每 that＊s not going to persuade anybody of anything and it helps Trump divide the country. My point is that you don＊t do that, you sit down and talk to somebody, not blog in an echo chamber. It might be stomach-churning, but you might plant a seed, and if someone wakes up three weeks, three months, three years later and thinks, ＆Wow, that person that called me on my bigotry was right.＊ All this racist, anti-immigrant fascism isn＊t getting us anywhere. I don＊t want any part of it anymore.§Author and punk historian Jon Savage, a champion of the Dead Kennedys during his stint as a music journalist in the 70s, isn＊t so sure: ※It＊s very idealistic and very laudable, but it＊s like arguing with Brexiters over here (in the UK). You＊re not going to get any change out of that. There is a proportion of people who can discuss things in a rational way, but here you＊re talking about core beliefs and wishes and feelings, and these are irrational, and they are even less rational when they are tested against reality.§  For Savage, Antifa＊s direct action tactics are as legitimate a tool as Biafra＊s more measured approach: ※If you don＊t protest the way things are, then nothing is going to change. You＊re reacting to fascism and entropy. You need a variety of approaches, and in politics I wouldn＊t discount any approach. It＊s probably useful to have sensible people because they can say, ＆Well, look what happens when you don＊t listen to me and see what the nutters are going to do.＊For Barnett, even the current terminology is under debate. ※Calling it ＆Antifa＊ is like calling it this weird exotic cult, instead of calling it ＆everyday life＊. Every aspect of media coverage of it is insidious, turning public opinion against us, making us a violent spectacle that＊s both something terrible and un-American, when this is the fucking Boston Tea Party,§ he says. ※If people want to talk about how the heritage of American culture and our patriotic destiny fits in [to anti-fascism] 每 it＊s basic math to me, and to many, many others.§Biafra and Strike Anywhere＊s Thomas Barnett at least find some accord on the rebranding of the right, however. ※You know what they called the alt-right two years ago? Neo-fucking-Nazis!§ says Biafra. ※Now it＊s alt-right, like alt-country or alternative pop music.§ Barnett concurs: ※They don＊t get to be alt-right. They just get to be digital-age Nazis, or white supremacists or terrorists. And that＊s what [the media] are doing to anti-fascist action.§Regardless, Barnett says the antifascist movement isn＊t taking anything for granted. ※These rallies, whatever the next one is, whatever form it takes, are Trojan-horse events to invite and welcome white terrorist groups, and are just platforms for them to go into communities to hurt and intimidate people. And that＊s what anti-fascist action has always known, and that＊s what the punks have always known.§Or, in the bald terms of someone who put his teenage years in a punk band called  behind him to go and fight in an actual war, former YPG militia member Belden says: ※When I was younger my friends and I used to beat the shit out Nazis that would roll out to punk shows [in California]. And guess what? They＊d leave and never come back. Violence works.§																																											"
"ight, where were we then, in  (ITV)? Adam and Tina the landlady, that＊s right. They finally got it together, at the end of the last series (the first of Cold Feet 2.0, AKA Old Feet).And now, at the start of the new one, they＊re having a baby, already. Oh, it＊s a dream sequence. But it appears to mean that Adam is getting broody. At his age, he＊s morphing into Mick bloody Jagger. And Spanish Ramona, who showed up again at the end last time out, is still around. Ramona remains. Ironic, really, that her name has come to be a (kinda) homophone for someone who＊s unhappy about the result of last year＊s referendum, and she might end up having to go back to the EU herself. For now, though, she＊s answering the phone for Karen at her publisher. Answering it very badly 每 you＊d think her English would have improved after all this time. She＊s basically the female . Jen＊s jealous of Karen＊s friendship with Tina, because no one ever really grows up, the playground just continues throughout life. Pete＊s black dog isn＊t around, at least for now. He＊s swapped the taxiing for chauffeuring, and gets David an introduction to the Cheshire set. Wags and the like 每 they look like they might be fun. There are some good touches; I like the children interviewing Adam for a job at a hipster startup that matches consumers with designers. There are some less good ones 每 like Adam and Tina＊s I love u... nicorns mix-up. And there are some old ones (sometimes the best ones), like the car going through a big puddle (it＊s Manchester, don＊t forget), soaking Adam in his smart suit. Best location: an empty Victorian swimming pool, venue for the launch of the first book Karen is publishing. Best tune: . Again, it＊s like a university reunion. Last year was the first; you hadn＊t seen them for years, and though you＊d had your reservations about it, it was surprisingly fun, reminding you why you liked these people in the first place. Now, just one year on, they＊re doing it all over again. And you＊re wondering whether it＊s such a good idea. I mean, you still like them, but perhaps you have less in common now.																																											"
"Since the age of nine, Simbi Ajikawo had been recording raps in her school classrooms and performing at her youth centre. She idolised Lauryn Hill and Missy Elliott, the hip-hop icons of her youth. As she got older she tried everything to get noticed, appearing on E4 show Youngers and releasing a string of impressive freestyles. Her idols started to take notice.  took her on tour with her. Kendrick Lamar had called her ※the illest doing it right now§. Throughout, Ajikawo, who＊d come to be known as Little Simz, always hated being a ※female rapper§. She wrote the song  每 with the line ※Women can be kings§ 每 about how her gender would never affect her desire to dominate her field.A few years ago we had a long, messy conversation in a burger bar and she bristled at the mere mention of the word ※female§. ※Why does it always have to be about my gender?§ she asked. ※Why can＊t I just do what I want to do freely without feeling like people are trying to put me in a box all the time? Do you know how annoying that is? When you feel like you＊re doing something greater than life, but you＊re always just a female rapper?§ Last year she released Stillness in Wonderland, a record of intricacies and world-building that wrestled with issues of race, toxic relationships, anxiety and introversion; it was as ambitious as you could ever hope a rap album could be. It seemed certain that Simz would be the next UK success story.But she was not. The album didn＊t even chart within the top 100. There were no Mercury or Brit nominations. Apart from her hardcore fanbase, the record was greeted with little more than a shrug.No one is guaranteed a free pass to success, of course, and there are plenty of reasons why an album might not land with the public. But what rankled about mainstream indifference towards Simz was that it came at a time when rap music in the UK had never been more popular. Grime and UK rap has been on a near unstoppable rise. From  to , an artist who previously had all his shows cancelled by the police, bringing Drake out on to the main stage at Reading, barely a month goes past without another groundbreaking moment.The success of homegrown rap has happened in tandem with a renewed fervour for international artists: Kendrick Lamar, Dr Dre and Drake have all had No 1 albums and the likes of  and J Cole have headlined major UK festivals. Those artists are all men, but it has also been an incredible period for female MCs. Much of the most intricate and fully realised music in this new wave is by artists such as , an Afrofuturist art rapper from the Bronx who assumes multiple identities and has a radio show where she deals with race and womanhood in between Placebo records. Or Lady Leshurr, whose sick pop culture-infused humour and ongoing discourse with the listener is reminiscent of early Eminem. There are so many more to speak of: ,, . All women who, like Simz, would probably hate to be grouped together, in this way, based purely on their gender (Little Simz declined to be interviewed for this piece).Yet it＊s worth talking about women MCs, because the commercial gap between male and female artists is a chasm. In the same way that rising gender equality in the workplace overall doesn＊t negate the fact that fewer than 5% of Britain＊s top companies have a female CEO, or that so few of the BBC＊s top earners are women, so it＊s true that while there a huge number of female MCs out there, almost none are breaking through to the top tier of the music industry. Apart from , who is undoubtedly a global superstar and the exception to the rule (although even her last album only charted at 22 in the UK) it＊s been a long time since a female MC broke the Top 10 or played near the head of the bill at a UK festival.For Little Simz, the muted reaction to Stillness left her faced with a question she had always tried to avoid: would things have been different if she were a man? ※She did everything perfectly,§ says Caroline SM, the founder of the UK rap collective  and an A&R at XL Recordings. ※I think she was just ahead of her time. Four years ago, grime, rap, whatever it is, was not getting a look-in at all 每 men or women. It＊s taken so long even to get to this point. Our scene is so slow.§It＊s true that many of the British men who are currently on top, artists such as Giggs and Skepta, have been releasing music for well over a decade. But even among relatively new artists like Stormzy, J Hus, Nines and Section Boyz, it seems as if the path to success has been fairly straightforward.Lady Leshurr has asked similar questions about her own career and says that one of the reasons male artists do better is that they look out for each other. ※In grime, there＊s a circle of people that all support each other and, guess what, they＊re all male: Stormzy, , . They＊re people that will always support another person＊s music. When you look at the females, there＊s not really that collective of people who will show love. If more female rappers in the UK were more supportive of each other it would be completely different.§She says the picture is further complicated by race. ※In my opinion [the issues are about] gender but it＊s also the colour of your skin. It can be harder if you＊re a dark-skinned girl trying to make it in this industry because it＊s always been hard.§Leshurr has found that while in some ways the situation for women has improved, the double-standard about physical appearance, and skin colour in particular, has gotten worse. ※For men it doesn＊t really matter what you look like. Ed Sheeran, for example; I＊m not saying he＊s ugly, but you＊d never think he＊d be the biggest pop star in the world. Whereas for women, it＊s still based on image, and men will always think about what the female looks like before they hear what she＊s gonna say. It＊s always going to be ＆She＊s ugly＊ or ＆Look at her hair＊. Whereas guys can just put a hoodie and a snapback on and record something and everyone will be like ＆Yeah they＊re sick＊.§Both Leshurr and Caroline SM believe that these problems are particular to the scene in the UK at the moment, and that the recent success of male artists will eventually open the door for female MCs too. But discrepancy in fortunes between men and women stretches back a lot further than that. , probably Britain＊s most famous female MC, managed to combine critical acclaim with chart success on her debut record , which went on to win the Mercury prize in 2002. She was unable to turn that initial success into a sustained career as an album artist 每 her second record didn＊t chart in the top 40 and eventually she went back to her first calling: singing verses on club tracks. Seven years later another female MC, , won the Mercury prize, but she was even less able to build a career from the exposure. She＊s now working behind the scenes, as a music relations manager for Arts Council England.※Somebody needs to change the formula. The way people approach music,§ says Angel Haze, an artist from Detroit. A few years ago, Haze was the belle of the music press: an incredible MCing talent with a horrendous story, overcoming sexual abuse and life in a religious cult. She was interviewed by everyone, reliving her awful childhood experiences over and over again. Then she released her debut album, , which charted at 196 in the UK.※You don＊t get the recognition based on what your music sounds like, it＊s all about the hype around you, who said what about you. But it＊s this reality TV generation, everyone has a 30-second attention span and on to the new shit, and only the craziest of people survive.§ What＊s strange is that it＊s a cycle that no one can seem to get out of, artists and press playing their dutiful roles, unable to stop history repeating itself. Just last year,  had a Billboard Top 20 hit with her track . The record, a brilliantly blue ode to cunnilingus, was one of the most open celebrations of same-sex relationships in mainstream hip-hop. Talking to the Fader in August last year, she said that the song＊s success motivated her to do more. ※Let＊s keep it moving now. Let＊s keep giving ＊em this fire and let＊s not stop this,§ she said. But one year on, she has released an EP to little fanfare. It charted at No 166 in the US and another hit has not emerged.It would perhaps look foolish now to suggest that this could all be about to change, considering how often that prediction has been made in the past and been proven to be wrong. Yet everyone I speak to seems to believe the first superstar female MC of the 2010s is just around the corner. There＊s  and combines R&B singing with MCing. , who found fame on the American reality show , but whose brazen personality and track Bodak Yellow have meant that, unlike every other person on that show, she is now being taken seriously as a star.※I feel like there was a glass ceiling before, but this new generation of people coming out are changing things,§ says BLK. ※We can more easily connect with our fanbase 每 things are spreading a lot further because of that.§ Among this new wave, though, there is one name that everyone is saying is going to be the person to finally shatter the ceiling: Stefflon Don. ※We haven＊t seen someone like her before. Not in my lifetime. Not in the UK,§ says Caroline SM. ※We really haven＊t seen someone like that. She＊s a gangster. Boys are scared of her and she＊s sexy. She came through on the  remix, she rolls with rappers. She＊s one of a kind.§Don＊s X-rated, Jamaican-influenced flow owes more to dancehall stars such as Spice and Cham, but she combines that with hard-hitting Atlanta-style production and British slang that gives her a global appeal. It is telling that when I talk to Don, she sees industry sexism as something of a relic. ※I remember watching interviews with female artists on MTV and they would always say, ＆It＊s harder for us,＊ or, ＆We don＊t get as much opportunity as men.＊ I believe that. I don＊t think female artists would come out and keep saying it if wasn＊t true. But I haven＊t really experienced it, not yet anyway.§ Judging by her initial success, it＊s not surprising Don hasn＊t experienced the same pressures as other MCs. She＊s been working with , and has just signed a huge record deal with Polydor for a reported ?1.2m. Whether this new generation will be the stars of 2018, or just follow an established rise and fall, can＊t really be predicted.For Haze, though, the ability to use  to reach fans should just be seen as a way to get to the top faster. She says there needs to be a rethink of who the winners and the losers are in this story. Yes, she concedes, women have a harder time in music than men, but that doesn＊t necessarily mean they suffer worse outcomes. ※I live in a house in the middle of the woods and I make music 24/7. It＊s like hibernating for a good cause and when I do resurface it＊s going to be at a different level. I＊m so much happier than if I was releasing something new every six months.§ 																																											"
"The woman in the picture is my grandmother, Sofia. You may wonder what is so special about a woman standing in the rain in front of ? Well, the fact that in 1977, when the picture was taken, my grandparents lived in the Socialist Republic of Romania. It was almost impossible to travel to the ※decadent＊ west. Luckily, my well-connected grandfather was able to pull some strings. They were granted permission to join a bus tour of northern Italy. They weren＊t allowed to take my father (who was 17 at the time) with them. The authorities feared that they might?defect, so one important family member had to be left behind.My grandparents were not allowed a?lot of foreign currency, either. Not even enough to satisfy little whims. For instance, a few days before this picture was taken, my grandparents had been in Venice and it was very hot. After much hesitation, my grandfather bought himself an ice-cream cone 每 and it was the best he had ever had! Unfortunately, after only a few bites, he dropped it on to the pavement in a?moment of inattention. My grandmother told me, many years later, what a long look he threw the splayed ice-cream, as if considering whether to scoop it up again. He didn＊t 每 but nor did he buy another one. This story always broke my heart.In 2003, my father and I visited my grandmother in Constan?a. We talked of travelling to Italy that year. She remembered her own extraordinary trip and told us how, of all the cities she?saw, Florence had been her favourite. Florence. Yes. We would go to Florence. Except we didn＊t. My grandmother died a few weeks after our conversation; my parents cancelled all our holiday plans.We didn＊t travel to Tuscany until 2011. It was the last holiday I ever went?on with my parents 每 but I could not know then about the heart attack that would brutally tear my father from life not long after. However, at the time, we were terribly happy to walk the same streets and piazzas my grandparents had walked 34 years before, as unlikely as it seemed. We fell in love with bits and pieces of Florence: the Uffizi, the Piazza della Signoria, Ponte Vecchio, but, most of all, with Santa Maria del Fiore. I remembered my grandmother saying it, as if it were the name of a long-lost love: ※.§Whenever I hear the song La Bamba by Trini L車pez it takes me back to a hot summer night in Cape Town in the 1960s. It must have been the middle of summer, as it was late, but still light and very hot. The heat and sun were still radiating through my sun-filter curtains, which were patterned with black and white poodles. Poodles were very popular at that time. I was about three and could not sleep. I wondered down the hallway to the lounge where?my parents were having a party with our neighbours. There was no television and none of them were well off, so they took turns going to each other＊s homes.They would dance to music on the reel-to-reel tape recorder, hold Tupperware parties, or play cards with beans for betting using an old sheet with ballpoint pen drawings to make it?into a card table. Food included sausages with cheese or cheese with pickled onions on toothpicks, stuffed eggs and peanuts.I recall the slight sense of trepidation I felt, as I was not supposed to be up. However, when I?reached the lounge, my father swept me up in his arms, and, singing in time to the music, danced with me to La Bamba. I recall feeling safe and happy. Everyone was dancing and singing to the music.My father died quite young, but this memory, my sense of feeling loved and a love of dancing, that I think started then, have always stayed with me. As a?psychologist, I know how special it is to have had a relationship like this with a parent and this song reminds me of the love, the warmth and the fun-loving qualities of my father.I was born in 1948 in Leicester, and my father was a bank clerk. He came home on the bus for dinner (it wasn＊t called lunch) at 12.50pm, left at 1.30pm, then reappeared at 6.50pm. At dinner, the table was laid with a seersucker cloth, and there were two courses. Dad would only ever eat one sprout, but he especially liked steamed puddings with Bird＊s custard.At about 6pm we had high tea 每 tinned spaghetti or poached egg or baked beans on toast made under the grill. There was one tea that could only?happen when the fire was lit at weekends in the winter. It was a treat?called hot buttered toast, and if it?had been written down it would definitely have had capital letters for every word.Dad was in charge of the fire; he held a newspaper tight over the fireplace with his arms outstretched to get it to take, then he stoked the fire until there?was a bed of red coals. The sparks?crawling over the back of the fireplace were children running home from school.A large battered saucepan was half-filled with boiling water, a chipped Pyrex dish sat on top with a lid, and it was placed ready on the hearth. We knelt in front of the fire as if we were worshipping, jostling for position with slabs of white bread poked on to a?toasting fork, and held them to the heat. They ended up as patchy golden pieces of toast 每 when they weren＊t fatally burned or dropped into the fire. It was a serious business. My mother buttered the pieces and slipped them under the lid, until there was a heap of crisp, soggy deliciousness steaming up the glass.My mother brought in a jug with sticks of celery in water, and a piece of?cheap cheddar that she had wrapped in a cloth soaked in vinegar in the larder for a few days to strengthen the?flavour. The trick was to take the piece of toast from the bottom of the pile, nearest to the hot water. A sliver of cheese fitted into the groove of the celery, and the toast disappeared rapidly from the bowl, only to be replaced with more. The last pieces were spread with Robertson＊s jam, Marmite or Bovril.Having brought up two children on a low income, I can only admire my mother＊s ability to make such a feast out of very little. I can still smell the buttery toast, and taste its crunch and its squishy centre. It still feels like the biggest treat there could be.																																											"
"y pre-school son and I?were snuggled up, reading, when it happened for the third time. I?had mentioned that our new book was written by the same author as one of his old favourites. The author was a woman and my son frowned: ※But that＊s not usual, is it?§ he asked. ※I mean, for a woman to write books?§I was disconcerted. I had been prepared for all sorts of strange new opinions when he started reception,but this was the third time he had come out with sexist guff. How had he absorbed these sorts of ideas in his cosseted, pre-school world?More to the point, girls now outperform boys in school and further education. If my son was going to start his school life with a tendency to underestimate girls, might that extend to him putting down their willingness to work hard? Might he also learn to despise the abilities traditionally considered to be feminine, such as cooperation, empathy and diligence, which are increasingly valued in the?modern-day workplace 每 and which feature heavily in those jobs thought to?be safest from the advance of automation?Before having children, I assumed it was daughters, rather than sons, who required help to avoid the elephant traps of gender-based partiality and prejudice that the world would strew in their path. It wasn＊t until I?had first a?boy and then a girl, that I?realised reality is more complex. I still twitch with horror at the proliferation of girls dressed permanently in billowing pink princess dresses 每 my daughter almost exclusively wears her brother＊s castoffs 每 but the truth is that despite their crinolines and sparkly tiaras, these princess-wannabes rampage over bouncy castles and hurtle down the steepest slides in the playgrounds just as enthusiastically as their male peers.As a friend of mine said recently, gazing out over a back garden strewn with saccharine playthings. ※I＊ve given up the fight against pink. I＊ve decided it doesn＊t matter: my daughters are still going to be lawyers and doctors, they＊re just going to collect their degrees wearing pink dresses.§Boys, though, are another story. The gap in attainment between boys and girls in the UK is stark and starts young. At key stage 2, the gap is six percentage points. For GCSEs, the gap for five A*-C grades, including English and maths, is  in England, and more than seven in the other three home nations.The impact of this underachievement by boys is direct. Annually,  fewer young men than young women become apprentices and  fewer go to university 每 460,000 fewer over the past decade 每 an underachievement that has been called a . More  than women are not in education, employment or training. Fewer men are entering nearly all of the professions, and between the ages of 22 and 29, , in both full-time and part-time roles.There are, of course, a multitude of ways in which parents can try to prevent their sons sliding into this slipstream. But all too soon, our influence is first diluted, then trumped by our children＊s peers. Nevertheless, I＊m a strong believer in the power of books to nuzzle deep into children＊s heads in a way that parents and peers cannot, providing the blueprint for what is right and wrong, what is beautiful and ugly, what is attainable and what is out of bounds. Books bestow a neutral and absolute authority as to the way life is, can be and should be lived.I have bought books to prepare my son for everything significant he has ever experienced, from his first visit to the dentist to the arrival of his baby sister. I bought creepy-monster books to satisfy his craving to be scared 每 and nice-monster books when that plan proved a bit too successful. I＊ve bought culturally diverse books to go some way to ameliorating the predominantly white circles he moves in.So I had already tried 每 and failed 每 to find age-appropriate, literary ripostes to the first of his earlier two sexist pronouncements: ※Queens aren＊t powerful,§ he announced, when we were reading about the Tudors. ※They just look out of windows.§ Annoyingly, according to the fictional world of literature for the very young, I found this is true: at their best, queens despair over their messy princesses but, mostly, they play a silent and usually fretful, second fiddle to the king.My son＊s second declaration, however, totally blindsided me. When reading a book that featured a girl winning a running race, he protested that it wasn＊t true. ※Girls can＊t run fast,§ he insisted. Coming as it did just after a sports day at his nursery in which he had been beaten by virtually every girl in his class 每 and from a child whose mother is more physically boisterous than his father 每 this was quite an exercise in prejudice trumping reality.I determined to stock up on books that would counter his ※alternative facts§: books that showed cool-yet-ambitious boys who worked hard to achieve their dream 每 whether that be dragon-catching, alien-befriending or pirate-thwarting 每 alongside strong, courageous, funny, clever peers who just happened to be girls.This proved harder than I?expected. According to a study co-authored by Professor Janice McCabe, from Florida State University, . While of , 53 featured female characters who didn＊t even speak. It is not limited to books: across children＊s media, only  compared with 80.5% of male characters.Nevertheless, with a bit of effort, I?found a rich seam of fantastic books featuring girl protagonists who were courageous and scrappy, ingenious and fallible. As great as these books are, however, their central character almost always has her adventures on her own or with other girls. What has been surprisingly difficult to find are books where the genders play together, without the boys dominating, outnumbering or otherwise overshadowing the girls.Referring to her study on the dearth of female protagonists in children＊s books, McCabe said: ※Such findings are significant. It is a trend of symbolic annihilation of females in children＊s literature, which has implications for children＊s understandings of gender.§McCabe was talking in the context of?girls when she said this, and their incipient feelings of gender-based inferiority. But what about the impact on boys who read exclusively about worlds where girls are ※annihilated§ or?dominated? , ※I＊m glad we＊ve begun to raise our daughters more like our sons, but it will never work until we raise our sons more like our daughters.§If we want to create an equitable society in which everyone can thrive, we need to give boys more choices. Letting them develop a sense of gender-dictated birthright that will be whisked away from under their noses by high-achieving girls, as surely as the tortoise triumphed over the hare, is a recipe for resentment between the sexes.Nan Froman is a senior editor at Groundwood Books, an independent children＊s publisher committed to publishing books that are difficult or potentially controversial. She thinks ※gender equality in children＊s books is very much on people＊s radars§ but acknowledges an issue with demand. ※Parents of daughters may more actively seek out books that encourage female empowerment [rather than gender equality] and perhaps that is just a reflection of where we have come from as a society,§ she says. is tackling the issue head on. It will shortly publish a picture book 每  by Jean E Pendziwol 每 featuring two siblings who can be ※read§ as being of any gender the reader wishes to attribute to them. Also on Groundwood＊s list is , about a little boy who likes to wear the dress in the dressing-up box at school. But Froman admits, ※Social justice is?one of the touchstones at Groundwood, so the kinds of authors we attract and the manuscripts we are drawn to probably tend to be conscious of gender equality. This is something we are aware of in the editing and illustrating process.§But the larger publishing houses, sadly, are a different matter. A senior editor at one, who preferred not to be identified, said, ※Parents of daughters buy books that encourage female empowerment but neither they, nor the?parents of boys think it＊s a priority to buy books that focus on gender equality.§ She also suggests there is an assumption among some publishers that it is harder work to get boys reading. Their solution, she said, is to commission and prioritise books aimed at boys that focus on simple, white-knuckle activity and excitement, rather than risk losing their audiences for the?sake of a few mildly challenging characters and friendships.But the biggest reason for the dearth in books showing girls and boys as equal is that there is no money in it. ※Publishers need a clear financial incentive to change their juggernaut-like direction of travel,§ she says. ※Until there＊s a loud and clear call for books that encourage boys to think it＊s cool to interact with their hardworking, high-achieving female peers 每 like there was a call for books featuring strong female protagonists 每 I＊m afraid they＊re not going to happen.§A book that eschews words for imagination-stimulating pictures: a?storm-wrecked, seashore adventure between a girl and a boy.An ebullient book in which children revel in opposites as they jump in a?pond, enjoy a picnic or run with a?kite, all with a rollicking band of animals in tow.These books show a boy playing with not just one girl as an equal, but having a great time by mucking in with a group of them.A friendship between a quiet boy 每 shunned by schoolmates on account of his family, which includes rattlesnake tamers and shape-shifters 每 and?a girl, which celebrates difference and kindness.An interactive adventure in which readers choose what happens every?few pages.

"I＊ve been playing this record for probably over a decade. It＊s pretty dark, but very sexual; usually when I＊ve played this, I know I＊ve played well.

"n the spring of 1982, a rumour started swilling around New York. The gallerist Annina Nosei had some kind of boy genius locked in her basement, a black kid, wild and inscrutable as , making masterpieces out of nowhere to the accompaniment of Ravel＊s . ※Oh Christ§,  said when he heard. ※If I was white, they would just call it an artist-in-residence.§These were the kind of rumours he had to work against, but also the deliberate myth he constructed about himself, part canny bid for stardom, part protective veil. Basquiat was 22 by then, and could make up out of the whole cloth of his childhood experience all kinds of patchworked, piecemeal selves, playing off people＊s expectations of what a grubby, dreadlocked, half-Haitian, half-Puerto Rican young man might be capable of.He had come to prominence as a graffiti artist, part of the duo SAMO, short for same old shit, who bombed the doors and walls of the Lower East Side with enigmatic phrases. The paintings started coming right at the moment that the East Village transformed from a burned-out wasteland inhabited by heroin addicts to the epicentre of a startling art boom. There was a marketable glamour to being a down-and-out prodigy then, but it was an act for Basquiat, as much a way of satirising prejudice as the African chieftain outfits he＊d later wear to the parties of wealthy white collectors.He was a street kid, true, a teen runaway who had slept on benches in Tompkins Square Park, but he was also a handsome privileged boy from a Park Slope brownstone who had gone to private school, followed by a stint at City-As-School, a destination for gifted children. Though he didn＊t have a formal art education, he and his mother Matilde had been frequenting museums since he was a toddler. As his girlfriend Suzanne Mallouk recalled of a trip to , ※Jean knew every inch of that museum, every painting, every room. I was astonished at his knowledge and intelligence and at how twisted and unexpected his observations could be.§All the same, there were ruptures. His parents separated when he was eight. That year, a car hit him while he was playing basketball in the street. He spent a month in hospital with a broken arm and internal injuries so severe his spleen had to be removed. The gift his mother gave him then, a copy of , became his foundational text, his talisman. He loved discovering the interior architecture of his body, but he also loved the way a body could be reduced to the clean lines of its component parts. Later he would be similarly drawn to cave art, hieroglyphs and hobo signs, the world resolved into elegant pictorial symbols that encoded complex meanings.As a boy he made cartoons of  films, but in 1977 he graduated to making his mark on the skin of New York itself. A bebop insurgent, he travelled the nocturnal city with a spray-can in his overcoat pocket, attacking in particular the high art zone of Soho and the Lower East Side. ※ORIGIN OF COTTON,§ he wrote on a wall in front of a factory in his distinctively loose-jointed capitals; ※SAMO AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PLASTIC FOOD STANDS§. The statements were so totally poised in their assault on art-world inanities that observers believed they were by a disaffected conceptual artist, someone already famous. ※SAMO FOR THE SO-CALLED AVANT GARDE; SAMO AS AN END TO THE POLICE§.There is a graphomaniac quality to almost all of Basquiat＊s work. He liked to scribble, to amend, to footnote, to second-guess and to correct himself. Words jumped out at him, from the back of cereal boxes or subway ads, and he stayed alert to their subversive properties, their double and hidden meaning. His notebooks, recently published in an exquisite facsimile by Princeton, are full of stray phrases, odd combinations. When he began painting, working up to it by way of hand-coloured collaged postcards, it was objects he went for first, drawing and writing on refrigerators, clothes, cabinets and doors, regardless of whether they belonged to him or not.In 1980, a boom year, he was mostly homeless and penniless, picking up girls from clubs so he had somewhere to spend the night. He showed his work for the first time in the scene-defining , which also featured Kenny Scharf, Jenny Holzer and Kiki Smith. He starred as the lead character in , a film based loosely on his life, which wouldn＊t be released until 2000, when it was renamed . That year his co-star  bought one of his first paintings, , for $100, less than one millionth of the price reached by  this year.It＊s salutary to look at , with its Twomblyish neutrals, its scumbled regions of accomplished and obscuring white and grey, behind which are visible ranks of capital ※As§, spelling out a lexical scream, alongside cartoon cars and TV sets. At the bottom there is a sequence of names, from left to right a crossed-out SAMO, followed by AARON, a name Basquiat often incorporated into his paintings, probably after the baseball player Hank Aaron, and then his own bold signature.There it is: the mature elements of Basquiat＊s work, worldly, reticent, communicative, crude and expert all at once. In palette and simplicity it＊s a visual rhyme to the very late , painted in the heroin wasteland of 1988, Basquiat＊s last year, in which a black man rides on a four-legged white skeleton, against an awesomely reduced background, a burlap-coloured scrim, of absolutely nothing at all....A Basquiat alphabet: alchemy, an evil cat, black soap, corpus, cotton, crime, crim谷e, crown, famous, hotel, king, left paw, liberty, loin, milk, negro, nothing to be gained here, Olympics, Parker, police, PRKR, sangre, soap, sugar, teeth.These were words he used often, names he returned to turning language into a spell to repel ghosts. The evident use of codes and symbols inspires a sort of interpretation-mania on the part of curators. But surely part of the point of the crossed-out lines and erasing hurricanes of colour is that Basquiat is attesting to the mutability of language, the way it twists and turns according to the power status of the speaker. Crim谷e is not the same as criminal, negro alters in different mouths, cotton might stand literally for slavery but also for fixed hierarchies of meaning and the way people get caged inside them.※Everything he did was an attack on racism and I loved him for this,§ Mallouk says in , the poetic account of their shared life by Jennifer Clement. She describes him in MoMA sprinkling water from a bottle, hexing the temple. ※This is another of the white man＊s plantations,§ he explains.After Basquiat, Mallouk became involved with another young artist, Michael Stewart, who in 1983 was arrested and beaten into a coma by three police officers after graffitiing a subway station wall. He died 13 days later. The officers, who claimed Stewart had a heart attack, were charged with criminally negligent homicide, assault and perjury but found not guilty by an all-white jury. It is thought he was killed by an illegal chokehold, as Eric Garner would be, in New York, 31 years later.※It could have been me,§ Basquiat said, and set about painting  . Two cartoonish cops with malevolent Mr Punch faces and raised nightsticks wait to rain blows on a black boy, who Basquiat has drawn as a faceless silhouette, passing between them into the blue sky.In contrast to the portrait of another black martyr, Emmett Till, by the white artist  that caused so much controversy at this year＊s Whitney Biennial, Basquiat chooses not to show Stewart＊s destroyed face. Instead he writes a question in Spanish: ※?DEFACIMENTO?§ Who is defacing what? And was the weapon a nightstick or a felt tip pen; was it the 14th Street subway station wall that was defaced, or was it the defacing of a man?All the time, Basquiat was becoming more successful, more wealthy and famous. And yet he still couldn＊t reliably hail a cab in the street. Fine: limos instead. He bought expensive wines, Armani suits to paint in, like any artist who has suddenly made it big, yet the anecdotes about his spending were passed on with a casual glaze of racism, as if there was something unusually revealing about his appetites.It was lonely, he was lonely, the only black man in the room, his prodigy status like that of a toy. ※They＊re just racist, most of those people,§ he＊s quoted as saying in Dieter Buchhart＊s  (Prestel). ※So they have this image of me: wild man running 每 you know, wild monkey man, whatever the fuck they think.§One of his closest friends in the years of his success was . The first time Warhol mentioned Basquiat in his diary, on 4 October 1982, was as ※one of those kids who drive me crazy§. It didn＊t take long, though, before they were embroiled in a full-blown friend-romance, among the most intimate and lasting of both their lives. They collaborated on more than 140 paintings (this fertile partnership ended in 1985, after Basquiat was stung by a bad review of their joint show at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery), worked out and went to parties, had manicures and talked on the phone for hours. Those who believe Warhol incapable of tenderness might take a look at his diary, as he frets endlessly over Basquiat＊s gargantuan drug consumption, the way he nods out on the Factory floor, falling asleep as he ties his shoes.There was nothing heroic or glamorous about Basquiat＊s addiction. It came with the usual detritus: hitting girlfriends, accruing debts, falling out with beloved friends. He tried to stop but couldn＊t, and in the end he died in the apartment he rented from Warhol on Great Jones Street, of acute mixed drug intoxication. In its obituary, the New York Times observed that Warhol＊s death the preceding year ※removed one of the few reins on Mr Basquiat＊s mercurial behaviour and appetite for narcotics§.Maybe so, but in 1988, a somnolent, junk-sick, grieving last year, he assembled masterpieces, among them , with its intricate map of heroes and villains, some barely visible beneath the black and white pentimenti, the repentance marks that Basquiat made his signature. Among the vanishing names is , another prodigy who died of his addictions, who had tried to express how and for whom power functions in the US.These days Basquiat is among the most expensive artists in the world; these days his images are franchised, replicated everywhere from Urban Decay blusher pots to Reebok trainers. You could scorn the commercialisation, but isn＊t it what he wanted, to colour every surface with his runes?They are doing his spells for him and it could hardly be more necessary, since the forces that he arranged himself against are unequivocally on the rise, since white men are parading unmasked and with torches through the streets of Charlottesville and Boston, chanting ※blood and soil§.※Who do you make a painting for?§ he was asked in a filmed interview in October 1985, and he was silent for a long time. ※Do you make it for you?§ the interviewer continued. ※I think I make it for myself, but ultimately for the world you know,§ Basquiat said, and the interviewer asked him if he had a picture of what that world might be. ※Just any person,§ he said, because he knew that change is coming all the time, from everywhere, and that if those of us who are leaning on the doors get out the way, freedom might be a possibility 每 yeah, boom for real.  is at the Barbican, London EC2Y, from 21 September. .

"The great-grandnephew of  is writing the first authorised prequel to Dracula, based on scholarly research into the original, unedited version of Stoker＊s 1897 tale of the undead count, as well as Stoker family legends.Dacre Stoker and co-writer JD Barker＊s prequel Dracul is set in 1868, and sees a 21-year-old Bram encountering some of the creatures he would later write about. Due out next year, it has provoked great excitement in both the literary and film worlds. North American rights sold for a six-figure sum to Putnam, UK rights are with Transworld, where editor Simon Taylor called it ※terrific fun 每 and suitably terrifying§, and film rights have gone to Paramount, where the director of the new adaptation of Stephen King＊s It, Andy Muschietti, is attached to direct.According to Dacre, who also wrote a sequel to Dracula in 2009, there are 102 pages missing from the original draft of Dracula. He believes that only 17 of them have ever been found 每 published as short story Dracula＊s Guest by Bram＊s widow Florence in 1914. Dracula＊s Guest features a nameless character 每 ※very much like§ Dracula＊s protagonist Jonathan Harker, said Dacre. He makes his way to Transylvania, stopping in Munich for the night. ※[Florence] wrote in its preface that it was edited out of Dracula due to length,§ said Dacre. ※The story fits as part of the early narrative, so most likely it was part of the missing pages.§To write their prequel, Dacre and Barker have picked over the original typescript, as well as Bram＊s notes and journals, to analyse what else the lost section might have featured. They searched ※for lines that were crossed out that may have referenced anything Bram had to take out of the 102 pages,§ said Dacre. ※These crossed-out lines gave us clues about what may have been on those missing pages. Since Dracul is a prequel ＃ we wanted to have a really good idea what was included in Bram＊s original and unedited version of Dracula.§He describes the new book as ※the story of the events in Bram＊s life that led him to write Dracula ＃ The story focuses on Bram and his family, as a young boy growing up in Clontarf, Artane and Dublin. These parts were based on Stoker family background stories [and] knowledge, all of the existing biographies, excerpts from  [Bram＊s private notebook] and our speculation.§But the story will centre on Bram＊s encounter with ※an ungodly evil, which he traps in an ancient tower§, according to the announcement of the deals for the novel in Publishers Marketplace.Taylor at Transworld said Dracul ※speculates on what Bram Stoker＊s early life 每 he was a sickly child, often bedridden 每 might have been like had the creatures he later created been real§.※The authors have very cleverly and convincingly resurrected the tone of the original but in a modernised voice,§ said Taylor. ※It includes some nicely handled nods to the original novel, and like Dracula often uses an epistolary narrative form.

"The  government is bankrolling a $60,000 mural project to honour punk pioneers the Saints, continuing Brisbane＊s penchant for venerating its rock bands via city landmarks.The Queensland premier, , announced the funding on Wednesday for a large-scale mural to ※immortalise§ the Saints at Upper Roma Street, a stone＊s throw from its onetime share-house cum rehearsal room and live venue in Petrie Terrace.The mural, to be launched with a concert and recording by the band＊s former guitarist Ed Kuepper, will mark the 40 anniversary of their album (I＊m) Stranded, now widely considered a watershed release of punk.※This exciting project will create a rich addition to public art in Queensland and will fittingly celebrate a home-grown band revered worldwide as one of the most influential punk rock bands of all time,§ Palaszczuk said. It follows the , which the Brisbane city council approved in July after a local resident＊s petition.In 2010, an inner-Brisbane toll bridge opened as the Go Between Bridge, a celebratory nod to another influential local band, .The Saints mural and music project was driven by former Go-Betweens bassist John Willsteed, who is now a Queensland University of Technology creative industries lecturer.The Saints＊ origins lay in 1973 when singer Chris Bailey and drummer Ivor Hay joined forces with the German-born Kuepper, writing many of their classics in the Kuepper family＊s Oxley garage.Bailey, born in Kenya to Irish parents, grew up in nearby Inala, an area that Palaszczuk now represents as the local MP.Initially ignored by local record labels, the Saints＊ first recordings coincided with the very beginnings of punk as a worldwide musical movement.Their first single, (I＊m) Stranded, was recorded in June 1976 每 two months after the Ramones cut their debut in the US and a month before the Sex Pistols played what would be their first single, Anarchy in the UK, live.The Saints released the single independently in September, with a review in a UK magazine prompting EMI in London to order its Australian arm to sign the band.The album (I＊m) Stranded was released in February 1977. The band split in late 1978 with two other acclaimed albums under its belt.Palaszczuk, who made the announcement at the opening of Brisbane music industry conference Bigsound, said many of the 150-plus acts in the city for the event would ※acknowledge the huge influence of the Saints§.They not only helped ※change the face of rock music worldwide in the 1970s but [showed] that a Queensland band could have a big impact on the world stage, paving the way for many of the great Queensland musical acts to follow§.Palaszczuk said the large-scale mural would be ※situated on the north side of Upper Roma St, close to the Saints＊ original practice room, share house and live music venue at 4 Petrie Terrace, known as Club 76§.Kuepper in concert would ※reimagine songs from the first three Saints albums§ in collaboration with Robert Davidson of Topology, she said.

"ingsley Wood, the Tory chancellor of the exchequer in the wartime coalition government, grudgingly conceded in 1943 that he would ※rather give money for education than throw it down the sink with Sir William Beveridge§. Beveridge had certainly designed a very big sink. His formidably technical 300-page report, Social Insurance and Allied Services, published in 1942, laid out an ambitious system of social security that built on, but went well beyond, the mosaic of services that had grown up piecemeal over the previous half century or more. The report was a surprising bestseller: 100,000 copies were sold in the first four weeks.The government was reluctant to endorse such a disruptive and expensive scheme, but most public opinion was strongly on Beveridge＊s side. In a familiar attempt to scare the electorate, the Daily Telegraph misquoted Beveridge saying that his report was taking the country ※half-way to Moscow§. In reality, he was taking it no further east than Whitechapel and Poplar, the social laboratories in which so much late-Victorian and Edwardian thinking about the best means to relieve poverty had been incubated.The National Insurance and National  Service Acts that came into effect in 1948 and that gave expression to so many of Beveridge＊s recommendations serve as the terminal point of Chris Renwick＊s . Renwick provides a readable overview of the development, from the early 19th century to the 1940s, of thinking and policies directed at improving the ※welfare§ of the population. The book necessarily moves at some speed, so the treatment is selective; it is at its best on the fashion for biological social thinking in the early 20th century and on the role of social science in policy-making in the 1930s and 40s.One of the most notable features of the growth of social provision in Britain between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries is the extent to which it was the outcome not of popular pressure but of ideas and policies worked out by an intellectual and political elite. There was popular support for many of the measures that improved the life of the bulk of the population, especially once those measures were seen to be operating successfully. But time and again the initiative, the design and the decisive practical steps were owed to intellectuals, social reformers, do-gooders and politicians. In this respect, the welfare state was something done to the British people much more than it was something done  them.Britain in the first half of the 19th century could not be said to have possessed any ※system§ of welfare provision. What it had was the , based on legislation dating from the end of the Elizabethan era. In the course of the century it became clear, initially to social critics and reformers and then to some progressive politicians, that the Poor Law was not capable of addressing the problems of poverty in a rapidly industrialising and urbanising society. Preventing some people from starving to death was not enough. But all proposals to do more than this ran up against the well established individualist fallacies about not weakening people＊s obligation to provide for themselves, plus the usual dollop of ratepayer meanness. The story of the debates about social policy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is by no means a simple narrative of smooth, cumulative progress, but the patchwork of increasing provision did express a growing recognition that the state had a much larger role to play in helping to provide a livable minimum for all its citizens.The measures adopted during these decades did not reflect one consistent principle or method. The Old-Age Pensions Act of 1908, for example, was non-contributory; claimants received a pension as of right, paid for out of general taxation (though entitlement was circumscribed). The composite National Insurance Act of 1911, by contrast, was contributory, and in a regressive, flat-rate way; in helping to insure selected workers against some of the consequences of illness and unemployment, the state was seen to be acting as a larger and more efficient friendly society. Nor, as Renwick points out, were the measures always introduced by the progressive party of the day: a Tory government passed the Education Act of 1902 that set up local education authorities, leading to the building of more than 1,000 secondary schools in the next 12 years, and it was a Tory minister, Neville Chamberlain, who was responsible for the Local Government Act of 1929 that finally abolished the old Victorian Poor Law.Although these and other measures made a considerable difference to the lives of the poorest three-quarters of the population, they came nowhere near to constituting what we would now think of as a welfare state. Before 1939, unemployment was still devastating for working-class families and even in good times many of them could not afford basic medical care. It was, initially, the second world war that provoked the government into considering ways to secure the wellbeing (and hence the productivity) of the bulk of the population, and it took a Labour government, riding on the back of the solidarity and sense of shared sacrifice experienced during the war, to push through the key measures between 1945 and 1948.Nonetheless, the welfare state and socialism are very far from being identical, despite the gibes of critics then and now. In fact, there is considerable truth in the claim that the national insurance and national health systems that came into being in 1948 were essentially Liberal measures enacted by a Labour government, and that their enactment anyway relied on the exceptional circumstances of the immediate postwar years. What has to be recognised is that the welfare state, as it evolved in Britain, was less about justice than about need. Its starting point was the relief of suffering, after which it took modest steps towards the prevention of suffering. The five ※giants§ Beveridge picturesquely intended his scheme to kill were ※want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness§. These are all forms of deprivation. The central preoccupation of those who had shaped the measures that culminated in the system that came into effect in July 1948 was poverty, not inequality.The story of  and  and his National Health Service is by now a familiar and impressive one, and Renwick retells it well. There is, however, a deeper level that can be excavated, which is to explore how the practical concern to alleviate or prevent the sufferings of the poor came to be bound up with 每 and, intellectually, to depend on 每 two conceptual breakthroughs that are among the salient achievements of the age. The first hugely consequential intellectual advance was the development of macro-economics and the idea that the state was in some sense responsible for managing the economy as a whole. Right up to the 1930s the orthodoxy was, roughly, that governments set the legal framework, controlled the currency and allowed economic agents to pursue their own goals without further direction. A central part of the Keynesian revolution was the insight that the state could, and should, manipulate the level of aggregate demand so that economic activity was stimulated and prosperity ensued. There were, of course, fierce disputes about the precise means of best doing this, but from the 1940s to the late 1970s it was broadly accepted that this is what governments should aim to do.The second crucial conceptual achievement was the working out of the rationale for progressive taxation. This, too, was essentially a New Liberal not a socialist idea. Socialism was focused on achieving social justice through nationalisation of the means of production and the redistribution, or even confiscation, of large concentrations of wealth. The argument about progressive taxation, by contrast, rested on the insight that the achievements of individuals, including their financial rewards, were always dependent on the collective operation of society and social experience, whether in the form of infrastructure, public order and the legal system, or shared knowledge, cultural resources and moral attitudes.Individuals needed sufficient incentive to fully mobilise their talents, but rewards beyond what was needed to call their abilities into play constituted, in economists＊ terms, a form of ※rent§, a return that accrued to those individuals as a result of their advantageous position in society, just as actual rent is a socially generated windfall that benefits whoever happens to own a well-placed property. The precise level at which appropriately progressive taxes were to be set was, again, a largely pragmatic question of political calculation, but that should not obscure its principled basis. It involved not just an assertion that ※those who have more can spare more§: it meant society reclaiming some of what society had created.In the 21st century we have effectively lost sight of this truth. One enormously valuable effect of the New Liberal argument was to cast doubt on the absoluteness of the everyday distinction between public and private money. We now get in a great lather when individuals are paid sums of ※public money§, while we tacitly accept the vastly greater rewards of executives and financiers because that is ※private money§. But it＊s not. All such wealth is in part socially created, and there is no intellectually reputable defence for the astronomical ※rents§ that figures in the corporate and banking worlds extract from their advantageous positions.The coordinated counterattack waged by representatives of capital against these two ideas since the 1980s has been very successful. Protection of the return on capital is now the over-riding long-term policy goal, and it is one that has engineered for itself considerable popular support. Its preferred ideological disguise is a version of the American dream: anyone can ※make it§ if they work hard enough in a system of ※free competition§ (as though there were such a thing). The history of the development of the welfare state up to the middle of the 20th century bore witness to the growing recognition that this belief was simply false.  measures addressed the fundamental human needs of the great majority of those who, at certain not always predictable moments in their lives, would find themselves vulnerable and helpless in the face of impersonal economic forces. It was a great advance in civilisation when society enacted measures to address these needs. Their recent erosion or repeal is a cause for shame.But perhaps the moral of the history, especially given the recent unravelling of so much that had been so patiently woven into the fabric of British society during the period covered in this book, is that, when faced by systemic and deep-rooted disease, sticking-plaster is not enough. Capital never sleeps and is constantly remaking the world in its own image. The story Renwick has to tell is in some ways a stirring one, but at present it looks as though future histories of the first half of the 21st century will depict our age rather as resembling the naked exploitation and class conflict in the first part of the 19th century than the progressive moves towards a more decent society in the first half of the 20th.  is published by Allen Lane.

"A＊s  has long been in the business of off-kilter, sardonic, sleazy sounds that cut and paste 60s psychedelia, 70s prog and 80s synthpop with obvious adoration and more than a tinge of ironic pastiche. How, though, could he possibly filter all of it into a concept record? Dedicated to Bobby Jameson is ostensibly themed around  from the 60s whose career was derailed by drugs and alcohol, except that it＊s loaded with strange non-sequiturs 每 such as the krautrock-heavy Time to Meet Your God, and Santa＊s in the Closet, high on cut-price Bowie vibes 每 which meander away from the central conceit. The moments where Pink truly connects with the Jameson myth 每 albeit with minimal context for the listener 每 are the most effective; Another Weekend and the Cure-nodding Feels Like Heaven are raw and authentic in their ennui and romance, while the title track channels Pink＊s knack for facsimile into something productive, as he  on the Sunset Strip. There are some excellent 每 even tender 每 moments here but, as per, only true fans will be able to overlook Pink＊s exasperating lack of focus.																																											"
"trictly has chosen the traditional format of mixed-sex couples and at the moment we have no plans to introduce same-sex couples in the competition.§ For guidance, they added efficiently, same-sex couples are not something they have ruled out for the future.If you don＊t keep up with Strictly news, you will be wondering what the hell is going on: one of the contestants is the comedian , who has been paired with the professional dancer Kevin Clifton, whose face and/or moves had already impressed her so much that . The problem is that Strictly has come to occupy a place in culture so prominently that the underlying dilemmas of the culture are ventriloquised by its editorial decisions 每 that is, if they aren＊t played out in first. No, sorry, that＊s the meta-problem. The actual problem is that Calman should have chosen a female partner, since she is gay 每 as a lesbian, if she fails to make her every action a pioneering surge forward in the struggle for equality, then she has failed and so has her paso doble.That＊s according to Twitter, anyway. The chief executive of Stonewall, Ruth Hunt, thought differently (also ): ※Will catch up on #strictly later but for the record: 1. I Love @SusanCalman 2. @stonewalluk loves Susan. 3. She can dance with a man. #chill§. Calman would probably have found allies, had she wanted a female partner 每 Craig Revel Horwood, the judge whose distinction is that he often makes perfect sense, said that  and rather demystifies the art by observing: ※You only have to decide who＊s going to go backwards really, that＊s the only difference.§ However, Calman 每 who has campaigned for LGBT rights all her life 每 didn＊t want a same-sex partner, and didn＊t ask for one, remarking (also on Twitter): ※Dancing＊s not necessarily about sex; it＊s acting. When I do a sexy tango with my partner I＊ll be acting.§I don＊t know if I＊m ethically bound, as a neutral Strictly-chronicler, to say that I agree with Hunt. It is irksome to have to act as not just ambassador, but ever-ready street-fighter on behalf of your own sexuality. It wouldn＊t happen to a straight man, put it that way: nor would it happen to a gay man. The Reverend Richard Coles, also in the line-up this season, has been under no pressure to choose a male dance partner.The question is 每 not for Calman but for the  每 does ballroom dancing have anything to do with sex, or is it so formalised, so attenuated by its own conventions, that it has no more to do with real sex than Valentine＊s Day or a love song by McFly does? If the sex element is still real, a public service broadcaster has a duty to be flexible about who fancies whom; if that＊s all acting, as Calman says, then it makes no odds.Berlin-based Antonio Ciutto is now involved with the German gay and lesbian ballroom scene 每 it meets at  每 and moved to London in the 90s to compete internationally for his native South Africa. ※If we＊re talking about different dances, each one has a characteristic: with the Latin dances, the rumba is a love dance, sexual attraction but kind of a love story; the cha-cha is a tease; the tango is almost sex on the dance floor; the paso doble is the matador and his cape. Irrespective of who you＊re dancing with, that is the play, and that will never change.§ But does it help if you fancy your partner? ※No, not at all.§ If you＊re acting attraction, especially in a highly stylised, technically complicated context, the last thing you want to feel is actual attraction. British ballroom dancing is known, says Ciutto, for being ※quite conservative: quite prissy and dainty. The Italians, everything they do is attack; the Germans are incredibly fast; Russians are super-fast and disciplined. The English don＊t have that rawness.§ In other words, even in a world where the sexual component is highly stylised, the British are even further removed than the rest of the world.It would be a bit rum to make the sexuality of the partnerships into a campaigning issue, while leaving in place the fundamental precepts of the dancing theatrics, which are patriarchy with tassels on. The follower, who is always the woman, dances a fraction of a second behind the leader and is without agency. ※The girl dances endlessly in one direction, until the male yanks her in another direction,§ Ciutto says. Even if you had an all-male or all-female pairing, you would leave that sub-dom dynamic in place. An equality-first ballroom-dancing agenda would mean ripping up all the dances, and replacing them with something more like what  might do at a birthday party. (I＊ve made that sound like a bad thing 每 obviously, it would be incredible.) The conventions of the ballroom are, like Japanese Kabuki, frozen in theatre, not much to do with romance, still less to do with sex, everything to do with glitter. Which leaves Calman, and Reverend Coles, free to dance with whomsoever they like, except one another (somebody has to know how to do it).																																											"
"rie Larson＊s directorial debut, Unicorn Store, is a film about embracing your idiosyncrasies without letting the dull conformity of life strip you of your originality. But the film itself often takes this message too literally, with glitter-strewn whimsy taking precedence over boringly necessary little things like plot and characterization.Larson stars as the lead, Kit, a woman stuck in a rut. She＊s still living with her parents (the amusing double act of Joan Cusack and Bradley Whitford) and trying to make it as an artist, struggling to convince the art world to embrace her childlike paintings. When she finally decides to grow up and get a job as a temp, she starts receiving mysterious notes, inviting her to ※the store§. She succumbs and finds a mysterious man (Samuel L Jackson) offering her exactly what she＊s always wanted: a unicorn. However, there are a few important things she needs to do first ...If it all sounds insufferably twee, then at times it really is 每 but it＊s not a total misfire. Larson is a competent director and unlike other recent actor turned film-makers (step forward Ryan Gosling), she doesn＊t let her film drown in the aped style of others. Scenes are solidly staged and she resists the urge to overload the film with extraneous flourishes. But it＊s a deceptively difficult task in a debut film, and the tonal shifts become too much for her to handle. The quirky setup becomes a route into a more dramatic look at a woman struggling to progress from adolescence to adulthood. It＊s a surprise, given her largely drama-based background, that it＊s in the more serious scenes that the film truly falters.The biggest takeaway from Unicorn Store is that Larson is a skilled comic presence. She just about keeps things tolerable, even in some of the sillier moments, and makes a convincing case to be cast in more comedies. Judd Apatow recognized this, casting her in Trainwreck, and she was an excellent host of Saturday Night Live, but we need to see more of her in lighter fare. Jackson is less successful in a small role and his Mr Magorium-esque figure grates whenever he＊s on screen.The key messaging has been sold in other, better films many times before, and Larson＊s film has little more to add, disappearing from the memory as soon as the credits roll. There＊s also a failed attempt at romance between her character and a hardware store worker, played by the Patti Cake$ and The Get Down star Mamoudou Athie. He has presence, but his role is little more than an assistant, and it＊s not entirely clear why he would help her in a quest to make a stable for a unicorn, her character coming off as someone with mental health issues rather than the manic pixie dream girl the film seems to think she is. She never feels like a real person, just a collection of quirks, which is especially jarring when the film tries to aim for pathos in the misjudged final stretch.As a film-maker, Larson shows promise, and as a comic actor she shows genuine talent. With a less affected, more genuine script, Larson could star in and direct a great comedy. Unicorn Store is not it.																																											"
"re you ready?§ a woman shouts, sprinting up the stairs. ※Ready for the madness?§ Her companion yells back: ※I＊m pumped.§ Five minutes to get back to our seats and the ballgowns are necking their schooners of sauvignon blanc, the boating blazers are setting their game faces.Everybody knows the rituals of the second half of the Last Night of the Proms; but no one can be prepared for the shock of experiencing them in person. Yes, that man in a straw boater really does have a rubber duck in his left hand. It wears its own union jack hat and goes ape at the big moments. In quieter passages it merely waves a flag.Which means the duck fits in better than me, because nearly everyone is clutching some kind of territorial marker. There are plenty of European flags (they＊ve been giving them away outside). Most of all, though, there is the union jack: stretched across waistcoats, jutting out of breast pockets, draped over suits. Couples have come dressed in his-and-her＊s union flag outfits. None of this comes with even the faintest seasoning of irony. At the interval, a man in yet another boater barks up at the balcony: ※This is being televised all over the world and you＊ve got the union jack upside down.§He＊s right on both counts. The concert will be watched by 6,000 people in the hall, another 9 million Britons at home, and many more as far as away as Japan, Iceland and Norway. It is being heard on radios in Athens and Tallinn. It is the biggest musical event in the world 每 and it is the story Britain likes to tell the world about itself.※It is so British,§ audience members keep saying. ※Very British,§ murmur a trio of Taiwanese women, each wearing a pair of union flagpoles fixed to their heads like deely boppers. exactly what that Britishness is no one seems able to say, although it is evidently a co-creation between the performers and the prommers. The people who queue for hours each year to ensure a standing place in the arena take it upon themselves to act as the event＊s custodians.A man in a red fez tells me he came from Oxford to sleep in a doorway of the Royal Albert Hall on Thursday night to ensure he got a ticket on Friday morning that enabled him to queue again on Saturday afternoon, which meant he got to stand under the conductor＊s rostrum for three and a half hours. He has been doing this every year since 1987. He won＊t give his name but ※you can use any of this material§, he graciously offers. Next to him is Phil, who＊s been coming to every Last Night and most of each Prom season since 1992. When I ask what he does the rest of the year he looks at me like it＊s a trick question. Just behind them is John, bedecked in union jacks, who says they can never, ever change the programme: ※It＊s tradition, isn＊t it?§Well, up to a point, John. The historian  that the four key pieces that make up the evening＊s all-important second half ?每 the Sea Songs, Land of Hope and Glory, Jerusalem and Rule, Britannia! 每 were only strung together for the first time in 1954, smack bang in the period between the loss of India and the fiasco of Suez. And while the prommers always had a reputation for foot-stamping boisterousness, only after the last night was televised did they start to wear ※ever more outlandish clothes, and to bring their bunting and umbrellas and funny hats§. This supposedly most British of traditions is of recent manufacture.. The Sea Songs and Land of Hope and Glory were both composed around the turn of the 20th century, precisely as British pre-eminence was facing eclipse by Germany and the US. Blake＊s Jerusalem was set to music in 1916, the darkest year of the first world war. The entire musical sequence is a postcard from a country that never existed. No harm there, except that Britain in 2017 is a country in danger of believing its own caricature and hoping the rest of the world will, too.Still, such concerns mustn＊t get in the way of a night of strictly organised fun. The prommers bop to the Hornpipe with as much rhythm as the audience on an old Top of the Pops. In the first half,  gave the Liebestod from Tristan und Isolde a darkness that lifts it above the usual kitsch. But it＊s when the great Wagnerian comes on in a helmet and shield to perform Rule, Britannia! that the audience really perks up. Much merriment is had each time a party popper goes off, an inflatable banana is held aloft or a prommer parps a horn. It amounts to an evening for people who find telethons entertaining and miss Dave Lee Travis from the Radio 1 schedules. Such folk deserve their expensive entertainment, but why it should be taken as part of the shorthand for contemporary Britain is beyond me.																																											"
"ow let＊s turn the Royal Festival Hall into a rave!§ In all my experience of concert-going at the Southbank Centre, this was a first. Most of the audience were already on their feet, but the prompt from ?lafur Arnalds 每 a composer and one half of Icelandic techno duo Kiasmos 每 had people streaming down the aisles towards the stage, hands aloft. For the next 90 minutes, Kiasmos set in motion shimmering, rib-quaking layers of electronic sound that flowed across each other and pulled apart, while CGI scenes of slow-motion apocalypse unfolded on a vast screen behind the mixing decks 每 imagine  with industrial-strength bass.Kiasmos represented one aesthetic extreme of this two-day event celebrating the 10th anniversary of , a London-based record label that describes itself as a ※genre-defying§ home for ※avant-garde artists§. At the other extreme was , a bearded mystic who ranted against modern-day materialism but offered to sell records following his afternoon show. Though he played a mixture of new and older work it was all in the same vein: the swirling, mostly-tonal arpeggio figuration of what he calls ※continuous music§, churned out with the piano＊s sustaining pedal down.Incomparably more sophisticated was the dapper 12-piece outfit Penguin Cafe. Surrounded by giant pot-plants and equipped with a plethora of instruments from a battery of ukuleles to a tabla (via a string quintet, two melodicas, bird whistles and a Steinway grand), they served up a mix of gently kitsch hits and new, minimalism-influenced material 每 all rhythmically taut and irrepressibly energetic. Similar energy levels, though a very different kind of sound, characterised the set played on Friday evening by Brooklyn drum-piano-and-bass trio Dawn of Midi, which wove a series of beguilingly complex sonic fabrics from musical materials as simple as repeated notes plucked on an acoustic bass.Nothing, though, could compete for simplicity with multi-instrumentalist Peter Broderick, who wandered onto the stage alone, singing the Irish ballad As I Roved Out on a May Morning. I don＊t know how audible he was at the back of the hall but from the stalls, before he was plugged in, before the heavier Indie-folk vocals, before the electronic looping, his spare, sinewy voice provided a moment of respite 每 and a reminder that if defying genre is the aim, the sound of the human voice is as radical as it gets.

"n the UK, the appeal of jangle pop has often lain in its rough-hewn execution, despite the pristine heights to which its practitioners aspire. Tune into the second alluring album by , Toronto＊s two-girl, two-boy jangle sensations, however, and 每 as with their most obvious predecessors,  每 it＊s like stepping into a parallel universe. All the cutie derivatives are present: punky perkiness (Your Type), blithe melodies, or odes to the Jesus & Mary Chain＊s Jim Reid (Lollipop). But here too are ear-candy production values, and Kerri MacLellan＊s bejewelled keyboards. Molly Rankin＊s pipes are pure 60s pop on Not My Baby, and her songwriting wit sparkles throughout this nuanced break-up album.																																											"
"Strictly is back for a 15th series, with head judge Len replaced by Wirral-born Shirley Ballas, known in dancing circles as ※the Queen of Latin§. She＊ll be flanked by Bruno, Craig and Darcy, but will she tolerate Bruno＊s standup judging style? Contestants including the Rev Richard Coles, Ruth Langsford and telly chef Simon Rimmer will be paired up, while last year＊s winner Ore Oduba will be showing them how it＊s done with an intimidating opening routine. It＊s that time, when the Royal Albert Hall turns red, white and blue, and Land of Hope and Glory rings out. Cultural politics and rousing finale aside, tonight＊s music includes the world premiere of Finnish composer Lotta Wenn?koski＊s Flounce plus Lola Montez Does the Spider Dance to mark John Adams＊s 70th birthday. Sakari Oramo, conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra, manages the mayhem. Continues on BBC1 at 9pm. A classic lineup of judges, a well-loved format and the joy of the early moments when those novelty warblers outweigh the potential stars make the audition stages of X Factor worth a watch. But with the Strictly bandwagon rolling into town and threatening to cha-cha-cha all over the ratings, times are tough for Cowell and co. As the second stage of auditions starts, more hopefuls face the main man as well as Sharon Osbourne, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh. There is an opportunity to compare our Italian friend to British counterpart Cormoran Strike, as this week the Sicilian police detective investigates a similar crime to the one in The Cuckoo＊s Calling. A beautiful woman is found dead in the foyer of an apartment block, but all the residents claim ignorance. Getting the truth from this lot will require some finesse. Happily, il commissario is as smooth of manner as a plate of pat谷. Wherever he lays his chat, that＊s his home: Ross recently returned to the former bosom of the BBC by parking the 12th series of his ITV vehicle in the remodelled  Centre (or at least the bit of it that hasn＊t been turned into posh flats and a fancy club). His lineup of guests tonight include both Rag＊n＊Bone Man and a moaning gag-man (Jack Dee), plus there＊s a chinwag with former Westeros side-eye champ Natalie Dormer. This new series, in which kids oversee a revamp of their family car, is hosted by vlogger Ali-A and infused with smartphone culture. A fair bit of it is filmed on a handheld selfie-cam, which lends it intimacy and energy, but the conceit of the presenter receiving instant-message updates from the show＊s mechanic and resprayer doesn＊t really work. In episode one, Djim tries to make his parents＊ people-carrier into a supercar. Some jam with your Cream? The 60s supergroup 每 supposedly named because Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker were considered the ※cream of the crop§ of British jazz and blues 每 released a batch of lean, mean singles including Badge, White Room and Sunshine of Your Love. But for many, their strength lay in their interminable onstage workouts. Featuring concert footage and interviews with the trio, this tells their story. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a delightfully interfering Emma Woodhouse in this assured and funny adaptation of Jane Austen＊s novel. McGrath, as director and writer, wisely leaves the wit to Austen, while the relentless matchmaker Emma busily sets about arranging marriages 每 including that of the unfortunate orphan Harriet (Toni Collette). Encompassing Nazi Germany, the cold war and the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, this X-Men prequel is a heck of an alternative history lesson. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are first-class acts as the pre-wheelchair Prof Xavier and embittered Magneto, who team up to confront Kevin Bacon＊s evil geneticist before following different paths. A somewhat sombre but superior Marvel movie. Matthews winningly extends the themes of his award-winning 2007 documentary, Beautiful Young Minds. It＊s the story of brilliant young mathematicians who are on the autistic spectrum and bound for the International Mathematical Olympiad.

"Expectations have been set unrealistically high for the Stephen King-based scary-clown horror, but this polished rendition should satisfy fans, even if  has stolen its thunder. The story is similar, in terms of likable 1980s preteen misfits banding together against a smalltown terror: Bill Skarsg?rd＊s genuinely creepy Pennywise the clown.Earthy sensuality, rugged landscapes and understated tenderness make for , hinging on the tentative romance between a troubled Yorkshire farmer＊s son (Josh O＊Connor) and a Romanian hired hand (Alec Secareanu). It＊s a beautifully told story, unsentimental in its portrayal of tough, precarious rural life.Masculinity is stripped to its fundamentals in this astonishing documentary observing an intense, four-day group therapy session at California＊s Folsom State Prison. The participants are a mixture of long-term inmates and curious outsiders. We join them as they go to places within themselves they never imagined. in this dark horror-thriller, with feminism, media sensationalism, class division and even Karl Marx in its scope. Bill Nighy is fittingly funereal as a detective assigned to catch a Ripper-style murderer, with Olivia Cooke playing a stage star and murder suspect.A terrific cast (Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, Daniel Craig, Riley Keough for starters) and a shambolic, atypical heist make for , with just enough relevance to here-and-now America to make it more than a mere trifle.

"lassic Blue Note releases of the 1960s are filled with tracks that exoticise Africa, with names such as Afro Blue, Afrodisia, Ghana, Niger Mambo, Mr Kenyatta, The Man from Tanganyika and so on. Five decades later, Blue Note＊s latest signing  每 the Nigerian drummer who powered Fela Kuti＊s Afrobeat 每 is turning the tables and exoticising Blue Note＊s hard-bop. The Source builds on Allen＊s , but this time he and musical director Yann Jankielewicz invoke other jazz legends. Ewajo recalls Miles Davis＊s angular modal jazz; On Fire is based around a Dizzy Gillespie-style chromatic trumpet riff; Cruising evokes Duke Ellington＊s tone poems; Push and Pull sounds like an ecstatic New Orleans marching band. Each is set to one of Allen＊s herky-jerky drum patterns and a restrictive ostinato bassline, but Allen＊s Parisian band explore each theme in detail, with some garrulous, impressive solos from the likes of saxophonist R谷mi Sciuto and trumpeter Nicolas Giraud.

"It＊s the sort of merchandise you might find in any hotel gift shop: mugs emblazoned with slogans, T-shirts, prints of local beauty spots and novelty key rings. But this is not any ordinary holiday tat. Banksy＊s  in the Palestinian territories will open a gift shop and sell new works by the elusive street artist for the first time in four years. The works on sale include limited-edition crucifixes that have been fashioned into giant grappling hooks, and painted keyrings and ornaments resembling parts of the wall that separates  and Palestine.The gift shop, which will open in the autumn, will be next to Banksy＊s hotel, museum and protest gallery space that he opened in March overlooking the vast concrete stretch of wall, topped with barbed wire, that passes through Bethlehem. This is the first time Banksy has put his works for sale since 2013, when he set up a small, anonymous pop-up stall in Central Park in New York where lucky passers-by could purchase original signed canvases for $60 (?38). They were a steal compared with the prices that original  artworks now fetch at auction, and indeed some of the Central Park works have since sold for upwards of ?120,000.Most of the new works at the Walled Off gift shop will only be available in the West Bank shop, but a few are also going on sale in the hotel＊s . Those keen fans and collectors hoping to get their hands on a limited edition crucifix grappling hook will have to put in an order before they travel to the West Bank. In true Banksy fashion, none of the new works are on sale for anywhere near the six-figure sums that collectors are willing to pay for signed Banksy work. Miniature reproductions of the hotel key fobs, which resemble segments of the concrete separation wall, will be available to buy in the shop for 90 shekels (?20), or 230 shekels for those who want it hand-painted. Souvenir reproductions of parts of the separation wall are also on sale, some featuring Banksy＊s popular  image, and others daubed with more openly political statements such as ※Free Palestine§. Also likely to be in high demand is a Banksy art print that portrays the wall＊s Israeli military watchtower as a fairground swing ride, set behind an actual chiseled piece of the wall, on sale for 575 shekels.All of the items have been designed and created by Banksy himself and are likely to be hugely popular, since it is now rare for him to put his own works on sale, despite an enormous demand for them all over the world. It also marks a continuation of the graffiti artist＊s decade-long relationship with Bethlehem, since he came to the Palestinian city over a decade ago and graffitied the wall, making it a tourist destination in its own right. For the Israeli government the West Bank barrier, built from 2002 after the second intifada, is seen as a vital security wall to protect Israel from terrorist attacks. Palestinians, however, regard it as a symbol of their oppression and racial segregation.The wall is now covered in political art and statements from street artists and protesters from all over the world, including a recent illustration of Donald Trump hugging the watchtower and another of the US president vowing to build the West Bank wall ※a brother§ 每 a reference to his election pledge to build .The Walled Off hotel, which the artist described as having ※the worst view of any hotel in the world§, exists both as a living art institution but also an informative museum space that explains the turbulent history of the region. It is also a gallery showcasing Palestinian artists, who are often restricted from travelling and exhibiting their work in Israel and abroad. Banksy＊s hope for the hotel was that it would draw a new type of tourism to the area and generate much-needed jobs. Rooms start at $60 (?46) and go up to $965 for the presidential suite.The area where the hotel sits in Bethlehem is under Israeli control, but for Israelis to get there requires a journey through  which would be illegal for Israelis.In October, as well as the opening of the gift shop, the Walled Off hotel will also be running package holidays for the first time. The ※vandals＊ retreat§ will give people the chance to visit the Bethlehem hotel in the presence of a famous graffiti artist, such as Australian street artist Lush, and guests will be taken on excursions to paint the wall themselves. A hotel spokesperson said: ※It＊s a bit like going on a cruise with a celebrity, but with a lot more swearing.§ But with his own appearance still shrouded in mystery, Banksy himself is unlikely to be among the package holiday guest vandals. This article was amended on 13 September 2017 to correct a date and clarify a detail about location access.																																											"
"he hour grows late at the London press junket. The schedule is running horribly behind time. Inside suite 206, the reporters find themselves packed in like sardines. They are perched on tables and windowsills, spilling coffee and mopping up the mess with their notepads. Each time the door opens, a fresh arrival comes in, which means that the walls inch ever-closer and there is less air. Tension is mounting and tempers are fraying. The night before, we all sat down and watched  together. Today, it feels as if we might be living it, too. is an explosion, an assault, a haunted-house horror that whips up conflicting emotions. Some love it, some hate it and some pinwheel back and forth, like lost souls in limbo. On screen, Jennifer Lawrence plays an unnamed heroine whose domestic idyll is overrun by an endless procession of malignant houseguests. They are disturbing her in the bathroom; they are making out in her bed. ※I＊m confused,§ she confides, just as the nightmare begins. And by God, she is not the only one.※Yeah, well, that＊s the journey,§ shrugs Aronofsky, sipping bottled water, after I am granted entry to the tranquil suite next door. ※I think it＊s OK to be confused. The movie has a dream-logic and that dream-logic makes sense. But if you try to unscrew it, it kind of falls apart. So it＊s a psychological freak-out. You shouldn＊t over-explain it.§Some directors dazzle and some seduce. Aronofsky simply tramples you in your seat. He is the ripsnorting bull of American cinema, flanks matted with sweat, hooves kicking up clods; meaning to shock and awe; and possibly impregnate us as well. This pedigree was apparent right from his 1998 debut Pi, which took a cerebral premise (a mathematician studying patterns in the Torah) and spun it into paranoid fantasy. It then proceeded to thunder through , the redemptive contortions of  and , before building to the bombast of  (by far his least interesting picture).※I＊m always going to be a divisive guy,§ he tells me. ※What can I tell you, I＊m like .§ And yet Mother! 每 which was enthusiastically booed at its Venice press screening 每 takes a particular delight in tormenting its viewer.How best to describe Aronofsky＊s bloody beast? Mother! is like Lars von Trier＊s  as rewritten by Edward Albee, or a garish horror-comic by way of primal-scream therapy. It is about a lauded poet (Javier Bardem) and his doting young wife (Lawrence), who live in a gothic gingerbread house in a clearing in the woods. The poet wants to fill the house with new ideas, either as means of inspiring his writing or distracting himself from it, and so he opens the door to a cadaverous fan and his busybody wife (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer, both deliciously creepy). Before long the place is teeming with demonic revellers who trash the furnishings and drive a seemingly unresolvable wedge between the husband and wife. Is it a redundancy to note that the film turns shrill and hysterical, on the outer edge of control? That, surely, was where Aronofsky was headed all along.I am trying to resist over-explaining the film 每 but there is a major elephant at large in this room. Mother! is a film about a monstrous 48-year-old artist and his 27-year-old muse. And during production, Aronofsky struck up a relationship with his star. Aronofsky is 48; Lawrence 27. So I am wondering the most delicate way of broaching this subject. Did Bardem at any stage ask whether he was playing the director?※Oh no,§ says Aronofsky, who has the sensitive features of a rabbinical student and the foursquare physique of a New York docker. ※No, no, not at all. Javier knows me. He knows I＊m not a monster. Because a film director is a very different kind of artist. I only have to be a monster on set 每 for two or three months every few years. The rest of the time I＊m a nine-to-five father [he has an 11-year-old son from a previous relationship with the British actor Rachel Weisz]. I take my kid to school, go to sleep, live a life. Then go see my parents at weekends.§OK, I tell him. But does he realise he has left himself wide open for this kind of speculation? It is hard to believe the film is not just a bit about him.※Oh sure,§ he allows. ※It＊s a projection of my life and what I＊m thinking about. But my ego is in every character in every film that I＊ve made. I＊m the ballerina in Black Swan. I＊m the wrestler in The Wrestler. I can see how people will especially make the connection with this one. But it＊s also all fiction; it＊s all smoke and mirrors. And if anything, my empathy here is more with the mother. I＊m probably more Jen＊s character than I am Javier＊s.§Aronofsky was raised in Manhattan Beach, South Brooklyn, the son of two schoolteachers. He says his first exposure to culture was seeing Broadway musicals with his mother. They saw  and he didn＊t know what a whorehouse was and asked his mother too loudly as soon as the curtain came down.A few miles up the road from his house was , stinking of brine and cotton candy. He used to ride the Cyclone rollercoaster, sometimes 10 or 20 times a day in the summer. He has carried the experience with him ever since.※It＊s funny,§ he says. ※Sean Gullette 每 the guy who starred in Pi 每 is staying in Rome and so he just came to the Mother! premiere in Venice. He told me afterwards that he closed his eyes twice during the movie. And I thought: ＆Come on.＊ If you keep your eyes open the whole time, well, it＊s like riding the Cyclone with your belt unfastened and your hands not touching the rails. And the second you look away, you＊ve ruined it. So that＊s the dare 每 and then Sean went and blinked.§Aronofksy likes to push his audience to the brink. I＊ve heard that he likes to do it to his performers as well. Mickey Rourke 每 Oscar-nominated for his brilliant performance in The Wrestler 每  He has a reputation for being combative and controlling, for breaking actors down and shooting them in extremis.※No, no,§ he says, briefly nettled. ※It＊s not about breaking them down. They break themselves down. They＊re game.§He gulps some water and thinks it over. ※Actors,§ he says. ※Sometimes they forget, but I think the original reason they started acting was to be able to cry in front of class. Sometimes they forget that, when they become big action movie stars, because that＊s more about modelling than acting. But they love it, really. So I＊m always looking for actors who want to roll up their sleeves and let loose and just cry. Javier＊s not afraid of crying; he＊ll do anything. Jennifer, completely the same. She＊s still very young; not jaded in the least. And, yeah, she was scared on this movie, because she knew she was going to have to go for some big emotions.§, Lawrence discussed her own experience in making Mother! ※I had to go to a darker place than I＊ve ever been in my life,§ she admitted. ※I didn＊t know if I＊d be able to come out OK.§ There were reports that during one gruelling scene, she dislocated a rib.※Yeah, she ended up tearing her diaphragm,§ Aronofsky says. ※She was hyperventilating. Because of the emotion.§Is it true that he then immediately ordered her to do the whole scene again?The director snorts. ※Well, yeah. Pull it together. That＊s very British, right? Come on, let＊s go.§And how was Lawrence with such behaviour? Did she tolerate it?※No, no,§ he says, apparently worried I＊m getting the wrong end of the stick. ※I mean, we gave her time to recover. The thing is that she＊d been thinking about that scene way too long, and it got all up in her head. So then the emotions flooded her and I saw what was happening 每 because I＊m experienced 每 and was able to get the camera in the right place. The shot was originally on her back and I flipped the whole thing, let her recover and then said, ＆Get the camera on her face, right now＊, because that＊s the kind of emotion that you never, ever see.§It takes me a moment to process this. It sounds as though he is saying that he used Lawrence＊s recovery time to reposition the camera so as to better capture her pain.But then Mother! is a film that positively luxuriates in pain. It＊s a great, twisted howl of a movie; overheated and heady; an engrossing ordeal. As the house fills up, Lawrence is sent scurrying from one room to the next, vainly attempting to clear up the breakages, ordering the interlopers to get the hell out. One might view the film as a disease metaphor, in which tumours metastasise and infest the whole body. Alternatively, you can view it as a dark parable on the creative process, with the artist deciding what is let in and used up. In Aronofsky＊s world, perhaps, there is not a whole lot of difference.The director agrees, but only up to a point. Film-making is tough, he admits. Some might even go so far as to view it as a form of dysfunction. But he has never been the sort to start whining about his hardship.※I love it,§ he says. ※Shooting movies, I love it. Those are the times in your life that you really remember. I remember, crystal-clear, shooting certain scenes in Requiem for a Dream, right down to the shirt I was wearing on a particular day. And it＊s still so sharp, you know, because you＊re alive, because your brain＊s firing. Because you＊re living, right there, in that little moment.§He says that the first thing he did on arriving in London was pick up the phone to call his parents. He wanted to tell them about the premiere, over in Venice, and let them know that he had landed safely. His father was in a nostalgic mood. The old man remembered the family driving past the local cinema when it was screening Pi. Aronofsky was still in his 20s, his career barely warming up. And he pointed out of the car window and said: ※Dad, all I want in my life is for people to either cheer or boo. I just don＊t want anything in the middle.§Aronofsky slams down his water and chuckles at the memory. He says: ※Twenty years on, I guess not a whole lot has changed.§																																											"
"Kate Millett, the wayward artist, thinker and activist whose 1970 book Sexual Politics became a keystone of second-wave feminism, has died at the age of 82. Perhaps aptly for someone who wrote widely and fervently of her pursuit of love, she succumbed to a heart attack during an annual holiday in Paris to celebrate her birthday with her wife and longtime collaborator, the photojournalist Sophie Keir. ※Let＊s always be having an affair. Wherever we meet, however many times a year 每 let it always be an affair,§ Millett wrote in Sita, her 1976 account of an earlier lesbian relationship, which, like subsequent autobiographical works, became an exploration of forms of love.Lena Dunham was among those who paid immediate tribute to her cultural importance, and its continuing impact on a new generation of readers and writers:The cultural critic Elaine Showalter said: ※A revolution needs leaders, and with Sexual Politics Kate Millett came forward to give the Women＊s Liberation Movement a national voice and a strong connection to higher education. She was an intellectual and a radical feminist who could also speak effectively to a wide general audience.§ Born in Minnesota in 1934 to an alcoholic father and a mother who worked as a teacher and insurance saleswoman to support her three daughters, Millett went first to the University of Minnesota. A rich aunt paid for her to go on to Oxford, where she became the first American woman to receive a first-class degree from St Hilda＊s College. She was working as a sculptor when , based on her doctorate at Columbia, was published. A New York Times pen portrait written at the time reported that it had sold 10,000 copies in a fortnight, making her ※something of a high priestess of the current feminist wave, a movement long on gimmickry but short on philosophy until Miss Millett appeared on the scene§. Andrea Dworkin later : ※I cannot think of anyone who accomplished what Kate Millett did, with this one book. It remains the alpha and omega of the women＊s movement.§  ※In the matter of conformity,§ Millett wrote in the book, ※patriarchy is a governing ideology without peer; it is probable that no other system has ever exercised such a complete control over its subjects.§Before Sexual Politics, she had published a scathing indictment of women＊s colleges, Token Learning, which documented the ways women were being trained for gentility and ※service§ rather than achievement and leadership, said Showalter. ※Her visit to Douglass, the women＊s college of Rutgers University where I taught, in April 1970, persuaded the faculty to rethink its mission and methods and began a new era of feminist education devoted to the encouragement of excellence in women.§Her forthright style and strong opinions won her as many adversaries as friends, , whom she eviscerated in Sexual Politics as one of three ※counterrevolutionary sexual politicians§, along with DH Lawrence and Henry Miller, for their representations of sex. Mailer lashed back in The Prisoner of Sex, published a year later 每 ※not one of his best§, quipped Millett. In 1974, she published Flying, the first of her books rooted in her own experience, which dealt with the fallout of literary celebrity for a woman who was always uncomfortable in the spotlight.  (1990) dealt with a painful period when she was hospitalised by her family after being diagnosed with manic depression, and Mother Millett, in 2001, explored the love between mothers and children when decrepitude has overturned the old power relationship. In 1979, she and Keir travelled to speak at Iran＊s first celebration of International Women＊s Day. They were arrested and evicted from the country, but went on to found a support group for women fleeing Ayatollah Khomeini＊s regime, and to record the experience in a 1981 book, Going to Iran.With the proceeds from her early success, she bought a 10-acre farm in LaGrange, New York, and set up an artists＊ colony for women which she financed by growing and selling Christmas trees. She and Keir continued as co-directors after it was registered as a not-for-profit organisation in 2012 and was renamed the Millett Center for the Arts. Millett was awarded a Yoko Ono Lennon Courage award for the arts in 2012, and a year later was inducted into The National Women＊s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York, site of the women＊s rights convention in the US in 1848.

"In the interests of transparency, I have to confess that I neglected my RR duties last Saturday and spent several hours traipsing over . On the way down, weary and footsore, I was roughly two hours from the car when ＊s Keep Right On to the End of the Road popped into my head, resolutely staying there for the rest of the walk.

So obviously I＊m sharing it with you at the beginning of this playlist.Persevering with the outdoorsy feel, next up we have the  and This Year. An upbeat yet reflective number, containing a fundamental assertion of persistence: ※I am going to make it through this year / If it kills me.§, a few spots this week were reserved for regularly-yet-unsuccessfully-nominated tunes (or ※§ for those who prefer the scientific term discussed in the Readers recommend glossary). First up in that category is The Mary Ellen Carter by , which has previously been put forward for the topics of boats, resilience, gases, iron and steel, sticking it to the man and girls＊ names. Indefatigable or what?Returning to the on-theme suggestions,  issues a rallying cry for tenacity in Keep On Keeping On ...... while the  keeps on the, er, keeping on bandwagon, with Keep On Running. A classic hook leads neatly to a classical tune. Reader Pairubu describes Mushi No Onna by  () thus: ※Jun takes the song ... set to Pachelbel＊s Canon and basically whips it into submission in a series of screams, shrieks and cries that ooze desperation§. Oddly enough, that vocal style was the one adopted early in his career by the great . It was only latterly that his approach mellowed sufficiently to afford the contrast now evident in his rendition of The Impossible Dream.A similar sentiment about stoicism 每 but with more synthesisers 每 crops up in ＊s :All these positives about persistence notwithstanding, it would be negligent to deny that there can be a darker side. In my favourite nomination this week, : ※A song about being aggressively and persistently stalked by a child who looks like a cross between Ed Sheeran, Meatloaf and Chucky.

These people would of course be wrong, and accordingly next we have (I＊m Gonna Be) 500 miles by the .

"In the early 90s, New York was home to an R&B collective, the Swing Mob, comparable in talent and influence to the city＊s 70s folk scene. Missy Elliott would become its , a breakout star with a brain full of fireworks, shooting out blazing innovations too fast for her audience to keep up, let alone her rivals. Initially as part of the group Sista, then in partnership with , she honed the skills as a singer, rapper, writer, producer and performer that made her own shot at the big time, Supa Dupa Fly, such a commercial and critical success. Yet the album＊s most memorable track was one of its least sonically representative: a jaunty, tuneful paean to sex, a subject Elliott has always rejoiced in addressing directly. Constructed around a sample from a Delfonics song, Ready Or Not Here I Come (Can＊t Hide from Love) 每 already the basis for a Fugees hit the previous year 每 Sock It 2 Me was a huge hit in turn, helped along by a characteristically dazzling video by Hype Williams that defied industry expectations by exaggerating rather than playing down Elliott＊s body shape. Had this been Missy Elliott＊s first single and not her second, it would surely rank among the greatest debuts of all time.Excellent though much of it is, Supa Dupa Fly explored where R&B had recently been 每 echoing the work Elliott and Timbaland had crafted for Jodeci, SWV and  每 rather than sounding new or alien. It was her second album, Da Real World, that sounded as though it was beamed in from the future 每 shiny, synapse-popping, crackling with ingenuity and mischief on such tunes as Beat Biters, Stickin＊ Chickens, and the screw-you reclamation of She＊s a Bitch. From the start, Elliott had two major subjects: Missy Elliott＊s brilliance, and Missy Elliott＊s libido 每 and there was plenty of both to go around. It＊s the latter that drives this taut and simmering celebration of female lust, reflecting the gaze of oglers back at them to see if they come up to scratch.Talent borrows, runs the aphorism, and genius steals. Like most great innovators ( being a prime example), Elliot has an instinct for exactly what to steal and when. Her third album, Miss E＃ So Addictive (the E was circled, like an embossed pill, to leave no doubt as to what she was getting at), followed Madonna on to the electronica dancefloor. Yet it remained unmistakably an R&B record 每 and a masterpiece, the high-point of a run that mirrored and defined a golden age for mainstream R&B. It was fashionable at the time for mainstream music to borrow from ; typically Elliott did it best, if not first, on this absurdly catchy and danceable track.Peak modernist Missy: a knowing, witty, filthy, whip-tight tune, all coiled energy and single-entendres, that doesn＊t so much turn the tables on attitudes to women in rap and R&B as simply refuse to acknowledge them in the first place. In Elliott＊s world, she＊s in charge, men are there to serve her purposes, and she＊s equally happy to serve theirs if it gets her what she wants. A rap from her old pal  inevitably recalls the Dominoes＊ splendid and saucy 1951 novelty hit, Sixty Minute Man.The most club-oriented number in Elliott＊s catalogue, and one of her biggest European hits, thanks to a first-rate reworking from , who at that time were turning everything they touched to gold. Elliott＊s salute to hedonism, set to a speed garage beat, is eccentric and wonderful; there isn＊t another record quite like it.A stone-cold classic. Elliott＊s fourth album, Under Construction, is an amazing record. It harks back to old school hip-hop while incorporating the southern rap styles from Florida and Georgia then dominating the game (Elliott is from Virginia). It features half a dozen tracks which might have made this list 每 but none reach the heights of Work It, which manages somehow to be retro and thoroughly novel, with its pattering, housey percussion (sampled from ), comic sound effects, lascivious slang (※badonkadonk§, ※chocha§) virtuoso rhyming, crafty backmasking, and glorious chorus: ※I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it.§ Lewd, joyous and irrepressible, a Tex Avery cartoon made music, this is the essence of Missy Elliott in five inspired minutes.A ringer, technically, but as Elliott＊s work for others merits a run-down of its own (see also: the superb  by Destiny＊s Child), it would be a shame to leave it out. She co-wrote this delectable number with her protege and Swing Mob associate Tweet, and Timbaland produced it. A different voice allows for a sinuous, leisurely sensuality distinct from Elliott＊s own hyper-harged sexual assertiveness. It＊s one of pop＊s outstanding tributes to women pleasing themselves; no surprise that Elliott should, let＊s say, have a hand in it.Elliott was unhappy with her fifth album, the raucous, aggressive, crunk-influenced This Is Not a Test!, feeling she had been pressured into rushing it out. It had no standout hit, yet did not lack for remarkable tracks. Perhaps the most emblematic of them is this hilarious stomper, in which once again Elliott proves more than a match for any male rapper＊s preening vanity and lecherous braggadocio, undercut as ever with a sly self-awareness of which few of her counterparts showed any sign.One notable exception, however, was Slick Rick, who here delivers a wry, drawling turn on this droll and languid tall tale of collaboration leading to fornication. It appears on ; at 12 years old, Elliott＊s most recent album, and also her most underrated. It has quality, range and maturity, and just as  did, it showcases her flair for breathing new life into old sounds.Elliott has a knack for producing songs that sound rather like another, specific number, but not quite enough to be considered a knock-off. In her case, it＊s more likely to be her claiming back what had been borrowed in the first place. Her most recent single, I＊m Better (2017), for instance, has a definite hint of , who has benefited a great deal, directly and indirectly, from Elliott＊s inventiveness. Fair exchange is no robbery. Arriving soon after the Pussycat Dolls＊ 2005 hit Don＊t Cha, the similar sounding Mommy works as that song＊s serendipitous counterpoint. It＊s an overtly feminist polemic casting ※Mommy§ (※The definition of mommy is not a chick with kids / Mommy means the boss, the money-maker§) as a figure invested with power, allure, autonomy and fleshly abundance 每 like an ancient earth goddess channelled through a hip-hop track. Which stands as a neat enough summary of Elliott＊s presence, stature and achievements.																																											"
"his violent, high-energy Korean thriller springs to life in a neon-lit hallway. Its breathless, blood-splattered opening begins from a shooter＊s point of view (with a bodycam and a fisheye lens capturing much of the action), as they mow down the armed men who appear at every turn like avatars in a video game. When the shooter crashes into a full-body mirror, the image opens out and the assassin is revealed to be a young woman. Sook-hee (Ok-bin Kim) is eventually captured, though by the secret service rather than the police, before being retrained and refashioned (by way of plastic surgery) as one of their own.At two hours long, Byung-gil Jung＊s revengesploitation film is overstuffed and overcooked, lurching between melodrama, satire and kung fu grindhouse. At one point, the film turns into a K-drama style romcom, handsome, sensitive, devoted love interest and all (never mind the fact that he＊s also Sook-hee＊s handler, unbeknown to her). Not all of it comes together, but its balls-to-the-wall approach is riotous fun to behold, especially a climactic set piece involving apocalyptic rain, a bus, a machete and a self-driving car.

"um always moved like she had the eyes of passerbys on her, a trait typical of a former beauty queen. Hair only ever so slightly uplifted by a seasonal ocean wind and her arms casually tucked into her sleeves to shield from the cold, I chose to respond to her silhouette through the legerdemain of image as the sunset began its peak. It＊s tonalities remarking on the cloud-crossed skyline, forging itself across the ocean backdrop. The flash on the Canon T-50 my grandparents had loaned me clicked over. Brief inspections of the ISO settings matched the initial decision. I raised the glass to eye level and took the shot.In the past I＊ve attempted to write about these opening months of 2014 in a way that pays homage to their lucidity, in efforts to fully recapture those dazed moments of aftershock I experienced in the wake of a first break-up. But I cannot linger upon those devastating times. It is easier said than done to take on the mantle of bravery. Not only was it the first time I＊d had a boyfriend, but it was a relationship that almost killed me and left my body out on the road. Returning home every night in the aftermath of that separation continually left me feeling like something was caught in my throat. Like I was to blame for being stupid enough to stay with him despite everything.I remember my hateful self talk and, looking back, it makes me glad that I learned to be more gentle with myself over time. Like many people experiencing abusive relationships, the extent of the damage was unbeknown to me until way after it was finished and the stigma and accompanying silence of queerness (I wasn＊t out to my parents then) only made it more difficult to realise what had happened. During that period my mind was on rewind, tape strings whipping rapidly back into their sockets, all friction and radio static. Whole snatches of time feel suspiciously absent when I try to remember them.That evening with my mum down by the beach, where I encouraged her into being a subject, was one of those nights that affixed itself to my history so firmly that I can＊t possibly disentangle it. It burned itself in that way, I think, because of the camera 每 it＊s something I＊ve grown to be grateful for. We know that one of the effects of trauma is that memories often can＊t be stored or relied upon in the same way that they were previously. In Bessel van der Kolk＊s seminal book The Body Keeps the Score, he writes: I knew that my new hobby had, completely circumstantially, become my lifeline as I acclimated to this new me. It was like I was trying to interpret myself from across a great divide, using one of the only methods I had to do so. The images accumulated on my hard drive and Facebook photo albums, and I began to realise they created an external memory bank too, one to lean into, to survey and validate the sense that I was actually a real person existing within the world, engaging meaningfully with the people around me. John Berger notes that:I had the proof of actualisation in these intimate portraits of family and friends, staring down the lens, seeing each other in all of our clarity, and it let me re-order and re-prioritise these memories. It pinned me down firmly to my reality, made me feel like I was actually existing among my environment, and unstuck me from my worrying and lingering sense of dread. It was a textural tool that was ultimately salvational.In his book, van der Kolk reiterates that self-analytical story-telling as a means of building a personal narrative is something we must do in order to bring meaning and structure to our lives. We can hardly do that if we are in a constant state of detachment and fear, lacking the ability to draw upon our memories and feeling uncertain of their tangibility.The western interpretation of ※mindfulness§ places an unsteady weight on the responsibility of the individual 每 if you aren＊t following the right practices and if it isn＊t producing results for you, then you are the one who is broken, rather than it being the failure of a simplistic methodology that commercial mindfulness often proposes. One of the many tenets of traditional mindfulness is to produce an awareness and presence in our lives, to be actively within the world, something purportedly tarnished by a technocratic hyper-connected population uncomfortable with our feelings. Many traumatised people are at odds with this kind of vulnerability, and pathologically learn to dissociate as self-protection without realising it. Some wounds run deeper underground, those valleys of trauma that soothing music, deep breathing and peaceful visualisation that you learn in a counsellor＊s office cannot always fix. Mindfulness came to me in a more organic way 每 through the responsibility of photography. And by that token, a technique borne from a continually watchful eye, surveying and appreciating details in the landscape.Using old cameras means approaching the practice with an unlikely tenderness. It also means considering my shots with finesse. When you only have 24 of them to last you until your next roll, things become a bit less automatic. Taking photos of my friends and loved ones has provided me a curious sense of purpose while I work my shit out. It was hard not to be reminded of the support and love that bled from them and intertwined with my own condition, becoming clearly represented on matte paper as I made those realisations.

"emarkable things can be achieved by the British in the rain,§ announces Wild Beasts＊ Hayden Thorpe on day one of Festival No 6. Nestled in a far corner of Wales in the final splutter of summer, it is all but guaranteed to face testing weather, and last year that test was an extreme one 每 torrential downpours flooded the car park and stranded hundreds. This year, the organisers have taken stock, making structural changes and reducing the capacity, and though there are cascading downpours aplenty, the festival holds up.When it＊s visible through the deluges, the site is a remarkable thing indeed. With its backdrop of undulating hills and vast ocean, it spills out into the local village of Portmeirion, a bizarre, pastel-coloured collage of out-of-place fragments. A metal sheep hangs from a balcony; a golden Buddha sits in a baby-blue enclave; a giant chess board sprawls across the central village green. Though its designer, Sir Clough Williams-Ellis, was aiming to recreate a quaint Italian town, it looks more like a cartoon village come to life.The site＊s eccentricities are matched by a handful of events on the line-up. Charlotte Church＊s Pop Dungeon is an hour of operatically transformed pop covers with a sprinkling of perfectly judged curveballs 每 Willy Wonka＊s Pure Imagination glides into Sugababes＊ Overload as a Jefferson Airplane bass riff rumbles underneath. Sure, it＊s glorified karaoke, but boy, is it glorious. Then there＊s the Beatles parade, marking . Complete with enormous effigies and a brass band, it marches through town and on to the main stage, culminating in an infectious, frequently uncanny performance from the Bootleg Beatles.The headliners, meanwhile, become progressively more unhinged as the weekend progresses. Scottish post-rockers Mogwai provide an expansive, shoegazey soundscape that is beautiful to listen to 每 but given their music＊s cinematic scope, there＊s surprisingly little in the way of visuals.  put on a hyperactive show, where Kele Okereke＊s bouts of sardonic abuse 每 ※Come on you bougie fucks§ 每 just serve to fuel the crowd＊s enthusiasm. And there＊s a characteristically bonkers performance from Flaming Lips. With at least four costume changes, an inflatable robot, multicoloured hanging tentacles and a rideable unicorn, the whole thing could be unbearably gimmicky if it weren＊t for the strength of the band＊s strange, jittery psychedelic rock. ※We feel like we＊re in the exact place we should be,§ beams Wayne Coyne. The feeling＊s mutual.																																											"
"A unique collection of paintings by Durham miners, many made by men who spent their working lives underground and their nights painting on kitchen tables, in attics or garden sheds, will go on display in the first museum in the UK dedicated to such art. is being created in a former bank building on the marketplace in Bishop Auckland. It includes works by Norman Cornish, the most famous of the group, who left the pits at the urging of his wife to become a full-time artist and spent the rest of his life recording the small streets, shops and people of Spennymoor, where his studio is preserved in  at the town hall. There are also many works by Tom McGuinness, a miner until he was made redundant in the wave of pit closures in the 1980s, who earned enough money from his art to build a coveted indoor bathroom but then installed a printing press in the space instead. There are several paintings by Bob Olley, still painting at 77, who originally trained as a signwriter before working in a mine where the drift shafts stretched up to three miles under the sea. There is a print of the painting that has paid his bills for years, through copies and reproductions: , six men at a heavily graffitied urinal while one cheeky lad turns round to grin as he pees on the leg of his neighbour. When the painting was first exhibited, Olley＊s local council tried to have it banned. When a neighbour banged on his door to tell him that the urinal was being demolished, he rushed with friends to salvage it, and it has gone to the Beamish outdoor museum.The collection began when a man came into the Bishop Auckland library and asked the librarian Gillian Wales if he could put something on the noticeboard. ※He gave me a bit of paper which I unfolded, expecting to read about a community show or a charity jumble sale 每 and instead I was astonished to read that he was a painter, and his own work was going into an exhibition in London,§ she recalled. The man was Tom McGuinness. Later, in conversation with Bob McManners, a GP in the town, she discovered he was equally fascinated by McGuinness. The pair were so startled by the quality of his work, his knowledge and the seriousness with which he took his vocation 每 he hitched lifts to evening art classes after shifts and frequently walked miles home afterwards 每 that they bought a painting each. As they discovered more painters, including Cornish, they bought more and more pictures, began writing about the artists and set up their own imprint to publish the books.Wales and McManners＊ collection of more than 400 works, valued at more than ?600,000, has been transferred to a new trust, Gemini, and will be permanently displayed in the handsomely converted bank building.The mining art museum is the first in a string of developments in the town and its castle, the former palatial home of the prince bishops, once second in power only to the king. There will be a museum of Spanish art in another former bank on the marketplace, a new building for a museum of faith within the castle walls, a new restaurant within the restored walled gardens, and two derelict hotels brought back to life. All are intended to restore the fortunes of the town and its hinterland by attracting thousands of visitors and generating hundreds of jobs.The first museum opens next month, and the 29-metre viewing tower of a new visitor centre is already rising. The scale of the project is audacious, and the cost equally so: David Maddan, chief executive of the Auckland Castle Trust, said they had secured grants of ?11.4m from the Heritage Lottery Fund and a further ?10m from other private funders and grants, leaving a gap of around ?110m which Jonathan Ruffer, an investment banker, who launched the whole scheme by buying the castle and its contents, proposes to cover himself. ※He is very committed to it,§ Maddan said, with dry understatement.The mining paintings record working lives and a society in the pit towns that have almost vanished. Olley is delighted they are being collected in a permanent exhibition to keep the memory alive. He doesn＊t miss the dirty, dangerous work 每 a painting by Tom Lamb, Laar Coal, shows his own brother working in a seam barely the width of his shoulders 每 but he does miss the humour and camaraderie of the workforce.※It won＊t take long until all we have left is the paintings,§ Olley said. ※It＊s good that it went, but it went too quickly 每 in Germany they spent years training the workforce before closure; here they just turned the lights out.§ The Mining  Gallery will open in Bishops Auckland on 21 October 2017.

"No journalist likes to admit this, but I recently blew a scoop. Last month . I＊d planned to ask her about some of her upcoming roles 每 in films with titles such as ,  and  每 but before I could get there, Reid cut me off with what sounded like a well-practised wrap-up speech. That was fine; she＊d spent most of the interview revealing that she＊s been the victim of bullying, so it would have felt cruel to directly follow that up with a sneery ※Hey Tara, tell me about your dumb hedgehog movie§. But now Andy the Talking Hedgehog is one of the hottest films on the planet, and I＊m kicking myself a little.When  on Friday, the internet went nuts. That was partly because the poster featured a hedgehog, two cats, Dean Cain, Tara Reid＊s Twitter profile pic manipulated to look slightly more wholesome and an unattributed quote calling it ※a magical good time§. But it was also because the for the film read ※Tara Reid brings her Oscar award-winning prowess to this documentary about a hedgehog that Dean Cain farted on giving it the ability to talk. It＊s a fun-loving family movie that will for sure make you say ※WOWZA. That＊s a stinky fart!§＊ That summary, incidentally, was attributed to Scott Baio.Obviously, like the rest of the world, I desperately wanted to know the story behind Andy the Talking Hedgehog.

These include  (a film about a girl who wants a puppy, starring Dean Cain and Tara Reid),  (a film about a girl who wants a puppy, starring Dean Cain and Dustin Diamond), Amanda and the Fox (a film about a girl who wants a puppy, not starring Dean Cain), two different films about horses (only one of which stars Dean Cain) and A Parent＊s Worst Nightmare (a drama about child sex trafficking, starring Dean Cain).A Parent＊s Worst Nightmare formed my way into the machinations of Be Your Own Hollywood. Some light Googling revealed both , and , possibly because it offered the role of ※Dean Cain＊s wife§ as a reward for donations.The Indiegogo page was created by Joel Paul Reisig, the film＊s director. And it would appear that Reisig is the mastermind behind Be Your Own Hollywood. He＊s a 33-year-old self-taught Michigan native who writes, directs and produces an astonishing number of movies each year. He balances his film-making career with a series of . These workshops might also double as a story-finding scheme, since in 2012 he produced . According to IMDb, . He has not responded to requests for an interview.Aside from puppies and Dean Cain, the Be Your Own Hollywood films all have one thing in common; they＊re cheap genre movies churned out specifically to sell to cable channels and streaming services. They won＊t win any awards, but they presumably make money and form reliable work for a number of actors who might otherwise struggle. They＊re also produced in a very modern way 每 financed through crowdfunding, promoted through social media 每 that would have been unthinkable even a decade ago. Reisig saw an opening and went for it, and you can＊t deny him that.As for Andy the Talking Hedgehog, no release date has been announced. However, its spiritual cousin might be a real film that Reisig produced last year, entitled Arlo the Burping Pig. If  is any indication, Arlo the Burping Pig is about a pig that can burp so hard that peoples＊ hats fall off. If Andy the Talking Hedgehog is anything like Arlo the Burping Pig, you can pretty much count me in.																																											"
" second opera has hardly been seen in the UK since Scottish Opera commissioned it and gave the first performances in 1990. ＊s resourceful and very thoroughly rehearsed production of The Vanishing Bridegroom, directed by  and conducted by , is the first full staging here since that premiere.Its revival provides a reminder of how ingenious Weir＊s musical storytelling can be, and how her music can suddenly alight on moments of shining transcendence, even if narrative and characterisation are never fused completely convincingly. Sometimes, it seems as if the mechanics of presenting the narrative matter more to Weir than packaging it in a way that involves and rewards her audience.The Vanishing Bridegroom telescopes three Scottish folk tales, two from the Outer Hebrides, one from Sutherland, into a compact family saga, in which the protagonists themselves provide the links between the stories. The husband whose bride is returned to him in the first tale becomes the bridegroom who is spirited away by fairies in the second; his daughter is then the central character of the third, in which she resists the advances of a rich man who turns out to be the devil, and asserts her independence as a woman.It＊s all ingeniously dovetailed and packed into a single, 80-minute span, with a score in which references to Scottish folk music, psalm singing and work songs ghost through the textures. But despite the compactness there are moments when the dramatic pulse falters, and it＊s hard to remain engaged with characters who inhabit a world poised between realism and fairytale enchantment. Barker＊s production, in Andrew Riley＊s semi-naturalistic designs, keeps the action as lucid as it can be, but hearing more of the words might make the narrative easier to grasp, though Weir＊s solo vocal lines and the density of her choral writing don＊t always aid clarity.The student cast, all on the stage throughout the opera, work hard, and the best of the soloists make the most of the opportunities the multiple roles in the score prescribe. Standout contributions come from soprano as the bride in the first story, the bass Timothy Edlin in all three parts, and the mezzo , who takes the role of the daughter in the final story with immaculate diction and tremendous dramatic presence.

"There are no plans to introduce same-sex couples to , the BBC has said.The broadcaster was responding after contestant the Rev Richard Coles argued it made ※no sense§ that anyone would resist having dancers of the same gender taking to the floor together in the hit programme.Coles, who was one half of the 1980s band the Communards, is in a same-sex marriage and is among the 15 contestants taking part in this year＊s edition of Strictly Come Dancing, which started on Saturday.He has been paired to dance with Dianne Buswell, but told Digital Spy he had ※a discussion§ with bosses on the show about having same-sex couples taking part.Coles was speaking after fellow contestant Susan Calman, who is a lesbian, had been criticised on social media for not having a female professional partner.He told the website: ※We＊ve had a discussion about it, actually, and I don＊t know. It makes absolutely no sense that anybody resists the idea, in principle.※It＊s just a question of doing it. I think this year would be a good year to do it actually, with the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act (which decriminalised sex between two men aged more than 21).§A spokeswoman for the  said: ※Strictly has chosen the traditional format of mixed-sex couples and at the moment we have no plans to introduce same-sex couples in the competition.§Comedian Calman said she had considered dancing with a woman, but it was her choice to dance with a man.She said: ※I did think about dancing with a woman, but from the very first moment when I was asked about the show I said I wanted to dance with a man.§Speaking about comments made on social media, she said: ※People can criticise me all they want, but I＊ve worked tirelessly for LGBT equality my whole life and right now I would like to dance and bring entertainment to people by dancing on a Saturday night.※Dancing＊s not necessarily about sex; it＊s acting. When I do a sexy tango with my partner I＊ll be acting and, fundamentally, I＊ve watched the show for years and I want to learn how to dance.§ 																																											"
" is an unusual, intimidating and thought-provoking show by dreamthinkspeak, a remarkable company founded by Tristan Sharps, whose site-specific work has ranged from a Moscow paper factory to a Clerkenwell abattoir and is now to be found in an office block and car park in central Hull in its city of culture year. We take a lift up to a floor populated by smartly dressed Koreans in lime green and grey uniforms with corporate smiles. Each audience member is issued with a K-pad (K for Kasang, the name of a global technology company, which means ※virtual§ in Korean). It is the 30th anniversary of the Korean Sixth Republic and we are to experience ※the future of retail§, play an ※immersive video game§ and ※much, much more§. It is the ※much, much more§ about which one needs to be mindful.What follows is South Korean time travel 每 into the future and past 每 dazzlingly performed by a 30-strong Korean cast. The show interrogates technological progress (in English and fast-forward Korean), showing it to be an exciting but potentially amnesiac diversion. In our buy-it-now present, it might seem that history never happened. The show contrasts fevered consumerism with political unrest, reminding us of the 1980 democratic uprising in Gwangju, where hundreds were massacred. Revenant students walk among us and a sinister news clip reveals us that Chun Doo-hwan, army general, and former president Roh Tae-woo, involved in the massacre, are now out of jail. The show is technically miraculous but it is the final, low-tech image that makes it a memorial. In a huge conference room, a small candle burns on every empty chair, ending a long evening＊s journey into light.																																											"
"s the audience arrive, I wait on stage in an open coffin. This is obviously rather eerie but I like listening to the people come in. With my eyes shut, it＊s quite restful. Thankfully I haven＊t fallen asleep yet. Starting the play this way is such a contrast to most roles. But then, this isn＊t your usual role.In , I＊m playing a corpse. Mrs McLeavy is her name, and she＊s at the centre of a bank robbery involving her son, a fellow thief, her husband and a nurse. When the play was first performed, the  insisted that a mannequin be used as the corpse, rather than casting an actor. We＊re presenting the play as Orton intended, .In this role, everything is done  you. Mrs McLeavy is variously dragged out of her coffin, undressed, wrapped in a sheet, left under a bed, thrown over shoulders and stuffed inside a cupboard. I thought that at that point, out of view of the audience, I＊d be able to go off and have a cup of tea while they get on with the play. But, no, I stay in the cupboard 每 although not upside down, I do manage to right myself. I＊m often left in the arms of these two wonderful young actors, Sam Frenchum and Calvin Demba, who play the thieves. It must be a bit like throwing your grandma around but they＊ve taken it very seriously, asking me after each performance how it went. Playing a corpse is challenging for me, but it affects the other actors too; it＊s been a learning experience for all of us. As the corpse, you need to remain completely still while the energy of the farce swirls around you. I＊m not so much worried about having an itch or a coughing fit 每 although thankfully no one＊s had a cold yet 每 but I do fear that I might react instinctively to something. The other day a handbag was thrown on the stage, hitting my leg. If it had been my head I might have reacted involuntarily and spoiled the scene. It was an absolutely ludicrous audition. The director, Michael Fentiman, picked me up in a big bear hug and I tried to be limp. We did some physical exercises and I had to fall forwards and he caught me but left it until the last minute. I just had six days to rehearse. Before I joined the rest of the cast they were using a cushion. As an older actor, I＊m very careful about exercising. I try to keep as limber as possible and perform a set of yoga-type exercises before each show. Afterwards, I walk home from the theatre and it＊s nice to stretch my legs again. Being wrapped up in the sheet is a bit of a challenge. In rehearsals, we tried a thicker sheet which left me almost hyperventilating, so we ended up using a thinner one. I＊ve never felt so vulnerable, especially in the scene when I＊m undressed. I＊ve never been undressed on stage before so it＊s doubly strange.Joe Orton was . My parents went to see Loot when it was first on, and I can still remember how shocking it was to learn about his murder in the 60s. Weirdly, this is the second time I＊ve played the corpse. I played Mrs McLeavy when we did a scene from the play at drama school. So you could say she＊s haunting me. 																																											"
" begins on Saturday, and this year＊s lineup is ready to go. One will win. Others will lose. Some will be bad but popular, and find themselves at the centre of a heaving maelstrom of criticism that will embarrass everyone when viewed with any amount of perspective. All will have left their partners by next Easter. Still, let＊s rank this year＊s Strictly crop in reverse order of perceived ability.Simon Rimmer is a blokey cook and best pals with Tim Lovejoy. Realistically, this means that his dancing ability cannot extend beyond biting his lip and nodding his head to the version of Speakeasy that Shed Seven rewrote for the defunct mobile phone retailer The Link in 1999. His time on Strictly will be mercifully brief.Aston Merrygold is probably the most accomplished dancer in this year＊s lineup. He is absurdly fit and has bags of energy to spare. He＊s a likeable presence, and his utter commitment to any challenge is largely what made JLS such a success. In any other show, he＊d walk it. So why won＊t he win Strictly? Oh, don＊t make me say it. . Joe McFadden is apparently a Holby City cast member. Does Strictly traditionally use Holby City cast members as crude filler figures whenever it fails to book a more famous contestant? Yes. Will this be reflected in McFadden＊s results? Yes.Two Holby City cast members this year. Honestly, it＊s almost like actual celebrities are reluctant to appear on a TV show where they＊ll definitely end up getting caught cheating on their spouses.Brian Conley is the Avatar of light entertainers; he used to be a megastar, but nobody missed him when he went away. Strictly will either return him to his lofty status of old, or expedite his plunge towards total obscurity. Fun fact for millennials: if Conley talks about puppets a lot, it＊s because his catchphrase used to be pointing at a puppet and saying ※it＊s a puppet§.Frankie Bridge used to be in the Saturdays, and made the Strictly final in 2014. Rochelle Humes used to be in the Saturdays, and came last in the 2013 Strictly Christmas special. Using maths, I can deduce that Mollie King, who was also in the Saturdays, will come somewhere between these two.Every year, Strictly offers up one unexpected disappointment; a beautiful, athletic-looking contestant who magically transforms into a sack of potatoes on the dancefloor. This year, my money is on Ghadami to be that disappointment. The man is enormous 每 so enormous that sometimes it feels like an entire EastEnders department has been hired to think up reasons for him to take his top off 每 but his bulk might make him too inflexible to impress.Jonnie Peacock is going to enjoy enormous support from the public in the coming weeks. He＊s a Paralympian, so he＊s already at a big physical disadvantage. But he＊s fit and he＊s funny, and everyone will be rooting for him. Appearing on Dancing with the Stars temporarily made people like Heather Mills, for crying out loud, so getting people onboard should be a cakewalk for Peacock.Susan Calman is close to being a national treasure, and her time on Strictly 每 however long it lasts 每 should push her over the edge. The only thing that can stop her is if her studiously unthreatening persona somehow cracks under the pressure and she ends up losing it and bludgeoning a cameraman with a brick. This, however, is unlikely.Debbie McGee might not be much of a dancer 每 we just don＊t know yet 每 but expect her to do well. The woman spent her entire life playing second fiddle to her husband, then she suffered the tragedy of losing him, and now she＊s primarily being billed in the media as ※magician＊s widow§. The woman deserves a break.This is an unproved theory, but I think Gemma Atkinson might genuinely be a Terminator. She＊s conservatively 90% six-pack, I cannot ever remember hearing her speak even though she＊s an actor by profession and, of all this year＊s contestants, she is the one I can most vividly picture clawing her way up the boot of a speeding police car with a look of blank determination on her face. She must do well. Skynet demands it.Alexandra Burke is going to be on Strictly? OK dot com. Alexandra Burke has proven to be an athletic performer, both on the X Factor and in her subsequent career? OK dot com. Alexandra Burke should realistically be seen as a frontrunner in the competition? OK dot com. And yet, despite this, will she plunge out of the competition in the semi-finals because there＊s something intangibly weird about her? .Charlotte Hawkins is tougher than she looks. She＊s spent countless early starts on Good Morning Britain listening to Piers Morgan spit and judder like an overfilled kettle, and to my knowledge she hasn＊t punched him in the face once. This takes colossal willpower and, if she can transfer even a tenth of this to her Strictly training, she＊ll do incredibly well. On paper, as an older contestant who doesn＊t appear to be in tremendous physical shape, Coles looks most like this year＊s Ann Widdecombe. However, here＊s what I keep coming back to: he used to be in The Communards. Listen to their version of  and tell me that anyone responsible can＊t be anything but an absolute monster on the dancefloor. This year＊s dark horse.You can feel it: the world is willing Ruth Langsford to win. It＊s seen her quietly sigh and roll her eyes whenever Eamonn Holmes says anything stupid or boorish on TV, and it feels for her. It knows that Strictly is her only escape route from this hellpit of misery, and it desperately wants her to break away. And if she can do it by jeopardising her marriage by sleeping with her partner, even better. 																																											"

It is 10 years since the book was published and now boys go to school in dresses as Dennis from The Boy in the Dress for World Book Day. So I think we are heading in the right direction, to a world where being different can be celebrated.§The Boy in the Dress, , was also adapted into a film by BBC1 three years ago.In a statement to , Aldi said that it had ※no intention of removing The Boy in the Dress from sale§.※The book tells the story of freedom of expression and tolerance,§ it said. ※This forms part of a range from David Walliams, the third biggest children＊s book author in Australia, and is available throughout a number of major retailers.§																																											"
"ith their 2015 debut album , Malija staked a big claim to being one of the front-running European acoustic trios with as much understanding of receptive listening as conversational playing. Polar Bear and Loose Tubes saxophonist  remains the foreground voice, pianist Liam Noble and double bassist  the attentive contrapuntal shadows who also stretch the music improvisationally way beyond its economically composed, scene-shifting hooks. The tonally refined Lockheart makes a handful of notes go a long way, floating conspiratorially murmuring tenor sounds over staccato piano and bass vamps (Kindred Spirit), noirish deep-sax prowlings on softly rocking hooks (Hung Up), and Wayne Shorteresque soprano musings against springy bass motifs that wrestle with jostling sub-themes (Mila). It＊s a beautifully played and often very spontaneous three-way postbop/world-folk conversation, though the grippingly smoky tenor-sax dreamwalk Sanctuary, with its long tones, briefly flickering fills and minimally moving piano support, emphasises by contrast how unsettlingly restless some of Malija＊s current thematic characters can be.

" is a  whose first film, , was the first ever made about Islam and homosexuality. It made him the subject of death threats throughout the Arab world.Nevertheless, the power of his faith and his curiosity as a journalist propelled him to take the  pilgrimage of to Saudi Arabia 每  每 even though he knew if he was identified at the border his punishment would almost certainly be a beheading.※Immense faith had brought me here,§ he writes. ※I was obeying my highest calling as a Muslim.§ Somehow, the name on his Indian passport did not set off any alarm bells. The result is the first book about the  from a gay perspective, written by a man with a deep knowledge of Islamic history. This pilgrimage is the centerpiece of his book, and he recounts it with courage and fierce emotion.Part of Sharma＊s compulsion to find his spiritual salvation at Mecca was a need to prove to himself that despite his sexual orientation, he was still holy enough to be worthy of this journey. It was far from a casual decision. As a child, a medical issue prevented him from having the required circumcision. To reduce one major risk during his pilgrimage, when he would be forced to wear an ihram, two seamless pieces of white cloth with no underwear, he had to have the operation as an adult. He writes: ※In my nightmares, my ihram would fall off in Mecca, subjecting unsuspecting pilgrims to my un-Muslim penis.§ His grandfather had told him how after the partition of India and Pakistan, his two best friends were stripped and identified as Muslim by their genitals. They were then hacked to death.Sharma＊s struggle to reconcile his faith with his sexual orientation leads him on a search for the essential humanity of the prophet Muhammad. ※Scholars learn to question faith,§ he writes, ※while believers just accept it. My adult self seemed to possess both abilities.§ He argues convincingly that the version of Islam promoted by Isis comes directly from Saudi Arabia＊s  and that both represent a terrible corruption of the original intent of his religion. He also believes that without Wahhabi indoctrination, there could not have been a 9/11 每 because it had been taught to 15 of the hijackers. The black flag used by Isis (which Sharma calls Daesh) ※is dangerously painting all of  with the color black, and saying the faith is monolithic, intolerant and violent§. Centuries of Islamic thought has actually ※appealed to mortal rationality. But there is no rationality for the Al Saud or Daesh§.Sharma believes Muhammad ※was a man of skill, wisdom and moderation ＃ He did not believe in harm. His lifetime was a time of respect for the other monotheisms ＃ Jews and Christians were not hated 每 they were to be respected as ＆people of the book＊.§The author says that America＊s ※unquenchable§ thirst for oil had made it ignore the fact that the Saudis have spent at least $10bn promoting the warped Wahhabi ideology. A report from the European Union said Wahhabi groups in the Middle East were closely involved in the ※support and supply of arms to rebel groups around the world§. Sharma says it＊s like ※a PayPal for ＃ jihad§. ※What did [the Saudis] do? They took Muslims of diverse traditions within Islam that are exceptionally moderate, like South Asian Sufi-enriched Islam, and flew in Wahhabi imams to preach intolerance.§Sharma＊s pilgrimage to Mecca included a hallucinatory reunion with his dead mother, whose shame over his homosexuality was something he was trying to exorcise. In the end he was successful, writing: ※It was a life-transforming journey because in Mecca I killed the part of me that questioned whether Islam would accept me. In its place was the certainty that it was up to me to accept Islam.§He believes Europe ※really needs to win the ideological battle with Wahhabi Islam§ and if it can, he has this dream for posterity: ※Will Muhammad still be a force to reckon with 14 centuries from now? Probably.※Will Daesh and their Wahhabi masters be mere footnotes? Hopefully.§																																											"
"Brisbane＊s grimy entertainment district, Fortitude Valley, is home to a slew of live music venues, bars and clubs 每 and each year, the Australian music industry descends for annual conference Bigsound.Tagging itself as a global gathering of musicians, media, brands and music lovers, Bigsound is at once a showcase for local talent, and a forum for discussion about an industry that＊s in a constant state of flux. And two of the big issues on the table this year revolved around gender: sexual assault and antisocial behaviour at festivals and in live music venues; and gender equality and diversity within the industry itself.The former issue was brought to the fore recently via  at the Tasmanian leg of Falls festival. Helen Marcou, co-owner of Melbourne＊s Bakehouse Studios, chaired a panel that argued for preventative, rather than reactive, measures. Marcou is a co-founder of , an initiative launched in Melbourne in July and heavily backed by industry heavyweights, which aims to curb sexual assault, violence and discrimination at live music events by making promoters, venue owners, artists and managers aware of the issue; and by giving them the tools and information they need to stop toxic behaviour. As Marcou＊s fellow panellist and PR head Stacey Piggott said, the only way culture will change is if people within the industry talk to each other about it: ※The conversations need to be peer to peer,§ she said.The issue of gender equality was also on the table. In late July, the , which assessed the state of gender representation in the industry. It found that women were poorly represented across festival lineups and industry boards; on stages and backstage.The same week, industry copyright licensing body APRA/AMCOS  which found that female members share in only 10% of the total royalty pool, and that more women are represented in cricket than songwriting in this country. To many, these statistics come as no surprise.※We＊ve acknowledged there＊s a problem; this is about how to deal with it,§ Leanne de Souza said. De Souza is the executive director for the Association of Artist Managers, but also runs Facebook group MEGA (Music Equity Group for Action), advocating for a more inclusive industry.※I think the conversation around gender equity has been so focussed on calling it out that we＊re over it, women who＊ve been working in the industry now for 20, 25 years are tired of that,§ she tells me later. ※We＊ve heard those stories, so now it＊s time to turn the narrative 每 what＊s working?§As a result of the research undertaken by RMIT, APRA/AMCOS  over the next three years. From October, the body will invest each year in the mentoring of female artists across a range of genres; and they have called for the entire industry to take action and eradicate gender disparity.※So now there＊s this energy for change,§ de Souza said, ※and there are some great things happening. There＊s the Listen movement, safe spaces, there are youth mentoring services 每 there＊s all this good stuff.§, based in Melbourne, is a diverse and inclusive feminist music collective whose focus is on giving a voice to minorities in the industry. It＊s co-organised by Elspeth Scrine, who spoke on two panels at Bigsound and whose flyers could be found at venues across the Valley: ※Top 5 Cop Outs For Booking A Lineup That Is Not Diverse§ read one 每 no doubt a direct response to the Days Like This festival  in March.Other fliers listed simple things everyone could do to make for a more inclusive industry: respect people＊s pronouns; avoid reducing an artist to one part of their identity, like their gender; make sure your workplace has toilets that everyone can use.They are deliberately easy ways to rebalance an industry that for decades has been seen as a boy＊s club; a recent study by Triple J program Hack  within the majority of aspects of Australian music. ※It＊s about individual accountability,§ said de Souza. ※There＊s a sense in the industry that we＊re moving towards a positive focus.§																																											"
"f graphic design can save your life, it is eminently capable of killing you, too. That＊s the conflicted message at the heart of a powerful new exhibition at the , which explores graphic design＊s complex relationship with health, medicine, and the world of big pharma 每 and the different ethical positions that designers choose to take.The show opens with a hard-hitting section on , where creatives＊ seductive and lucrative attempts at selling tobacco over the years are paired with their equally clever efforts to encourage people to kick the habit. We find the  每 reproduced on T-shirts and baseball caps 每 alongside the Silk Cut campaign masterminded by Charles Saatchi in the early 1990s. The glossy billboards, featuring luscious photographs of skeins of purple silk being slashed and sliced, were an ingenious response to the growing constraints on tobacco advertising, which explicitly prohibited the naming of brands. Instead, the increasingly  offered a reward to the cognoscenti capable of deciphering the coded message. Silk Cut sales soared, their loyal customers enticed by the prospect of collecting the artworks as miniature cards along the way.By contrast, we are then shown the result of market research agency GfK＊s quest to find ※the ugliest colour possible§ with which to wrap Australia＊s new plain cigarette packets, following the government＊s 2012 ruling prohibiting the branded packaging of tobacco. They settled on  每 AKA ※opaque couch谷§ 每 a queasy shade of greenish brown. The muddy hue is now used to cover the 25% of the packet not already taken up with gory photos of tar-addled lungs and rotting gums. It seems to have had the desired effect. An Australian government report estimated that the number of smokers fell by more than 100,000 in the three years following the introduction of the new .The World  Organisation has called on every government to take up the plain packaging pledge, thereby firmly cementing the role of graphic design as a key battleground in the war on smoking. Design sells, but it can equally put you off picking up a cancer stick ever again.The exhibition is full of other examples of the provocative power of graphics in ramming public health messages home, from the famous  Aids awareness campaign 每 which saw every UK household leafleted with a mock tombstone in the 1980s, to the , designed to encourage organ donation in Scotland. Presenting viewers with the choice of killing someone, by deciding whether or not to sign up as a donor, the campaign was subject to a litany of complaints. But the shock tactic paid off: donor registration surged by 300%.The sensationalism is stirring, but the show also demonstrates graphic designers＊ capacity to inform and explain with subtlety and sophistication. The section on hospitals includes a  aimed at reducing violence caused by frustration due to unexplained delays in accident and emergency departments. The designers installed a series of clear information panels throughout A&E areas, explaining every stage of the process, from the waiting room to triage and consultation, that also provided live waiting times. Following a one-year trial, violent incidents fell by 50%.A similar no-brainer solution comes in the form of the ※§ developed by designers  in the 1980s. As colour-coded charts of simple pictograms, the cards allow patients to communicate with doctors, identifying the type of pain, its location and severity, without requiring spoken language. First introduced in New York, they are in use in 150 hospitals across North America.If the ability of graphic design to transcend language barriers is the overarching theme, it is particularly evident in the section on the rise of the big pharma companies, driven by the need to differentiate their brands with a strong visual identity. We see the brand development of Bayer, whose circular logo could be easily stamped on its aspirin pills, and the beautiful packaging of Swiss pharma giant Geigy, who commissioned leading designers of the 1950s and 60s to design sleek abstract graphics for their drugs 每 which might tempt you to become a junkie from the boxes alone. On the package of Petrofran, for ※rapid resolution of depressive states§, a ball and chain runs around the box. The chain links are triumphantly broken when a perforated strip around the middle of the package is torn open.Ultimately, it is fitting that the exhibition should be held here in the Wellcome Collection, given that  每 whose company first patented the ※tabloid§, or tablet, in the 1880s 每 was one of the most savvy marketers of them all. Hailing from a sales background, he was the first to establish the practice of direct marketing to doctors. From 1890, he also started giving out branded appointment diaries as promotional gifts, beginning the cosy practice of pharmaceutical companies showering medical practitioners with merchandise 每 which has helped to keep the drugs giants, and their designers, in business ever since. Can Graphic Design Save Your Life? is at , London, until 14 January. 																																											"
"here is something almost unbearable in this film＊s tension and claustrophobia, a brutally tough drama from writer-director Philippe Van Leeuw. The scene is a crowded apartment in the Syrian capital Damascus, in which a family is barricaded, effectively imprisoned by the civil war outside. Food and water are running out in this small space. Hiam Abbass plays Yazan, the stern matriarch who through sheer force of will is keeping things together. Her husband has gone for help; she must keep in line her two daughters and son, her elderly father-in-law and also a couple staying with them, who are planning an escape. Then something tragic happens that has to be kept secret from the rest of the family, known only to Yazan and her maidservant Delhani (Juliette Navis).It is an absorbing drama, but I felt that it spoiled its own sense of tension and jeopardy with something of a cop-out ending. Yet there can＊t be any doubt about the strength and charisma of Abbass＊s performance, and that of Diamand Bou Abboud, who plays the young mother, Halima.																																											"
"The  director, Tristram Hunt, has said the museum was ※honoured§ to have the financial support of the billionaire supporter of Donald Trump Len Blavatnik, and welcomed it from donors of ※all political views and no political views§.Hunt on Wednesday launched the museum＊s annual review, announcing exhibitions on a diverse range of subjects including Frida Kahlo, video games, and the environmental impact of fashion.He was speaking in the recently opened Blavatnik Hall, an entrance named after the Ukraine-born businessman in recognition of .Blavatnik, one of Britain＊s richest men, is in the spotlight  because of a $1m donation to Trump＊s inauguration committee.But Hunt said the V&A had no such qualms. ※I am very honoured that [Blavatnik] supports this development ＃ he is a supporter of arts and culture across the UK and across the world.※We regard him as a very generous patron and supporter of the arts and what his political views are 每 that＊s a question for him. In terms of the support for arts and culture we are just very grateful for his support.§Hunt, a historian and former Labour politician who was appointed V&A director this year, said a donor＊s politics were not a concern. Blavatnik, the owner of Warner Music Group, was knighted this year for his philanthropy. He has been a regular donor to arts and culture projects in the UK. As well as the money he gave to the V&A, Blavatnik donated . It ranks as the biggest financial donation to a UK museum and .At Oxford he gave ?75m to set up the Blavatnik school of government,  that said the university ※should stop selling its reputation and prestige to Putin＊s associates§.Rothstein said he had received hundreds of messages of support after resigning his Oxford professorship in protest at Blavatnik giving money to Trump＊s inauguration. In his resignation letter he wrote: ※President Trump stands for a system of governing that is completely contrary to what I have come to define as ＆quality of government＊.§Blavatnik denies donating to Trump. Instead the money was to the committee that had been responsible for organising US presidential inaugurations since 1901.He also denies being an associate of Putin and has stated that he has had no personal contact with the Russian leader since 2000. Hunt, who has not met Blavatnik, said the businessman＊s money was welcome and had helped fund , the museum＊s largest architectural innovation in more than 100 years, providing the new entrance and a new temporary exhibition space, the Sainsbury Gallery.In 2018 the gallery will be used for a major exhibition called The Future Starts Here, exploring how design is ※shaping the world of tomorrow§ whether through smart appliances, satellites or artificial intelligence.The V&A＊s big autumn show will be on video games, said Hunt, describing it as ※the first in the world to fully consider the complexity of video games as one of the most important design fields of our time§.There will be large immersive multimedia installations, as well as the opportunity to play.Hunt said the V&A was the ideal home for video games. ※We are very happy to have them in the same building as Donatellos, Botticellis, Christopher Dressers and Constables and Turners. One of the challenges for the V&A is to get people to think differently about what they might not respect enough visually.§The V&A has long been known for the diversity of its exhibition programme and that continues in 2018 with a show on the environmental nature of fashion, sponsored by the ; the first exhibition outside Mexico of clothing and personal possessions of Frida Kahlo, which were discovered in 2004 in sealed cupboards and storerooms; and previously announced shows on Winnie-the-Pooh and .

"t has been  operas, two of them so far 每 including the widely admired Breaking the Waves, based upon  每 that have established her reputation in the US. The New York-based Mazzoli is still largely an unknown quantity in the UK, but  concert with the BBC Symphony Orchestra opened with the first European performance of the orchestral version of Sinfonia (for Orbiting Spheres), which Mazzoli composed four years ago, and turned into a work for full orchestra last year.The title and subtitle hark back both to the baroque sinfonia, and to the idea of using the model of the solar system, with its different orbits and periodicities, as a starting point for the music. The shifting layers of Mazzoli＊s Sinfonia are assembled from short loops of material that coalesce into longer ones and rotate at different speeds, though the overall effect is more about texture than rhythm or pulse.In the hall at least, the melodica and the multiple harmonicas that Mazzoli smuggles into her orchestra did not blur the harmonies and simulate the wheezing sound of a medieval hurdy gurdy (once called a ※sinfonia§) as she intended. Listening later to the BBC broadcast gave a better sense of what the effect should have been, though perhaps something was lost when the piece was scaled up to orchestral proportions. The result still seemed strangely inconsequential, as if this 12-minute movement is merely a beginning, the mysterious prelude to something weightier to come.There were balance problems too in Bart車k＊s Second Piano Concerto, where  dazzling virtuosity often seemed to be obscured by even the most modest orchestral writing 每 more to do with the directions taken by the sound from a concert grand and the acoustic eccentricities of the Albert Hall than the performances from the pianist or the BBCSO, I＊m sure. Once again, there were no such difficulties in the broadcast, when the wit and delicacy of Denk＊s playing, both in the concerto and in the movement of a Mozart piano sonata (K545) he added as an encore, could be fully appreciated.Canellakis and the orchestra provided a crisp, efficent accompaniment to the concerto, and their performance of Dvo?芍k＊s Eighth Symphony was equally efficient, if not especially characterful: there＊s more to this symphony than guileless melodic invention, but none of those darker, angrier undercurrents were touched upon here.

"ou will find it hard not to be amazed, and impossible not to be moved, by the indomitable spirit that drives this memoir. Though dealt a terrible hand in her middle years,  remains so utterly without self-pity, so brimful of stoicism and courage, that at times she comes across like the heroine of a great novel. Memoirs, especially writers＊ memoirs, are often the occasion for score-settling, an excuse to produce that dish best served cold, yet even in the face of mighty provocation, this writer transcends petulance and piety. Such is her restraint, indeed, that the reader may feel occasionally chastened by the high-mindedness of it all.It is, I should add, a hugely entertaining book. Having read her work, I expected the biographer＊s lightness of touch, instinctive sympathy and eye for the killer detail; here those attributes are enlivened by a story she knows better than anyone else＊s. Born of artistic middle-class parents 每 her father a French rationalist, her mother a Christian Scientist from Liverpool 每 she had a childhood disrupted by the war and haunted by a distinct perception: ※As soon as I was aware of anything I knew my father disliked me.§ Her parents＊ marriage was gothically wretched. She was conceived on a holiday in Cornwall on the same day her father had ※thought seriously§ of killing her mother. Again, it sounds as if it should be in a novel. They separated when she was eight, in 1941.Intellectually speaking, her stockings were always of the finest blue worsted. She grew up in a home full of books and music 每 opera became a lifelong passion 每 and from an early age consumed art with terrifying enthusiasm. Educated at the French Lyc谷e in Kensington, she was reading JE Neale＊s life of Queen Elizabeth and ※turning out sonnets by the dozen§. For her 13th birthday she asked her mother for the two-volume . ※I longed to become an adult,§ she recalls. This book gives a clear picture of Tomalin as a young woman: bright, curious, affectionate, a bit of a show-off and, like many women of her class and generation, quite unworldly. Sensible enough to have dodged the ageing mentor who had explained sex to her as ※just like going to the lavatory§, she was less fortunate in falling for Nick Tomalin, a dashing fellow student at Cambridge who came from an erudite, bohemian family like her own. They married, against her better instincts, and raised a family in the newly resurgent Camden Town of the 1960s.A tension in Tomalin＊s character becomes apparent. She is clear-sighted and remarkably lacks sourness in her account of Nick, whose multiple infidelities and defections left her and her young children in a state of miserable uncertainty. Partly in retaliation, partly in keeping with the times, she embarked on an affair of her own with ※a clever and likable journalist§. When the philandering husband hears of this he throws a punch at her, which she ducks. But what we really want to know is the man＊s name, not the scene＊s affinity to  (※he will not allow the countess any equivalent freedom§). Tomalin＊s reticence is presumably a courtesy to people still living; to the reader, alas, it is maddening. Later, when books editor of the New Statesman, she is wooed by a ※brilliant and witty colleague§, also married. Her refusal to spill his name forces her into locutions (※my lover rang me§) that sound old-fashioned and coy 每 surely not her intention. Later still, at the Sunday Times, a malicious colleague tries to stitch her up in a spat with  at Private Eye. Who, for heaven＊s sake?She exercises a discretion on her private life she would never dream of conceding to her biographical subjects. (I kept thinking of her elucidation of Dickens＊s mislaid 1867 diary in her superb life of Nelly Ternan, ).On the other hand, her restraint in dealing with the twin tragedies of her life, seven years apart, is moving. In October 1973 Nick Tomalin, reporting on the Yom Kippur war, was killed on the Golan Heights by a Syrian missile. She recounts the shock of his death, for herself, her family, colleagues, with a tenderness that feels raw even today: ※It felt as though the sun had been eclipsed.§ She grieved for Nick 每 the charmer, the chancer, the fearless journalist 每 yet she also felt released in some way. She knew she had her own life to make: ※I was already standing alone, and not afraid.§ Her first book, , appeared the following year, and she plunged right into the thick of literary London, reviewing, editing, even finding the time for an affair with  (※I succumbed to the charm of his smoker＊s voice§). The love of her daughters and her son Tom, born with spina bifida, sustained her. Men were constantly offering themselves as protectors and domestic helpmeets. I would have liked to know the story of how Michael Frayn, a shadowy presence here, became her soulmate and second husband, but again, she isn＊t telling.All seemed to be well until she was blindsided by another bolt from nowhere. Her middle daughter, Susanna, a bright and high-spirited girl, fell prey to ※a cruel and inexplicable blackness§ whose warnings neither her mother nor the medical profession sufficiently heeded. She made several attempts on her own life, and finally succeeded in August 1980. Again, sorrowful acceptance of her lot is Tomalin＊s keynote. ※I should have protected her, and I failed,§ she writes, concluding a fine and affecting account of her daughter＊s short life. The bough creaks, and bends; somehow it does not break. ※Work has to be the healer§ 每 the joyful work of life-writing and, in the disputatious 1980s, a final stint in journalism as literary editor of the Sunday Times, first under Harold Evans, later under the celebrity-chasing aegis of . It＊s a farewell to the old Fleet Street spirit as Rupert Murdoch outwits the print unions after moving his papers to Wapping.I loved the way the book＊s closing chapter belatedly back circles to its beginning via her posthumous discovery of songs in a manuscript written by her mother, not just a talented pianist but an accomplished composer. ※How hard she had worked, and how well.§ With her father, who lived much longer, she became reconciled, though when he published in his own memoir the atrocious story of her conception she never challenged him: ※I cannot explain why I failed to.§ Perhaps this is simply the way she has learned to survive, and what looks like a blind spot to some readers will strike others as majestic decorum. That Tomalin knows who she is seems to have made it easy for her to understand others. Aged 84 now, she wants to follow the example of her longest-lived subject, Thomas Hardy, and keep writing to the end. She intends to begin another book after this. I can＊t wait for it.

" (, ) goes for the grey pound once again with this well-meaning tale of the unlikely intergenerational friendship between Queen Victoria (Judi Dench, regal as ever and clearly having a blast) and an Indian servant named Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal). Abdul is ※the tallest man here§ and so is shipped from Agra to England to present Her Majesty with a ceremonial coin in celebration of the golden jubilee. ※I thought the tall one was terribly handsome,§ says the Queen, and so Abdul is promoted from bearer of wobbling royal jellies (the symbolism isn＊t lost on me) to her personal footman and, eventually, her ※munshi§ or spiritual guide.Dench＊s Victoria learns ※Indian§ (Urdu is deemed more queenly than ※Hindustani§), while an enthusiastic Abdul teaches her about the joys of mangoes and the spiritual significance of carpets. (※Life is like a carpet; we weave in and out to make a pattern,§ he says.) ※She＊ll be wearing a burqa next,§ mutters Lord Salisbury (Michael Gambon).Dench is captivating as the cantankerous queen, but Fazal isn＊t able to flesh out Abdul, who is thinly sketched on the page.

This kind of historical revisionism is a stretch that, at best, works as a cute royalist fantasy and, at worst, dresses up its endorsement of colonialism and empire as something progressive.

"(BBC1) | (Sky Atlantic/Now TV) | (ITV) | (ITV) | (C4) | (BBC2) | Alan Ayckbourn, writing about creating what might be termed cerebral farce, once ventured that it ※explores the extreme reaches of tlhe credible and the likely, and proceeds by its own immaculate internal logic, [to leave] the audience wondering how on earth they came to be where they are now§. Something similar is happening back in Parminster, two short years on, where a similarly skilled craftsman, , is retethering the guy ropes of credibility with the return of for a .It started with a light heart. Suranne Jones＊s Dr Gemma Foster, the 2015 poster lass for wronged wives everywhere, was managing her own medical practice and getting on spiffingly with her son Tom, the only shadow being the imminent return of , his twentysomething bride and their new brat. Still, lightness＃ Dr Gemma asked son Tom to take new bride Kate a present, and he asked, pithily, ※Is it a bomb?§, all smiles. Even when neighbour Chris begged her, ※Please ＃ don＊t make a scene! Gemma!§ at Cheat Simon＊s homecoming/wedding party, there was a certain airiness of touch. At least, for those who had somehow managed to forget the last soiree over which Chris had presided, a magma meltdown of revenge and spat secrets to rival the last reel of , if not the last act of .It was only upstairs, fuelled by wine and industrial levels of passive-aggressive goading by smug Simon and his smug new wife, that we really began to see the Gemma of old. The skull beneath the skin, yes, but also the intelligence, and the sexiness, and the cynical calculations of the doctor＊s brain, quietly spinning, working out whether, in fact, squirrelly Simon had in fact suffered enough, breezing back with his mimsily pretty missus to a home town wreathed in forgetfulness and forgiveness: and concluding, gothically, No. Quite right 每 yet she sets about redressing matters in diametrically wrong ways, again her trademark spirited melange of forensic planning, rash spontaneity and professional foot-shootery. At one stage Gemma snaps (at a child!), ※It＊s not Dr Foster any more,§ but we don＊t learn what it , and she has kept her wedding ring: has she been in stasis throughout, refusing herself the luxury of the hateful phrase ※moving on§? The questions line up, but by the end of that fraught first hour, fag in mouth, she＊s lining up syringes, and a jar of acid for the ring. And every step 每 the key phrase from above is that ※immaculate internal logic§ 每 credible. Just.At heart this is a sad tale: not dark comedy, or farce, but an everyday tragedy of just how much can be invested in a relationship, a marriage, and what happens when one partner takes all that fragile trust, so vulnerably proffered 每 and, essentially, defecates on it. That this relatively mundane sadness has been raised so successfully to high drama is testament to the strengths of both Bartlett and Jones (who this time associate produces): it deserves to soar as it did in 2015.Strong alcoholic drink also featured, if far more bleakly, in the other absolute standout of the week, , in which  excels (naturally) as Jim Worth, an ex-London detective transplanted to Little Big Bear in the Canadian Rockies. He is struggling, successfully enough and two years dry, with his alcoholism: he has a lovely, wry family, and an easy way with him, yet there are darkling hints of an alter ego. Little Big Bear is struggling less successfully with the building of a huge oil refinery, presided over by the magnificently simpering : the population is actually seen to increase, via the town-border sign, from 1,578 to 2,157 in one jump, with ramifications, via incoming ne＊er-do-wells, for crime.The opener seems to jog along in pithy fashion, nice scene-setting for Sheriff Jim＊s culture-clash with the rocky-redder necks among the maples. But suddenly, there＊s a savage startler, a gulper, and a boy of five is left dead, shot in the head. By the end of the second episode, Worth (Roth) is back on the whiskey. There will, surely, be revenge: the tin star on the title credits is subtly speckled with what I had thought to be rust. I have revised that thought, and this grips the windpipe already.As doesn＊t, not really at all, the return of . Fine enough cast, though Stephen Moyer has none of the subtleties of a , opting instead for vague gruff transatlantic tree trunk. Two things are already clear: as before, the ※safe§ house will be set somewhere remote, fascinating, mysterious and thus not at all safe 每 here the Lake District has been swapped for one of Wales＊s less low-key peninsular beauty spots 每 and the witnesses will again stupidly endanger everyone by switching on their expressly forbidden mobiles.The new series is enlivened by the presence of Jason Watkins, Dervla Kirwan, a decent backstory, a subplot. But my money＊s still on the baddies rolling up, half an hour into the finale and doubtless in driving rain, past the miles of DayGlo chevrons helpfully advising ※Safe House This Way§., which began on C4, can be read in a few ways. Back as in,  (left) are back, together, hurrah: the guys reunited, and playing quasi simulacra (the sober, moral but sarky one, and the smiley shallow one). Back 每 as in Stephen＊s dad, a pub landlord and inveterate foster father, has died, and the mourners suddenly include Andrew (Webb), who was fostered for about 10 minutes back in the lost 80s, and they will replay their memories of those days with wildly differing degrees of enthusiasm and accuracy. Back 每 as in, you can never really go there.It＊s a triumph, in that writer Simon Blackwell looks to be embarking on a grown-up exploration of memory that manages to be in parts explosively funny, too. Mitchell＊s character (as ever) reveals himself as too clever to pull off real pathos: Webb＊s (as ever) as too misguided to garner real dislike. Painfully sharp but also oddly touching, if you let it.In contrast, the return of  for a seventh series felt, dispiritingly＃ welcome enough but a bit of a chore, like the bath you can＊t be bothered to get out of.

"n old pictures, Liverpool＊s Granby Street is a bustling thoroughfare packed with shops 每 takeaways and launderettes, hairdressers and tailors, florists and supermarkets 每 all serving the lively, diverse, tightly packed community in the neat grid of Victorian streets that surrounded it.But decades of alternating clearances and government neglect have left those streets full of holes. Sections of sturdy brick terracing remain, separated by modern low-rises and patches of fenced-off ground. At its southern end, though, after decades of stubborn local activism, Granby Street is beginning to blossom again.In 2012 the residents were introduced to , a young architecture collective then mainly known for inventive installations such as Clerkenwell＊s , a project that transformed a petrol station into a cinema. Three years later, Assemble unexpectedly .It seems, in retrospect, an unlikely coupling, but five years on, Granby Street has become a rare beacon for thoughtful, human-scaled urban regeneration. Some of the original houses have been cleverly refurbished, while the shells of two others have been combined to form a community meeting space, caf谷 and indoor garden. On the streets, planters improvised from salvaged materials are painted in vivid colours, and gardens are bursting with flowers.If Assemble were your average architects (and the Granby Four Streets Community Land Trust were your average clients), that＊s probably where the story would end. But instead, they ploughed the Turner Prize money into the Granby Workshop, a small manufacturing enterprise which has taken over one of the street＊s old corner shops. The aim: to produce experimental handmade products for the home.※There are a number of core principles behind the workshop products,§ Assemble＊s Lewis Jones explains. ※And one of those is that there should be an element of chance, or accident in the way things are made. So it doesn＊t just end up becoming incredibly boring 每 and that＊s where these products developed from.§As we talk, he pulls out some samples, many of which first saw the light of day during restoration work on the first few houses. There are beautiful handles and door knobs in pale clay, barbecued with pine needles and banana skins to create smoky, scorched effects. There are mottled aggregate mantelpieces, formed from reclaimed building rubble mixed with coloured cement. There is a swathe of patterned tiles, with patterns ranging from marbled streaks to rainbow-coloured transfers.And now, thanks to their latest toy 每an old, used to mould clay, lodged in a newly built outhouse 每 the team is launching Splatware: a series of tableware products made using traditional pottery processes in a characteristically un-traditional way.※We found a cool machine, and then tried to figure out what we could do with it,§ says Jones.What they do, currently, is produce a range of bowls, plates and cups in plaster moulds, made by placing clay in the kiln with different oxides pressed on top 每 or ※squooshed§, to use Jones＊s satisfyingly descriptive term 每 to produce random, rainbow-coloured results. The range will launch online with crowdfunding website Kickstarter, and make its debut at , part of the London Design Festival, from 21每24 September ().Simultaneously, back at Granby, they＊ll also host some tours and demonstrations. ※We think it＊s kind of a nice thing to have,§ says Granby Workshop＊s Sumuyya Khader. ※People get to see the machine in action, and have the opportunity to be a part of it.§※We really want the workshop to grow and be a big neighbourhood business,§ Jones agrees, ※but to have a broader relationship beyond just selling products. There is a lot of general creative activity in the city. And that also fed into the way that the houses were saved 每 and refurbished. People didn＊t just protest to save the houses; they painted the empty houses, and planted the streets. It was always a very creative approach.§The feeling is clearly mutual. ※Everything they do is fantastic,§ says long-time local resident and Trust vice-chair Hazel Tilley, poking her head in while taking some students on a workshop tour. ※You＊ve only got to look at what they do: the love, the care, the attention. And they gave a lot of it for nothing for a long time. What we love about Assemble is, they＊re young, they＊re enthusiastic and they didn＊t know what they couldn＊t do 每 so they did it. We have had a bit of iffiness on Twitter and stuff, from people that say this isn＊t grassroots, that everyone＊s been brought in from London. It＊s a pile of shit. It couldn＊t be more grassroots if you tried.§While Jones may well be a Londoner, he moved to Merseyside 18 months ago 每 and now lives 10 minutes from the workshop, with his girlfriend and three-month-old child. ※The baby＊s Scouse,§ Tilley points out, laughing delightedly. ※It＊s nationalised!§Afterwards, we go for a walk down Cairns Street, where some of the 11 houses which formed the original project have already been inhabited. The Winter Garden 每 incorporating the shell of two houses too far gone to save 每 has just had its glass roof inserted, and will open this autumn as a community meeting space, caf谷 and greenhouse.After touring the workshop, we visit the next battle line, Ducie Street, a half-demolished road with a grand terrace of double-fronted houses on one side, and a wildflower meadow on the other. The houses here have been empty the longest, and are in the worst condition 每 but their metal shutters and teetering gateposts are a riot of defiant murals. On the way back, Jones struggles to wrangle the workshop door open. ※We need to get that fixed,§ he says, ruefully. In all honesty, I don＊t know when he＊d find the time.																																											"

But, having lost the computer console, the child grows captivated by the forest＊s sensuous delights 每 from stroking slimy snails to slurping icy rainwater.Alemagna＊s illustrations start to lighten as the child＊s heart lifts. In the tale＊s turning point, the child appears to morph into the landscape, the bulbous raincoat suddenly resembling a magical toadstool, while we＊re told ※I knew that there was something special close by§.In its celebration of the sights, sounds and squelchiness of the outdoors,  is reminiscent of Michael Rosen＊s , but it goes a step further, highlighting the transformational potential of nature.

"My friend and relative Elisabeth Parry, who has died aged 95, was an accomplished classical singer and recitalist who became a ※forces＊ sweetheart§ during the second world war, entertaining the troops.She was born Mhari Elisabeth in Aberdeen. Her father, Arthur Parry, who had been badly injured in the first world war, had gone on to be a junior personal secretary to Winston Churchill; her mother was also Mhari (nee Forbes). Elisabeth was the great-granddaughter of , the Welsh composer who wrote the famous hymn tune Aberystwyth (which later formed the basis for , the national anthem of South Africa). She was later to contribute generously to the , set up to help aspiring young singers.She was brought up in London and after her parents separated she boarded at Eversley School, which was in Folkestone, Kent, before moving to Lymington in Hampshire. In 1939 she was offered a place at Oxford University to study French and German, but refused this on the outbreak of war to join the Red Cross as an ambulance driver.Singing lessons with the concert singer Mark Raphael and a chance audition led to her becoming a soloist with the staff band of the Royal Army Medical Corps, with whom she performed as ※Thirty Men and a Girl§, in Britain and the Middle East until the war＊s end. She was voted ※forces sweetheart§ for Paiforce (Persia and Iraq Force). She also sang and gave many recitals for the Council for Encouragement of Music and the Arts, later the Arts Council.Following the end of the war, she set up and ran the Wigmore Hall lunch hour concerts in London for musicians returning from the war, and also auditioned successfully for Benjamin Britten＊s English Opera Group, working with great artists such as  and . She made her operatic debut at Glyndebourne performing as Lucia in  Rape of Lucretia. She was also awarded an Italian government scholarship to study at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena and Rome.She started the  in 1950, which she ran until her retirement more than 50 years later, touring productions around the UK to give many people who wouldn＊t otherwise the chance to experience live opera.Elisabeth, a relative of my wife through her mother＊s side, took up climbing and colour photography in the 1960s, and gave illustrated travel talks all over Britain. She was a member of the Alpine Club and Association of British Members of the Swiss Alpine Club, and a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. She contributed articles to magazines and mountaineering publications.In 1973, she was awarded a commendation for distinguished achievement in . In 2011 her autobiography, , was published, followed by a book of her poetry,  (2013).																																											"
"aron Rogers of Riverside comes on so wood-fired, so extra-virgin, so biodynamic, so ethically sourced and cloudily unfiltered that he might be an obscure Umbrian goatherd＊s dish served at Lady Rogers＊s . A lesser man would be crippled by the very yoke of the angelism that burdens him and afflicts everything he does.But, somehow, over the past 50 years this virtuoso has, in various partnerships and configurations, designed a number of sheerly thrilling and stylistically various buildings. Most of his architectural near peers (, , ) are plodding one-trick ponies. Rogers is a very different sort of dobbin 每 a Lipizzaner stallion with a modern jazzer＊s hairdo, a deafening apple green shirt and a capacious store of axels, salchows and triple skips.He has been reluctant to copy himself, to supply a predictable product with a recognisable signature. There is no such thing as a typical Rogers building. The , the law courts in Bordeaux and Antwerp, Lloyd＊s in the City of London and the later Lloyd＊s Register,  and  每 a few chromatic and gestural quirks apart, these might all be by different hands. Which suggests that he is an unusually protean artist with the mutability of  or, more probably, that ※his§ work pays more than lip service to the practice of collaboration.He (or his ghostly collaborator on this book, Richard Brown) writes that his dyslexia made him realise ※at an early age that there was more strength in a group, in creative collaboration, than there was in the solo high achiever§. This would come as news to artists such as Beethoven, Thomas Hardy, Otto Dix or any other ※solo high achiever§. Quite how or why dyslexia should prompt that revelation is undisclosed. And, anyway, it appears that his idea of collaboration is somewhat straitened. After Yale he was briefly employed in the San Francisco office of?the architectural colossus Skidmore, Owings & Merrill: ※I quickly came to realise that working in someone else＊s architectural practice was not for me.§The implication of that sentence permeates this portmanteau-ish book. But it cannot be made explicit. For in the open-necked, given-name, anti-elitist elite of which he is a capo and whose mores this book unwittingly portrays, rank and hierarchy are as unmentionable as, say, sex was in the 19th century or as death remains today. There is a disinclination in this establishment to acknowledge that . Rogers, who agonised over whether to accept a knighthood, which he did, then agonised over whether to accept a peerage, which he did, keeps what he claims to be his one and only tie at the House of Lords. The rest of the time he goes rebelliously tieless and, crucially, .The first part of the book is a brisk memoir of his early years. Florence, where he was born in 1933; bourgeois, doting, intelligent, atheist parents with English and Jewish forebears; flight to London then Surrey at the very beginning of the war; hideously violent boarding school; less hideous day school; teenage hitchhiking and getting banged up in solitary on trumped-up charges in Venice; national service in Trieste where he spent much time with his evidently inspiring cousin Ernesto Rogers, architect of the  in central Milan. Now, all this is peculiar to Rogers but it amounts to no more than a sketch wanting detail. A literal  but a very thin one.As architecture begins to preoccupy him he manages to muster greater interest in his former self.  and the sort of architect he will become start to define him. The text gets fuller, richer. At the same time, however, it becomes more generalised. It might be a personal history that he attempts to recount but much is an utterly familiar trawl through postwar Britain. The resistance to modernism, the Festival of Britain, discovering Le Corbusier, the ineffable Smithsons, Stirling and Gowan, an Aldermaston march 每 and then Yale, where he met another Fulbright scholar, Norman Foster, who would become his first collaborator.He rather predictably ticks off Yale＊s campus for being ※a strange pastiche of a Victorian Oxbridge college ＃ Gothic revival buildings§. (Pastiche is a scornfully pejorative word among architects of Rogers＊s generation and aesthetic bias.) He writes interestingly if, again, too briefly about his first professor there, Paul Rudolph, whose untheoretical approach and insistence on the primacy of appearance seem to have rather shocked him; though the Lloyd＊s building＊s obvious debt to Rudolph＊s great Art and Architecture Building, opened the year after Rogers left Yale, suggests that he absorbed a lot from this famously querulous teacher. He tucked it behind his ear for later.The more immediate future would be coloured by the work of the Californian Craig Ellwood, as energetically heterosexual as Rudolph was homosexual. Rogers＊s only mention of him is in a list of west coast architects whose work he and his first wife Su drove to see in a Renault Dauphine, which now and again spontaneously combusted. I think the accounts of these fires are intended to be?funny.The house Rogers designed for his parents in Wimbledon owes much to Ellwood and the California Case Studies Houses sponsored by Arts & Architecture magazine in the 1940s and 50s. These are pared down, but hardly austere or threatening, and comfortably non-didactic 每 family-friendly modernism.One moment Rogers is scratching around doing houses for friends of friends and in-laws, and low-cost factories, and wondering whether he should jack it in, the next he and Renzo Piano have won the competition to design what was to be called the Centre du Plateau Beaubourg: ※We had no idea what we were taking on.§That becomes all too evident. Designing a building whose only forebears had been the paper dreams of the Archigram group and  was one thing, maybe the easy bit. Coping with the constant barbs and brickbats of French architectural panjandrums, politicians, planners, community groups, steel manufacturers and the press was something else again. An organisation called Geste Architectural was established with the sole purpose of bringing lawsuits, an echo of those received by Le Corbusier in Marseille 25 years previously. Robert Delaunay＊s widow Sonia said she＊d rather burn his paintings than have them exhibited in the building.Not all the attacks were founded in chauvinism. The British press joined in too. Rogers＊s long chapter on the making of the Pompidou Centre is by far the best thing in the book. While the building itself has proved inimitable, its example has, usually regrettably, been copied: ※cultural§ regeneration seldom achieves anything beyond the self-congratulation of the arts loop.After five years living in Place des Vosges in Paris, he and his new wife Ruth moved, in 1977, back to London, where ※olive oil was sold in chemists for cleaning your ears out§. This is balls. It was widely available in Cypriot Camden Town and Harringay, Italian King＊s Cross and Clerkenwell, everywhere in Soho. Again Rogers slips into easy (and wrong) generalisation.His account of his ascent to the peak of New Labour＊s great and good is more precise, though it＊s constellated with praise for those he meets en route. He is generous with such words as ※genius§, ※poetic§, ※excellent§. He finds it difficult to recall the names of his many ※close friends§, most of whom are almost as successful as he is. Some of them, the fawnocracy, have lined up to supply a few back-cover plugs. He has a good word for everyone apart from volume builders, ※arch-conservative§ planners and the Prince of Wales.There are some predictable omissions. Just as his old friend and rival Foster perks up whenever a central Asian dictator drops by, so has Rogers developed a peculiar late-life fondness for autodestruction. ※Do as I say, not as I do§ is?not a happy label to bear. Quite why the greatest architect of his age, who has campaigned for equality, social housing, lifestyle-size street furniture, improved cities, community communities, multicultural handshake sheds and countless other right-on causes should all but shred his reputation by designing obscenely expensive and very ugly flats is a mystery.

"atching a skilled bartender at work 每 gracefully moving from backbar to ice well, throwing splashes of liquids into mixing glasses and shaker tins, silently stirring drinks or shaking them with vigour 每 is part of the pleasure of going to a cocktail bar. But this theatre serves to obscure a fundamental truth about bartending: making a good cocktail isn＊t necessarily hard work.Home bartenders have a few advantages over their professional counterparts when it comes to making high-quality cocktails. Firstly, home bartenders are beholden to nobody＊s budget but their own. If you want to make, say, a  at home, nobody＊s going to stop you 每 whereas the reality of what customers are willing to pay keeps such drinks off most bars＊ lists. Home bartenders are also able to deep-dive into the things that interest them. If you discover that you love aquavit, for example, you can collect as many different examples of the spirit as you please 每 a luxury most commercial bars can＊t afford.With practice and finesse, the drinks that you make in your home bar can equal the drinks you＊ll find at your local watering hole. Here are a few tips to help take your home bar game to the next level.There＊s a truism in the cocktail world that a mixed drink is only as good as its worst ingredient. While it mostly holds true 每 as anyone who＊s had a Manhattan made with cheap bourbon and spoiled vermouth can attest 每 that doesn＊t mean you have to spend a packet on ingredients to make good drinks.There isn＊t always a strong correlation between price and quality of liquor. Of course, the very cheapest bottles are more likely to be dreck, but that doesn＊t mean that the very expensive stuff is amazing. When you buy a bottle of liquor, you＊re not just buying the juice inside 每 you＊re paying for the packaging, the marketing, the product＊s rarity, and the social prestige it endows. It＊s also worth thinking about whether the product is a ※team player§ when put in mixed drinks. For example, I adore the Catalonian producer Casa Mariol＊s sweet vermouth on its own as an aperitif, but have found that it doesn＊t work very well in most cocktails that call for sweet vermouth.This kind of knowledge comes down to trial and error, but one simple way to tell if a product might not be a team player is if the product advertising emphasises its novelty or unusualness. The trendy new gin laden with obscure botanicals may taste wonderful in a G&T, but could also ruin your Negroni.If you＊re looking to fill a gap in your home liquor cabinet and don＊t know what brand to buy, pop into a local bar and ask them what brand they use. The ※first-pour§ spirits used at good cocktail bars are usually great value for money and will work in a wide variety of mixed drinks.The Manhattan is one cocktail that benefits from some thought put into its ingredients. Made with average ingredients according to the now-standard ※212§ recipe ( two ounces whiskey, one ounce sweet vermouth, two dashes aromatic bitters) hardly wows. Upgrade to a high-proof or cask-strength whiskey, match it with an equally impressive vermouth, and tweak the ratios so the vermouth plays an equal role to the whiskey 每 and suddenly you have a seriously delicious cocktail. Build ingredients in a mixing glass. Add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into a chilled cocktail coupe. Garnish with a skewered maraschino cherry or a twist of orange peel.If you＊re making drinks at home, you＊ll need some basic equipment 每 emphasis here on the basic. While high-quality barware makes mixing drinks a pleasure, it＊s not required at home. So skip the expensive equipment and splash out on ingredients instead. I＊d much rather drink a martini made with high-quality gin and ultra-fresh vermouth stirred in a jam jar than one made of cheap gin and vermouth left over from a house party four years ago stirred in a Japanese cut-crystal Yarai mixing glass.There are a few areas where it doesn＊t pay to skimp on equipment. Firstly, spend money on a decent set of jiggers to measure the booze you pour into cocktails. Accuracy is important: it helps you control how much liquor you and your guests drink, and it means your cocktails are consistent. Look for jiggers that can pour the most common cocktail measurements: 7.5ml (? fl oz), 15ml (? fl oz), 22.5 ml (? fl oz) and 30ml (1 fl oz). If you make a lot of cocktails, go for a jigger with a larger capacity 每 one that measures 45 ml (1? fl oz) and 60ml (2 fl oz). A bar spoon that measures the industry-standard 5ml in its bowl is also useful, but you can use a metric teaspoon measure in a pinch. If you like cocktails that call for dashes of ingredients that don＊t come in bottles with built-in dashers 每 such as maraschino or absinthe 每 then a Japanese-style bitters bottle with a dasher top is a useful investment.For the rest: improvise. If you have a clean jam jar with a matching lid and a chopstick, you have all of the equipment you＊ll need to make a stirred drink. And a protein shake bottle and a tea strainer can be used in place of a cocktail shaker and strainer. If you＊re invited to a friend＊s cocktail party and are unsure what to bring, bring a few bags of ice. A well-made cocktail usually requires a surprisingly large, almost environmentally irresponsible quantity of ice 每 not just in the glass (for drinks served on the rocks or in collins glasses) but also in the making. Rookie bartenders often underestimate how much ice a cocktail needs, with tepid results. Quality matters too. Make sure the ice you use is fresh (old ice can absorb food odours from its neighbours in the freezer) and made from the purest water available. As , ※if a gin or vodka travels to Iceland for its pure water source and you throw a seven-month-old burnt cloudy ice cube that was stuck to a packet of frozen peas in your drink, you just negated the trouble they went through.§ The cloudier the ice is, the more impure it is. You don＊t have to make your ice cubes from bottled water from an unspoiled exotic locale to get clearer cubes 每 simply run tap water through a basic water filtration system before freezing for better results.Large, crystal-clear ice cubes have become something of a shibboleth for high-end cocktail bars. If you have the time and patience, you can replicate this kind of ice at home using a technique known as  每 essentially forcing the ice to freeze from the top down, which pushes the water impurities towards the bottom. Several new products, such as ＊ ice chest and ＊s clear ice system, do the work for you 每 but all you really need is a small insulated cooler filled with water, a freezer large enough to contain it, and the patience to break the slab down into smaller chunks.If you have the means to make large blocks of crystal-clear ice, the old-fashioned remains one of the best drinks to deploy them in. This light take on the old-fashioned is not only a doddle to make, but is light in colour, allowing the clear ice to shine through.Build ingredients in a mixing glass. Add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into a tumbler over a large piece of clear ice. Garnish with a twist of grapefruit peel.There are three fundamental ways to make a cocktail. The easiest is to measure out the ingredients into the glass and add ice 每 known within the bar industry as ※building§ a drink. The other ways are to shake the ingredients together with ice or stir the ingredients over ice, then strain the drink off. These latter two techniques sound simple, but require practice and finesse.The rule of thumb for whether to shake or stir a drink has to do with its ingredients. Generally drinks that contain only clear ingredients (spirits, simple syrup, bitters etc) should be stirred, while drinks that contain opaque ingredients or those that need to be fully incorporated into the drink (citrus juices, milk, cream, and eggs) should be shaken. This allows drinks with clear ingredients to remain beautifully limpid, while creating texture and mouthfeel in the shaken drinks. In both cases, use loads of ice 每 enough to rise above the surface of the drink in the shaker tin or mixing glass.Many rookie bartenders underestimate just how hard a shake needs to be to properly chill and dilute a cocktail. Harry Craddock＊s advice to young bartenders from his 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book remains timeless: ※Shake the shaker as hard as you can ＃ you are trying to wake [the cocktail] up, not send it to sleep!§ Hard here doesn＊t necessarily mean fast, but something more like firmly 每  from one end of the shaker to the other. This is easier to accomplish when you＊re not fighting gravity 每 try shaking your cocktail horizontally rather than vertically. Once you＊ve shaken for about 10 to 15 seconds, your cocktail is ready to be strained off through a hawthorne strainer and a second fine-mesh strainer (to catch errant chips of ice and citrus pulp).Professional stirring technique is deadly silent. Stirring a cocktail is not like stirring coffee 每 you＊re not aiming to agitate the contents of your mixing glass while stirring. In fact you＊re not really ※stirring§ the drink, but rather pushing the ice  the drink. Start by building your cocktail in the mixing glass and top it off with ice, then place a bar spoon (or chopstick if you＊re improvising) between the ice and the inside of the glass. Then, with the spoon handle between the fingers of one hand, move the ice by . Stirring a drink down to the proper level of chill and dilution takes longer than shaking 每 about 30 to 45 seconds should do the job.If you want to test your shaking mettle, whip up a Ramos gin fizz. This cocktail is so labour-intensive that its inventor Henry Ramos famously hired a posse of ※shaker boys§ whose only job was to shake these drinks. It＊s a lot of work, but worth the effort. Build all ingredients except soda water in a cocktail shaker. Shake without ice to fluff up the egg white and incorporate the cream. Add ice and shake again, vigorously, until well chilled and frothy. Add soda water to a collins glass and gently strain the cocktail over the soda water. Gently top with ice if necessary. No garnish is required, but you can add a slice of orange if you like.The old bartender＊s saying is the customer takes the first sip of their drink with their eyes. This underlines the importance of a cocktail＊s presentation 每 like food, drink is more appealing when it looks good.How much garnish to apply to a drink is a matter of aesthetic taste 每 some bartenders skew towards over-the-top garnishes, while others eschew all but the most functional of garnishes altogether. It＊s worth distinguishing between garnishes that are functional 每 those that serve a purpose and those that are purely visual. Simpler garnishes tend to have a functional purpose: the twist of lemon peel that floats in a martini or the sprig of mint tucked under the straw in a julep, both of which enhance the taste and smell of the drink. More adventurous garnishes, such as the  or artful arrangements of pineapple fronds and edible flowers, tend to be less functional. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule: the beautifully simple sprigs of baby＊s breath that Naren Young  add no flavour or aroma to the drink, while the inverted bottle of Underberg that  adds a complex aromatic element.For home bartenders, less is often more 每 you＊ll achieve more wow factor with a simple garnish prepared with care than an extravagant one made poorly. You don＊t need to do much to make your cocktails insta-worthy: a twist of citrus peel can be jazzed up by trimming its edges with pinking shears rather than a knife; a fresh sprig of an unexpected herb (thyme, basil, sage) can transform the way a drink looks and smells; and a long slice of cucumber can wind its way around the inside of a collins glass. As with the ingredients that go into the drink, opt for high-quality, fresh garnish ingredients wherever possible, especially if the garnish is edible.																																											"
"any first novels are really first  novels, reactions to the angsty roman 角 clefs and 700-page epics that preceded them (now mercifully forgotten in a drawer). But this was not the case for Pajtim Statovci. My Cat Yugoslavia 每 which has already won gushing praise from  (※a marvel, a remarkable achievement§) and  (※strange and exquisite§) 每 is not only the first novel he tried to write, but the first piece of fiction he ever wrote.※I was working in a grocery store while simultaneously studying comparative literature at the University of Helsinki,§ he says. ※One night, after a late shift, frustrated and fed up with my job, I asked myself: what am I waiting for?§ Eighteen months later, at just 21 years old, he had finished the first draft of My Cat Yugoslavia. But while Statovci the author, multilingual, bookishly handsome and improbably successful for his age 每 he＊s now 27 每 may make writing look easy, it took a turbulent childhood to get him here.  He was born in Kosovo in 1990, a mere year before the first of the many Yugoslav wars broke out, and had dreamed of being a writer since boyhood: ※As a child, I was sensitive and fragile to the point where I actually pretended that I was in the stories I consumed, that I led the life of their protagonists because the life in fiction was so much more interesting than [the one] I was living.§Although Statovci assures me that his novel ※is a work of fiction from start to finish§, he admits to including some autobiographical elements. Like one of his protagonists, Emine, he fled his home for Finland with his family. His observations on nationality, racism and migration come from his own experience, as well as the people around him. Bekim, his other protagonist, talks at length about growing up as an Albanian migrant in Finland. ※One day you＊ll see that if you try to become their equal, they＊ll despise you more,§ he recalls his father saying about Finns. My Cat Yugoslavia is made up of two stories: one is a magical realist tale that follows a young, gay man 每 Bekim 每 and his relationship with a boorishly humanoid talking cat. The other, about Emine, is a realist portrayal of an Albanian mother who flees to Finland with her family during the 1980s. Bekim is Emine＊s child, though you would hardly realise it from their interactions. ※Oftentimes there＊s a gap between the younger ＃ and the older generation in families that have migrated from one culture to another. And sometimes there＊s no solution to be found, no dialogue, no understanding,§ Statovci says. ※And the gap gets only bigger and deeper, and the distance between two worlds only grows longer, never closing up.§ Magical realism, Statovci says, ※doesn＊t care about walls, and it doesn＊t have constraints, whereas the reality does. It has rules, norms and codes of conduct.§ After their initial meeting in a gay club, Bekim＊s cat companion is abrasive, homophobic, bigoted 每 but Bekim thinks the love he gets from the cat is stronger and more powerful because of the boundaries it has crossed. Through fantasy, Statovci expresses the troubled inner life of Bekim 每 though this isn＊t to say that Emine＊s sections are any less lyrical; when performing chores, she remarks that ※in a clean house, there were no secrets§. But in those passages, the lyricism lies in how events are presented. In Bekim＊s surreal story, what happens is just as fantastic as how it＊s told. Reality and fantasy aren＊t entirely separate for Statovci, either. ※Many things in my childhood and in my life, such as the war in Kosovo, did not make sense to me. They just were fenced outside my understanding,§ he says. ※I guess this is the reason I＊ve always been drawn to works of fiction that make the unimaginable possible and the unbelievable understandable.§ So why a talking cat? When writing the novel, Statovci became interested in the relationship between animals and humans, particularly how the latter project their own feelings onto their beastly companions, anthropomorphising them. ※Reading animals as symbols of us reduces them, [it] violates their right to represent themselves,§ he says. Depending on the culture, animals can symbolise completely different things, he says: ※In Finland, cats are domesticated animals, whereas in Kosovo they are seen as dirty.§In this sense, animals fall foul of the same cultural stereotyping as humans. ※We live in a world pierced with animal cruelty, racism, prejudice and stereotypes. Oppression and discrimination have always been, and are to this day, very much alive in our world. Only the victims of them keep changing.§ Statovci isn＊t too concerned about his own national identity. ※I don＊t go to sleep at night thinking about my relationship to the country I was born in,§ he says. ※I speak Albanian as my mother tongue, but I don＊t use it when I think, write or dream.§ In his novel, however, Bekim＊s Albanian grandfather holds precisely those concerns, worrying that ※one day [Bekim] won＊t be an Albanian at all but something else all together.§ There is also a wonderfully plain line where the cat decides he ※no longer wanted to be a cat; he wanted to be a film director§. Statovci treats species and occupation as one and the same: both are roles we must play.While second-generation migrants are often robbed of a national ※home§, considered foreign in both their adopted country and their family＊s homeland, Statovci considers home ※a state of mind§. ※When I write, that＊s home to me,§ he says. ※That＊s the great thing about fiction 每 its ability to resonate inside everyone.§ That is what appealed to Statovci the boy. It is also what he gives back in My Cat Yugoslavia.																																											"
"Historic objects from the , some of which have remained undocumented and unseen in the stores of European museums for more than a century, are to be part of the UK＊s first major show exploring Oceanic art.The  (RA) has announced details of its 2018 Oceania exhibition, which will bring together 250 objects from the vast region that stretches from New Guinea to Easter Island, and Hawaii to New Zealand.The show will be staged in the 250th anniversary year of the RA, which was founded in 1768 每 the same year Captain James Cook set out on his first Endeavour expedition.Around three-quarters of the objects will come from European collections, in particular ethnographic museums in Germany and Switzerland, as well as museums in the UK, France, Ireland and Austria.Adrian Locke, a senior curator at the RA, said: ※There is an incredible array, a fantastic richness of objects that have been collected since the time of Cook, not just by voyagers and explorers but also by missionaries and anthropologists.§Locke said some of the objects had not been seen in public and were undocumented. is an enormous carved wooden feast bowl that has the head of a crocodile cheerfully holding a human skull in its teeth. From the Solomon Islands, it has variously been described as being used in both cannibalistic practice and marital ceremonies. ※So take your pick on that one 每 perhaps both at the same time,§ said Locke.There will also be canoes, , and drawings by the Polynesian navigator Tupaia, who travelled on the Endeavour.Though the show arrives in Cook＊s anniversary year, Locke said it would not be from a European perspective. All the art is by indigenous people and there would be no contested objects.※We are very conscious of the sensitivity of a lot of these objects, some of which we can＊t borrow for cultural reasons,§ said Locke.There have been cases of European museums giving back culturally sensitive artefacts to the communities from which they were taken, but Locke said he did not anticipate that being an issue in the RA show.In one case the lender has stipulated that if a living descendant of an artwork＊s maker comes forward, the RA must pay for them to travel to  for the show.It is the first show of its kind since 1979, when the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC explored the subject. Locke said the RA show, to be curated by academics from Cambridge and Auckland, would be ※pioneering§ and ※reflect very much on the advancements that have been made in the understanding and the dialogue and the exchange culturally that has been taking place since the late 1970s§.One contemporary art highlight will be a work which was, in some eyes, one of the star＊s of this summer＊s Venice Biennale: a gripping panoramic video work by .The show is in the tradition of other blockbuster shows the RA has staged exploring cultures including the Aztecs in 2002; China: The Three Emperors 1662-1795 in 2005; and Byzantium 330-1453 in 2008.Oceania will be the big autumn show in an important year for the RA.

"t＊s a self-assured author who decides to write a children＊s novel about the adventures of a ※young boy wizard§ in a world of magic, but then  has reasons to be confident: 8m copies sold of her books, a  and a spin-off series for TV.As with the Viking world of , the eagerly awaited   is set in the ancient past and our two heroes are scrappy kids struggling with that timeless issue of failing to live up to parental expectations. In place of dragons, there are sprites, deep-thinking giants, ogres and snow cats living in an enchanted wildwood.The kingdom of Wizards is at war with the neighbouring queendom of iron Warriors, against whose iron weapons their magic is useless. When the boy wizard, Xar (a troublemaking prince waiting in vain for his magic to ※come in§), meets the warrior princess, Wish, they discover that the evil magic of witches 每 long thought extinct 每 has returned.The detail of Cowell＊s imagined world is a delight, not least in her scratchy pencil illustrations that evoke the darting, insect-like sprites or the pitch-black terrors of the forest. And her kinetic prose barely pauses for breath as Xar and Wish leap from one action-packed scrape to the next (you can practically see the scenes from the already-signed Dreamworks film jumping off the pages).In an introduction to her new series, Cowell (an advocate for kids literacy) extols the joys of being read to as a child and there are many pleasures here for parents, including  echoes (iron invaders, infectious ※bad§ magic) and a moment where Crusher the giant ponders the paradoxes of an expanding universe (※giants are big and they tend to have BIG thoughts§).

"Both U2 and Ed Sheeran have cancelled concert dates in St Louis over security concerns amid .The Irish band were booked to play at The Dome at America＊s Center on Saturday night, while English singer Sheeran had sold-out a Sunday night show at the Scottrade Center. Police say they cannot guarantee the typical level of security as the city faces ongoing protests.Hundreds protested on Friday and Saturday in downtown St Louis, in an upscale section of town and in well-to-do suburbs, leading to at least 32 arrests.

"f you＊re used to hearing , then the pure heft of this recording 每 his first as music director of Berlin＊s Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester 每 might take a bit of getting used to. It＊s exciting, and it bodes well. The orchestra has a powerful engine that always feels on the verge of breaking loose, but Ticciati harnesses the depth and drive of that energy and adds some gorgeously febrile stuff. Maybe some of the corners aren＊t as nimble as they＊ll become a few years into his new job, but Faur谷＊s Prelude to Penelope surges and sweeps, Debussy＊s Pell谷as and M谷lisande suite has a rich, sombre beauty and La Mer sounds robust, brooding and vast.

"hat happens when the world moves on and leaves you behind? It＊s the key question behind , the first release from the endearingly earnest folk collaboration Gavin Osborn & the Comment Section. It＊s a record about being frustrated, angry, bewildered and aware of the utter ridiculousness of a world that has moved past your point of understanding.Singer-songwriter Osborn, 40, has seen the soft-corporate power of chain-stores swamp the West Country town of Keynsham where he lives; he＊s tried to make it in the bohemian paradise he imagined in the big city, and abandoned it as too cynical and expensive; he＊s tried to hang on to his values: left-leaning, pro-immigration, pro-arts, and seen the world rush forward and leave them behind. And he really doesn＊t know what to do next. It makes  one of 2017＊s most relatable releases.Up to this point Osborn＊s career hasn＊t exactly been marked by seriousness. In 2004 he was struggling on the London open-mic folk circuit when his old school friend, the comedian John Oliver (now a hugely successful talkshow host on America＊s HBO) invited him to a regular Tuesday afternoon football match with a group of friends, mostly comedians, now almost all famous.Among them was the fanatically worshipped cult comic Daniel Kitson, who was impressed by Osborn＊s warm storytelling and enlisted him as tour support. Kitson＊s devoted fanbase took to Osborn straight away and he became a sort of accidental comic, appearing at comedy clubs and festivals, working with Robin Ince and Alun Cochrane and writing a series of acclaimed storytelling collaborations with Kitson, which the pair toured as support for Belle & Sebastian. e is the first time the jokes have taken a backseat to the music and the message.※Even when it＊s funny, I don＊t think I could do many of these songs at a comedy club,§ Osborn explains. ※There＊s funny bits 每 I can＊t help putting witticism in 每 but I don＊t think it＊s laugh-out-loud. If it＊s funny, it＊s wry. It was time to be more earnest.§The album was sparked by a conversation with friend and collaborator John Hare (the ※Comment Section§). ※John＊s a music teacher and told me about a class at his school that got an Ofsted inspection,§ says Osborn. ※The teacher was told there was too much music, that the kids were picking up instruments too much.§ In his head, Osborn began to fast forward through the kids＊ and their teacher＊s lives: if you love poetry, art, music and you＊re told it＊s not important enough, what happens next? What kind of world are we building?Part of Osborn＊s appeal is the way he processes his anger into a kind of likably grumpy bewilderment and uses it to unite his audience. We may feel lost and alone in a cynical world that no longer fits our values, but we can be lost and alone together. Osborn wanted to create a comfort blanket for post-Brexit alienation.One of the album＊s key songs is Don＊t Know Enough About That, about the very 21st-century tendency to bluff your way through important conversations using information you＊ve gleaned from headlines. Osborn knows the damage this can do, but also knows it＊s something we＊re all guilty of. ※That＊s true right down to David Davis trying to do the Brexit negotiations,§ he says. ※He＊s that guy, wandering into a room with people much cleverer than him and pretending he knows something. That＊s all of us.§Osborn doesn＊t have the answers, but that＊s not really the point. ※When Bob Dylan used to sing Don＊t Think Twice, It＊s All Right, people would ask him what it was about, and he＊d say it＊s just a song to make him feel better,§ he explains. ※That＊s how I feel about this record. It＊s a sense of catharsis for me and the audience. Even on the record I＊m telling myself that it＊ll all be all right. We need this, we need to know that other people are feeling it, even if it＊s more out of hope than expectation.§																																											"
"mid rows of houses and a sprinkling of bars, coffee shops, convenience stores and restaurants in Riverside, an unpretentious corner of Baltimore, one building stands out: a redbrick townhouse that was once an old church. It is the office of , a master of the medium of television.Up three steps and through thick wooden doors is a kitchen displaying posters for Sergio Leone＊s  (), Sam Peckinpah＊s  and Simon＊s own series , set in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans. But it is the bathroom that offers an oblique clue as to where he is off to next: period posters announcing long-ago labour strikes 每 one by police, another by a newspaper guild.Simon is animated by the perpetual struggle between capital and labour and believes that, after the ravages of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and globalisation, and the anti-establishment anger that produced Donald Trump and Brexit, the argument for unions and collective bargaining is as vital as ever. Which brought him to , his ambitious new HBO series charting the rise of the porn industry in 1970s New York.※What I stumbled into seemed to be a ready-made critique of market capitalism, and what happens when labour has no collective voice, and that seemed to be apt for this moment because I think a lot of the lessons of the 20th century are going to have to be learned all over again thanks to Reagan and Thatcher and all the neoliberal and libertarian argument that has come after,§ says Simon, 57, unfailingly intense as he leans forward on a sofa., a title derived from local slang for 42nd Street, sets up a colourful canvas of characters 每 hustlers, pimps, sex workers, morally exhausted police officers 每 in a sordid Times Square of graffiti, trash, neon lights, rising crime and sex shops. James Franco plays moustached twins: Vincent Martino, a savvy barman trying to keep on the straight and narrow, and his brother Frankie, a hot-headed scoundrel running up gambling debts. Maggie Gyllenhaal is Eileen ※Candy§ Merrell, a fiercely independent call girl who spots an opportunity in X-rated films. Porn is more profitable 每 and seemingly more liberating 每 than hanging out on street corners: this is the birth of smut on an industrial scale.Simon continues: ※There was always a market for prostitution, and even pornography existed below the counter in a brown paper bag, but there wasn＊t an industry; that had yet to find its full breadth in terms of the American culture and economy, but we all know what was coming.※It＊s now a multibillion dollar industry and it affects the way we sell everything from beer to cars to blue jeans. The vernacular of pornography is now embedded in our culture. Even if you＊re not consuming pornography, you＊re consuming its logic. Madison Avenue has seen to that.§Simon also has a lot to say about pornography. Whereas his critically lauded  was ostensibly about the drugs trade in Baltimore but subliminally about race,  could be seen as ostensibly about the sex industry in New York but subliminally about gender. ※affected the way men and women look at each other, the way we address each other culturally, sexually,§ he says. ※I don＊t think you can look at the misogyny that＊s been evident in this election cycle, and what any female commentator or essayist or public speaker endured on the internet or any social media setting, and not realise that pornography has changed the demeanour of men. Just the way that women are addressed for their intellectual output, the aggression that＊s delivered to women I think is informed by 50 years of the culturalisation of the pornographic.§He admits: ※I don＊t have any real way to prove that, but certainly the anonymity of social media and the internet has allowed for a belligerence and a misogyny that maybe had no other outlet. It＊s astonishing how universal it is whether you＊re 14 or 70, if you＊re a woman and you have an opinion, what is directed at you right now. I can＊t help but think that a half century of legalised objectification hasn＊t had an effect.§The series is a collaboration between Simon and , described by  as ※the poet laureate of the [Washington] DC crime world§, who also had a hand in  and . Pelecanos has previously written about Hispanic sex workers trafficked on the same trail as drugs and guns.※Personally, I think pornography has had a crude effect on society,§ he says. ※I＊m a first amendment [freedom of speech] guy but I really feel it＊s kind of like racism in the last few years: we＊ve had a wake-up call because everybody thought, ＆Wow, it went away＊. Same thing with misogyny, right?§Pelecanos, 60, thinks about the two sons he raised and the conversations he overheard when their friends came to the family home. ※The way they talk about girls and women is a little horrifying. It＊s different from when I was coming up. It＊s one thing what was described as locker-room talk, like, ＆Man, look at her legs. I＊d love to＃＊ 每 that kind of thing. But when you get into this other thing, calling girls tricks and talking about doing violence to them and all that stuff, I＊d never heard that growing up, man. I just didn＊t.※I think the culture＊s changed because of the way women are depicted in popular culture. Pornography＊s a big part of that. You can say nobody＊s getting hurt, it＊s just a masturbation fantasy and all that stuff, but these women are trafficked, man.§He believes there is a through line to Trump＊s stunning victory in last year＊s presidential election. ※There＊s no doubt if Hillary Clinton had been a man, she would be president now. The code words that were used against not just her but female journalists and everybody that was involved peripherally in the campaign was awful. Never seen anything like it.§Whereas Simon was seized by the convulsions of capitalism, for Pelecanos there was the attraction of gritty, graffiti-strewn Manhattan as seen in 70s movies such as ,  and , and blaxploitation flicks including  and . His noir novel  is set in the Washington of the day.※That＊s sort of my era,§ Pelecanos explains. ※I was a teenager in the 70s so you remember that better than anything. The texture of those movies, they felt really real, mainly because in  [Martin] Scorsese basically puts the camera operator in the back seat of the taxi and just shoots over his shoulder. There＊s no lighting, there＊s no costumes, there＊s no picture cars. He＊s just shooting what there is. In , they didn＊t have to do anything but point the camera outside and get everything.※We had to build everything and find the cars and the costumes, but it＊s cool, man. I mean, we wanted it to look like a movie that got found, that was made in ＊71, put in a vault, and somebody pulled it out and said: ＆Look what we got.＊ When you look at the pornography scenes, they＊re kind of starkly lit, as it is on a film set, and it＊s not beautiful: it looks like work or boredom, even. Not to say somebody＊s not going to get titillated 每 they probably will 每 but we didn＊t want that and we didn＊t try to do that. It is a challenge because you can＊t not show it. Then you＊re erring on the other side; you have to show what you＊re talking about.§ set the bar for period detail with its evocation of 60s New York interiors.  is as fastidious about haircuts and fashions and, with some help from CGI, transformed the New York neighbourhood of Washington Heights into the tawdry Times Square of the 1970s when it was caught partway between the early 20th-century glamour of Gershwin＊s Rhapsody in Blue and the Disneyfied tourist plaza of today.The  observed recently: ※The most consequential character may be the city itself, a New York two generations removed, which the creators and their team have captured through spot-on dialogue, time-specific set designs and atmospherics evoking  and . No bike shares, no artisan coffee, no sushi; you took the damned subway, you drank bad deli coffee 每 and if you wanted fresh tuna, you went down to the pungent Fulton fish market before dawn.§Not that the experience made Simon nostalgic for a pre-gentrification, pre-hipster age: ※There are things that have gone wrong now that are a different kind of wrong, in terms of people being priced out of neighbourhoods 每 Manhattan especially, but even some of the outer boroughs becoming a playground for the rich. But I don＊t know if you can look back on what the lower-east side was like, the Times Square of the 1970s or the upper Manhattan, the Washington Heights of the 1970s, and think, ＆Oh man, this was a paradise.＊ There were profound problems of dispossession and crime and pain, there were people who were asking the question in the late 70s: can New York survive?§It is not by chance that a cinema glimpsed in the first episode is showing  (1971), a post-apocalyptic movie in which Charlton Heston plays the lone survivor of a plague. By the mid-70s, New York was in a fiscal slump 每 immortalised in the  每 and violent crime was rife. The sexual revolution, and changes in the legal definition of obscenity, helped throw prudishness to the winds and bring sex and commerce together in a hive of peep-show stalls, live sex shows and teenage prostitution. Is it a coincidence that this is the time and place where Donald Trump grew up and forged his business career?Simon says drily: ※Growing up is a phrase I would not use about the president of the United States. I don＊t know where he grew up. I have no explanation, I have a million explanations, for this man and what he lacks as a human being. Certainly he＊s misogynist and his understanding of sexual equality is minimal and he＊s drawn to him an incredible reservoir of anger against women and against people of colour. There＊s a lot of anger out there in American society; he＊s drawn all of it to him and he＊s weaponised it. It＊s interesting.§Asked what the 2016 presidential election told him about America, Simon replies: ※It said to me 25 to 30% of our population is foolish and untrustworthy and incapable of self-governance, and that a demagogue in the right circumstances with the right amount of manipulation can go a long way. It also said that for all of her flaws, and she was not a perfect candidate in any sense, a much more plausible female candidate was at that moment in time problematic for America. We demonstrated a distaste for the idea of a woman president that transformed a lot of votes. I certainly woke up in a different America from the one that I thought I was in.§His comments bring to mind the way Trump lurked behind Hillary Clinton during one of their presidential debates. She has subsequently written how  and wondered if she should have told him: ※Back up you creep, get away from me! I know you love to intimidate women, but you can＊t intimidate me, so back up.§ Trump＊s campaign rallies regularly featured material referring to Clinton as a ※bitch§.Simon notes that Clinton received nearly 3 million more votes than Trump last November, only to lose the White House because of the quirks of the electoral college. ※I certainly don＊t think he represents the aspirations of the United States of America, but he certainly got enough votes that he gets to play at that.§Simon is a former reporter on the  and his  still describes him as a journalist, along with author and TV writer/ producer. He frequently bashes Trump on the medium. Recently, after the president criticised the media as dishonest and divisive, Simon tweeted: But the paradox of Trump is that major media organisations are galvanised in their work and booming in terms of readers and viewers.※I think high-end journalism has been given a second wind,§ Simon agrees, ※primarily because of the direct attack on press freedoms that this administration has engaged in. Whatever existential crisis came to journalism from having mismanaged its revenue stream, I think, has been overcome by the fact people at the  and  and mainstream media, , , a lot of the core institutions in journalism, now know exactly why they＊re there and what their job is.※Were there any errors in terms of how television particularly allowed itself to be used by a demagogue during the election? Absolutely. But from late in the election cycle to the present moment I think there＊s been a lot of good, aggressive journalism that has in some very basic ways been assertive for democratic values. The problems of the revenue stream in regional journalism 每 in municipal and state coverage 每 still exist. And we haven＊t resolved issues of the revenue stream and the internet, but I would say if you didn＊t know why you were still a reporter before November, you do now.§Among the innumerable things that Trump has upended is a project that Simon was working on with his childhood hero, Carl Bernstein, who with Washington Post colleague Bob Woodward exposed the Watergate scandal that brought down president Richard Nixon. ※The piece is based on his insight that while the presidency is still the presidency, and the supreme court is still the judiciary, it＊s the legislative branch of American government that has become dysfunctional, has become purchased by capital, and it can＊t function, it can＊t do its job any more. Carl＊s argument was: that＊s where the drama has to be. We have to find a way to tell that story.※We had to throw out 60-65% of the construct of the world when Trump won. When we wrote it, we＊d presumed that either a mainstream Democratic party functionary or Republican functionary would win, so either a [Mitt] Romney type or a Clinton type. It did not presume an insurgency that was going to weaken both political parties and win. So the decision was made 每 we＊d better shoot this after the election, make sure, and then, as the election happened, it was clear that whatever else we＊d done we＊d saved  about $12-14m of what would have been wasted money.§Simon, Bernstein and co-writers Ed Burns and Bill Zorzi have since met to restructure the show and work out how to keep it relevant to the political moment. Evidently Simon is as hungry as ever, 15 years after , which still seems certain to be in the first paragraph of his obituary.※I don＊t have any resentment towards ,§ he says briskly. ※I＊m proud of that work and it has allowed me and the people I work with to do other work that might not have been greenlit had  not been a success.§Could  be made today and look more or less the same? In 2015 , an African American, sparked widespread unrest in Baltimore. The murder rate is now the highest in the city＊s modern history.※There was a brief moment where I thought the drug war was going to be ratcheted down in Obama＊s last term, when they started to actually address mass incarceration and the drug prohibition, but [attorney general] Jeff Sessions has seen to that, hasn＊t he, at least on the federal level. So probably we could make the show similar. Would there be some emphasis on some other things? Probably.§Although highly regarded in his field, Simon is no TV addict. He loves  (※excellent work§) and admires ,  and the Canadian series , but has not seen  or . Nor has he succumbed to the craze for : ※I have a cousin who＊s read the books. He tells me you＊ve got to read the books first. I＊ve heard it＊s excellent.§ Instead he spends evenings reading 每 he＊s currently researching the Spanish civil war 每 or watching baseball.※I tend not to watch shows until they finish and then somebody will come to me and say, ＆No, no, they knew what they were doing, they knew where they were going＊, and so I＊ll be sticking in DVDs or downloads two years after something＊s on the air. It＊s certainly hypocritical when I guess I＊m asking people to watch my television shows in real time. But nothing＊s worse than giving eight hours, when you could have read a couple of books, to find out, boy, that was a great idea but those guys really didn＊t have a plan＃ so I end up taking the guesswork out of it by being late to everything.§ came about when an assistant location manager from  told Simon and Pelecanos about a man he knew in New York, a veteran of the old 42nd Street cesspool. ※He kept saying, ＆You gotta meet him, you gotta hear these stories＊, and George and I were very ambivalent because the idea of doing a show about pornography and prostitution seemed gratuitous. Since the advent of premium cable, when they got rid of the advertisers, there had been a lot of porn pilots that had gone nowhere and, in our view, rightly so.§But one afternoon in New York they agreed to meet the man, learning that he and his twin brother had once been mob fronts for the bars and massage parlours of yore. ※After two or three hours listening to him tell stories, George and I pretended to go take a walk and have a smoke 每 although neither of us smoke 每 and I said to George, ＆My God, I think we＊re going to have to write a pilot here, I think we＊re going to have to do something with this. This is amazing material.＊※The characters, the world and some of the themes that began to emerge, that really appealed to me in terms of labour and capital and the product being itself the labourer: flesh is the commodity here. And how the money and the power array themselves and how they don＊t. The more we talked, the better it got, so we started to think that we might be able to do it in a way that wasn＊t gratuitous, and that led to a lot of discussion and eventually we took a shot at a pilot and trying to world-build.§Simon continues: ※It felt like we were starting in on it just from this guy＊s stories about Times Square, which is this physical plant where a lot of the industry began. It felt like we had something by the tail, but the more you think about it, the more we asked him about what happened to this character, what happened to her, what happened to him. These were the people who were there at the beginning, who were experiencing this moment where it went out to the greater world.※The answers he gave us were never: ＆She married a podiatrist and she lives in Scarsdale and she has two kids and a garage.＊ The answers were always attritive and painful. Now you＊re dealing with something that＊s not a lighthearted romp through the sex industry. Now you＊re getting into the guts of something that is interesting. So the guy＊s stories were compelling, the characters he was describing for us were compelling and the outcomes were telling.§Simon and Pelecanos went on to consult porn stars, police, waiters, lawyers and journalists from the era, acquiring other stories on the way. They hope to be recommissioned for a second and third series that will take the story into the mid-80s. The mission, of course, was to humanise the protagonists 每 including the pimps and porn stars 每 and render them with their own distinct voices and personalities. They were determined that, despite personal misgivings about the coarsening effect of pornography on society, they would maintain a dispassionate reporter＊s eye and not get into the business of preaching. Early reviews suggest they have succeeded.Simon explains: ※We were not particularly interested in having a heightened moral debate over the worth or utility or damage from drugs in  每 that＊s not what  was about. Certainly I think the use of illicit drugs is on the whole destructive to individuals and to society, but the war against them I think is infinitely worse and doesn＊t in any way mitigate the damage from drugs. I was much more interested in how power and money array themselves around the drug war and around the industry of illegal drugs.※The same logic applies in , which is much less interested in having a discussion about whether pornography is good or bad or prostitution is good or bad. I accept these things as the given in the human condition. Now, if they＊re going to exist, where does the money go? What happens to labour? Who profits? How does the society as a whole array itself to acquire that profit or to participate in it or to acquire the product? These things were way more interesting to me.※Once you allow the moral question to dominate the narrative then I think you end up with a stunted argument and there＊s only so much that can be said. On the other hand, if you follow the money and power and you see who＊s attrited and who＊s exalted, then you have a much more interesting story.§Simon, after all, pushes his audience hard and does not deliver answers neatly tied up with a ribbon. ※In 1971 a 12-year-old kid had to hope to steal his father＊s  magazine from under the mattress and even then it was a much tamer version of anything pornographic in the modern sense: you couldn＊t figure out the facts of life from the centrefold. Do I think we＊re better or worse off nowadays when a 12-year-old with a couple of keystrokes can access the entire construct of human sexuality right down to every misogynist fantasy, that that can be fed into a 12-year-old brain? Probably not a good thing.※But I＊m not sure how you make a narrative out of that and address all the others factors, which I think if you＊re going to do anything, have to be attended to. I think in some ways you can get lost in either being too puritan or too prurient in this piece and what you have to do is basically attend to the why, the why of how this comes to be. That＊s what makes it a grown-up story.§																																											"
"here＊s a common phrase often uttered by established actors working within the studio system to define their career strategy: one for them and one for me. It allows for a steady stream of income from big-budget fodder but also for regular soul-cleansing sojourns into artier territory. Ben Stiller＊s trajectory has often followed this path, and with age, it appears as if he＊s leaning more towards the latter with his regrettable Zoolander sequel proving to be just a greasy appetizer for meatier, festival-dwelling material.After receiving warm notices at Cannes for his role in The Meyerowitz Stories, his third film with Noah Baumbach, he＊s now teaming up with underrated multi-hyphenate Mike White for Brad＊s Status, premiering at Toronto. It＊s familiar territory for Stiller, who＊s found much to explore in similarly introspective comedy dramas, and at times this sense of deja vu threatens to distract from the nifty observations on offer. Brad＊s status? It＊s complicated.Stiller plays the titular character, a family man and the head of a non-profit organization, who feels underwhelmed by the life he＊s made for himself. It＊s not that he has it particularly bad, but his college friends just seem to have it so much better. Brad spends too much time bitterly scrolling through their latest social media updates, seething at the glamorous lifestyles they appear to have, resenting the decisions that led him to where he now is. When he heads to Boston with his son Troy (Austin Abrams) to check out potential colleges, he finds himself in something of a tailspin, his deep-rooted unhappiness boiling to the surface.As with writer/director White＊s finest work, from The Good Girl to short-lived HBO show Enlightened, there＊s a great deal of perceptive humor here. Brad＊s obsession with coveting the constructed Insta-lives of friends is an uneasily recognizable problem, also recently explored in Ingrid Goes West, and his flip-flopping between accepting and rejecting his lot in life makes for similarly uncomfortable viewing. It＊s well-worn territory for Stiller, who＊s riffed on this before in Greenberg and While We＊re Young, and his casting is both well-suited and somewhat repetitive. It＊s infinitely more pleasurable to see him in a more nuanced comedy, but his dissatisfied indie schtick is in danger of becoming just as overused as his broader Meet the Parents persona. He skates perilously close here but his performance remains one of the most consistent pleasures of what feels like a patchier version of far superior films. White＊s screenplay is hampered by a rather redundant voiceover that＊s full of tiresomely on-the-nose realizations (※Sometimes in life you can lose the plot§ and ※This is not the life I imagined§ feeling particularly inane). It＊s frustratingly lazy and inelegant, clunkily signposting Brad＊s emotional state at points where the viewer is perfectly able to figure it out without such hand-holding. It＊s a film that＊s in need of more confident, subtle direction, with White＊s long-time collaborator Miguel Arteta sadly absent and White himself taking on the job for just the second time.While White might not make for an entirely convincing film-maker, his script still reveals his considerable skills as a humorist. As with his last script for the short, sharp Beatriz at Dinner, he＊s found a way to tap into issues that feel prescient without feeling preachy. Brad＊s funk is the direct result of his fragile, conflicted masculinity. He resents being surrounded by ※beta males§ yet mourns for the political and intellectual idealism of his youth. He both respects and resents money, craving it and idolizing it while critiquing the effect it has on others. He tells his son that as a white kid he＊s now the ※underdog§ and, in one smart extended sequence, a young female student calls out Brad＊s white privilege for his self-obsessed wallowing. But who hasn＊t wanted more even when they arguably have enough? There＊s enough emotional intelligence here to resist labelling Brad a buffoon or a self-diagnosed victim and his complaints will likely resonate with a lot of people. There＊s also a fantastic naturalistic performance from Abrams as Brad＊s son and their conversations have a wonderful beat to them, believably shifting from warmth to tension within seconds. Brad＊s Status is a frustrating concoction. There＊s a script full of insight but also inanity and while the performances might jump out, the direction falls flat. Stiller is back on the right route but, like Brad, he could afford to take a more daring detour every now and then.																																											"
" Love You, Daddy is a screwball comedy, written, directed by and starring  who financed it entirely himself, shot in New York in lustrous black-and-white; it contrives to be a very funny and recklessly provocative homage to Woody Allen, channelling his masterpiece Manhattan and brilliantly finding a fictional way to tackle his personal reputation head-on. Maybe only Louis CK could have got away with such a controversial subject - that＊s if he has got away with it - and done so with such elegant wit. With his hang-dog expression, the gloomy eyes behind the heavy glasses (which he occasionally removes to rub his face, wearily) he looks eerily like any actor in a later Woody Allen movie who is tacitly called upon to ventriloquise the Woody role. But he is notably less romantic; there is a hint of Larry David there, too. Louis plays Glen Topher, a guy who in mid-career has found sensational success in television, writing and directing smash-hit comedies. He is extremely wealthy, with a huge apartment and fancy offices in New York. Edie Falco plays his long-suffering production manager and Charlie Day is the wacky comedy star and best buddy that hangs out with him. He has tense relationships with his ex-wife (Helen Hunt) and ex-girlfriend (Pamela Adlon). But the most important person in his life is his outrageously sexy and spoiled 17-year-old daughter China, played by . She is now living with him in his palatial apartment, slinking about the place in a bikini and asking him for Spring Break trips to Florida and use of his private jet. And he can refuse her nothing. At the end of almost every sentence she coos: ※I love you, daddy.§ Her heart, to quote the old song, belongs to daddy. But it＊s not entirely creepy. There is genuine affection.Yet having allowed us to see the resemblance to Woody and Mariel Hemingway, the film springs another comparison on us: like Woody, Louis is discontented with the world of TV, and hero-worships an ageing movie director, who has worked a lot in Europe - played with self-satirising elegance by . This man has the toxic reputation of being sexually obsessed with young girls - but Glen angrily rejects any criticism of him on these grounds, insisting that this ill-informed gossip has no relevance to the work. But then he and China are invited to an A-list party hosted by a star Glen might now be in love with (played by Rose Byrne) and the great man is there. Glen is as tongue-tied and awkward as any fan. But to his rage, he realises the awful truth: his lovely daughter China has caught this man＊s hooded eye - and she is mesmerised by his seductive charm. They are about to have an affair, breaking Glen＊s heart into the bargain, twice over, both as dad and fan-worshipper, and there＊s not a thing he can do about it.The two quasi-Woodies come into horribly ironic conflict, a generational dispute of patriarchal ownership, and it is a duplication that Louis has crafted with his own kind of insouciance. Both the famous film director and famous TV writer have a good deal in common: they have a patronising way with young women. And Louis CK provocatively, even outrageously, allows his heroes to talk down to China - ※mansplaining§, to use the term that Glen just about concedes is accurate. Glen presumes to tell his daughter that she doesn＊t understand what feminism is. Malkovich＊s auteur lectures her on the same subject - and she listens politely. Later, Rose Byrne attempts to mollify the furious Glen, telling him that she had a relationship with an older man when she was a teenager. ※Well you were raped,§ says Glen. With any other comic, or actor, you might wince at a moment like this, at its sheer male presumption, and to be honest I did wince. But Louis CK carries it off with his strangely artless, almost maladroit sincerity. And it is very funny. 																																											"
"alachi O＊Doherty deserves praise for journeying into the interior world of Sinn F谷in president . This unauthorised biography of the great Irish republican survivor seeks to psychoanalyse Adams like no other book before. It is a journey into a heart of darkness and in particular the dark secrets that were only unlocked in 2009 about , and the shadow that cast on the entire family.The author is critical of Adams＊s role in support of the IRA＊s ※armed struggle§, but is also scrupulously fair in noting that without him there would be no ceasefire, no peace process, no movement from violence into constitutional politics. One of the most striking revelations in this book is how, from even the 1980s, the British security and political establishment saw Adams＊s survival at the top of the republican movement as essential in directing the organisation away from armed insurrection. Cynically, as O＊Doherty reveals, others were targeted by loyalist paramilitaries so that Adams could remain in power.  by Malachi O＊Doherty is published by Faber (?14.99).

"n a roundabout way we have Rupert Murdoch to thank for Ally McBeal, the show about a neurotic Boston lawyer that aired on the Murdoch-owned Fox and is celebrating its 20th anniversary today. The fact that this is being marked is testament to a programme that was one of the first popular ※dramedies§, with the Emmy awards struggling to decide on the comedy or drama categories (). That dilemma is something that is prevalent with shows these days, proving Ally McBeal＊s influence 每 but back then, straddling of genres was new.I was eight when the show 每 created by  每 first aired: too young to catch it first time around. But in my early teens I became obsessed with it. In the pre-Netflix era, binge-watching wasn＊t the universal habit it is now, but I bought all of the box-sets in an old-stock sale from Blockbusters and devoured them. Ally was the first show I pushed on friends during sleepovers, air-drumming to  每 and, given that I had ambitions to be a barrister, it was aspirational. (I did do work experience in barristers＊ chambers, which I loved, though it turned out a magistrates court in Birkenhead was somewhat different to those on TV.)In almost all ways, Ally McBeal was ahead of its time: stylistically, thematically and in what we would now call the ※diversity§ of its cast and subjects. Although , representation is a more accurate word.This was a show that had black characters and Asian-American characters whose presence had nothing to do with the fact that they were black or Asian-American, as is too often the case. It had a  and featured two trans characters: the first, Stephanie, appearing in a recurring role in the first season (1997) and the next, Cindy, in 2000. The writers didn＊t shy away from holding up a mirror to society＊s structures and discriminations through its many case plots.Then there was the furore about feminism. In a , the magazine somehow asked: ※Is feminism dead?§ and put a cutout of Calista Flockhart (who played the title character) next to Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. Quite aside from the lol-ness that is putting a fictional character 每 let alone a comic one 每 against, you know, , I have never agreed with Time＊s feminist critique of Ally McBeal, a show that frequently dealt with workplace discrimination cases, sexist dudes and Ally chucking her high heels off in discomfort.More undermining of feminism was the media＊s obsession with the fact that Ally dared to wear short skirt suits and was thin. This was a professional woman (who makes partner in the firm at the end of the show＊s run) respected by her colleagues; who buys and then fixes up her own house; who has casual sex and doesn＊t feel bad about it. Again, early-teens me almost saw her as a role-model, but also, not unusual. And that normality was the most important and formative thing.Sure, Ally was quite often fixated with finding her perfect man and the . But she never fell apart when single (see the house). She experimented with her sexuality (all in all, she ) and had solid friendships with both men and women. Ally was not the only successful woman: you can take your pick from the many strong female leads. Richard Fish found older women attractive, becoming enamoured with ※wattles§ (what we＊d call jowls, I guess). If anything, the relationships between the female characters were authentic, both the bad and the good.Decades before the current debate on toxic masculinity, this issue was also explored via the character of John Cage (Peter MacNicol). In one episode, he wears a muscle body suit under his shirts to assuage his concerns about his lack of a six-pack. He was sensitive, and, with a secret hideaway to read and think, romantic too.Meanwhile, Ally was as neurotic as anything and went to regular therapy. At least two of the cast members had offscreen mental health issues during filming: Robert Downey Jr had addiction problems and Lisa Nicole Carson (Renee), who has bipolar disorder, was hospitalised during filming and  behind the camera.Apart from all of this, the show was . The writing was sharp, smart, smutty, witty, wacky 每 and so were the characters. , for instance, as the hilarious, attention-seeking secretary Elaine (※Whatever it was, I＊m sorry I missed it§), who later went on to be just as funny in 30 Rock. The double act of Richard Fish (Greg Germann) and John Cage was a dream (see also: John＊s nose whistle, tics and ). Nell and Ling＊s sizzling feud, which eventually thawed. There were hard-hitting dramatic moments, tear-jerking plot twists, but the atmosphere of warmth and fun was ever present, as in the legendary after-work bar scenes.The musical guests were proper stars: Michael Jackson, Barry White, Tina Turner, Elton John, , Gloria Gaynor, Al Green. I＊d even credit Ally McBeal with my introduction to blues and jazz.Add to this the stylistic risks and directing quirks, much emulated since. The bathroom dancing; Ally＊s hallucinations (one of which, , originated as one of the first ever internet viral sensations); random special effects; true slapstick. The cases, too, were interesting, with many modelled on real-life events (since a commonplace trope, as with ). I first learnt about Oliver Sacks＊  because of the show. I won＊t pretend that the quality of the show didn＊t decline towards the end: the ludicrous decision to introduce Dame Edna Everage as a character (what? No). That pretty much killed it for me. And . And Ally＊s long-lost daughter (played by Hayden Panettiere, who went on to star in Heroes). As soon as a ※long-lost§ character is introduced, you know a show is in decline. I＊m even going to admit to the fact I didn＊t like the character of Billy (Gil Bellows) and was glad to see the back of him (sacrilege). While many of the cast alumni have gone on to great things (Portia de Rossi in Arrested Development, for example), some of the actors haven＊t done much since. And I＊m a . But what a treasure this show was: everyone could recognise themselves in someone, with all varieties of humanity on display. I＊ll even forgive Ally for being an early adopter of the adults-on-scooters trend. See, ahead of its time in all things.

"or almost two decades now, comedy duo Tim (Heidecker) and Eric (Wareheim) have honed their absurdist and often gross sketch comedy. After a summer of touring and the recent 10th anniversary special of The Awesome Show, they＊ve become the kings of out-there alternative comedy, by way of mock infomercials, situational humor, and the occasional song-and-dance routine. The second season of Bedtime Stories, their mock-horror after-hours series on Adult Swim, returns this month to magnify the humdrum tropes of suburban American life, cementing the duo as two of comedy＊s most amusing satirists.EW: We＊re both musicians, so it＊s kind of going back to our roots. There＊s no editing and, immediately, you have a finished product. When we make Bedtime Stories it＊s months of preparation. But our show is a train-wreck of a live experience. That＊s exciting for us after slaving away at TV for so many years.TH: When we would first tour and do festivals, it was hard. You were doing what you thought was funny and sometimes people would look at you like you＊re an idiot. But now we＊re doing this for kids who were raised on our comedy. They＊re like, ※I started watching you when I was 12 and I＊m 22 now.§ We don＊t have to educate them about what we think is funny. So in some ways, it＊s not such a fight. They＊re also scared of us, so there＊s no heckling.TH: If someone opens their mouth I start screaming at them. It＊s not an interactive show.EW: We met in the dorm and our floor was mostly basketball players, a lot of big guys. And there were about four of us that looked a little different and had more of a rock＆n＊roll, hippie vibe. I myself was more an emo, hardcore dude. And we just bonded out of desperation. TH: We thought we were going to be serious filmmakers. But everyone＊s work was just awful and hard to watch. It would just be unbearable. Our stuff was nothing to write home about either.EW: We both loved comedy, but we also loved serious, dramatic things as well. And as any 18-year-old goes to college we quickly realized, there＊s no way. So we made these little shorts. We＊ve always been major self-promoters, even as a joke. We called ourselves TimAndEric.com and put our little videos on our website before there was YouTube. The moment where it felt like we could so something bigger was when we were in the Philadelphia film festival. [The pair＊s animated film] Tom Goes to the Mayor played for a couple hundred people and they were laughing really hard. We were like, ＆Oh shit, that＊s more than just our friends＊.EW: We love local shops and we love the idea of desperate working men, and dads having to do stuff for their families. All those themes are great. So we love keeping things grounded in that reality. These little dingy locations are fun and they help give this nice patina to the look and vibe of the story.TH: I grew up in a car dealership because my dad ran one. And in my head, in the script, it was a car dealership. You always see these guys standing around bullshitting, there＊s nobody coming in. So it was a car dealership for a long time and then once we started to prep, it was hard to find one and we＊ve got to be there for a few days, so it became really impractical. And the piano store is so much better, so much funnier, and so much more grim, because, like, how many pianos do you sell everyday? Who comes in to buy a piano?EW: We tried to keep it exactly like the old days. We hired the same friends who helped us edit and create the show, we tried to bring back the same characters, we shot it almost on the same camera. We did learn a lot of production tricks over the last ten years, how to speed things up and keep things efficient. But I feel like we nailed the vibe. My favorite comment from the fans thus far is that it is a continuation rather than a reunion.TH: Obviously our stuff is very influenced by the state of the world right now, but Eric and I from the beginning of our work together just generally reject current events more than anything because it always fades pretty quickly and other people were doing it better. That wasn＊t really where our common interests were. At the same time, I think our work has always been very political because it＊s a reflection of the culture, and a satire of it. So we＊re not going on about what happened in the news this week, but it＊s all there, the stupidity of consumerism, it＊s all in the work.																																											"
"Not so long ago, the big-screen take on Stephen King＊s It seemed to be heading down the storm drain into a whirling purgatory of corporate clumsiness. The film＊s original director, True Detective＊s Cary Fukunaga,  with studio New Line. Then Will Poulter, Fukunaga＊s first choice for Pennywise the Clown, the most famous incarnation of the shape-shifting, fear-imbibing monster of the title, was forced off the project due to scheduling conflicts.Yet somehow, here we are two years later with a movie directed by the Argentine horror film-maker Andr谷s Muschietti that has a on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and has been praised by both  and , who played Pennywise so memorably in the flawed but occasionally glorious 1990 TV miniseries. So how does the new It compare to the TV version, and is Bill Skarsg?rd＊s leering killer clown a patch on Curry＊s? Here is your chance to weigh in on the film＊s key talking points.Released in 1990 in two parts by ABC in the US, the first It is a troubling beast. Frankly, if there was ever a good case for a remake, this was, well, it. While Curry＊s performance is among his most memorable, the films suffer from the lower production values inherent in television movie-making at the time. The acting is pretty shonky in places, and  for the climactic battle is one of the most infamous examples of terrible special effects work ever seen on any screen, big or small.By contrast, the new  feels loved by its makers. Muschietti gives a glimpse into the dark heart of each member of the Losers Club, the gang of outsiders who decide to rid the small town of Derry, Maine, of the hideous Pennywise. Most of us, while growing up, came into contact with a Henry Bowers, the sociopathic local bully who terrorises the geeks and freaks of Derry in King＊s book. And while the movie personifies the torment and horror of teenage existence as a burlesque clown, we can all recognise the feeling of always having to keep an eye out for danger. This It＊s chills feel genuine and earned.Without , Netflix＊s paean to King and spooky 1980s cinema, it is unlikely the new It would have achieved as much buzz. If the producers did not actively seek to cash in on the Duffer brothers＊ vivid tale of small-town supernatural goings-on, they have certainly done little to dispel the sense that Muschietti＊s film can be viewed as a companion piece to the TV series. The casting of Finn Wolfhard, the 14-year-old Canadian actor who played Mike Wheeler in Stranger Things, as Richie Tozier may have been a coincidence, but it＊s not the only similarity between the two.It and Stranger Things are both set in a small rural town beset by a supernatural entity, both feature groups of children who feel cut off and disconnected from their peers, and both feature a female newcomer who shakes things up in unexpected ways. New Line has even moved the timeline of King＊s novel from the 1950s to the 1980s, bringing It into line with the period setting of its TV cousin. All this was probably to be expected, given that Matt and Ross Duffer only created Stranger Things after  was turned down by Warner Bros. Would you agree that none of this is really an issue? For while It lacks Stranger Things＊ depth and doesn＊t have the TV show＊s startlingly good adult cast, it makes up for any shortfalls with sheer bloodthirsty insouciance. Where Stranger Things is closer to supernatural sci-fi, It＊s horror leanings are plain for all to see.Yes, Skarsg?rd has the aid of prosthetics to add to the killer clown＊s sideshow freakishness, whereas Curry relied on his natural proficiency for physical theatricality. But the Swedish actor＊s take on It, from the moment we first see him in that murky storm drain, is a revelation. There may be something of Heath Ledger＊s Joker, and a Depression-era New Yoik gangsterism to Skarsgard＊s vowels, but his ability to go from quiet, leering menace to nightmarish attack mode in a split second is a big part of the appeal. The Swede also seems to have coaxed better performances from his youthful co-stars than Curry managed. Certainly there is a twisted, curdled connection between the clown and his victims that feels horribly real.One of the reasons  is an iconic writer is that he ventures into territory others fear. Children＊s horror is a tricky sub-genre because the idea of deriving entertainment from viewing the abuse of those members of our society who are too young to protect themselves seems wrongheaded in the extreme. Yet it is for precisely this reason that It retains the power to shock. If you weren＊t outraged, at least momentarily, when tiny, defenceless Georgie had his arm ripped off by Pennywise in the opening moments of Muschietti＊s film, then the director really wasn＊t doing his job.A cheap trick, to turn what was always intended as a two-part project into a standalone movie and its sequel, you might think, via that final-scene reveal. But who wouldn＊t be back for part two after witnessing the excellence of the first film 每 if only to see if they make a better job of the interdimensional giant spider this time around.

"his empathic documentary follows an experimental programme that helps convicts at Folsom state prison in California and volunteer citizens confront their darkest feelings through group therapy. Shaped by recent therapeutic approaches aimed at men with issues involving violence, substance abuse and childhood trauma, the programme gets the guys all chanting, crying, screaming, raging and, above all, talking about what happened to get them where they are now.In the case of the prisoners, that＊s often a lot of bad luck and poor decision-making. But what is really fascinating is watching how the ordinary joes 每 aware of being there but for the grace of God 每 learn from the inmates, inspired by their courage to ※jump in the fire§ and expose their deepest fears and anxieties. The constant therapy-speak may be squirm-inducing for more uptight British viewers, and risks confirming suspicions about the huggy-feely nature of Californians of all classes, but for the open-minded this is moving, even wrenching viewing that might inspire similar approaches in British institutions. The dry, strictly observational shooting style means the doc stays in the moment and rarely ventures out of the room where the programme unfolds, adding immediacy. It＊s also essential viewing for aficionados of intricate tattoo art.																																											"
"ho will be on the Man Booker shortlist? If you go by the bookies＊ odds, Colson Whitehead () is a cert to be selected, followed by Jon McGregor (), George Saunders () and Sebastian Barry (). After that there＊s less agreement, but Mike McCormack () and Kamila Shamsie () have the next shortest odds on average. This would be a shortlist with two Americans, two Brits and two Irish writers, with only one woman left in the field and half the books set in 19th-century America.Paul Auster, the oldest and arguably most illustrious author on the longlist, is rated a no-hoper set to?join the first-timers, Emily Fridlund and Fiona Mozley, in the judges＊ reject pile; while Arundhati Roy, the only previous winner in contention, and former shortlistee Mohsin Hamid are also relegated to the back of?the pack. Above them both Ali Smith and Zadie Smith are seen as just outside the elite group.But how reliable are these odds likely to be? At this point last year four of the authors who made the 2016 shortlist - the eventual winner Paul Beatty, Deborah Levy, David Szalay and Madeleine Thien - were in Ladbrokes＊ top six, which isn＊t bad 每 but the problem has always been picking a favourite: Ladbrokes＊ No 1 then, Ian McGuire, and JM Coetzee and AL Kennedy, co-favourites at William Hill (seemingly not offering odds this year, presumably because ※Booker bookie§ Graham Sharpe left the firm in April) , all failed even to be finalists.That could be ominous for 2/1 frontrunner Whitehead (unimpressively identified as ※Colson White§ on Ladbrokes＊ site at the time of writing), but an unusual aspect of the 2017 longlist potentially points to the odds, including his, being more reliable. This is the presence of a trio of novels (all 2016 titles) already festooned with awards - a National Book and Pulitzer double for , a Costa novel and book of the year double for , the Goldsmiths prize for . In contrast, Saunders and McGregor, respectively former Folio and Impac winners, appear to be high up for the more conventional reason of success with earlier books.Of recent Booker winners, Richard Flanagan was a 16/1 backmarker in 2014 and Marlon James was at 20/1 in 2015. In this year＊s markedly stellar longlist, big names are on offer at big prices (Bet365 has Roy at 19/1 and Auster at 23/1), not just relative unknowns; and fans will snap up the longest odds available for Shamsie (15/1) and the Smiths (both 12/1) before they shorten (if they get on it) after the shortlist is revealed. Barry＊s Ladbrokes odds went from 9/1 to 6/1 this week, but Bet365＊s are still surprisingly generous: Britain and Ireland＊s reigning (Costa) book of the year, and it＊s only 10/1?

"ust the snow. And the silence. That＊s all.§ With these agonised words in the movie＊s dying minutes, a key character summarises its two ambient ideas: a deathly whiteout in the piercing cold and an oppressive quiet, far from the city＊s bustle where help in a crisis might conceivably be at hand. Screenwriter Taylor Sheridan 每 who scripted Denis Villeneuve＊s  and David Mackenzie＊s  每 now makes his hyphenate debut as a writer-director with this gripping movie, muscular in its confidence and storytelling punch, the kind you could call a western forensic thriller. There＊s some Cormac McCarthy in here, and a tiny bit of Patricia Cornwell. We get country lore and the wearing of stetsons, and scenes with horses being treated with loving connoisseurship and respect, but also a gruesome autopsy, featuring a medical examiner looking faintly eccentric and blandly unshockable amid the gore in the time-honoured manner.The setting is the , a vast, wintry area of land in central Wyoming. Here, the overstretched police force have been called to attend a crime scene: a young Native American woman, Natalie (Kelsey Asbille) has been found dead in the snow, with a head wound and evidence of sexual assault. An FBI agent is called in from Las Vegas: this is Jane Banner, played by . She is inexperienced and physically untested but courageous, mentally tough and willing to learn 每 similar in style and relatability to the gutsy operative Emily Blunt played in Sicario (and not a million miles, in fact, from Jodie Foster＊s classic federal agent ).Agent Banner is way out of her depth. She needs help, particularly in talking to the Native American community, and the Comanche actor Gil Birmingham is excellent as Natalie＊s grieving father, Martin. And so Jane teams up with the guy who found the body in the first place: a professional game tracker called Cory Lambert, who lost his own daughter some years ago in brutal circumstances. He is used to tackling predators, and offers his own off-the-record services. He is played with maturity and presence by , in perhaps his best performance so far.Cory＊s own predator credentials are established with resounding force at the outset. A wolf menaces a flock of sheep and gets taken out with a sniper＊s bullet in a brutal manner, which is also a premonition of the human-on-human violence to which all this is leading. Cory wears white camouflage garb out there in the snowy mountainside, and it looks weirdly like a hazmat suit.The snow is the paradox; it is their friend and their enemy. Tellingly, the medical examiner says that he can＊t register the cause of death as homicide but rather as the snowy cold itself 每 the catastrophic effect subzero temperatures have on the lungs. This means that a full criminal investigation can＊t be mobilised, but it does force them into unofficial and very effective inquiries. Snow is what causes tracks to be visible: an eerie trace of what happened and when, and Cory has an almost Sherlockian grasp of what different tracks mean. But the snow impedes their progress, and more snow effaces the tracks themselves.With simplicity and style, Sheridan walks us through the various suspects and locals, through Agent Banner＊s own learning curve and through the delicate steps of her relationship with Cory, which is taken adroitly to the very brink of something romantic. When she comes to his apartment, a scene that is to disclose Cory＊s direct interest in the case, he asks her if she＊d like a drink. For a moment, we are interestingly allowed to absorb the possibility of flirtation before Cory reveals the choices he has in mind: milk, coffee or well water. Banner chooses water, and the tempo and mood is coolly recalibrated.When the complete explanation has to be produced, Sheridan does it by means of a single, unselfconsciously clear flashback, which lets us understand everything without the accumulation of indirect revelations that another movie might have considered essential. But it cancels any possible anticlimax that could follow this scene with a brutally violent sequence in the present tense.Sheridan is emerging as a master of the Mexican standoff, the shootout, the stomach-turning crime scene, the procedural office politics, but he＊s also adept at tuning into the vulnerability and strength of the women and men called in to uphold the law. Wind River is a smart and very satisfying movie.																																											"

"※I can＊t tell you how extraordinary it is for this to happen,§ said author and 2017 Miles Franklin award-winner Josephine Wilson. ※It＊s not the sort of thing I ever imagined would happen to me.§On Thursday night, Wilson was revealed as the 60th winner of Australia＊s most high-profile literary prize for fiction for her novel, Extinctions, which was hailed by the judges as ※compassionate and unapologetically intelligent§.Wilson told Guardian Australia she was ※absolutely thrilled§ to receive the award, which comes with a $60,000 cash prize, but said she did not write with thought to any financial rewards. ※Writing takes a very long time and its labour far exceeds the returns, regardless of the prize money. You can＊t really quantify that,§ she said. The Western Australian author said on the day she found out she spent most of the afternoon missing calls from one of the judges, convinced she was about to be told she had not been successful. ※Of course, one always has hopes,§ Wilson said. ※I hoped that my book would touch a chord and be read and appreciated beyond myself and my smaller community.§Wilson describes Extinctions as a novel ※trying to come to understand the emotional complexity of belonging§. The story follows retired engineer Frederick Lothian, an expert on concrete who, at 69, is a relatively young and reclusive resident of a retirement village. His life changes when he strikes up a friendship with his neighbour, Jan, and the secrets of his past confront him anew. Wilson said writing the novel was a way for her to think through issues and ideas, including questioning the limits of personal responsibility and how much people are shaped by their environment and historical context.The novel was also inspired partly by her own experience of adopting a child. ※I was also thinking a great deal about family and post-biological families, and do we need to give birth to love? The question of adoption was really very central to my thinking and reading around the book,§ she said. ※I was really engaged and thinking a lot about Australian history and the history of Indigenous adoption, fostering, and the Stolen Generation and what that meant. So I was really thinking about what a family means and what a family can be.§The award, named for 20th century Australian writer Stella ※Miles§ Franklin, was established in 1957 to be given to a novel of ※the highest literary merit§ that shows ※Australian life in any of its phases§. The judging panel this year included State Library of NSW librarian Richard Neville, Sydney bookseller Lindy Jones, critic Dr Melinda Harvey, columnist for the Australian, Murray Waldren, and Emeritus Professor Susan Sheridan. , including: Last Days of Ava Langdon by Mark O＊Flynn; Waiting by Philip Salom; An Isolated Incident by Emily Maguire; and Their Brilliant Careers by Ryan O＊Neill. ※A book can have a very short shelf life,§ Wilson said. This was especially true for books from smaller publishers, she said 每 Extinctions is published by UWA Publishing 每 so the recognition that accompanied being long- or short-listed for the prize was just as important.※If you are insecure, which most writers I know are 每 you are stumbling around in the dark often with something you＊re working on,§ she said. ※There＊s all these unknowns and it takes an enormous strength to believe that something can come of it.※We make decisions for writing which take us away from whatever work we might do that brings an income immediately, or we put aside the writing because we don＊t have any faith that anything can come of it. So the Miles Franklin is enormously influential for writers for that reason. It gives us faith 每 and I think it gives the public more faith 每 in the books.§																																											"

Adele and Chris Martin led the musical tributes, at the Grammy and Brit awards respectively. While recent years hadn＊t yielded classic material, it was a major wrench 每 the loss of an artist with a rare emotional clarity who took queerness into the mainstream.Hopes that it would be a brand new classic are slightly dashed 每 it＊s a rework of , a 1990 B-side included on Freedom! ＊90 in the US and Waiting for That Day in the UK, later featured on a 2016 reissue of Listen Without Prejudice. But it＊s now been given a substantial refresh. Where the original is driven by a 90s breakbeat and some even more 90s horns, this new version has been pioneered by Nile Rodgers, who George apparently commissioned before he died. ※I hope we make the fans proud of the amount of love we put into it,§ Rodgers has said,  to those who expressed mixed feelings about the posthumous nature of the work, ※You SHOULD have mixed feelings. No one＊s heart was dragged through emotional ambiguity more than mine. Tears, uncertainty, happiness & love§.A classic Rodgers choppy guitar line sits under a freshly minted pop-house rhythm, as Michael＊s voice is pleasantly 每 and quite radically 每 mangled, before segueing into the original＊s top line. Its status as a B-side rather undersells it 每 Michael＊s secret weapon is a half-sung style of rapping that gets a good airing here, and the ※if you ain＊t got time for me, I＊ll find another fantasy§ pay-off is suitably fabulous. The sigh that closes the chorus remains a glorious bit of petulance. Perhaps there isn＊t a Prince-style vault waiting to be raided, and there needn＊t be, given the strength of his existing work. Fantasy meanwhile is a reminder that George Michael could invest a dancefloor with sex and wit like few other pop stars.																																											"
"ne of the biggest shocks of this new  series 每 apart from the sensory pandemonium that comes from hearing Noel Fielding sincerely describing biscuits 每 is Steven Carter-Bailey. If you have been watching, you will know that Steven has won the coveted Star Baker title two weeks out of two, first for his cake that looked like bread and then for his biscuit that you could play chess on.Inevitably, the primary response to this has been outrage. Steven＊s  has been uncovered, and it shows 每 gasp 每 that he is actually really good at baking cakes. Angry viewers have even suggested, although in no way proven, that he might have exchanged some of these cakes for cash. If that＊s the case, the naysayers claim, then Steven qualifies as a professional baker and should be booted off the show. He is too good, they say. He has an unfair advantage.This plugs Bake Off directly into everyone＊s favourite TV conspiracy theory 每 The Secret Ringer. Just as Steven is apparently too good for Bake Off,  has had to defend her place on this year＊s Strictly Come Dancing after some suggested that her time spent in a heavily choreographed girl group gave her a better chance of winning than her competitors. Danny Mac had to do the same thing last year, and Helen George the year before.Grace Davies, a hotly tipped contestant on this year＊s The X Factor, has  after viewers discovered she lived with former X Factor contestant Janet Devlin and had performed with former X Factor host Olly Murs. Britain＊s Got Talent is rammed with stories like this, about singers with over-long CVs and impressionists with TV experience and .This sort of thing has been going on for years. Although viewers like to see talented contestants excel on shows such as these, if they are too talented 每 or have shown too much interest in the subject before signing up 每 then they will cry fix. There is a grey, intangible hinterland that must not be crossed, and it appears that Steven already has one foot in it.How to remedy this? That＊s easy. For next year＊s round of competition programmes, producers should pick only contestants who veer between total inexperience and outright antipathy for their chosen subject. Let＊s find celebrities who have never danced before and book them for Strictly. Let＊s find people who would rather tear their own jaws off than sing in public and sign them up for The X Factor. And, for Bake Off, let＊s dig out bakers who are actively fearful of eggs and burst into tears when confronted with icing. The ※ringer§ narrative has been woven so tightly into the fabric of all these shows that the only way out is to pull everything apart and start from absolute zero. Next year, I want the Star Baker to go to whoever poisons Paul Hollywood the least. That sounds fun, doesn＊t it?																																											"
"I have had the dubious pleasure of living in a hostel on Whitechapel Road for more than 18 months, and I could have told you (or, more pertinently, Thames Water) that there was something very wrong with the sewer over two years ago (, 13 September). In response to the seven bishops (, 14 September), can we expect to hear from Tory MPs and local councillors whose Christian faith makes it impossible for them to vote for cuts in local welfare assistance schemes? Perhaps a vicar＊s daughter somewhere might take the lead. Ian Watson＊s playful comments about the recent Steely Dan correspondence (, 14 September) are somewhat disingenuous. When I shared a flat with Ian in the 70s, he rarely had Steely Dan off the record player and was affectionately known to his flatmates as Kid Charlemagne. Your headline reads ※Bilingual TV crime drama launches Welsh ＆noir＊§ (, 11 September). Where have you been living? Hinterland?																																											"

As a vegan she objects to the fact the polymer banknotes were made using the animal byproduct tallow.She works at Redemption, a vegan restaurant on Old Street in London, where some customers had already expressed unease about the new plastic fivers, introduced last year, which are made the same way.After the bank issued the new ?5 note, one .

He is proud that the cash machine outside his shop was one of the first chosen to distribute the new notes. He attached a homemade sticker to the ATM boasting: ※Polymer ?10 note ready.§Danisan is a collector of old banknotes. He draws a sample from under his till that includes old tenners and fivers and an old ?1 note. It also includes one of the first plastic fivers to run off the presses, featuring a sought-after serial number beginning AA01. ※You can get on them eBay for ?25, but this is not for sale,§ he said.

Danisan looks down at the notes with some disdain. ※I won＊t be collecting those because they haven＊t got AAs on them.§ He holds out hope, however, that there could be serial number treasures hiding in the machine. ※Maybe the bottom set is different,§ he said. Danisan has had to reassure some customers in his shop that the new notes are not forgeries. ※It looks different from the old one,§ said Dominik, a Polish builder, after withdrawing a handful of new tenners from the machine.Asked if he wa a fan of Jane Austen, who features on the note, Dominik said: ※ I don＊t know her.§ Pointing to the picture of the Queen on the other side of the note, he said: ※I only know this one.§ 																																											"
"et in the US some 60 years hence, Omar El Akkad＊s dystopian debut imagines civil war breaking out after a group of southern states revolt against a fossil-fuel ban imposed when extreme flooding leaves Florida under water. The conflict (stoked by a rising pan-Arab empire) is described from the vantage point of the early 22nd century, by a dying historian anxious to record the pivotal role of his Louisiana-born aunt, groomed in childhood to join the insurgency against the north. While there＊s no shortage of action in her grisly journey from victim to aggressor,  is solemn, slow and somewhat schoolmasterly in its grim determination to bring the miseries of present-day trouble spots to the US.

"he  has all sorts of upsides. ※I＊m in my pyjamas,§ quips Jessie Ware, just a handful of songs into her set, ※so I can go straight to bed.§ As the crow flies, we are not all that far from her east London home.Wrapped in elegant satin and shod in checked stilettos, a beaming Ware is surrounded by five band members and a lush, verdant stage setting lit by large, sunflower-like lamps. It＊s as redolent of a fashion shoot as it is of electrified music performance. Since her first album, 2012＊s , Ware＊s visual signature has been as recherche as her sound. Both exude a sleek, grown-up classicism derived from soul and the age of 80s video-pop:  and billowing white curtains, are, metaphorically, never far away.Hearing Ware again after a two-year absence, however, it＊s striking how strong her good songs remain, and also how much just-so filler she has been responsible for. Seemingly insubstantial,  每 the title track of  每 gets ecstatic, deserved whoops from the crowd on its first notes. It pins Ware as a gossamer 80s stylist, one whose minimalism and?vocal restraint add up to a very high-end product. By contrast, an early-set run of songs like  and No to Love tend towards muzak this evening.Her maternity leave has also resulted in a brand new album, the forthcoming . A striking new track, , starts off as a breathless come-hither, then resolves?into a 70s soul vamp, injecting?a little more oomph into Ware＊s glistening catalogue.Its fellow, , is equally striking, a bossa nova confection that recalls the Cardigans＊ 90s hit , but not damagingly so. The two songs have been released with a pair of intriguing, linked videos 每 enigmatic films noir in which Ware slays a boyfriend. (For my money, Midnight is her love song to the housekeeper in the films＊ story, with whom Ware might be secretly knocking boots.) Both bode?well for .Although Ware is chatty, the first half of tonight＊s performance is uneventful. You always find yourself wishing that all artists would play their?entire sets like they play their encores; so few do. In addition, Ware＊s inbuilt sophistication has always carried with it the threat of too much maturity 每 a problem shared with her fellow south London warbler, Adele 每 and you can＊t help but feel that as album three rolls around, Ware might be tipping over into complacency. Wipe-clean songs, delivered elegantly, with just a little shuffling around the mic stand: job done.By the second half, however, the veneer peels back. Ware wonders aloud whether she can do something ※in bad taste§. The mind boggles; , a punk performer who used to do unspeakable things with bodily substances, springs to mind.In the end, Ware just asks the crowd to put their phones down, and demands her band play her set opener, Midnight, again. This small outbreak of spontaneity results in an even slinkier version; you suspect Ware is actually proud of that song. Soon after, Ware asks the crowd for a hairband to put up her long hair, ※sopping§ with sweat. In the effort, one of her stilettos falls off. Instead of fighting to put it back on, Ware kicks off the other one and pads about the front of the stage, barefoot, before sitting on a monitor.She really does look ready for bed, but the result is a charged intimacy for?the final pair of very different songs.  is vintage Ware: she is gutsy and bittersweet, trying to find the stable ground in an extreme relationship.The final song is a new one and ※important to her§. It＊s a love song to several people: Ware＊s partner, Sam, after whom it is named, their baby girl and her own mother. Ed Sheeran＊s co-writing credit is audible in the song＊s stripped-down sensibility, a marked divergence from all the monochrome?synthetics that have held?sway for two albums. Whereas before, Ware＊s songs tended to be generalised paeans to tortured love, now, Sam finds her wondering what sort of a mother she will be. There＊s admiration for her own mother＊s bravery, and a line that casts her own father in a dim light. It＊s a paradigm shift that gets a standing ovation.																																											"
" City of Crows is the story of a young woman in 17th century France who turns to witchcraft in a desperate effort to rescue her son who has been abducted. It was inspired by the Affair of the Poisons 每 a scandal that rocked the French court in the late 1670s, in which the Parisian police uncovered what they thought was a plot to poison Louis XIV. In their investigations, they instead uncovered a thriving underground network of sorcerers, magicians, abortionists and astrologers working in Paris. I was reading mainly non-fiction: French history, obviously, as well as hunting down medieval grimoires in Paris 每 books of magic from which I might gather up the language suitable for City of Crows.I actually like to read poetry when I＊m writing, as a kind of tuning fork 每 TS Eliot, Elizabeth Bishop and this time around, a bit of medieval French balladeer Francois Villon.I am looking forward to reading The Last Days of Jeanne d＊Arc by Ali Alizadeh. The real-life tale of Joan of Arc is truly amazing and I＊m keen to see what a poet＊s imagination can bring to a tale so febrile with extraordinary mysticism, courage and transgression. Through multiple points of view, Terra Nullius challenges the dominant settler narrative 每 the story of the invasion of Australia 每 in a way designed to explain what the original inhabitants are so upset about.  is a powerful tool to explain the unexplainable, to provoke empathy and understanding where they did not previously exist.Australia was not settled or colonised; there was no peaceful arrival of white people on this continent, no welcome by the original inhabitants. Australia was invaded by the English and there is still no treaty. Most Australians have difficulty understanding or appreciating that core, fundamental truth. This was not in the distant past; it is not ancient history. There are people alive who remember the arrival of the white people to their country.Aboriginal Australian people don＊t need to imagine a dystopia: we live in one every day.Aboriginal resistance and survival narratives were important to the development of my work. One of my favourites was the inspiring Jandamarra and the Bunuba Resistance by Howard Pedersen and Banjo Woorunmurra. It＊s an important true story of the frontier wars that is not well known to most Australians.I am excited about Common People by Tony Birch. I have loved his previous work, prose and poetry, and can＊t wait to read this collection of short stories.Unmaking a Murder tells of human tragedy and the battle against the inexorable despair of a murder conviction. A pretty young lawyer is found dead in her bath just weeks before her wedding. Her fianc谷, the man she loved, is cast as her murderer, judged to be motivated by betrayal and greed. Henry Keogh receives a life sentence. Hearts and steel doors slam shut behind him. But something is wrong. It＊s discovered that crucial forensic evidence doesn＊t exist. As a journalist, I can＊t turn a blind eye. What follows is a 13-year battle to unmake the case for murder. Against me is not just the ※finality§ of the verdict but also the venomous politics of populism and the tenacity of our institutions to resist challenge. The story traces the difficult balance between reportage and advocacy and finally the quashing of Keogh＊s conviction. Henry Keogh is released two days before Christmas 2014 after serving 20 years in prison.Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy. McCarthy is a word artist and a genius. His writing inspires me. I share his view of the beautiful but ruthless nature of existence. No one will save us; we must save ourselves and the ones we love.The Angels by Bob Yates and Rick and John Brewster. With a few notable exceptions I prefer non-fiction and biographies. I also love popular music and its history. When it comes to Australian music, The Angels are an integral part of the great tradition.

A pro-refugee, pro-reconciliation leftie (me) films the far-right populist Pauline Hanson for a year to understand what drives her, who loves her, who hates her, and why. In the process I am accidentally given a front row seat to the ※Fed Up§ election campaign that delivered Hanson back to power, after 18 years in the wilderness. Hanson＊s journey, from Ipswich fish shop to parliament to prison to TV celebrity on Dancing with the Stars, is one of the strangest in modern politics 每 and as I follow her around Australia, I try to make sense of the indelible stamp she has left on this nation. I fail to change Hanson＊s mind about anything, of course, but the reasons why are revealing.Jane Mayer＊s Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right 每 to understand America＊s parallel descent into conservative populism. And Margo Kingston＊s 1999 take on Hanson, Off the Rails 每 which made me realise how much tougher, smarter and more dangerous Hanson 2.0 has become.I＊m exhausted by charismatic political anti-heroes, having written about North Korean leader Kim Jong Il before I tackled Hanson. David Marr＊s Patrick White: A Life and Peter Fitzsimons＊ Nancy Wake: A Biography of our Greatest War Heroine are the top two antidotes on my recovery list! I＊ve been writing for a long time 每 nearly 30 years now 每 and mostly I＊ve written for the lulz.There is an egomaniacal hunger to all writing, but especially to humour writing. It＊s possible to write poetry and literature for yourself. But I don＊t think anybody ever wrote a joke for purely private pleasure. Laughter wants to be shared.It used to be the only way you knew a joke had landed was when you were lucky enough to see somebody reading your stuff in public and laughing. That＊s some powerful juju, right there; faintly, distantly akin to the magic a stand up comedian taps into when they＊re in front of a full house and riding the laughs like a monster surf break. I don＊t know how they do it, but I can understand why it would be so addictive, and so utterly destructive too. These are my best rides. Soldiers and Sons by Brett Barry, a history of the Jewish refugees who fled Hitler＊s Germany as young boys and returned as American soldiers. It had no effect Stranger Thingies at all, other than to remind me that the world can be a dark place. Aussie Aussie Aussie by Ben Pobjie. It＊s like a ridonkulous dictionary of biography for an alternate Australia, where our true weirdness was allowed to run free. I started reading it in a bookshop and couldn＊t put it down. Very funny.This book was the most effective way to answer what had become, especially after the election of Trump, a large volume of personal messages and emails, chiefly from folks under 40, asking, ※What is this Marxism thing, then?§ I＊d intended it first as a single long post and then, when I returned to Marx＊s difficult texts after many years, I thought I＊d make it a 10,000-word eBook available for maybe a buck. Then, as I read, I conceded that even a simple introduction had to be longer,  that I needed both a deadline and a little money to actually finish it. Happily, my publisher agreed that there was a great hunger for these ideas, no longer taught at universities, and uncritically pilloried by our Cold War relics in the press. And, as the centenary of the October 1917 Uprising happened to be upcoming, we aimed for and made that date.In short, it＊s the culmination of many private conversations mostly with youngish folks who had begun to suspect that capitalism governs so much of their social experience. This book is informed entirely and explicitly by other books, so the most efficient answer here is the  or the ※MEGA§, AKA the collected works of Karl and his adorable sidekick, Fred.Is Racism an Environmental Threat? by Ghassan Hage, largely because my friend Shakira is disgusted that I have never read anything by this highly regarded anthropologist, who is unafraid of an enormous idea.

Working title was Maintaining My Druthers Whilst Mistaken for Others. Unsurprisingly that was deemed a little ... glib. Which on reflection, would have been .Barry Hannah, Airships. Hence my pieces involved a lot more fishing than they should＊ve, before the polite, but necessary hatchet.Storyland by Catherine McKinnon. Recommended with a gasp by a friend, and it has been winking at me, now as I sit here ＃ we＊ll be off for a bit, excuse us. My book, set in the early 1970s, is about a 10-year-old girl called Justine who is growing up in a rural town in Victoria, close to the Murray River. Justine, abandoned by her mother when she was a toddler, lives with her Pop, a man damaged by his experiences on the Burma Railway. Justine＊s father comes and goes, an unsettling and dangerous presence in Justine＊s life. Justine must find ways to survive so much male aggression 每 she must seek out friendship, beauty, hope and purpose, against all odds. The Choke is, ultimately, a story of the indomitable nature of the human spirit.Days Without End by Sebastian Barry. Barry＊s writing is musical, rich, and character-driven. The story is original, full of pain and hope. I don＊t know if his work affected mine consciously, but I suspect I am soaking up his power, I am sure his book is teaching me, showing me what is possible. If a book brings me joy, shows me new worlds, then I must be learning from it.Coal Creek by Alex Miller. Alex has recently become my friend, and we have spoken about what it was like to write Coal Creek, how it happened with great passion and energy. I am curious about this, about where our work might be similar, or different. I can＊t wait!This is a direct sequel to Robert Louis Stevenson＊s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Not a parody, not an update, not a retelling. It＊s designed to honour the original, complement it, and subvert it all at the same time.Nearly seven years after Mr Hyde is found dead on the laboratory floor, a stylish gentleman shows up in foggy London claiming to be Dr Jekyll. Only Mr Utterson, Jekyll＊s faithful lawyer and confidante, knows that he was must be an impostor〞because Jekyll was Hyde. But as the man goes about charming Jekyll＊s friends and reclaiming the estate (snatching it from Utterson, to whom it was about to be bequeathed), and as the bodies of potential challengers start piling up, an increasingly desperate Utterson starts fearing for his own life ... and questioning his own sanity. The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro. I＊ve always loved this book for its very measured prose and manners, and purposely reread it to get me in the right frame of mind.See What I Have Done by Sarah Schmidt. The world can never have enough atmospheric, macabre and ambiguous history-mysteries.																																											"
" Arena has reopened with a charity concert to raise money for a memorial to the 22 people killed in a suicide attack on 22 May. About 14,000 people, including a number of survivors and bereaved relatives, packed into the venue last night to hear an eclectic lineup topped by Noel Gallagher＊s High Flying Birds.The Oasis star was joined by other Mancunian musicians, including the Courteeners, grime act Bugzy Malone and indie band Blossoms, from nearby Stockport. The somewhat confusing programme also included a turn from Rick Astley, who deviated from his 1980s hits with a cover of Everlong by Foo Fighters. Former Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle and  were also in attendance., the comedian, introduced Gallagher as ※Mr Manchester himself, all the way from London§. Kay wore the yellow fleece of the Arena stewards 每 he worked at the venue for four years from its opening day in July 1995, when he earned ?4.10 an hour. He eschewed any jokes for the first few minutes of his brief set, urging the crowd to ※move forward with love and not hate§.Gallagher played a set that was roughly 50:50 Oasis hits and new songs including Half the World Away, dedicated to ※Manchester＊s favourite family, the Royle Family§ [it was the theme tune to the TV series], Champagne Supernova and of course Don＊t Look Back in Anger, which Gallagher said ※has become a kind of anthem§ post attack. ※Every time you sing we win. So sing!§The evening, under the banner We Are Manchester, began with a set by DJ Clint Boon, formerly of the Inspiral Carpets, who gave Gallagher a gig as a roadie before his Oasis days. The first song was the Stone Roses＊ Made of Stone, a tribute to the city＊s spirit. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, then read out the names of those killed.There was an appearance by poet Tony Walsh, whose love letter to Manchester, , became a rallying cry in the days after the bomb and was released as a charity single.The event sold out in hours, disappointing some of the families, who were unable to get tickets. There were no freebies; everyone from Burnham to Gallagher＊s guest list had to pay ?25 or ?30 for a ticket, with all proceeds going to the memorial fund.Airport-style security had been installed, with the audience searched as they attended the first concert since the attack at an Ariane Grande show.At the City Rooms entrance, where Salman Abedi detonated his nail bomb, a group of teenagers from Garstang in Lancashire were crying. ※The girls were all at the  concert. For two of them, it was their first concert on their own,§ said Sharon Hartley, the mother of 14-year-old Ella. ※We are all struggling a bit.§They went off to seek ※emotional first aid§ from , the Warrington-based charity set up in memory of IRA victims Johnathan Ball and Tim Parry.

It had been a little eerie walking through the bomb site, she said. ※You keep thinking of all those little girls with their pink balloons and bunny ears.§																																											"
"y now, most listeners will probably have a take on , originally out of Brooklyn via Cincinnati, now residing as far apart as LA and Copenhagen. Two pairs of multi-instrumentalist brothers and a lanky, lugubrious frontman, they deal in literate rock that presents at first as artily sombre, and eventually as one of the most nuanced 21st-century iterations of what used to be known as ※college rock§.Ten years on from their breakout album, , the National come packing more filigree 每 just listen to the jazzy sussurations and sneaky digitals on the title track 每 and more heft. Having survived a number of , they have, on this evidence, also happily bypassed the smugness that could come of success.Nothing on  is headline-new. But you are either in singer Matt Berninger＊s corner, clinging on as he drills down into his anxieties, or you are wondering why even validated white guys in first-world countries can still eat themselves up inside so insatiably.Then there＊s the tension created by the hyper-musical brother duos, pacing the cage of what ※rock band§ means with increased vigour. It often adds up to a subtle, grown-up take that still leaves space for drama 每 Turtleneck, for one, has the energising air of a Nick Cave song.Elsewhere, it makes for aural intrigue 每 as on I＊ll Still Destroy You, a restless, semi-digital ballad that contrasts what the Dessner and Devendorf brothers can do underneath Berninger＊s self-flagellating croon. Sometimes you wonder, however, whether a rougher and readier digital sketch like Walk It Back might have benefited from even more directness. The track ends with the re-voiced sample of a purported  (※We are history＊s actors＃§) which just dangles, not discernibly contextualised. Berninger has hinted that the ※beast§ of the album title might be the positive energy of future generations, but again the songs don＊t bear this out.If you were Berninger＊s in-laws,  might make for some awkward silences at Thanksgiving. Berninger might seem like ideal bohemian husband material 每 urbane, with few of the liabilities endemic to the role of lead singer 每 but he queries every relationship, every comfort. ※I wasn＊t a catch/ I wasn＊t a keeper,§ goes , a love song, ※I was wandering around like the one who found dead John Cheever in the house of love.§ Carin Besser is the real name of Berninger＊s partner, which prompts the usual head-scratching about writerly distance.Another desperately sad song, , only piles on the midlife romantic anomie. The cheery trumpet is certainly not helping, parping away in the background as a sinkhole opens up, swallowing certainty. Autobiography, or not? The plot only thickens when you learn that , just as Tom Waits＊s partner, Kathleen Brennan, does. Ultimately, though, these fudged irresolutions 每 political and romantic 每 tantalise more than they distract. As the National keep proving, little is ever straightforward.																																											"

"t＊s Friday afternoon in Ibiza, the sun is beating down and I＊ve arrived at an old army barracks in the centre of the Spanish clubbing mecca for the inaugural . It resembles a rave; the police, naturally, have already tried to close it down. But despite the troupes of hippies, decorative canopies and the totem pole demarcating the entrance, it is most definitely not a rave.While the tech house superclubs prepare for another night of narcotics and vest-clad fist pumping, this is an event singing to a different tune. If you＊ve ever wondered what happens when a former Brazilian model and a ex-director of a tech startup discover , then you＊ve found your answer: they launch a foundation dedicated to the promotion of indigenous culture, start a festival and fly in 40 spiritual leaders from around the world to lead a series of talks, performances and ceremonies including the ritualistic sharing of cacao, the consumption of ※plant medicine§ and sweat lodges. Whatever your poison, Ibiza is always going to be an island of excess.※I think Ibiza is a very magnetic place,§ says co-founder Vivien Vilela, who is from S?o Paolo, lived in London and spent a fair amount of time partying on the island in a ※past life§. ※But now, instead of destroying our bodies we＊re healing. We＊re still dancing, but we＊re dancing to sacred chants; we＊re connecting as a community.§After passing a man on a unicycle, sitting in on a talk by a member of the Peruvian Ash芍ninka tribe, and watching a woman perform improvised cosmic wellness poetry while staring into the eyes of whomever wishes to have their soul sung to (※We think we haven＊t figured it out because ours is the only Instagram that isn＊t smiling,§ she sings while a young woman kneels before her, weeping), I sit down in a shady corner where Mexican native and Ibiza resident Javier, 46, and Swedish visitor Christian, 33, are sharing a spliff. ※Just as with the DJs, Ibiza is a place where the most important people in the spiritual community come,§ Javier tells me, when I ask why events like this still happen here. ※There＊s three generations of spirituality. It＊s always coexisted with the clubs but this is the real soul of the island. The hippy dream is still alive.§For many, this will always be the ※true Ibiza§. It is over four decades since the hippies first laid foot there: a mix of artists, writers and Vietnam draft-dodgers who established the non-conforming spirit of psychedelic decadence that laid the foundations for the island to grow into one of the world＊s biggest and most lucrative clubbing destinations. When the first clubs opened 每 like Pacha in 1973 and Amnesia in 1976 每 resident DJs such as Alfredo played to this boho, free-spirited crowd, his selections generating the origins of the ※Balearic beat§ sound now synonymous with Ibiza: a louche, euphoric music that spans genres but finds commonality in its laidback eclecticism, blending touches of jazz, Latin, Italo, new wave, lounge music and much besides, from Grace Jones＊s pop-reggae to dreamy Ennio Morricone soundtracks. Now, the dominant musical force in Ibiza is the ubiquitous digital pulse of tech house. From the moment you arrive at San Antonio airport, and all along the road into the city, you can see billboards for superstar DJs like David Guetta, Richie Hawtin or Calvin Harris. Thousands of clubbers throng within the smoke and lasers of high-priced, corporate-minded venues and, if they can afford it, buy their way into a VIP booth and look down from the mezzanine while sipping their way through a 2,000 bottle of Belvedere. At a time when, for many, the homogenous club culture of the island has reached an overbearing peak, the hippy scene and the old-school Balearic beat bohemians have reasserted themselves as alternatives for a small but growing number of people travelling to the island for a more ※traditional§ experience.If there＊s one place on the island where the Balearic spirit has found a home, it is Hostal La Torre, a politely chic, classically Mediterranean hotel overlooking the sea at Cap Negret, just north of San Antonio. You can enjoy a stunning sunset view while a carefully curated selection of DJs 每 DJ Harvey, Alfredo, Paul Davey from Leftfield 每 provide the soundtrack. ※This is the opposite of the big clubs＊ VIP culture,§ resident DJ Pete Gooding tells me as the light begins to fade to the theme from Midnight Cowboy by John Barry. ※It＊s the anti-Vegas side of Ibiza. No one is walking up to you with bottles of champagne and sparklers§.Bought three seasons ago by the family behind chillout joint Cafe Mambo (neighbour to the equally legendary Cafe Del Mar), La Torre has solidified its position within the Balearic revival thanks to its successful compilation albums, , selected by Gooding and fellow resident  每 two men with obsessive personalities dedicated to synching every sunset to the right track. Barrott＊s label, , has played a big role in the revival of classy electronic chillout music, a sound which has found new popularity in recent years thanks to labels such as Antinote and ESP Institute, and producers like Wolf Muller, Tornado Wallace, Nico Motte and DK. As well as drawing in the hippies, its audience is wrapped up with those fuelling the rise of  such as Brilliant Corners and Spiritland in London. This summer, Ibiza gained a new club in this model, with the opening of Petit Pereyra, an audiophile restaurant and club in Talamanca that will host the DJs who helped define Ibiza, with residents including Pippi and Cesar de Melero playing vinyl on a bespoke Klipschorn hi-fi system in an exclusive clubhouse. Its owner, Eric-Jan Harmsen doesn＊t mince his words when describing his disdain for the superclubs or his lack of interest in attracting wealthy punters. ※I am not in that business,§ he says. ※I don＊t do marketing, I don＊t go for tourism, I＊m the anti-guy.§Other established venues have also recently focused on appealing to a different crowd.

They were the life of the party. We want people to lose themselves. I do think that authentic Ibiza is about letting go.§In terms of programming, this means takings things back to Balearic.

But if you don＊t like that stuff, you shouldn＊t be there.§Other events prioritising the eclectic Ibizan spirit include Nightmares on Wax＊s Wax Da Jam and Acid Sundays, both held at the old hippy market Las Dalias. The names of these parties come up frequently among those attending Aniwa, along with one of the island＊s biggest success stories over the past year, Woomoon. ※The best parties here are all built from micro-communities and have an element of spirituality,§ one girl tells me, and this, I＊m told, is the essence of Woomoon, which blends together circus-style performances, art and dance, bringing something of the essence of  to the island. ※People are looking for something different in Ibiza,§ says co-founder Doumi. ※Less commercial, less superficial, more poetic.§Maintaining a connection to a deeper spirituality believed to emanate from the island is what motivates these events and those that attend them, whether it＊s seeking transcendence through an ayahuasca ceremony, dancing to cosmic rhythms under the moon or celebrating the emotional surge of a sunset to the sound of rare groove. ※If you look back into the history, it＊s always had that something.§ Mark Barrott tells me, as he explains how the music he makes on the island feels distinct from his productions made elsewhere. ※People need magic ... and Ibiza has magic.

"t＊s hard to imagine approaching this debut collection of short stories, set in the US prison system, without the knowledge that Curtis Dawkins is a prisoner serving a life sentence without parole. Dawkins killed a man in the commission of a botched robbery at a time when he was addicted to drugs, a crime that＊s fairly commonplace for the hapless but gravely culpable people who end up spending their lives in prison. Less typical is the fact that, before he went to prison, Dawkins earned an MFA in creative writing.This combination results in a book that is remarkable for its modesty, realism and humanity. There＊s no trace of the grand guignol sadism and preoccupation with sexual violence that typify popular prison narratives, from to . Instead, Dawkins gives us prison as it is?for most inmates most of the time: a?series of dull, claustrophobic days, in?which men oppress each other not with violence, but tedium. His characters play dominoes, tell interminable stories, sell handmade Christmas cards?to each other, obsessively watch sports. The existence of violence is acknowledged, but it＊s left at the margins of the narrative. The more present danger, to which various characters succumb, is the temptation of suicide.The risk of this approach, of course, is that the stories could be as boring and shapeless as prison life itself. But Dawkins has a genius for bringing characters to life and making mundane situations compelling, if only because they feel so real. Throughout, it＊s the tiny details that keep us invested; a?prisoner missing life outside remembers how ※when I would mow my yard, my dog followed close behind me, and when I would stop he＊d run into the back of my legs§.In ※A Human Number§, a prisoner uses his phone time to make collect calls to random numbers; he finds a kindly elderly woman who reads the Book of Revelation to him, then pauses to take a pie out of the oven and begins to talk to it ※as if it were a small child or a puppy: ＆Oh, you are a nice little yummy thing, aren＊t you. You are just perfect ＃ ＊?§Most of the characters reflect on the?past; the empty days of prison become a mirror in which they continually face the shortcomings that?brought them here.In the story ※Daytime Drama§, a prisoner with mental health issues wears a blanket as a cape and babbles unguardedly to other prisoners, asking to borrow one man＊s teeth and telling a?gay man: ※You must dream of going to prison.§ We keep expecting someone to react badly and hurt him, but the other prisoners make allowances for?his mental illness and treat him with humour and patience.We learn that he?has ※uncles in prison all over the country§, in addition to one uncle who?has been executed by lethal injection. His own?crime (which is never specified) carries?a mandatory sentence of life in?prison. He doesn＊t grasp the horror of any of this, and seems to have no memory of whatever he?did;?he＊s just trying not to lose control?in the time before his next?medication.In the final story, ※Leche Quemada§, a man returns home after 12 years in prison for a crime that＊s similar to Dawkins＊s. Remarkably, his girlfriend has remained faithful; but what this means is that he returns to the same petty relationship problems he had before. He can＊t satisfy her demands; she doesn＊t share his enthusiasms. He ends up saying to the?dog: ※Did I ever leave?§ He tells himself to be grateful for his second chance at life, but also finds he＊s uncomfortably nostalgic for prison. He＊s terrifyingly unsure he＊ll be able to make it outside, and sadly reflects that ※all the good parts [of life]?appeared to be over: the kids growing?up, climbing the career ladder,?family trips everyone would always remember§. is a debut, and like most debuts, it isn＊t perfect. It has its overwrought images, its passages of?cod , its ill-judged foray into magical realism. There are cringeworthy moments of phoned-in psychology: ※He would change or he wouldn＊t. Some men never do. They spend the rest of their lives denying the truth, protecting the illusions that?protect them from their past.§ But?Dawkins has a gravitas and clear-sightedness that carries us past these?moments.He has produced a book that is not?only moving and genuine, but genuinely important; one that, without resorting to shock tactics, powerfully conveys the perverse inhumanity of mass incarceration.

This latest book from the author of The Idea of North is a meditative and melancholic look at the beatific borderland between light and dark 每 as seen by western artists, poets and writers.

"ew artists make the business of being in a hugely successful rock band seem as breezy and straightforward as . In their world, there never seems to be much in the way of angst or agonising or artistic differences 每 three things frontman Dave Grohl presumably had enough of to last a lifetime while he was in  每 just an endless succession of platinum albums, magazines featuring Grohl＊s face inevitably gurning good-naturedly from the cover and mammoth gigs, where their evident delight in playing live manifests itself in an inability to stop once they＊ve started. There were moments during their headlining slot at when it seemed as if the only way Michael Eavis was going to get them offstage was with the aid of a bulldozer.And yet, their recent albums seem to have spoken, at least under their breath, of a certain kind of rock star ennui: the struggle to keep yourself interested when there＊s nothing else to struggle for, when your career has plateaued, albeit at an impressively high altitude. Back-to-basics recording sessions in a garage (); touring America＊s most famous music cities and recording a song in each, with support from a celebrated local musician (2014＊s ): these are the kind of wheezes you might come up with were you plagued by the spectre of declining inspiration and diminishing returns, the creeping fear you may already have said all you have to say. They＊re obviously more ingenious ideas than the one bands in their position usually come up with, which involves gritting your teeth and insisting against all odds that your new album is the best you＊ve ever made. But it all raises the question: what next?Concrete and Gold originally came with another grand concept attached: the idea was to build a complete studio onstage at the Hollywood Bowl and record an album in one night in front of a 20,000-strong audience, a plan scuppered by  decision to record last year＊s Hope Demolition Project in a glass box at Somerset House. Instead, the band have opted to work with pop producer Greg Kurstin, an unlikely choice: Grohl has  having to play Kurstin＊s most famous co-write, , to nonplussed guitarist Pat Smear, who＊d apparently never heard it before, a not-unimpressive feat in itself. The album＊s supporting cast, meanwhile, offers impressively eclectic testament to Grohl＊s famed ability as a networker 每 it includes Justin Timberlake, the Kills＊ Alison Mosshart and Shawn Stockman of 90s R&B sensations Boyz II Men. Grohl has likened the end result to both ※Mot?rhead＊s version of Sgt Pepper§ and ※Slayer making Pet Sounds§. If that often seems even more hyperbolic than it＊s intended to be 每 as on Arrows or The Line, when Concrete and Gold sounds exactly like the Foo Fighters usual anthemic pop-rock, except with a few psychedelic effects thrown in 每 you occasionally take his point, or at least something like it. Run repeatedly flips between a lysergic expansiveness and raw-throated metal. The ghost not of Sgt Pepper but the  haunts both The Sky is a Neighbourhood and Happy Ever After (Zero Hour) 每 the former a kind of steroidal take on the taut, twilit sound of Happiness is a Warm Gun, the latter based around an acoustic guitar figure that recalls Mother Nature＊s Son 每 while there＊s a pleasure to be had listening to Sunday Rain, which features  behind a song absolutely stuffed with knowingly McCartney-esque melodic twists and turns. The closing title track, meanwhile, attempts to weld the tumbling, harmony-laden euphoria of Pink Floyd＊s  to the Soviet state-funeral tempo of early  It＊s a weird recipe that doesn＊t quite work 每 leaden euphoria is a tough thing to pull off 每 but it＊s indicative of an admirable urge to think a little outside of the box.But the album＊s most improbable set of musical references turn up in the lyrics. The first time you hear the words ※White House§ in La Dee Dah, the obvious assumption is that it＊s a reference to the Trump presidency, which hangs, obliquely, over much of an album big on expressions of defiance and despair (※I just want sing a love song and pretend there＊s nothing wrong,§ offers opener T-Shirt). But no, it turns out Grohl means Whitehouse, the controversial power-electronics band of  and Shitfun fame. La Dee Dah is a curious pen portrait of the alienated teenage Grohl, lost in post-industrial music and its attendant antiheroes: it also namechecks Psychic TV, the  and the profoundly rum, Nazi-obsessed Death in June. This is clearly a deeply unlikely thing for a stadium rock album virtually guaranteed platinum sales to do, but for the most part, Concrete and Gold sees the Foo Fighters gently and enjoyably nudge at the boundaries of what they do, rather than crashing through them to new territory. It＊s an album that won＊t frighten the horses, but provides enough fresh interest to keep the band ticking over: for the , you suspect, that means mission accomplished.

"he lights over the Ship Cafe were still advertising the ※Last Night of § when, on the morning of 10 August, 1933, the main attraction, his boyfriend Jimmy Forlenza and fellow actor Patsy Kelly piled into his car to head off to a party at the Hollywood Barn.Tired after finishing a fortnight-long booking, Malin accidentally put the sedan into reverse, sending it off Venice Pier and into the water. Forlenza and Kelly escaped but Malin, trapped under the steering wheel, wasn＊t so lucky. The brightest star of the Pansy Craze 每 a spate of wild parties full of drag queens and bawdy songs 每 was dead at 25.The roots of the Pansy Craze stretch back decades, at least as far as the first of New York＊s infamous masquerade balls, held in Harlem in 1869. The city already had a number of gay-friendly bars, including  (favoured by Walt Whitman) and , which Joseph Pulitzer＊s New York Evening World labelled ※morally the lowest in New York, Paris, London or Berlin§. But the popularity of these drag (or fag) balls was such that by the 1920s, as many as 7,000 people of all colours and classes were attending. Prizes were awarded for the best costumes and Malin was often among the prizewinners.The 1920s also saw an increase in the number of bohemian enclaves in rundown areas, such as New York＊s Greenwich Village. Painters, poets and performers were lured by the cheap rents and by an increasingly wild and lawless lifestyle. Prohibition had given birth to a black market for booze and a bustling underground scene, where bright young things slumming it in mob-run nightspots developed a taste for camp, cutting repartee.LGBT people were flocking to cities as much for the nightlife as for the ability to connect with others. Soon, Variety was reporting that Broadway ※will have nite places with ＆pansies＊ as the main draw. Paris and Berlin have similar night resorts, with the queers attracting the lays.§ In Berlin, you could hear singers performing , one of the earliest songs to celebrate homosexuality. ※This song became the gay anthem of the time and still has status today,§ says singer Ute Lemper. ※The lyrics are witty and ballsy, quite unbelievable.§ You can hear its influence in the work of Rufus Wainwright, Marc Almond and others.Every European capital, and several major US cities, had similar scenes: London had Douglas Byng and No?l Coward, who once admitted: ※I should love to perform There Are Fairies in the Bottom of My Garden, but I don＊t dare. It might come out There Are Fairies in the Garden of My Bottom.§Performers, including the acid-tongued Malin, quickly eclipsed the drag acts that had been a stage staple for decades. Malin began his own career in drag, as Imogene Wilson, but it was as the tuxedoed MC of Club Abbey that he ※gave Broadway its first glimpse of pansy nightlife§, as Mark Hellinger of the Syracuse Journal put it. At Club Abbey, Malin ditched the dresses and reinvented himself as a high-camp, waspish, obviously gay man 每 and it was this that singled him out. For possibly the first time ever, an entertainer＊s entire act revolved around an explicit queerness. ※What was novel is that he did not bring a drag act to the club, but instead performed in elegant men＊s clothing, and brought with him the camp wit of the gay subculture,§ explains . ※If he was heckled by men at the club he knew how to cut them to shreds, to the delight of the crowd.§ At 200lbs and over six feet tall, few would argue with him anyway.※Malin was a tremendous success and other club owners followed the lead,§ Hellinger reported. ※Before the mainstream knew what happened, there was a hand on a hip for every light on Broadway.§ Songs with titles such as  and  were all the rage, and Malin＊s innovative style was copied by dozens of others with varying degrees of success. , kept punters happy in Harlem belting out risqu谷 versions of popular songs, but Malin was the undisputed queen of the Pansy Craze.Prohibition had forced legitimate bars to shut up shop, and the mob-run speakeasies that sprang up in their place were openly flouting the law. Crooked cops took backhanders to look the other way, but with serious violence breaking out between rival gangs keen for a slice of this lucrative pie, the authorities had to do something. And as many of these clubs had floor shows starring LGBT acts, it must have seemed that wherever the pansies went, trouble followed.In January 1931, mobster Charles Sherman was shot and stabbed at the Club Abbey, female impersonator  (appearing in a revue entitled Pansies on Parade) was caught up in a police raid on Manhattan＊s appropriately named Pansy Club, and on the same night, police shut down the Club Calais speakeasy, another popular pansy haunt. Sherman survived the attack, but four years later his corpse was found buried in a pit of quicklime.Tired of the trouble the pansy clubs attracted, New York＊s police commissioner Edward P Mulrooney stationed a cop at the door of every known pansy nightspot and barred female impersonators from the local clubs. Some acts tried valiantly to cling on but Malin, effectively barred from working in New York, went to Boston where, according to the front page of scandal sheet Brevities: ※Queers seek succor! Fairies cruise in daisy beds of Boston, making the city a lavenderish camp of love.§ Gladys Bentley took her butch lesbian act to San Francisco, but Malin, after briefly trying to re-establish his career in New York, decided to try his luck in Hollywood instead.He appeared in a couple of films, but after seeing the rushes for one of them 每  每 RKO Studio president BB Kahane sent a memo stating: ※I do not think we ought to have this man on the lot on any picture§, and Malin＊s part was recast. When, following New York＊s lead, Los Angeles also issued an edict banning female impersonators, it was time to move on.※Pansies Blow US§, Brevities announced. ※Prominent pansies of this country are scramming for Berlin and Paris [where] they have found a freedom not granted them in America.§ London＊s law enforcers were as intolerant as commissioner Mulrooney 每 in December 1932, more than 50 men , after undercover officers had watched them dancing and, they claimed, having sex dressed as women. More than 100 people were arrested at  after locals complained of it being ※frequented by sexual perverts, lesbians and sodomites.§But Paris had a reputation for its laissez-faire attitude, and queer performers were encouraged by the success enjoyed in the city by American performers including bisexual dancer  and gay trapeze artist Barbette. Berlin, too, had been a mecca for LGBT people for decades before Brevities reported on the ※queer resorts§ where ※patrons, either lesbian, fairy or normal sexed are welcome§. , whose 1996 collection Berlin Cabaret Songs ignited new interest in the songs and stars of the period, says that she was ※stunned by the array of songs that expressed freedom of sexuality, and also proclaimed emancipation and women＊s rights.§Like New York, Berlin＊s regular drag balls made it a popular destination for LGBT tourists. Yet many regarded this tolerance as a sign of the country＊s decadence, and Hitler＊s rise to power saw countless bars, clubs and cafes closed. Nazi stormtroopers tore the heart out of Berlin＊s cabaret scene, arresting anyone deemed : degenerate. Max Hansen, who recorded  (Weren＊t You Ever In Love With Me?), in which a drunk Hitler made passes at a Jewish man, had to make a quick exit from Germany, and other cabaret stars either followed or went back into the closet. Willy Rosen, Max Ehrlich and Kurt Gerron (the star of Weill and Brecht＊s Threepenny Opera) all died in Auschwitz. The bawdy, openly gay Paul O＊Montis died in the Sachsenhausen camp, just 25 miles north of the stages he once commanded. ※At the time of their creation, these songs were kind of shocking and anarchic,§ adds Lemper. ※Today, nothing can shock any more but these songs can still entertain and provoke.§Hailed by Variety as ※the best entertainer in the Village joints along the pansy lines§, Malin＊s death in 1933 signalled the end of the Pansy Craze, and the repeal of prohibition that same year closed the doors of many speakeasys. The scenes he had filmed for the upcoming Clark Gable and Joan Crawford feature, Dancing Lady, were consigned to the cutting room floor. With the  effectively banning Hollywood from portraying homosexual characters (or ※attempting to keep the dual-sex boys and lesbos out of films§ ), and war in Europe on the horizon, the LGBT performers who had dominated nightlife for more than a decade were driven back underground. It would be decades before we would see anything as outrageous again.																																											"
"here is a disease in the heart of cinema, and that disease is the Q&A. More cinemas are putting them on than ever, partly as a response to the rise of online streaming, in order to ※add value§ to their offering 每 and audiences are lapping it up. Q&As with directors and cast sell out in minutes to people consumed with a burning impulse to ask why there are no nice characters in the movie, or what it was like to film all those hot scenes. Why? Who would willingly put themselves through this hell? When will we wake from this nightmare?Imagine if other art forms enacted the same depressing, bathetic rituals as film-makers do with the Q&A. If, at the end of a gig, the lights came up and Dave Grohl and the rest of Foo Fighters came back on stage to sit on stools and take a few softball questions about lyrics and feedback from Lauren Laverne, before a microphone was passed into the crowd for concert-goers to ask why I＊ll Stick Around was omitted from the setlist, or if the band have any words about the passing of David Bowie. The Q&A is a sorry staple of literary festivals of course, but imagine if everybody in the audience had only just finished reading the book, at exactly the same time, with no intervening period in which to formulate a decent, critical response to the work. The Q&A is that rare addition to the filmic experience that diminishes it wholesale. No amount of charm or film knowledge can rescue a moderator ambushed by one of the types who routinely turn up at Q&As. There＊s the Incompetent, who begins asking a question before the microphone is handed to them mid-question, so that all the audience hears is, ※＃ and I just wondered if you have any thoughts about that.§ There＊s the Mature Student, who relates every aspect of the film to their own life. There＊s the Local, who frequents the pub you see in the film. And, most distressingly, the Film Bore, who delivers a question about aspect ratios, or the clear influence of De Palma. And what all these questioners have in common is that, almost to a man, they are men. The people answering the questions aren＊t much better. A film＊s director is perhaps the last person we should be asking about their film. , but the director＊s intentions are always irrelevant to the film＊s success, and asking about them occludes a proper critical analysis of the work. Similarly, do actors really have any insights into the film＊s artistic merit? I think modern audiences are keen for answers, and we too readily assess a film on what it does, rather than how it does it. This could explain why actors win Oscars for portrayals of real-life people: we evidently see the work the film has put in to recreate events, rather than having to think about its artistic choices. In that sense, the director does provide an answer 每 but the questions are wrong. But the Q&A＊s chief ill is that it removes the spectator from the very particular dream space that only films can occasion. The succession of images that are still floating about as so many evanescent moments and memories in your mind at the end of a movie will always be catastrophically disrupted by an earnest discussion about the audition process. The answer should be, I think, to start more film clubs in order to generate discussions that can bring about a critical exchange of ideas. But, as long as Q&As keep making money for cinemas and film-makers, the disastrous pretence that they are interesting will continue. 																																											"

"It was not, to say the least, a successful visit. The burgeoning friendship between a pair of literary stars,  and , had looked set to last. But it could not survive an overlong stay by the Danish author at the British novelist＊s family home in Kent. Just how bad things became, on one side at least, has been revealed by a surprisingly frank letter sold at auction on Saturday.In March 1857, Andersen had announced he was coming over for a short summer stay of a fortnight at the most. Andersen wrote: ※[M]y visit is intended for you alone,§ and added, ※Above all, always leave me a small corner in your heart.§By the time Andersen＊s visit had come to an end, after a full five weeks, Dickens felt compelled to confide to the former prime minister Lord John Russell that the creator of some of the world＊s best-loved fairytales was a bad house guest.※He spoke French like Peter the Wild Boy and English like the Deaf and Dumb School,§ complained the great author, making a cruel reference to the well-known , an ungainly court favourite in Georgian England.And, according to the reluctant host, Andersen was no better in any other language. ※He could not pronounce the name of his own book , in Italian; and his translatress appears to make out that he can＊t speak Danish,§ Dickens wrote.The remarkable letter, which fetched ?4,600 and is to stay in London, is just one in an extraordinary trove of correspondence, images and autographs sold by the Suffolk auction house Lacy Scott & Knight on Saturday. The rare documents, including an album sold to an American telephone bidder for ?16,000 that contains a scrap of Jane Austen＊s handwriting, are all part of a Scottish family collection handed down the generations. There were also letters from Queen Victoria, William Gladstone, Charles Darwin and Sir Walter Scott.※There is a huge range here, from political figures, to authors and royalty and the provenance of all the lots is excellent,§ said Guy Pratt, a book expert and consultant for the auctioneers. ※The original collector was well-connected.§Guests, it is sometimes said, like fish, go bad after three days.  was clearly pushing it. The famous writers first met in the summer of 1847 at an aristocratic soiree where Andersen had told Dickens he was a big fan, calling him ※the greatest writer of our time§.Some of the Danish tales had just been translated into English and so Andersen was on what might now be described as a promotional tour. In a letter back to friends, Andersen gushed that Dickens ※quite answers to the best ideas I had formed of him§.A couple of weeks later Dickens, one of the most celebrated names in London, left a package containing a note and presentation copies of a dozen of his books at Andersen＊s lodgings.On his return to Denmark, Andersen, noted for his social awkwardness, appears to have become a little obsessed with the dashing English author. For nine years he sent him regular fan letters, along with books for review. When the Dane came to stay in July 1857, it was not during a good time for Dickens, who was considering leaving his wife. His serialisation of  had not gone down well either and he was also feverishly rehearsing his acting role in Wilkie Collins＊ .For his part, Andersen found , in Higham, Dickens＊s country home, too cold, a biographer has noted. And he was also upset that no one was available to shave him in the morning.Soon his mood swings also became a problem. He lay down on the lawn and wept after receiving a bad review and then cried again when he finally left Gad＊s Hill on 15 July.Dickens was less glum on his guest＊s departure, writing on the mirror in the guest room: ※Hans Andersen slept in this room for five weeks 〞 which seemed to the family AGES!§ The author is already known to have written to his friend William Jerdan six days later complaining about Andersen＊s oddness.※Whenever he got to London, he got into wild entanglements of Cabs and Sherry, and never seemed to get out of them again until he came back here, and cut out paper into all sorts of patterns, and gathered the strangest little nosegays in the woods,§ he wrote.The correspondence between the pair died out soon afterwards. But the brief relationship may not have proved entirely fruitless. Some scholars have suggested that Andersen, later described by Dickens＊s daughter Kate as ※a bony bore§, could have inspired the character of the toadying Uriah Heep in .Wilde attacked Meredith＊s style in an essay, The Decay of Living, saying he had ※mastered everything except language; as a novelist, he can do everything except tell a story; as an artist, he is everything except articulate.§Asked on TV in 1980 which writers were overated the critic McCarthy said playwright Hellman was ※a bad writer, a dishonest writer, but she really belongs to the past,§ adding, ※every word she writes is a lie, including ＆and＊ and ＆the.＊§ An unresolved lawsuit followed.Though former friends, Vidal claimed to have sat on Capote at a party, mistaking him for a stool, while Capote falsely said Vidal had been ejected from the White House for being rude to Jackie Kennedy＊s mother. ※I＊m always sad about Gore〞very sad that he has to breathe every day,§ Capote said later. On Capote＊s death Vidal said: ※Capote I truly loathed. The way you might loathe an animal. A filthy animal that has found its way into the house.§Close friends before 1976, they were not on speakers for 31 years after Vargas Llosa punched Garc赤a M芍rquez in the eye on the red carpet at a Mexico City film premiere. Vargas Llosa was rumoured to be angry that his wife had turned to Garc赤a M芍rquez for ※consolation§ after he cheated on her.Greer shared a house with American novelist David Plante in 1982 while he wrote his book, Difficult Women, about Jean Rhys, Sonia Orwell and, secretly, also about Greer. She refused to read it, saying: ※He had no idea how deeply I would resent being made to utter namby-pamby Plante-speak like a dummy on his knee.§																																											"

"t the beginning of I, Tonya, we＊re informed that what we＊re about to see is based on a set of ※irony-free, wildly contradictory and totally true§ interviews with disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding and ex-husband Jeff Gillooly. It＊s a necessary, playful reminder that despite the far-fetched nature of the events in the film, there＊s at least a kernel of truth here. Even star Margot Robbie , unaware of how Harding＊s lurid story gripped most of the western world back in the early 90s.It also acts as an early indication of tone: we＊re not about to see an earnest Lifetime biopic, but instead something a little less rigid and a lot more knowing. The format of the film allows for a mixture of interviews with the main players and a chronological retelling of Harding＊s life. As a child, she was an undeniable talent on ice but suffered at the hands of an abusive mother (played here by Allison Janney). When she meets Jeff (Sebastian Stan), he seems to provide an escape from the crushing reality she faces at home. The pair quickly get married but Harding faces more abuse from him and outwardly toughens up even more, a refusal to let her treatment at the hands of others define who she is.As she journeys further into the competitive world of figure skating, Harding finds herself hampered by the snobbery of those who expect someone a bit more refined to be performing in front of them. Battling against her working class background, hoping to be judged by just her talent alone, her strength soon turns into aggression. It doesn＊t help matters that another US skater, the more superficially acceptable Nancy Kerrigan, is progressing at a much faster pace than her.Working from a Black List script by Steven Rogers (whose credits include far softer material like Hope Floats, Stepmom and PS I Love You), director Craig Gillespie is keen to present Harding＊s story in an unconventional manner, which is fitting given that her story is such a wild one. It＊s a difficult balance, between truth and exaggerated truth, the darkly comic elements resting alongside the story of a woman who suffered physical violence at the hands of both her mother and husband. It＊s also easy to fall into mean-spirited, class-rooted ridicule and while there is a certain amount of fun-poking here, there＊s also an affection for Harding at the center, a desire to present her as something other than a tabloid villain.Harding here is an unlikely underdog trying to succeed in a world where she＊s been repeatedly told that she＊s not welcome. We side with her on her quest but that doesn＊t mean we always like her. She＊s abrasive and frustrating, two steps back for every step forward. Much has been made of Robbie＊s transformation for the role but in truth it＊s never an entirely convincing portrayal. The decision to introduce Robbie as the 15-year-old Harding is clumsily ill-advised and while she＊s lively and forceful throughout, the process is always a bit too visible. Instead, the standout here is Janney, who gives a towering, monstrous performance as Harding＊s vicious mother, spewing foul-mouthed bile in every possible direction. It＊s hardly nuanced work but Janney＊s natural comic skills have never been utilized with quite such finesse and we mourn her when she＊s off screen. Given the titular focus on Harding, there＊s little characterization elsewhere. This is a broad, frequently cartoonish romp that plays like a less effective mishmash of To Die For and Fargo. The blunt, unashamed crudeness does provide some laughs but the tonal shifts are often uncomfortably handled. Gillespie stages some slick skating scenes but a reliance on hopelessly on-the-nose musical choices (Devil Woman, Every 1＊s a Winner etc) and the regrettable decision to break the fourth wall at random moments prove distracting. There＊s also a curious absentee in the story: Nancy Kerrigan. We merely see her in fleeting glances and one wonders whether this was a narrative choice or based on legal restrictions. It jars and leaves the film lacking sufficient background to the inarguable main event.The zippy fun of the first half dissipates once we reach the overly familiar scenes of the second, the focus on the harebrained criminal scheme feeling particularly sub-Coenesque. It＊s hardly dull but it＊s not quite as biting and sharply realized as it could be given the wealth of stranger-than-fiction drama surrounding Harding. Unevenly told and patchily performed, there＊s still a morbid curiosity that keeps I, Tonya at least diverting. It＊s brash and shaggy and while Robbie might not quite stick the landing, Janney＊s performance is gold. This article was amended on 12 September 2017. An earlier version misnamed the director Craig Gillespie as Jim Gillespie. 																																											"
"hen I was a kid, I＊d watch people on television loosen their ties or rake their hands through their hair before saying, in a world-weary sigh, ※I need a drink.§ The subtext was clear then (adulthood is hard), and so when I recently caught myself running my fingers in my hair 每 and not as part of my daily styling routine 每 I knew what to do. A girls＊ night was arranged with alacrity, for Friday after work. Look, things are still hazy, but here＊s what I can legally divulge: lots of laughter, much silliness, perhaps slightly too many proclamations of affection, and a soup?on of TMI.Inevitably, my thoughts turned to the most high-profile, big-screen girls＊ gathering of recent months 每 the runaway box-office success .

"very major film festival is an island when you＊re caught up in it, the outside world only really manifesting itself as pictures on a screen. The , however, really is an island 每 it takes place on the Lido, across the water from the main city 每 and the proceedings feel more cosily enclosed than ever, now that the festival buildings are surrounded by an elegant compound of patios and park. You could sit here sipping your spritzer 每 or indeed, sheltering from torrential rain 每 and forgetting that exterior reality existed, because only a few films managed to remind you at all persuasively that it did.On paper, the 74th festival looked set to be the best in years, especially in the wake of , with many hotly awaited titles and a host of big names on both sides of the camera. In the end, little induced either fury or rapture, and many just elicited that Italian shrug accompanied by a noncommittal ※＃§I arrived too late to catch the film that got consensus raves: Guillermo del Toro＊s , a monster movie-cum-romance starring Sally Hawkins. But for me, there were two standout fiction features. One was Martin McDonagh＊s . It＊s a very dark comedy thriller set in the southern US, about a woman (Frances McDormand) on a mission to avenge her raped and murdered daughter. As the violence spirals, a film that looks set to expose the darkest side of humanity ends up suggesting that even seemingly irredeemable characters might stand a chance of a third-act reversal. McDormand is leather-tough and tersely funny, there＊s superb support from Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell, and McDonagh＊s script crackles, not just with off-the-peg folksy profanity but with a genuine sense of surprise.The other standout was a film that I suspect won＊t really make sense till a second, maybe a third viewing. It＊s , the first feature in seven years from Argentinian director Lucrecia Martel (, ). Its protagonist is a hapless functionary in 18th-century Paraguay, and while not much happens (star Daniel Gim谷nez Cacho largely wanders around, perplexed, under a three-cornered hat), when it finally does, it＊s violently unsettling. This hallucinatory work vaguely suggests a stoned, swampy relative of 1970s Werner Herzog, but invents its own cinematic language.So arguably does , the festival＊s one genuine controversy. The latest from Darren Aronofsky, it starts off as a sort of  home invasion movie, with Jennifer Lawrence as a woman married to a blocked writer (Javier Bardem) whose life is turned upside when a troublesome couple (Ed Harris, a super-sinister Michelle Pfeiffer) pay a visit. Then more people visit, and soon the film has become an apocalyptic free-for-all that＊s possibly an allegory for＃ well, we＊re invited to decide for ourselves. By the end,  feels like a loud, drunken dinner-party argument between Bu?uel, Polanski, Fellini and Eug豕ne Ionesco. It also rather resembles Lars von Trier, except that Aronofsky doesn＊t have one jot of Von Trier＊s impish humour. I found it cosmically idiotic, although some critics hailed it; still, you won＊t see a Hollywood film this outre in a hurry.Most other offerings were easier to pigeonhole.  (directed by Micha?l R Roskam) was a glossily enjoyable thriller romance about a racing driver (Ad豕le Exarchopoulos) and her robber fiance (Matthias Schoenaerts), fuelled by genre energies and the leads＊ not inconsiderable chemistry. Stephen Frears offered a business-as-usual variant on the heritage pic in , with Judi Dench dusting off her Queen Victoria performance in the story of the queen and her beloved Indian Muslim attendant (a personable Ali Fazal). Scripted by Lee Hall, it tries for a satire of colonial attitudes but never escapes from the Faberg谷 chocolate box.A better, more down-to-earth British production was Andrew Haigh＊s , which follows a teenage boy in crisis as he finds hope in his attachment to the racehorse of the title. Steve Buscemi and Chlo? Sevigny give characterful support, up-and-comer Charlie Plummer is an engagingly candid lead, and Haigh＊s picture of back-road America feels involvingly authentic. But, fine though the film is, it could almost have been made by any of a handful of US indie auteurs, and it＊s a shame that Haigh 每 whose  and  so brilliantly cast new light on intimate corners of British life 每 should have taken such a well-beaten transatlantic track.Among the major disappointments was George Clooney＊s , part-written by the Coen brothers. Set in a squeaky-clean 1950s community, it＊s about a boy who realises that his family members (Matt Damon, Julianne Moore) aren＊t the paragons they seem; meanwhile, their black neighbours face racist hostility. It＊s as if Clooney had gussied up a standard Coens murder story with additional contemporary relevance, and the facetious result is offensively superficial.Meanwhile, one US film that gave you faith in some survival of American sanity was , veteran Frederick Wiseman＊s exhaustive documentary about the New York Public Library. Characteristically, he stands back without comment and simply shows how the institution works, through glimpses of careers fairs, slam poetry recitals, Braille training sessions and talks from Patti Smith, Richard Dawkins and Elvis Costello. We also get several board meetings, reminding us that culture and literacy have to be perpetually fought for, and financed. Though perhaps not one of Wiseman＊s very best, it＊s nevertheless a revealing study.Also taking his time to expand on a theme, Abdellatif Kechiche 每 who made controversial Cannes winner  每 returned with , a three每hour drama (with, presumably, more to come) about a shy young north African man spending the summer in the French Mediterranean town of S豕te, which seems to be populated almost entirely by beautiful young women in cut-off shorts and the men who hit on them. The film is a hymn to sun, sex, hedonism, loud conversation and women＊s bottoms; it＊s ferociously energetic, but one-dimensional, and if you think Kechiche showed lecherous tendencies in , he abandons all shame here.Also wildly self-indulgent was , a would-be Dostoevskian chamber piece by US director James Toback, in which Sienna Miller kills her boyfriend, then receives visits from a variety of loquacious types, including Toback himself, dropping in to discuss the meaning of life; even old Fyodor would have told Toback to lighten up. And , by fashion designers , was a druggy reverie starring Kirsten Dunst, so oblique that critics huddled outside afterwards to try and pin down the basic plot points.But no self-indulgence quite beat the excesses of Jim Carrey, as seen in , about the star＊s performance as comic Andy Kaufman in 1999 biopic . Chris Smith＊s fascinating documentary is based on footage of Carrey on set, permanently in character either as Kaufman or his monstrous creation, slobbish crooner Tony Clifton. Interviewed today, a wild-eyed, wildly earnest Carrey muses on Kaufman＊s conceptual weirdness and his own career, and wonders whether the role might have caused him some psychic damage. As an essay partly on the perils of going beyond method, partly on the worst extremes of movie-star ego,  is the most hair-raising horror movie of the year.

"here was a literal turning point in Eddie Izzard＊s lifelong pursuit of personal freedom. It came one afternoon in 1985 when he had gone out for the first time in a dress and heels and full makeup down Islington high street. He was 23 and he had been planning 每 and avoiding 每 that moment for just about as long as he could remember. The turning point came after he was chased down the road by some teenage girls who had caught him changing back into his jeans in the public toilets and wanted to let him know he was weird. That pursuit ended when eventually, faced with the screamed question ※Hey, why were you dressed as a woman?§, he decided simply to stop running and turn and explain himself.He spun around to give an answer, but before he got many words out the girls had run in the opposite direction. The experience taught him some things: that there was power in confronting fear rather than avoiding it; and that from then on he would never let other people define him. After that afternoon, he says, he not only felt he could face down the things that scared him, he went chasing after them: street performing, standup comedy, marathon running, political activism, improvising his stage show in different languages 每 all these things felt relatively easy after that original coming out as what he calls ※transvestite or transgender§. ※You think, if I can do something that hard, but positive 每 maybe I can do anything.§The ※anything§ he has been doing most recently is to take on the challenge of acting opposite Judi Dench and Michael Gambon. In Stephen Frears＊s interpretation of the true story of Queen Victoria＊s late-life friendship with an Indian servant, , Izzard plays a full-bearded, tweed-suited Bertie (later Edward VII), reining in his comic instincts to inhabit the outrage and scheming of a son seeing his mother apparently making a fool of herself. Izzard has done plenty of films before 每 he was in  and alongside George Clooney and Brad Pitt and the rest 每 but nothing that has required quite this level of costume drama restraint. He loved it.He and Dench are old friends. She has been a regular at his stage shows and has been in the habit, for reasons forgotten, of sending a banana to his dressing room each opening night, with ※Good luck!§ written on it. Seeing her channel Victoria at close quarters was a daily masterclass. The film was shot partly at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight (the first time any film crew had been allowed inside by ) and the cast would let their hair down in the evenings. One time, Izzard recalls: ※I was dancing with Judi to Ray Charles＊s ＆What＊d I Say＊. She felt like a young woman, a young teenage girl almost. Judi has this amazing spark of vitality that traces all the way back to her youth.§Watching the film, you＊re so ready to see Izzard slip into one of his wayward meanders of consciousness that for a while it seems odd that he stays on script. Does it feel that way to him too?※Not now,§ he says. ※My early work as an actor wasn＊t very good because I just switched all my comedy muscles off, and I didn＊t know what to replace them with. I think I have learned more how to just ＆be＊ on film now. It is just like knowing how to both ride a bicycle and drive a car. If you are in a car you don＊t want to lean sideways to turn a corner. You know the difference.§Ever since he bunked off school and conned his way into Pinewood Studios as a 15-year-old and wandered the film sets for a day, he has imagined himself an actor. The first thing he did when his comedy finally took off after years of trying and often failing to make people laugh was to get himself a drama agent and see if he could pursue a twin career. He has never been satisfied with just doing one thing, and it appears that determination to diversify has only grown. He＊s 55, and because of his running 每 which peaked at in the UK and  每 he looks lean and almost alarmingly bright-eyed. We are talking in a hotel room in London, and he is dressed sharply in ※boy with eyeliner§ mode. He works on the belief, he says, that human beings were never made to sit still or settle, but to place themselves in challenging situations, and then work out how to cope.※World war two is a good example,§ he suggests. ※People got dropped behind enemy lines with no idea of what they were going into. They had to learn to do a great deal under extreme pressure and on the move. And they proved they could. In a very different way, I think coming out as transgender allowed me to put myself in other terrifying situations and work them out once I was in them. I knew I would get through the bad, terrifying bit 每 and there was a lot of that when I was a street performer 每 and eventually get to a more interesting place.§He has, of late, paused to reflect on the motivations behind that impulse, first in a documentary film,  made by his ex-lover and long-term collaborator Sarah Townsend, and then in an autobiography, . The first two elements of that latter subtitle mostly led Izzard back to his mother, who died of cancer when he was six years old. Making the film, Townsend came to suggest that all Izzard＊s inspired digressive habits circled around this truth, and in his book, in opening chapters too poignant to read easily, he expands on that thought.※Toward the end of the film, I started talking about my mother＃ § he recalls. ※And I said something revelatory: ＆I know why I＊m doing all this,＊ I said. ＆Everything I do in life is trying to get her back. I think if I do enough things＃ that maybe she＊ll come back.＊§ When he said those words, he says, it felt like his unconscious speaking. The thought stayed with him that ※I do believe I started performing and doing all sorts of big, crazy, ambitious things because on some level, on some childlike magical-thinking level, I thought doing those things might bring her back.§I wonder, having got those things out into the public, nearly half a century on, if it has changed how he thinks about himself?※I certainly feel I am in a better place,§ he says 每 but also it has given him a sense of his own strangeness. ※There is that thing where people say wow about the marathons or whatever. And I kind of say wow too, because there are some things I did that, looking back, I don＊t know how I did them.  a double marathon on the last day in South Africa. It was 11 hours of not fun. And about five minutes of euphoria. I＊m not sure how I did that.§One of the things about marathons 每 even if you are running, as he was some of the time in the UK, followed by an ice-cream van blaring the theme 每 is that there is an awful lot of time for thinking. Does his mind ever pause for breath?※I have a lucky thing,§ he says, ※which is that I am interested in any question 每 how did we get here? all the religions. I can think about anything. For example when I did the 43 [marathons] I ran past a sign saying ＆the Battle of Naseby: 1 mile＊ and I＊m immediately off thinking about Cromwell and Fairfax, Prince Rupert maybe, and how this road I was running on would have been a track back then and maybe the cavalry came down it, how did they get cannon round that bend, all that, at every moment＃ §Talking to Izzard, and watching him perform, you sense he has a kind of need of not ever wanting to miss any scrap of experience. It＊s partly, he suggests, why he has broadened his repertoire of doing standup in different languages in recent years.※German has been the hardest so far,§ he says. He is doing Arabic next, planning a show in the Yemen (he was born in Aden, where his father worked for a time for BP) to draw attention to the brutal civil war there, and after that, Mandarin Chinese. As he explains this, blithely, I＊m reminded both of the passages in his book where he writes about the strategies he developed to overcome severe dyslexia as a child, and his uneasy relationship with his late stepmother, Kate. The antithesis of performing as a younger man for the memory of his mother was a refusal to be limited by Kate＊s efforts to control him. She wanted him to be an accountant because he was good with numbers, if not with reading. He recalls her once telling him: ※You＊ve got to understand that you are a cog in the machine. As soon as you understand that, you can fit in and get on with life.§ You can only imagine how that went down. Does he ever think he will become more accepting of limits?※I have a very strong sense that we are only on this planet for a short length of time,§ he says. ※And that is only growing. Religious people might think it goes on after death. My feeling is that if that is the case it would be nice if just one person came back and let us know it was all fine, all confirmed. Of all the billions of people who have died, if just one of them could come through the clouds and say, you know, ＆It＊s me Jeanine, it＊s brilliant, there＊s a really good spa＊, that would be great.§ He pauses. ※Although what if heaven was only like three-star, OK-ish. You know, ＆Some of the taps don＊t work＃ ＊§He puts his success down not to any particular talent, but to his being ※brilliantly boring. Some people are maybe brilliantly interesting. But I have the opposite gift.§ That, and stamina, and that unlimited curiosity about the world.For a BBC series about genealogy he went to Africa to trace the percentage of his genetic make-up that was Neanderthal. It reinforced his sense that there was nothing new under the sun, that people had always been the same. ※We never think of cavemen being envious of the neighbours with the better cave, but no doubt they were,§ he says.In villages in Namibia, women were fascinated by his nail varnish; some of the men, too. ※You know if you have a football and some nail polish and a smile you can walk into any village in the world and find friends,§ he says. ※There are 7 billion of us on the planet now and we should be linking up more. Ninety-nine per cent of us would be live-and-let-live and ＆Hi and how are you?＊. But the 1% aren＊t happy with that, they want to actively stir it up and tell us that is not the way to go on.§Talk of politics is a reminder of Izzard＊s interventions in last year＊s referendum campaign, in which he tried to use his experiences of doing comedy in French and German and Spanish as an example of how Europe might be a place where you could share culture, rather than be defensive about it. In those fevered weeks, his arguments were sometimes made to look naive; the and the rest roasted him after  on .He admits that he is sometimes still learning in politics, but is unrepentant about his efforts to try to advance a cause that he has been engaged in as a performer for a long while.※Running and hiding from Europe cannot be the way forward for us,§ he says. ※The idea that Britain can go back to 1970 and it will still be all the same just can＊t be an option.§Does he think there is still hope for Remainers?※It seems to me people are always capable of being either brave and curious or fearful and suspicious. If you track humanity all the way through, the periods of success for civilisation are those periods where we have been brave and curious.§There is plenty of fear and suspicion in the world though. How does he think it will go?※I don＊t know. If you look at the 1930s there are obviously clear examples of how individuals can spin these kinds of fears and twist them, and then you get what historians usually call mass-murdering fuckheads in power.§He has long talked of looking to run as a Labour MP in the next election. Is that still the case?※Yes, the plan was always to run in 2020, though Theresa May has changed that with her failed power grab. So now it＊s the first general election after 2020.§He will also put himself forward for Labour＊s national executive committee at the party conference this year. He didn＊t make it last time, though he got 70,000 votes. And if and when he becomes an MP, he will give up acting and performing?※I would. It＊s like Glenda Jackson; she gave up acting for 25 years to concentrate on it, then she turns up back as .§I wonder if another ambition, to eventually have children, still applies?※I always said kids in my 50s. But I also always felt that I had to do things first. Get this stuff done. But yes, I haven＊t given up on that.§For someone who was dealt an early lesson about the fragility of life, his long-term planning sounds odd. Does he feel that contradiction?※I think we should all choose a year we would like to live to, and do everything we can to make that work. I mean it could all go wrong at any point, obviously. But we also know that if we don＊t get ill or get hit by a bus we can help ourselves by drinking enough water and keeping as fit as you were when you were a kid. As we get older and we get a bit creaky we take that as a sign to stop doing stuff. My sense is we should push through creaky. I was feeling a bit sluggish recently, about a month ago, I thought right, I＊ll do seven marathons in seven days. And off I go. The first four were a bit rubbish, but you push on through that.§He must have good joints?※I mangled my knee up a while ago, trying to jump over a fence,§ he says. ※But it healed up, and now it complains only when I don＊t use it enough.§Is there some genetic explanation for his energy?※Dad loved football, played until his late 30s. I don＊t know about Mum. She liked singing and comedy and Flanders and Swann but I＊m not sure about sport.§I hear his voice break just slightly. Izzard still can＊t really talk about his mother easily, at least not in an interview. In his book he describes how in the immediate aftermath of her death he and his dad and his brother cried together for half an hour and then stopped in case they went on for ever. In place of therapy dad bought his sons a model railway set and they built it in the spare room and immersed themselves in it. The set recently resurfaced when Izzard had it restored and donated it to a museum in their home town of Bexhill-on-Sea, another part of his excavation of that time.※Dad encouraged us with it after Mum died,§ he says, by way of explanation. ※He made a table for us and we spent hours and hours building it. Then in 1975 my stepmother, Kate, came along and it was put away into boxes and never came out again. It went from Dad＊s attic to my brother＊s attic, and he didn＊t know what to do with it. I thought, why not give it to the museum in Bexhill? I guessed there might be plenty of model railway enthusiasts in Bexhill, and they rebuilt this thing, it＊s kind of a collector＊s item. They are now going to build another one, a Christmas version. We had a grand opening and Dad came down to see it.§He likes the fact that he is in a position to make these kinds of things happen.

"his lively, low-budget documentary about Labour MP  won＊t win the 85-year-old Derbyshire native any new fans, but is nevertheless an absorbing portrait of ※the Beast of Bolsover§. Director Daniel Draper has spoken about not wanting to date the film with too many references to current issues (indeed, the film was mostly shot in 2014, some time before Brexit or Jeremy Corbyn＊s leadership). As a celebration of old-school socialism and a historical account of Skinner＊s class-conscious rabble-rousing, it＊s effective enough, but Draper＊s tendency towards timelessness means his film lacks urgency, suggesting a reluctance of the Labour party＊s old guard to engage with contemporary politics.

"his is ＊s third recording of Bach＊s solo Sonatas and Partitas, the pinnacle of the violin repertoire, but don＊t fear that he has run out of things to say. His sleeve note explaining his approach to the cycle is as thoughtful and personal as you would expect from him, and his realisation of it in performance does indeed hang together as a journey from solemnity towards acceptance and joy, with the lengthy Chaconne of the D minor Sonata perhaps representing a very personal bereavement.Within this, the movements can be not only unpredictable, as one expects from Tetzlaff, but uneven, and the odd one doesn＊t come off 每 the second Double of the first Sonata, for example, which races by in short, springy bow strokes, so fast that it sounds gabbled. Yet the slower movements in particular have a ruminative air and a clarity that is entirely absorbing.																																											"
"he shimmer that ushers in the First Violin Concerto is arguably the closest got to engaging with musical modernism. He seems to have remained wary of it, and even in the gorgeous textures and neurotic orchestral activity of the First Concerto there is the sense of keeping this exotic world at arms＊ length, of never fully yielding to its charms.  performance of the work is rather like that too, highly polished but a bit aloof and detached, even though  conjures all the necessary colours from the BBC Symphony Orchestra around the solo line.There is much more sense of engagement in the Second Concerto, Szymanowski＊s last major work, where the squarer, folksy melodies and leaner orchestration seem to suit Little＊s no-nonsense directness much better.  much more traditionally romantic 1902 Violin Concerto is included on the disc, and hearing the confidence with which she attacks it, it＊s hard to escape the feeling that Little is much more comfortable with its uncomplicated rhetoric than she is with the ambiguities of Szymanowski＊s more subtly nuanced and coloured world.

"o-called ※gay cure therapy§ isn＊t medicine, science, or indeed therapy: it＊s abuse. Medical professionals regard the practice, which sees homosexuality as a fixable ※condition§, as scientifically discredited, unethical and harmful. When my first boyfriend came out, aged 15, his parents drove him to a pseudo-scientist to be cured of his homosexuality: consider this against a context of being bullied at school for being gay. .This week, . ※On next we＊ll meet the man who claims we can ＆cure＊ homosexuality in men,§ the show casually tweeted. ※Any thoughts?§ All of a sudden an abusive practice that inflicts horrendous psychological harm, that is rooted in extreme bigotry, in the very idea that being gay is a bad thing and that gay people should cease to exist, became an opinion worthy of national television. However much Piers Morgan harangued him, Davidson＊s presence on air conferred on him a legitimacy he doesn＊t deserve. There are different views, after all, on how much the rich should be taxed, or how high the minimum wage should be, or who should own the railways. But whether homosexuality should be erased by an abusive practice treated as a valid alternative perspective? Believing LGBTQ people to be inferior and desiring their disappearance from society is not simply a matter of opinion to be debated. It is bigotry 每 which causes profound damage to human beings.All LGBTQ people hear ※gay§ being bandied around as an insult from the earliest age; they may face verbal or physical bullying, from relatives, friends, people on the street; they may be rejected by family; they are relentlessly bombarded 每 even now 每 with the idea that there is something wrong with being lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or queer; they may be discriminated against in the workplace. The damage is long-lasting and profound: they have much higher rates of mental distress, of suicide, of alcohol and drug abuse. Imagine you were a teenager struggling with your sexuality 每 one of the loneliest feelings there is 每 and then saw a quack being given a platform to say you are effectively afflicted by a disease that requires a cure.We could dismiss Davidson as just a quack if it weren＊t for the fact that many of our hard-won LGBTQ rights seem to be under threat. Only this week Oxford vice-chancellor §. Her job, she said, ※isn＊t to make you feel comfortable. Education is not about being comfortable. I＊m interested in making you uncomfortable.§ Apparently if students ※don＊t like his views§, they should simply ※challenge them, engage with them§.And here is where the disingenuous ※free speech§ debate enters stage right. I share the . I am not proposing, however, that Davidson should be arrested or incarcerated for his reprehensible views. He should remain free to express them wherever he chooses: in his home, in a pub, standing on a soapbox in the street, distributing his own vile leaflets. That does not mean he should be granted a platform by broadcasters to disseminate his harmful bile. Being provided with a platform is not the same thing as free speech, however much it is falsely and disingenuously portrayed as such. If someone refuses to lend you a megaphone, they are not infringing your right to say what you believe: they are simply not offering you their own resources to amplify your views to a broader audience. The millions of people who never appear on TV or radio and are never provided with newspaper space to promote their views are not having their right to free speech undermined or attacked.The left is waging war on free speech, screeches the populist right on both sides of the Atlantic. Yet its interpretation of free speech is: ※The right to say whatever I like about minorities without facing any challenge.§ Any criticism of their expressed prejudices is treated somehow as an attack on their free speech. Like oppressors throughout history, they portray themselves as the ones who are really oppressed: they are free speech martyrs, besieged by an intolerant leftwing rabble.The one freedom they seem to truly care about is the freedom to incite bigotry; this freedom trumps the freedom of minorities to live unencumbered by prejudice, threats to personal safety, and discrimination. Words do indeed have consequences. The vilification of immigrants in the EU referendum led Britain＊s small minority of abusive bigots to believe they had been legitimised and now had a mandate:  on Britain＊s streets as a result.Perversely, it is these rightwing abusers of ※free speech§ who are the most chronically offended. While those on the left object to the hounding of minorities and women, the right are offended by critiques of privilege, attempts to come to terms with the past, or simply ideas that challenge injustice. When , the rightwing self-professed ※free speech§ brigade did not rush to her defence. Quite the contrary: they frothed with outrage.When L＊Or谷al  for demanding white people tackle a systemic racism bred from centuries of slavery, wars of oppression, colonial subjugation, and subsequent famines and genocides, the rightwing ※free speech§ brigade did not proclaim she was entitled to her opinion. Instead she was bombarded with abuse and threats of violence. Rightwing Brexiteers are continually offended and enraged by critics 每 scrutineers, even 每 of the Tories＊ Brexit approach, smearing them as ※saboteurs§ and ※enemies of the people§. Any attempt to scrutinise privilege 每 whether it be that granted by class, race, gender or sexuality 每 is greeted with paroxysms of fury by rightwing, well-heeled, white, straight male commentators who find the notion that they have been the lifelong beneficiaries of odds stacked in their favour as almost unbearably offensive. Today＊s populist right is built on offence, on the twisted idea that the struggles of minorities and women for equality insults and attacks those who are white, male and straight.In an era in which prejudice and bigotry have been given renewed legitimacy, providing platforms for homophobes on national television is dangerous. Free speech is indeed sacred, a hard-won right extracted from the powerful at huge cost. It does not mean the right to incite hatred, not least on public platforms provided by others. But the bigots who clothe themselves in the garb of free speech have no real interest in it. They just want the right to hate without challenge.

"aurie is dead. Laurie was the popular pub landlord in a pretty English village. Now it＊s time for son Stephen (David Mitchell) to step up to the plate, in the pub, in the village, as head of the family. Trouble is Stephen＊s not much of a stepper-up-to-the-plate. More of a faff-around-the-edges kind of chap. It doesn＊t help that he keeps on turning into his roughly 12-year-old self (nice touch, that). He has never really grown up, broken away, achieved anything, taken any risks or responsibilities, asserted himself.And it really doesn＊t help when Andrew (Robert Webb) shows up at the funeral. Andrew is a smooth-talking, jetset high-achiever (he says) who was once fostered for a few months by the family. He says. Stephen doesn＊t remember him and thinks he may be a con man, a Martin Guerre type. But they 每 Laurie and Ellen, his weed-smoking hippy wife (lovely from Penny Downie) 每 did foster a lot of kids. And no one else thinks there＊s anything at all suspicious about Andrew; they all think he＊s fabulous.Got it?  (Channel 4) doesn＊t have the most straightforward of premises; it takes a bit of setting up. But that＊s done well, and it＊s worth the effort, because once you＊re on top of things, it＊s an interesting place to be. A mine with many seams: fostering and foster siblings and the tricky relationship between foster children and biological ones in the same family; growing up and breaking free v not growing up and not breaking free; parents＊ shadows and living in them; the father-son thing; dead dads; a bit of parochial gossipy village life; and more.Speaking of shadows, any comedy starring  is inevitably going to get compared with the incomparable . Plus Back is the baby of Simon Blackwell, who wrote a few episodes of that too. And a few bells do inevitably ring, there is some crossover, principally in the two leads, and their relationship. Mitchell＊s character is uptight and fussy and perpetually annoyed by Webb＊s, who is more impulsive, gets less worked up about things, as well as being really annoying. But that＊s just who they are, as individuals and as a double act, and why they work so well together. There＊s enough difference in the situation and the setup for this to be quite distinct.I had some concerns about its boldness and bluntness. ※He fucking hated you, you tedious shitbag,§ Stephen says to a villager (after the tedious shitbag＊s gone, of course; there＊s nothing bold about Stephen, remember). But then, in the pub, there＊s some comedy based on misunderstanding and wordplay.※I feel like I need to give him a big brother send-off,§ says Geoff, in the pub, about the funeral.※Do you still watch Big Brother?§ says Jan, who works behind the bar.※No, I meant cos Laurie was my big brother,§ says Geoff.It＊s not just word play. ※We haven＊t watched it since Nadia was in it,§ says Mike, who also works behind the bar.※I never had you down as watching Big Brother, Geoff,§ says Jan. So now it＊s about Jan and Mike not listening to a word Geoff says. That＊s funnier.The gags get better, too. There＊s a music festival nearby, with four stages, someone tells Andrew, trying to impress him, perhaps persuade him to stay. ※Yeah, like cancer,§ says Stephen.The best line of the night, about vinyl records, has nothing to do with word play or double entendres though 每 but it is glorious, artful, beautifully timed, The Thick Of It filth. Thank you, Simon Blackwell.Or perhaps he＊s saved the best til last, the end of the episode? When Geoff, who＊s done a nice 70s soundtrack for his big brother＊s wake, goes to the loo, taking his iPad with him. The family is having a chat about Andrew staying, and suddenly Porn Hub is playing over the wireless speaker, crystal clear: ※Right there, oh my God ＃§It＊s a hilarious, and rather modern Bluetooth audio joke. And one that actually took on extra excrutiatingness in my house. I was rewatching the episode (I take my job very seriously) on my laptop at home, sitting on the sofa.

"n October 2004, , then an Illinois state legislator, appeared on the cover of Black Enterprise, a popular African-American business monthly. It was his first-ever cover, and he shocked the magazine＊s editors by proclaiming his intention to run for the United States Senate. They wondered if the young statesman was setting his hopes too high. Nevertheless, they ran the cover story with the prophetic headline: The next big thing in politics.Cut to 2008, and Obama, having made it to the US Senate, now had his sights on the presidency. The experts said that America was not ready for an African-American leader; that white people wouldn＊t vote for a non-white candidate or a man with a funny-sounding name, whose middle name is Hussein and who actually has Muslim relatives; and that even if they did, he would be assassinated before he saw out his first term.After they were proved wrong and Obama was elected in November 2008, people went out in droves to buy newspapers and magazines with him on their covers, as commemorative keepsakes. His face was everywhere, providing print publishers with a bump to flagging sales. In a few short years, Obama had risen from obscurity to become the most famous person in the world.I was in New York on election night 2008, and I too was swept up in the melee over the country＊s first African-American president. I bought several newspapers and magazines featuring the face of the new commander-in-chief, and before long found myself fanatically collecting examples from all over the world, trawling the newsstands and eBay, then wrapping my finds in plastic jackets and placing them carefully into storage, like ancient artefacts. Soon I had hundreds.There has never been a president who has straddled such a diversity of titles, from political and literary journals to hip-hop monthlies and comic books. His allure as a cover star went far beyond his vocation. Obama was the Sidney Poitier of politics 每 not only because he was the first black man to break through the racial restrictions of his profession, but also because he possessed the same dignified aura and princely posture.During his eight-year tenure, the press presented Obama as feminist, communist, fashion model, Jew, the messiah, Superman, George Washington, President Franklin Roosevelt, Julius Caesar, Muslim terrorist and even the Hindu deity Lord Shiva. This bizarre kaleidoscope of characterisations reflected a sense of confusion about what Obama stood for and the impossible scope of expectations heaped upon him.The two Obama covers that stirred the most contention when he was in office were published by New York magazine (28 September 2009) and the New Yorker (21 July 2008). The former appropriated artist , turning it on its head to reflect the views of those who the cover line referred to as ※the Obama crazies§. The president＊s face was graffitied with words such as socialist, impostor and Muslim, and the word HOPE was replaced by HATE. The cover 每  by the American Society of Magazine Editors 每 was criticised for its malevolent depiction of the new president, but the magazine maintained that the words used reflected not their views, but those of a section of Obama＊s dissenters.A year earlier, the New Yorker made headlines around the world just hours after its issue hit newsstands. It featured a cartoon, entitled The politics of fear, depicting Barack and  as terrorists standing in the Oval Office. Obama, who is a Christian, is dressed in traditional Muslim clothing, while Michelle is in Black Panther-style military fatigues, an AK-47 slung over her shoulder. The pair exchange a fist bump while an American flag burns in the fireplace beneath a portrait of Osama bin Laden.The day after its release, the cover was among the top 20 Google searches. But while the controversy propelled newsstand sales to record levels, editor  was forced to come out in defence of the artwork. ※What I think it [the cover] does is hold up a mirror to the prejudice and dark imaginings about Barack Obama＊s 每 both Obamas＊ 每 past, and their politics,§ he stated, later adding drily: ※A satirical cartoon would not be any good if it came with a set of instructions.§It was during the buildup to the 2008 election that Obama was first cast by the US print media as Superman and the messiah (or Obamessiah, as he was often called). The 20 March edition of Rolling Stone featured an illustration of the statesman bathed in an angelic glow of white light, while the cover of the New Republic＊s 30 January issue depicted him as a Christ-like figure within a stained glass window, complete with halo. Meanwhile, the winter 2009 cover of Ms featured the president-elect as a black feminist Superman. Obama, not as president but as saviour.Was it racist to depict Obama this way, in the knowledge that doing so was to set him up to fail? Some would say no, because that is simply how he presented himself to the 2008 electorate: as a transformative figure who would fix everything, who would bring radical change. Of course, every white president before Obama promised the same thing while electioneering 每 yet the press chose not to depict them as a flying demigod in crimson underpants. Because Obama was the first black president, expectations were high, and when he turned out not to have magic powers many felt let down. The 20 October 2012 edition of the Spectator skilfully captured the end of Obama＊s honeymoon period: an illustration of the president, again as a caped Superman figure, only this time caught in the midst of a fatal kryptonite moment, falling helplessly out of the sky, his powers sapped, his body suddenly mortal.Overall, however, Obama＊s covers have been overwhelmingly more flattering than Trump＊s. Where Obama was depicted as a charismatic statesman, Trump has been lampooned as a buffoon; where Obama was portrayed as a family man, Trump has been derided as a sexual predator. In what looks like an outtake from a Marvel Comics plotline, two separate 2016 covers of the New York Daily News depict Obama as Superman, Trump as Batman＊s Joker.This June it was revealed that on the walls of four of Trump＊s golfing properties hung framed copies of a  featuring his own image, along with the cover line: ※The Apprentice is a television smash!§ Was jealousy the primary motivator in manufacturing his own favourable cover story?  covers during the 2008 election year, compared to .The cover of  on 2 Feb 2009 captures the moment many thought would never come: the inauguration of Obama as the 44th president of the United States. When the country＊s very first president, George Washington, was inaugurated on 30 April, 1789, black people there were slaves. Now, 220 years later, here was an African-American president. It was a fairytale come true, and this image 每 arguably the most powerful in American history 每 marks that dramatic, startling moment.  by Ben Arogundade is published by .

"t＊s hard to watch any film in the current political climate and not look for parallels to , but Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down The White House arrives seeming less like a coded message than a direct plea. The FBI needs to remember that they are independent of the White House, and have an obligation to do right by any means necessary.Obviously, this movie, directed by Peter Landesman and produced by Ridley Scott, was in production well before any current investigations concerning inappropriate Russian meddling with the 2016 election. Moreover, the actions taken by Mark Felt (Liam Neeson) during Watergate weren＊t quite as altruistic as one might think.Felt, known better to the world as Deep Throat (the slightly risque sobriquet given by Washington Post editors to reporter ＊s secret, well-placed source), didn＊t initially begin leaking information to the press because he had it in for Richard Nixon. He did it because he was passed over for a job.When J Edgar Hoover, , died after maintaining a chamber of secrets for almost 40 years, Richard Nixon appointed an interim chief who was loyal to the White House instead of promoting Felt, the longtime second-in-command. The new boss Pat Gray (Marton Csokas) knows where his bread is buttered, but he also knows that Felt is untouchable. Things come to a head not so much because the dirty tricks group , but because Gray asks Felt to ease off digging into it at the White House＊s behest. It isn＊t so much that the White House crossed the line 每 it＊s that they crossed the Bureau.It＊s this distinction that prevents this film from being a total bore. It is, instead, only a somewhat bore. The problems include Landesman＊s drab shooting style (so many washed-out gray and light blue offices) and the preposterous background music, which crashes down on piano keys whenever anyone says anything important. Then there＊s the inarticulate script that drew some chuckles during the press screening. Worst example: ※Can you get this out before November 7th?§ ※That＊s Election Day!§Liam Neeson certainly looks cool when he gazes through blinds at the White House, and we＊re meant to wonder ※what＊s he thinking?§ But every time anyone opens their mouth all subtlety is smashed to bits. It＊s as if Landesman watched Tomas Alfredson＊s  and set out to do the same thing, but only managed a heavy-handed rehash.A secondary story about Felt＊s troubled marriage is given no room to breathe and all poor Diane Lane has to do is look sad in period clothing with a drink in her hand. The Felts＊ daughter has run off to a far-left hippie commune and this perhaps is why Felt takes such a hard (and knowingly illegal) line against domestic terrorist groups like The Weather Underground. Much of the time Felt is shown as distancing himself from the dirty tricks of Hoover＊s earlier years, and Tom Sizemore＊s cartoonish ※bad G-man§ Bill Sullivan is repulsive compared to the broad-shouldered and noble Felt.The implication is that the unconstitutional acts Felt approved in this specific arena were done to ※save§ his daughter. Maybe they＊d never even make it into this biopic (based on Felt＊s own book, and likely approved by his estate) if he didn＊t eventually get indicted. (President Reagan quickly acquitted him.)The worst thing, though, is that there＊s already a masterpiece of a film telling this story from the other side, Alan J Pakula＊s . (Hell, even Oliver Stone＊s Nixon is better.) It＊s surprising that a film about Deep Throat could be such an anticlimax.																																											"

"he overwhelming English sadness of Ian McEwan＊s novella  has been transferred to the movie screen, adapted by the author and directed with scrupulous sensitivity and care by , known for his stage work and making his feature film debut here. It is a tender and valuable film, well acted, with a shrewd eye for how naive you can be in your early 20s, how impatient, how pompous, how tragicomically un-self-aware.I have to confess to feeling that this film 每 like other adaptations of McEwan, and also  每 is constrained by flashbacks and by a certain literary good taste and hardback cultural prestige. It doesn＊t quite explode into uninhibited life, even when the anger overflows at the end, although this is partly the effect of its setting and era: the cloud-cover of Britain in the duffel-coated early 1960s.It is the story of Florence and Edward, young university graduates getting married in 1962. She is a talented and ambitious classical musician from a well-to-do family and he is a clever young man from humbler origins. Both have first-class degrees and, in consequence, no small opinion of themselves. They go as virgins to the marriage bed in a way that was quite normal then and all but unimaginable now. The setting is a horribly conventional seaside hotel on Chesil Beach in Dorset, whose wild and windblown expanse is in grim contrast to their own corseted timidity and ignorance. Its loneliness is, however, appropriate enough, and Cooke and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt contrive a moment in which they look marooned on that beach, as if washed up from some disaster.The wedding night is a painful, intimately humiliating fiasco with devastating consequences. The novel has a famous coup, in which McEwan telescopes the rest of Edward＊s life into just a few pages 每 a brisk parade of inconsequence that allows you to understand how important that single evening had been. The movie replicates this nicely, but with a notably more emollient resolution.Billy Howle plays Edward, a role not so very different from his part as young Tony in the recent film version of Barnes＊s : smart, hardworking with a bit of a temper. After a couple of beers to celebrate his exam results, he feels the need to confide his success to someone, anyone, and stumbles into a CND meeting in Oxford. There he falls head over heels for Florence: a quietly beautiful young violinist played by  with a well fabricated English accent of the time; she gets its sharp, quick chirrup right. Both have family difficulties. Florence＊s mother Violet 每 an amusing cameo for  每 is an arrogant Oxford don who thinks nothing of telephone conversations with Iris Murdoch. Her father Geoffrey is a wealthy engineer (rather looked down on by her mother) played by , with a tendency to male rage unsettlingly like Edward＊s. Edward＊s own dad Lionel is a gentle soul, nicely played by Adrian Scarborough; but his mother Marjorie, played with courage and attack by , is a talented artist whose eccentricities have escalated into mental disturbance due to a horrendous accident: being hit by an opening train door on a railway station platform.That moment is the most shocking in the film: the violence, and then the lifetime of care needed to contain and control its consequences, are well suggested; the movie soberly keeps Marjorie away from any suggestion of black comedy.But all this is revealed, like everything else, in a flashback from the central scene: the newlyweds＊ bedroom, where Edward and Florence endure their excruciating ordeal. It is opened out almost as a stage play might be. Each and every flashback, whether happy or sad, reveals the same poignant thing: they were a thousand times more relaxed in the past than now, at this longed-for moment of supposed abandon. But the flashbacks, though fraught with meaning, have the effect of impeding momentum and taking some emotional weight away from what＊s happening in the present tense on Chesil Beach. There＊s even a flashback-within-a-flashback. Florence remembers submissively acting as a page-turner for a famous pianist at London＊s Wigmore Hall, and at that moment remembering helping her grumpy dad as a teenager on his yacht.What On Chesil Beach gets right is the sheer silly, tragic pointlessness of the virgin-wedding-night business and how disturbing sex was for a generation whose hypocritical elders had withheld information about it 每 a bizarrely sacrificial ceremony which probably had its last gasp with our own Lady Diana Spencer. And of course it is made even worse by hints that a new era of freedom is arriving but still not quite here, like the Beatles＊ first LP in Larkin＊s poem. A world of wrongness and frustration. The movie is a muted elegy to emotional waste.																																											"

In tonight＊s episode, the proprietor of the titular refuge finds his antennae twitching when a crime eerily evocative of one that he investigated while on the force occurs.

He plays Jim Worth, a Briton who moves to Canada to become police chief of a small town about to be invaded by a big oil company, for whom Christina Hendricks＊s Mrs Bradshaw provides corporate liaison. But when his family come under attack, he reverts to an alter ego he was supposed to have left behind. Issa＊s failed ※ho-tation§ policy is at the centre of a deliciously awkward episode in which all the main characters are deceiving themselves. After an explicit pep talk to herself in the bathroom mirror, Issa tours the men in her life, failing to achieve carefree satisfaction at every turn.

"He is so ineffectual. Everyone was worried about the crazy things he＊d do, but there＊s nothing that he＊s done that can＊t be changed in another administration, like the Paris agreement. There＊s no need to panic. Too many 每 I don＊t want to say liberal lambasts 每 are hitting the panic button too quickly, instead of bringing up issues and talking about them. For me it＊s really a case of: what＊s going on with the senators, what＊s going on on a local level? Sure, Trump is the firebrand, and everyone wants to talk about the return of Nuremburg after that Boy Scout rally, but whatever. People forget: he hasn＊t done shit. He really hasn＊t. Even with his party in control of both houses, nothing has happened. He hasn＊t fulfilled one promise. So what am I scared of? I think people need to calm down, and keep fighting the illogical with logic. He won by the smallest of margins. And honestly, he only got in on a technicality. It＊s shit like that you have to keep reminding yourself of, because they will try and paint a completely different picture. Rhetoric is swirling around. If only there was an interconnected device to look back in time to see what the truth and the reality was! I say that with all the sarcasm in the world.It＊s only because of this presidency that we are getting a really good taste of it. In a misogynistic culture, there＊s this misconception that doing good things for people, and trying to take care of them, is a ※pussy move§. The result is a bunch of people pumping their chests up, and talking shit on women, talking shit on gay people, talking shit about everyone. They feel threatened; their way of life feels threatened.A lot of it has to do with the fact that the liberal and LGBT community is coming at them fast and loose with concepts they are not used to; they＊re not part of their culture, and yet they are being forced to accept them. There＊s liberal fascism in response to the conservative fascism, and it＊s keeping good people in the middle scratching their heads and thinking: I don＊t know what to believe. And part of that reaction is this pumped-up masculine middle finger going: ※You don＊t tell me how to live my life.§ It＊s their mind balking at the fact that they may have to accept something when they haven＊t had the chance to understand what it is.For so many years they have been in control of what is culturally accepted, and the whole LGBT community is trying to override that, because they＊re tired of being marginalised, they＊re tired of being treated like a perversion. It＊s very much a war. I lived through the Reagan years and I grew up during the gas shortage, I grew up seeing some serious shit go down. But I don＊t think the country has been this divided since the 1960s., and I＊m about as qualified as he is, ie not at all. It＊s the same as the Rock 每 I love the idea of him saying  but they＊re just another pair of voices saying that they can ※get it done§, and look where that＊s got us. There are still so many cabinet positions that have not been filled in this administration, because Trump is completely overwhelmed. And that＊s a guy who reportedly knows how to run a business. So what the hell is Kid Rock going to do? It＊s the biggest form of ego I have ever heard in my life. Please go ahead. Drive a car with a blindfold on and see how far it gets you.It brings out this crazy psychosis in all of us. At least on a blind date you have to kind of be yourself 每 they＊re going to see the sweat, and see you＊re struggling. But dating sites and apps put you at ease, and so all the little gnarly quirks and perversions come out. Hey, if it brings freaks together, who am I to judge? I think everyone has someone out there, and I would like to see people get together. But are you really trying to meet the love of your life on Grindr?Romance isn＊t dead, though. As long as there are hopeless romantics like myself, I don＊t think it will die. We will just see an evolution of what romance means. There are still people who love selfless acts. And if it＊s something as weird as a very heartfelt post on Twitter, to some people that＊s huge. To some people that＊s the ultimate act of romance.I＊m the worst hypocrite because I bitch about it, but I＊m just as bad as everyone else. I wander around with this tiny little tablet in my hand, and I look up and see that someone has asked me a question. It＊s so embarrassing. These devices are bringing out all the dopamine that I had wasted for years on smoking and drinking and drugs, and I＊m waiting for what the hangover is going to feel like. I don＊t know what the repercussions are going to be, but maybe we＊re starting to see the end of face-to-face relationships, and more and more people being comfortable with long distance relationships. Why do I need to touch anyone? All I need is my phone and this contact and that＊s all I need.My contribution to being eco-friendly is quitting smoking. I recycle. I do this and that. But all you can really worry about is your own side of things. If you start to think about it on a huge scale then you get overwhelmed. At the same time, I＊d like to think we＊re trying to do the right thing and we are trying to get this planet on the right track; not because of the planet, but because of us. George Carlin nailed this 25 years ago. He said: the planet is fine, the people are fucked! The planet is going to be here long after we are gone. Don＊t try and bullshit me that we are saving the planet 每 we are saving ourselves. We put so much emphasis on the planet and not on the people, because we feel it＊s more selfless, but if people were more honest maybe we would get more done with climate change. I＊m not trying to save shit. I don＊t give a fuck about the planet 每 I just want to keep my kids alive.The industry is trying to make peace with streaming, they＊re finding out how to monetise it, but they＊re still screwing over the artists. It＊s sad because I＊m seeing a lot of bands get out because they can＊t make a living. How are you supposed to make a living when it＊s completely taken out of your hands? I＊m in a unique situation because I＊m in the old system, but I＊m actually able to make a pretty decent living with the new system. I find it hard to bite the hand that feeds me. But at the same time I see all these other bands who can＊t get a break. I don＊t know what the answer is to be honest. I＊m stoked for people like Ed Sheeran 每 that kid worked his ass off, so why shouldn＊t he get the recognition? But at the same time when his songs dominated [the charts] because of streaming, where is the fairness? What about the other artists who worked their asses off, but maybe didn＊t have a million streams?I could have told you this 20 years ago. The thing that bothers me is that people differentiate pop and hip-hop but they＊re the same thing. I hate most new hip-hop. It＊s all the same mush-mouthed bullshit, and it doesn＊t say anything except ※I want to get fucked and drink champagne§. It＊s pathetic. The hip-hop I grew up with had a message. There＊s a reason  is my hero, let me put it that way.A lot of people are upset because too many manufacturing jobs are gone, but there are so many companies coming up that need a workforce. There＊s a reason the market is doing well in America even though the presidency is shit, because the prior presidency actually left behind a healthy infrastructure with growth happening. Trump＊s going to try and take credit for that, but there＊s always a two or four year hangover. The problem comes when you start to see deregulation happening on a federal level when it comes to big business 每 that＊s when the machines come in, that＊s when the outsourcing comes in.But all of these insurance companies are hiring, all of these tech companies are hiring. People look at those industries and go: I＊m not intelligent or pretentious enough. But if you want to feed your family, then a job is a job. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet and go with what you have to do. Follow where the work is. If industries want to keep outsourcing and replacing people with programs, then stop buying those products. Hit them where it hurts. That＊s what it comes down to. You＊re seeing grandmas in Slipknot shirts. It＊s really weird. It makes it easier for me to blend in, which I am completely happy to do; you get tired of the stares after a while. But punk and metallers take ※fascist§ imagery like shaved heads and black clothing and divorce it from racism and nationalism, to make a statement about disaffection; you＊re now seeing people like  who are not only appropriating the imagery of nationalism, but also the rhetoric. The anger, the racism of it. It worries me. Oh, but ? He can kiss my ass.																																											"
"※Are book doulas a thing?§ asks a writer I know. ※I＊d love to get one.§Book doulas  a thing, because where there is a need, there is a service. Traditionally, they were non-medically trained professionals who cared for the emotional wellbeing of women in labour. These days, doulas are used in many other contexts where you may need someone to ease you through a process and provide emotional support, for instance , divorce,  每 and, now, for writing books. Distinguishing themselves from agents and editors, book doulas offer a sort of coaching service, a kind eye to reassure nervous authors who are having trouble getting their book published. , who calls herself an ※editorial coach and consultant, AKA book doula§, refers to her services as ※bookbirthing§. ※I take my time getting to know you, your project and your voice. I listen and focus deeply. Committing your ideas, experiences or life＊s work to writing can be intimidating. I will reassure you,§ writes Ariane on her website, in the warm and fuzzy tone common to many birth doulas. Editor, writing coach and book doula  says the service involves: ※Meeting my clients where they are most vulnerable 每 needing guidance, support, encouragement, empowerment, accountability 每 and helping them to achieve their book goals.§Lawrence, who says the term ※really resonates for me when thinking of the creative process of book writing§, stresses: ※I＊m not a publisher, I＊m not an agent. I＊m a partner in reaching your book goals.§, meanwhile, offers the service for both books and babies. Her website explains: ※I can help with just about anything, from editing and proofreading to cover design and interior formatting, for both physical books and ebooks.§ In short, a book doula can be anything you need her to be.But is it all marketing rubbish? When I describe book doulas to other writers, most take issue with the basic analogy. As a mother and writer myself, I agree that giving birth is most definitely more painful than producing a book. Many other writers I spoke to dismissed book doulas as an expensive luxury 每 and they don＊t come cheap, though they are nowhere as costly as I expected. Conrad doesn＊t share the prices on her website, but Beams does: designing a book cover costs $400 (?307), the same for an ebook will set you back $250. A whole self-publishing package is $1,000, which includes cover design, editing and proofreading of up to 300 pages, and design and formatting for CreateSpace and Kindle.Lawrence offers two different monthly plans, which range from $400 to $600, which pay for some phone consultations, editing and feedback, as well as ※unlimited§ support via email. In comparison,  services usually cost around $30-$40 per hour, although you can pay ).But book doulas seem to be having something of a fertile moment and it is likely they will multiply. Even if it means more competition for her, Lawrence hopes so. ※I think too often we expect that we have to do every hard or big thing in life on our own in order for the outcome or result to be ours and ours alone. This is a dangerous expectation, and the more often we can allow ourselves to be supported, the more often we will succeed in one piece.§Having just spent months working on a self-published book, and having used a (birth) doula when my son was born, I can see the appeal. But whether they＊re fairy godmothers or just a load of marketing nonsense, that＊s for you to decide.																																											"

My grandmother was eight months pregnant with my mother when she had to flee Pakistan during .

That＊s important to say because after  got elected, I felt there was a loss of empathy, of kindness and basic humanity. I wanted to remind people that it＊s OK to be gentle and it＊s OK to be sensitive 每 it doesn＊t make you weak.

Fashion is meant to be aspirational, so if you＊re going to just have white models in your campaigns and on your runways, what message is that sending to young people? We need to change that stereotypical idea of what beauty is.I remember a few years ago I did a show where I only used black models. Many journalists came up to me after the show and asked me why I did that. And I said, ※Have you asked any of the designers who used all white models why they did that?§ And of course diversity is not just about black models, it＊s about Asian models, South Asian models. People need to talk about that; true diversity is all-inclusive.The issue of cultural appropriation is also linked to this. For many years there used to be fashion shoots where a white model would be flown to some exotic location and surrounded by the locals 每 I always found that so inappropriate. You＊ve got an industry that is so lacking diversity but then you＊re trying to pass this kind of thing off as cultural appreciation 每 who thinks that is OK? Wouldn＊t it be better if you had more representation of those people within your industry? Then perhaps it would genuinely be seen as appreciation and not a novelty fun gesture you＊ve done to sell a cute outfit.When I did the Indian collection, some people said, ※Oh my God, is that cultural appropriation?§ I can＊t appropriate my own culture. I think it＊s all about an understanding of where something comes from. When I see a white girl wearing a bindi, for instance, I think: ※Do you really know what that means? Do you know about colonisation?§ But fashion is a good place for driving these debates.																																											"

"t＊s summer, we＊re supposed to be having fun. This isn＊t fun 每 it＊s scary and disgusting!§ ＊s 1986 novel about a shape-shifting demon that terrorises the town of Derry, Maine, was memorably filmed for TV in 1990. Boasting a mesmerising star turn by Tim Curry as the malevolent dancing clown, Pennywise, Tommy Lee Wallace＊s mini-series became every coulrophobe＊s worst nightmare, rivalling ＊s  for the title of best small-screen King adaptation.Now, the Argentinean director Andy Muschietti, who directed 2013＊s creepy , brings a touch of widescreen gloss to King＊s enduring horror-adventure. Drawing heavily on such 80s screen favourites as  and  (both of which were co-written/produced by ), this latest incarnation will resonate with audiences hooked on the nostalgic weirdness of Netflix＊s . The chills may be more funhouse than frightful, but Muschietti＊s tangible affection for the misfit schoolkids at the centre of this story draws us into their world, lending engaging weight to their (pre)adolescent trials and tribulations.Tackling only the early years of King＊s chunky source, this ※Chapter One§ (a sequel is due to follow) relocates the coming-of-age section of the novel from the 50s to the late 80s. Here, poor Georgie Denbrough is dragged into a storm drain by the evil Pennywise (Bill Skarsg?rd, ably filling Curry＊s oversize clown shoes). Riddled with guilt and grief, Georgie＊s older brother Bill (Jaeden Lieberher, who shone in ), becomes obsessed with finding the lost boy. As the summer vacation of ＊89 rolls around, and yet more youngsters disappear, a group of variously bullied ※Losers§ embark upon a -style quest through the woods and into the sewers, in search of a mythical monster.Significantly, each of our key characters is haunted by nightmarish apparitions that feed upon their individual fears. Mike (Chosen Jacobs) sees visions of fiery tragedy that chime with suppressed memories of childhood trauma; Stanley (Wyatt Oleff) is distracted from his bar mitzvah rehearsals by a chaotic face that leers at him from a painting; hypochondriac Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) is pursued by ※a walking infection§ that seems to embody his mother＊s overprotective fantasies. As for Sophia Lillis＊s abused but strongly self-sufficient Beverly (※Who invited Molly Ringwald into the group?§), her Carrie-like anxieties manifest in a bloody eruption that owes less to the lift sequence from  than to Johnny Depp＊s demise in .With his gangly arms and marionette gait, Skarsg?rd＊s wall-eyed killer clown resembles a baby-faced relative of Freddy Krueger. No surprise, then, that  is seen playing at the local cinema. This is a self-reflexively cine-literate world, in which posters for  and  hang on children＊s walls, and the gateway to the monster＊s lair resembles Norman Bates＊s home from . In one bravura sequence, the kids use a slide projector to mount their own movie show, which is promptly hijacked by Pennywise in the manner of the spectral Sadako from .Cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon, who has worked regularly with  keeps his cameras gliding elegantly around the action, lending an epic cinematic sweep to the widening horizons of youth. While TV screens burble satirically about having fun with your friends in the sewer, the Losers get involved in outdoor rock fights and bike chases as exuberant as anything from . For all its horror trappings, this is still a story in which battles with the supernatural can be abruptly curtailed when your mom turns up unexpectedly. Even the bullies are children at heart. River Phoenix-lookalike Nicholas Hamilton＊s Henry may be the knife-wielding scourge of our antiheroes, but a scene in which he is humiliated by his boorish father (※nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble§) reminds us that his anger has been passed down through generations, a recurrent King theme.Flitting between crooked nursery crime chimes and lush orchestral themes, composer Benjamin Wallfisch creates an emotionally resonant score to accompany Muschietti＊s blend of scares and sentimentality. The result is an energetic romp with crowd-pleasing appeal that isn＊t afraid to bare its gory teeth. While it may not be as frightening as some hardened horror fans desire, the archetypal terrors and fundamental friendships of King＊s source are slickly transferred to the screen with a ghoulish enthusiasm that proves hard to resist.

"s well as showcasing the blandest and most tasteful three-way sex scene in history, this movie spreads an odd pall of sentimentality and period-glow nostalgia over a fascinating real-life story. DC Comics＊ sensational Wonder Woman character, recently , was created before the war by a former psychology professor named William Moulton Marston, his academic wife, Elizabeth, and his former student Olive Byrne, who lived together in a lovingly unconventional menage. Marston had a fascination for fetishism, bondage, dominance and the liberation that comes with ecstatic submission to a loving authority. It all went into the crypto-feminist inspiration of Wonder Woman, with her implied empowered sexuality and endless scenes in which tying up and being tied up was very important.The movie is written and directed by Angela Robinson, for whom it is evidently a passion project. Yet the passion never quite surfaces in the performances nor the action. It is as if the movie isn＊t quite sure how to acknowledge the obvious role of male porn in Wonder Woman＊s creation and popularity, nor exactly how to match this by celebrating Wonder Woman＊s feminist credentials. Nor does it acknowledge the fact that this superhero was, after all, aimed at kids. This creates a tone of forced sweetness and celebratory earnestness, where something more savoury would have been better. As for the relationship between William, Elizabeth and Olive, it may have been polyamorous, or it may have been a bit of unofficial alpha-male polygamy. plays Marston, who is preeningly vain in his three-piece suit, lecturing on psychology in the 1920s to a class full of simperingly submissive co-eds. His wife Elizabeth, played by Rebecca Hall, is intellectually brilliant but constricted by the sexist conventions of academe; she has to look on, wryly aware that her husband could misbehave himself with any of these acolytes if he wished. It comes to pass with a smart and beautiful student, Olive (Bella Heathcote), who is, in fact, a little more in love with Elizabeth than William. They wind up having an embarrassing PG-rated three-way on the stage of a student theatre that is staging Greek drama, of all Freudian things. The subsequent professional disgrace and firing gives William time to work (with Elizabeth and Olive as his Wonder Women, his muses-slash-collaborators-slash-domestic partners) on that delirious comic-book creation, born of passion, fire, costumes, role-play, Hellenic mythology and kinkiness. Periodically, the movie shows frames from the comic, and these absolutely pop: they are fierce, smart, funny and weird. But then we are back to the ponderous drama, which always insists on a deeply felt solemnity. The action is structured around flashbacks from evidence that Marston is giving to a glowering official committee, which is deeply disapproving of Wonder Woman and her effect on the nation＊s youth. There is even a scene showing kids burning  comics the way a later generation would burn Beatles＊ records. Marston looks on, grievingly sad at being misinterpreted and suppressed. But there appears nothing at stake: this McCarthy-ite tribunal doesn＊t seem to reach a conclusion, and there is no great reckoning.This is not to say the film shies away from the sexiness and gaminess in Marston＊s past. There is a scene in which William and Elizabeth spy on a sorority pledge initiation ritual involving Olive. It includes spanking. Hugely turned on, William begins to caress Elizabeth in the shadows and has to stop only because they might be discovered. Following scenes show them earnestly discussing how and why they found it arousing. But there is no question of them trying spanking themselves. In their quaintly conceived group-sex-hugs, the only flavour is vanilla. Weirdly, that is the flavour of the film itself.																																											"

"uch is the ubiquity of crime dramas nowadays that, were I to come across a blood-spattered corpse while walking the dog, I would be more inclined to look around for the attendant film crew than call the police. So how to breathe new life into serial killer series? If you＊re (), you look to  or Gaspar No谷＊s Irr谷versible for inspiration, and tell the story backwards. If only Midsomer Murders had thought of this.Rellik (it＊s ※killer§ backwards 每 geddit?) tells the tale of a murder investigation in reverse chronology. Thus, after seeing the apparent perpetrator cornered, the action spools back in time, pressing play at crucial points to dump great big slabs of exposition into the story while wilfully upending our understanding of what we think we already know. At the centre of this topsy-turvy tale is Met detective Gabriel Markham (Richard Dormer, AKA him with the eyepatch off Game of Thrones), whose face has been badly disfigured after being doused in acid by the killer in question. All of which means 每 and excuse me while I adopt the thundering tone of a Hollywood action movie trailer 每 this time it＊s personal.Written by , who penned child abduction thriller , and directed by Sam Miller (Luther), Rellik joins the likes of this year＊s  and In the Dark in aiming to show that it＊s not just Scandinavia that can churn out edgy crime dramas. Certainly, Rellik fancies itself as darkly stylish, evident in its sludgy colour palette 每 the monosyllabic coppers, the granite skies 每 and a portentous electronic soundtrack that, in moments of high drama, gives way to annoying faux-tribal drumming.It stands to reason that Gabriel is a brooder, a quality that one imagines was discussed when he interviewed for the job (※I see that you＊ve secured a lot of convictions and keep on top of your paperwork, Mr Markham. All very impressive but, if you want to fit in around here, you＊ll need to know how to frown intensely ＃§)In fairness, given the unfortunate incident with the acid, you can understand why Gabriel might have a few anger issues. His boss is minded to take him off the case and his doctor would like him to slow down, but he won＊t go because, you see, Gabriel is A Proper Man. In case that isn＊t clear, he shags his improbably glamorous police partner, Elaine (Jodi Balfour), in a pub car park, then turfs her out of his motor and goes home to his hatchet-faced wife who, he intimates, hasn＊t exactly been the model partner herself. Gabriel may have been through the wringer, but he＊s also a bit of?a dickhead.Still, there＊s work to be done. There are seven dead victims, heads and fingertips melted in acid; a suspect off his meds and running around covered in blood; a psychiatrist fixated on cleanliness, like an evil Niles Crane; and assorted hard-of- thinking cops who say things like ※the sooner we find this bastard the better§. Telling the story backwards might have sounded clever at the script stage but, in the event, it does little more than turn a whodunnit into a ※did-he- really-do-it?§. Frankly, playing it forwards at double-speed might have worked better. The sooner Markham can put the case to bed and enjoy some much-needed me time, the better.																																											"
" 每 classic , but with?a shocking twist 每 opens with the?54-year-old narrator, Victor, alone?in a Dublin pub. He doesn＊t share?a home with Rachel, the woman he calls his wife, but is vague about why. He feels out of place. When he says, ※Good man;?thanks very much§ to the guy pulling his pint, he immediately tells us ※the words felt great and a bit forbidden. I hadn＊t earned the right to slip into the rhythm?of a middle-aged Dub.§Why not? Unease grows when a former classmate who might be called?Eddie Fitzpatrick 每 at least that＊s?how Victor thinks he remembers?him 每 accosts him in the pub, raising uncomfortable memories?of the Christian Brothers school they went to. They＊re the same age and their fathers died in the?same month; people in the bar take?Fitzpatrick for Victor＊s brother or?his cousin.Who this man is and what he wants are questions that nag away as the novel rewinds leisurely through the previous 40 years of Victor＊s life. Schooldays are vicious, terrifying and strangely thrilling. When a Brother tells the 14-year-old Victor in French class that he can never resist his smile,?the repercussions from his peers are instant. Another Brother molests him 每 it was just once, Victor says 每 under the guise of teaching him a wrestling move.The progression through these episodes is not chronological. Chapters?flit around in time. So we also?know that Victor is a failed writer. The first in his family to go to university, he dropped out, seduced by his ability to get sarcastic music reviews into print, later becoming a talkshow controversialist who never got around to collecting his opinions into a book.Doyle＊s recreation of 1970s and 1980s Dublin is engaging in itself, even?as you＊re wondering what went wrong in Victor＊s life. Added to suspense over Fitzpatrick is the question of what happened with Rachel, an entrepreneur caterer from the posh part of town who, by the time?of ＊s ?present, is the star turn in Ireland＊s answer to .Rachel, whose altruistic sexuality saves Victor from his tortured virginity,?has the air of a fantasy woman. But the more you read , the more you wonder. Stray references to a sister and a grownup son aren＊t elaborated on: a hint that there＊s more 每 or perhaps less?每 to Victor＊s story than he lets on. And from the start we know Victor isn＊t always honest, telling?the barman he put a fiver on Costa Rica in the World Cup but then straight away informing us he hasn＊t. ※So you haven＊t read my book,§ he says?to Fitzpatrick, telling us in the same breath that he hasn＊t actually written one.Doyle does the fun stuff so well that we suppress doubts about these white lies. But then comes the devastating and comfortless finale, in which Doyle conjures up a mind-bending narrative swerve to jolt the novel out of?everyday?realism. The gamble comes?off, as Doyle embodies Victor＊s buried trauma to make clear what he has lost. The moment is horrible, as it?perhaps should be, but unlike other?recent novels about sexual abuse?每?Hanya Yanagihara＊s  or Gabriel Tallent＊s  每 Doyle achieves his effects without resorting to explicit scenes of violence.Doyle has made clear in interviews that the passage in which a Brother remarks on his fondness for Victor＊s smile was based on his own experience.?There＊s a sense of fine margins haunting this book, an awareness of how easily a life＊s potential can be snuffed out. By the end, the book＊s title takes on the air of a?taunt, as we＊re left with an unutterably bleak picture of institutional abuse, entirely without hope.by Roddy Doyle is published by Jonathan Cape (?14.99).

"Screenwriter Steven Knight and director Susanna White have here created juicy roles for  and the charismatic Canadian actor Michael Greyeyes. It is an intriguing story from real life: with brutal moments, underpinned by a sturdily liberal and humanist balance in its portrayal of an important and little-known encounter between a white woman and a Native American. These were the artist-activist Catherine Weldon and the Sioux leader Sitting Bull, whom Weldon set out to paint while living with him and the Sioux tribe 〞 to the horrified disgust of the military and civilian pioneers who suspected a subversive political intent.In truth, this movie appears to have softened and straightened out the historical record a little, making Weldon a widow when the facts were more complicated, and turning its heroine into someone a little more na?ve politically than appears actually to have been the case. The film depicts her as a slightly memsahib-ish idealist who journeyed out to the dangerous territories with her trunk full of canvas and brushes, and who became a partisan for the  only after putting into practice her quixotic and romantic plan of painting Sitting Bull＊s portrait. In real life, her political ideals seem to have been in existence at the same time as her artistic ambitions. But however fictionalised, the film does show that art is political: painting Sitting Bull＊s portrait is a public act of sympathy with unavoidable political consequences.Jessica Chastain＊s Weldon is tough and yet na?ve, someone who appears initially baffled and affronted by the hostility her ambitions arouse among her fellow whites. Sam Rockwell plays a local military man who is sneeringly contemptuous of her and who is incidentally engaged in a plan to starve the Native Americans into submission, reducing the rations available to those on the Reservation in return for legally signing away a good deal of their land rights.Michael Greyeyes himself is a calm, yet brooding figure as Sitting Bull, almost like Napoleon at St Helena, the great military commander reduced to a quasi-retirement, digging potatoes and accepting a future of farming, rather than hunting ?每 on land given on the white man＊s say-so. He meets cute with Caroline: she patronisingly tries to address him in a kind of pidgin English, talking about coming over many rivers and valleys to see him. ※So 每 you came here on the New York train?§ asks Sitting Bull sardonically. It is an amusing scene. (I wonder if Steven Knight was inspired by the moment in  when the native Australian tells Sue that she can＊t take his photograph: ※You believe it＊ll take your spirit away?§ 每 ※No you＊ve got the lens cap on.§)This Sitting Bull, so far from being the noble savage condescendingly imagined by the well-meaning white, is in fact a complex leader and savvy operator who agrees to be painted for a $1000 fee, which he in fact returns to Caroline and which she uses to buy their provisions. He also is an artist himself, having drawn autobiographical scenes from his own life.The drama is always in danger of becoming a slightly bland and platonic romance, but the movie produces a couple of violent but atypical flourishes in order to reassert its reality. One settler sneers in Caroline＊s face that he hopes the ※Indians§ will ※fuck§ her and later some townsfolk hit her in the head with a rock and beat her savagely in an alleyway. These are shockingly brutal if fleeting moments, scenes and Caroline has also been told about the locals＊ revulsion for the warriors＊ predilection for scalping their victims. Her association with them is a taboo-transgression which the whites cannot forgive, and there is perhaps a faint echo of John Ford＊s The Searchers here. Woman Walks Ahead is a solidly crafted and well shot, if basically unchallenging film.																																											"
"ne of writer/director Noah Baumbach＊s many smart career moves was to collaborate with actor , who co-wrote the screenplays for both Frances Ha and Mistress America. She brought an added layer of vitality to his work and, most importantly, an authenticity to films centered around young women. He realized that without her voice, he would be yet another guy in his 40s trying to speak for women half his age. (Woody Allen would do wise to follow a similar path.)In Lady Bird, Gerwig strikes out alone, removing herself from the actual picture and taking on the dual role of writer and director. She＊s covering semi-autobiographical ground, telling the story of a confused teenage girl in Sacramento (※the midwest of California§) in 2002. Christine (Saoirse Ronan), or Lady Bird as she prefers to be called, is drifting through her final year of high school with lofty, perhaps unrealistic, aspirations of where she＊ll be heading to college. She frequently clashes with mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf) whose real world concerns about money and a sense of order in their home are of little interest. Instead, Lady Bird cares about the opposite sex, her social life and daydreaming about what the future might hold.It reads like well-worn territory and when a first-time director picks their own life as inspiration for a debut feature, the results can often seem self-indulgent. But Lady Bird doesn＊t exist as a twee indie movie construct, it feels thrillingly real and deeply personal, every single beat ringing true. Despite a background in mumblecore, Gerwig＊s film is tightly engineered and at 93 minutes there isn＊t a wasted word. As shown in her previous work with Baumbach, she＊s an empathetic humanist but she＊s also willing to showcase her characters＊ more difficult traits. There＊s a wonderful tendency for scenes to switch moods within a single line of dialogue, especially those between mother and daughter. Gerwig knows how easily the choice of a particular word can sour an otherwise pleasant situation and as a result the film takes on a believably rocky tone. As a mini-Gerwig of sorts, Ronan is sensational, delivering arguably her greatest performance since she broke out with Atonement. Like any teenage girl of her age, she＊s a mixed bag of emotions, careering between joy, sadness, fear and anger without ever allowing us to see the joins. There＊s also a fantastic turn from Metcalf, so consistently underused on screen, who in a just world would be an automatic best supporting actress front-runner for her finely observed character work here. Gerwig has gifted her with a role that is often half-drawn in many other coming-of-age tales. She isn＊t nagging because  but has her own detailed reasoning for why she pokes and prods. In one scene, she chastises Lady Bird for leaving her school uniform on the floor and then proceeds to explain exactly what financial and societal concerns have led her to stress this request so strongly.There are some slight but meaningful interactions between mother and father, played wonderfully by Tracy Letts, that provide insight into the parental structure that Lady Bird so often disrespects. It＊s a film made with both sides in mind, Gerwig＊s maturity as a film-maker creating a fully fleshed out family unit. There＊s also a fine eye and ear for high school life with woozy romance, bitchy peers and ※unspecial sex§ all handled with skill and Gerwig avoids hitting predictable notes despite a third act prom and airport goodbye. There＊s a casual recognition of the era rather than a fetishistic need for nostalgia with only the odd technological reference or early Justin Timberlake song to remind us of the period.Lady Bird is a film bursting with warmth, wit and melancholy that manages to seem fresh and unexpected despite the overly stacked nature of the subgenre. Gerwig displays no narcissism as someone sharing a version of her past or an aching desire to be hip as a young film-maker and instead relies on genuine, deeply felt emotion to sell her story. It＊s an impeccably crafted film.																																											"
" (Radio 4) | ()  (Radio 4) | Not something I would naturally rush to hear, but  is the must-listen of my week. I didn＊t think anyone made unflashy, meticulous documentaries like this any more. Financial journalist Michael Robinson began his report in a lovely part of the world, on the banks of the Thames in Little Marlow. He listened to locals telling him about a time, a few years ago, when the river was not so pretty. When brown foam rolled over the river ripples and tampons, sanitary towels, condoms and ※large lumps of matter§ clustered around houseboats. Why was this happening? Because Thames Water wasn＊t maintaining its sewage equipment properly. And why was that happening? Ah, well＃Over the next half-hour, in a clearly presented and diligently researched programme, Robinson showed how an Australian investment bank called Macquarie was able to buy Thames Water with borrowed money, offload ?2bn of that debt on to Thames Water and make over-the-odds profits for its investors while not investing in the company＊s infrastructure (hence the polluted river). In March, Thames Water was . But by then, Macquarie had moved on, selling its final stake in Thames Water to 每 let me get this right 每 ※a Canadian pension fund and the Kuwaiti sovereign wealth fund§. Now Macquarie is backing a group of investors who recently bought a controlling stake in the National Grid＊s gas distribution business＃The voices in the programme 每 financial experts, watchdogs, journalists 每 were all reasonable. And they all said the same thing. Macquarie＊s structures were not transparent, money was moving through offshore subsidiaries and the UK watchdog, Ofwat, just waved everything through. ※Bankers are always a few steps ahead,§ said one expert, pointing out that by the time a parliamentary inquiry has been conducted, the bankers have made their money and moved on to the next deal. All rather depressing, but well worth your time.An altogether cheerier listen is   magazine＊s podcast. One of my occasional guilty listening pleasures, it＊s essentially an interview-with-a-celeb show. Sounds familiar: but this is snappy and funny, with UK  editor-in-chief, Jo Elvin, plus a staff member, leading the chat with charm and pizzazz.

Touching and real; a lovely debut.																																											"
" ballet that takes the Holocaust as its subject is likely to be controversial, and Northern Ballet＊s , choreographed by Daniel de Andrade after  has had mixed reviews since its launch earlier this year. Boyne＊s book, now a school set text, tells of the friendship between Shmuel, a young Jewish inmate of Auschwitz, and Bruno, son of the camp＊s commandant. Despite the historical implausibility of this scenario, the novel has become a publishing phenomenon, and last Thursday＊s matinee audience, which included many young people, gave the ballet an enthusiastic reception. Flawed or not, Boyne＊s account is the portal through which a new generation is encountering the Shoah.Technically speaking, this is a well-crafted and strongly performed piece. Matthew Koon, if rather too relentlessly upbeat, gives a clean-limbed account of himself as the naive Bruno. As Shmuel, Filippo de Vilio is poignant and expressive. Of the Nazis, Sean Bates displays a silken fluency as the vicious Lieutenant Kotler. De Andrade frames his steps thoughtfully, giving them room to breathe and time to make their mark. Gary Yershon＊s plangent score threads through the action, its dark woodwind notes a sombre reminder of the nightmare that is unfolding out of sight.There are, however, profound errors of tone. If you view the Holocaust as more than simply a fact of history around which fiction can be spun at will, you will find a production that includes pirouetting SS officers deeply troubling. There is too great a disconnect between the heartfelt act of dancing and participation in the industrial-scale slaughter of your fellow human beings. The two activities cannot meaningfully occupy the same dimension.At key moments of the ballet, De Andrade insinuates a figure called the Fury (Mlindi Kulashe) into the action. While true to Boyne＊s book, in which Bruno mishears the word F邦hrer, the presence of this fetishistic and quasi-sexual figure is a horrible error, suggesting that the Nazis were victims of diabolic possession rather than open-eyed mass murderers. Kulashe danced well on Thursday, but the cheers and whoops that greeted his performance were, to say the least, disconcerting. If ever there was an occasion for the cast to remain in character during the curtain calls, this was it. In two decades of writing about dance, I don＊t think I＊ve ever seen anything as inappropriate as the broad grins of the dancers playing the Auschwitz guards and of those whom, minutes earlier, they＊d herded into the gas chamber.

"he swallow sculpts its nest out of mud. The horned coot works with pebbles in streams, an avian . The weaver bird is famous for its elaborate globes and sheaths conjured out of grasses; but the bowerbird surely takes the biscuit, decorating its lavish pavilions with flower petals, shells and shards of shining plastic. It has even been known to use masticated berries as paint.A magnified bower dominates the opening gallery of . An enormous assembly of reeds with a central eye-like hole, it＊s so suggestive of art as to strike the mind first as some sort of sculpture. Which is both true and exactly the point. For everything in this marvellous Artangel exhibition 每 a show of marvels in itself 每 turns upon the astonishing connections between ornithology and art, or more precisely between birds and their visions, whether their nests and even their eggs can be seen as expressive creations rather than just evolutionary imperatives.The argument is played out using eggs and nests from all over the world, as well as paintings, sculptures and films. These are the work of , sometimes in conjunction with his father, Peter. Holden senior is a household name:  and former ※bird man§ on ; Andy is an artist, animator and musician with the . Posters for Peter Holden＊s first book featured infant Andy reading bird magazines in his highchair. This show is also about the evolution of their relationship.Here, for instance, is the blackbird＊s nest Andy once found in the tree outside his childhood home. A perfect circle, it turns on a revolving disc, emphasising the lovely roundness of the bird＊s creation; whereas for Peter the design is about cupping the eggs as safely as possible. Swallows are equally security-minded to the father, nesting in high eaves. But a greater wonder for the son is their ability to sculpt in a medium as quick-drying as renaissance terracotta using only beaks and claws. Andy shows photographs of the bird that even built its home on an emblematic trowel.Bark, nests and branches are all used in quasi-scientific displays, as well as installations and depictions (a vast collection of stolen eggs, subject of a famous crime, is recreated in spectacular facsimile). But the dialogue between father and son has its principal focus in a split-screen film where they give a brilliant two-headed lecture on nests, taking in, inter alia, the homicidal cuckoo; the tailorbird, stitching leaves together with spider＊s silk; the massive airborne apartment blocks of the sociable weaver bird; and the mute swans that work together in pairs.For Andy, the swans＊ nest measures the strength of their marriage. Knowledge from the father, poetry from the son: that seems to be the pattern. Except that Peter Holden opens your eyes to beauty too 每 to nests as exposed pockets, fragile cradles or invisible cities, as he refers to rookeries. He may be sceptical of Andy＊s chicken and egg claims 每 did mankind really make mud huts in imitation of the swallows, as Pliny says 每 but he points out just how astonishing it is that young  can make their bottle-shaped nests without ever having seen another bird do it.Downstairs in the disused Victorian library (formerly the Cuming Museum, a father-son ethnographic collection) is Andy Holden＊s latest film installation. Ostensibly narrated by a cartoon crow that once starred in his father＊s RSPB magazines, now grown into a wise old animatronic bird, this is an enthralling history of egg collecting from eccentric pastime, when aristocrats swam Scottish lochs with eggs in their hands, to childhood hobby, competitive pursuit and eventually 每 after the 1954 Protection of Birds Act 每 organised crime.The crow flies through landscapes by Turner, Ravilious and Hockney (this is a concise history of English art en route), hops in and out of a mist-rolling Paul Nash, enters into documentary footage of egg robbers discussing their crimes. Most unforgettable are the stories of , who cut down the tree in which endangered ospreys were nesting, in protest against the 1954 Act, then died while clambering up for an egg. And , jailed in 2011 for egging, who speaks on camera of his addiction, and the romance of it, betraying a forlorn desire to return to the innocence of childhood.Andy Holden twines the strands together like a weaver bird himself, subtly suggesting all sorts of parallels 每 between the cuckoo forging other birds＊ eggs and his own artfully faked collection; between the tailorbird＊s lacing and the shoe tying learned from his father (what＊s learned, what＊s instinctive?); between egging and art collecting. Egg thefts might almost be construed as a kind of art crime, except that to steal an egg is to steal a bird＊s life.And what is an egg but a perfect creation, a masterpiece of form and beauty, removed from the flow of time. Look at the owl＊s moonlight egg, known as an immaculate. Or the , laid directly on the rocky ledge, and apparently painted to resemble it. Each is different in its graphic abstraction; this one like a  ink work, this one like a Jackson Pollock. How are they even made?The show circles back in the end to the bowerbird, making its nest for fun, or love, a free invention in which no eggs will ever be laid. This bird, the Holdens agree, has a singular sensibility. For the father, this is a triumph of natural selection; for the son, it＊s the essence of creativity. The bird has a concept of beauty that precedes and governs his creation. It is by definition an artist.																																											"
"t runs for exactly an hour, but there＊s so much variety here, packed into what is essentially a piano trio album, that it seems over in half the time. There are jazz pieces by Monk, Miles Davis and others, an improvisation on a prelude by Chopin, a Stylistics soul classic, an original or two, and so on. And they all flow together quite naturally under the mellow influence of ＊s piano. Vibraphonist Steve Nelson joins in brilliantly on three numbers, with Chestnut quite content to play the unobtrusive accompanist when necessary, and the whole show closes with a gospel anthem, played as a rapturous piano solo.

"＊s latest record is inspired by her mother＊s ailing health and a sense of discontent at US society under Donald Trump (on Up the Creek she speaks of fighting against those ※climate blind§ with a ※militia of the mind§, a far from oblique reference to a certain president＊s fake news agenda). Across its 15 tracks, there are moments of greatness: Reindeer King is a swelling piano ballad about grief that boasts an ambient underside, while the aforementioned Up the Creek fuses a countryfied guitar loop with ominous strings, electro beats and backing vocals from , Tash, to create a multifaceted soundscape.Elsewhere, Bang＊s tonal shifts 每 from near-a cappella chorus to crunching riffs 每 make it a grownup coda to Cornflake Girl. However, much of this album is forgettable: Broken Arrow and Cloud Riders are passable pop-rock for the Starbucks stereo, while Breakaway and Wildwood veer into extended metaphors on nature that feel digressive. That said, calling out societal ills in a literal sense isn＊t always very effective either, as on Russia, which feels like a wasted opportunity to really stick the knife in.

"i everyone! It＊s Happy Meik here. Remember me? I＊m the bloke who wrote last year＊s surprise bestseller about how everyone should . Well now I＊m back with a book about . Lykke means Happiness but my important work as chief executive of the International Happiness Research Centre in Copenhagen (total number of employees: one) has shown that people feel much happier if they call happiness Lykke rather than Happiness.People often ask me when I was at my most Lykke. That is a difficult question as I tend to be Lykke all the time. Especially now that I am beginning to make a lot of money out of being Lykke. But I really think I could have been most Lykke when I found a stale bit of pizza in the fridge after a day out skiing with friends. When I found the pizza I said to everyone, ※I really think I＊ve found the meaning of happiness. This is so Hygge it is Lykke.§ And they replied, ※Oh do shut the fuck up Meik.§ So sweet.Copenhagen is probably the most Lykke place in the world. At five o＊clock in the afternoon everyone leaves work, rides home on their bicycles, does two hours of creative play with their children, goes out to do a random act of kindness to a stranger who wants to be left in peace, lights five candles and then settles down to watch several episodes of a Scandi-noir TV thriller about some psychopathic paedophile on the loose.But my extensive research in my capacity as the chief executive of the International Happiness Research Centre in Copenhagen (total number of employees: one) has revealed that people from some other countries in the world are occasionally happy too. So in this book I am going tell you about some of my exciting discoveries that can make you Lykke too. But first an admission: I am not always Happy Meik. Sometimes I am Not-So-Happy Meik. I wasn＊t very Lykke when I left my iPad on the aeroplane, but by realising it was OK not to be happy, I somehow made myself happy again. Here＊s a picture of a sunset in Paris. That should help you feel Lykke. People who do things together are generally happier than people who do things on their own. I once spent five days observing how often people smiled outside a McDonald＊s in Stuttgart and I conclusively proved that those who were on their own only smiled once every 36 minutes while those who were with friends smiled every 14 minutes. So if you want to be more Lykke, get out and do something with other people. And if you don＊t know anyone, try climbing over a fence and sitting in someone else＊s garden and wait for them to come home. Most of us would rather have money than not have money. But my extensive research in my capacity as the chief executive of the International Happiness Research Centre in Copenhagen (total number of employees: one) has shown that money on its own doesn＊t make you happy. In , we don＊t have as much money as people in Seoul but the South Koreans are a miserable bunch. That＊s because the Koreans have high expectations. They expect to have a new car every year and get depressed if they don＊t. In Copenhagen we generally expect the worst to happen and if it doesn＊t then we＊re really Lykke. And we don＊t buy new cars because there＊s a 150% tax on them. The Japanese have the longest life expectancy but it doesn＊t make them happy as they are so worried about dying young. The average Danish person will die younger even than an overweight Brit because we are so busy stuffing our faces with cakes to make ourselves Hygge with one hand and riding a bike with the other. Better to be dead and Lykke than old and UnLykke. Feeling as though you have choices and control over your life makes you feel Lykke. Who would have guessed? In many countries, parents feel trapped when they have young children but in Portugal they have a very different experience. That＊s because Portuguese parents hand over their kids to the grandparents every night and go out and party. This makes them very Lykke. Even if it pisses off the grandparents no end. Being nice to people is Lykke. In Denmark we have a ※Be Nice to Someone Hour§ at 9.45 every morning that people have to enjoy or they are sent to prison. We also play games that try to make children feel included. In Britain, children play musical chairs where one chair is removed every time the music stops. This can make those children who lose feel bad. Far better to play the game by adding a chair every time the music stops. That way children become less and less stressed. It may seem obvious to say this but stating the obvious for the best part of 300 pages can make you feel Lykke. Especially if someone is daft enough to pay to read it. No Lykke.																																											"
"ontrary to what some may believe, the welfare state did not come into existence solely as a result of some sort of post-second world war big bang caused by the election of the Attlee government. To be sure it was the Attlee government that supplied the political will, but many of the principles and some of the measures evolved over the preceding half-century. One or two were of even earlier origin., who lectures in modern history at the University of York, has produced an account of the origins of the welfare state, from the Elizabethan poor law to the , which is at once both learned and highly readable. Until the mid-19th century, most politicians and political philosophers were instinctively against the notion that the welfare of its citizens was any business of the state except maybe in the direst circumstances, and perhaps not even then. The late-18th-century philosopher Malthus argued that the poor law was an interference with the natural checks and balances on a growing population.There were also arguments that will be familiar today about escalating cost, fecklessness and the undermining of the market, with the result that early social reformers sometimes found it easier to focus, not so much on the moral arguments, but on the suggestion that it was simply not efficient to have perhaps one-third of the population unable to make any meaningful contribution to the wealth of the nation if they were laid low by disease, malnutrition and lack of education.The first stirrings of ruling-class interest in the welfare of the masses began in the 1830s with the appointment of a  into the workings of the poor law. Remarkably, however, it concluded that the existing patchwork of local provision was too generous and needed to be replaced by a centrally imposed system of workhouses where living conditions were sufficiently unpleasant that no one save the destitute would want to live there.Gradually, though, the grim realities of working-class life in 19th-century Britain began to impinge on the comfortable world of the Victorian middle classes. A combination of the rise of trade unions, the founding of the Labour party and the extension of the franchise, along with a handful of enlightened employers and social reformers, forced social welfare on to the political agenda. The revelation, during the Boer war, that up to two-thirds of the recruits from industrial cities such as Manchester were physically unfit to fight came as a particular shock to the political classes.Only with the election of the 1906 Liberal government did the state start to take a serious interest in the welfare of its people. One of the new government＊s first measures was to introduce legislation permitting local authorities, should they choose, to introduce free school meals. Predictably, however, many declined to do so with the result that, after five years, only a relative handful of children benefited. The first old age pensions were introduced in 1908 (?13 a year for the over 70s), but once again provision was far from universal. Only those with incomes of less than ?31 a year qualified. David Lloyd George＊s attempt to introduce a national insurance scheme to cover the sick and unemployed, funded by increased taxes, was famously blocked by the Tories in the House of Lords and?needed two further general?elections to force through.It took two world wars and the extension of the franchise to women before the welfare state as we know it today, universal and comprehensive, became politically possible. Although the greatest credit lies with the Attlee?government, Labour did not pluck ideas and legislation out of thin?air. During the first four decades of the 20th century, governments of all persuasions had begun to turn their attention to improving the education,?housing and welfare of all citizens. As the author says, ※The fact that there were Labour, Tory and?Liberal fingerprints on the welfare?state was an important reason why it was not instantly dismantled by the Tories when they regained power?in?1951.§  by Chris Renwick is published by Allen Lane (?20).

", or  (translating more accurately as ※competition§ in its original French), documents the rigorous admissions process of prestigious Parisian film school La F谷mis, once home to Alain Resnais, Arnaud Desplechin and Claire Denis (and director Claire Simon, who used to teach there). The film＊s effectiveness relies on some external understanding of the school＊s standing. Or perhaps the lack of context is part of Simon＊s plan to subtly criticise the fact that its clout is taken for granted 每 and its selection method, subjective to the point of arbitrary. Wide-eyed prospective students take three entrance tests (written, practical and oral), with each individual＊s merits and failings exhaustively debated at each stage by the school＊s teachers.※He did that well!§ comments one teacher after watching an applicant＊s screen test. ※I was falling asleep,§ argues another. ※Help! Don＊t come to La F谷mis! Get a life!§ sneers a professor to her colleague after watching a boy ※masturbating§ to his own rushes.

Exposing the mechanics of decision-making is an implicit reproof of increasing conservatism, both of La F谷mis itself and the film-makers they are producing.

"t＊s appropriate that  begins its five-city English?tour in Hull, the . Founded in 1976, the company, as its website says, ※challenged the apartheid regime, armed with little more than the conviction that culture can change society§.Sibongeleni James Ngcobo, who has been the company＊s artistic director for the past four years, aims to redefine the theatre in the light of the post-1994 realities. As he writes in the programme: ※South Africa has gone through a complete metamorphosis§ and the Market  is changing, too, to operate in a ※universal space§., as developed by Ngcobo from a short story by  (1919-2008), brings out the universal aspects of a particular situation. Timi and Namhla are a young couple whose parents disapprove of their marriage (he is Zulu and she is Xhosa). They leave their village for the big city, carrying scant savings, few possessions and bright dreams of a new life. In the 1950s, racial discrimination stacks the odds against them.On a wooden pallet in the centre of the stage stand a table, chair and a shelf. To one side of the pallet is a small wooden bench; to the other, a dustbin. The sprawling, hostile city that surrounds this one-room hub is brought to people-filled life by two ※storytellers§, Molatlhegi Desmond Dube and Nhlanhla John Lata. Daily humiliation and rejection etch deeper into Timi＊s every gesture, tellingly executed by Siyabonga Caswell Thwala.

His despair leads him to an irrevocable mistake.Hugh Masekela＊s bright, , shaded with blues and echoes of hymns (a stunning live vocal trio and guitarist), amplifies the story＊s scope, as do the sharply detailed performances, full of humour and deep humanity. Apartheid has gone, but lives of people the world over are still blighted by prejudice and injustice.																																											"
"It is anthem night at the  in Limehouse, and the piano player is working his way through Dancing Queen, Wuthering Heights and Bonnie Tyler＊s Total Eclipse of The Heart.

Before I know it, I＊m howling the chorus over the meatballs. ※Young and sweet＃ Only severnteeeeen＃§ And so on.I can＊t pretend. I am predisposed to like anywhere furnished with a piano. Partly it＊s fellow feeling. As a piano player, I am lucky enough never to have had to earn a crust playing to a disinterested restaurant; to the muffled chatter of the mating game, while rolling from one tune to the next. That＊s proper work. It demands my support.But it＊s also the fact that any space occupied by piano has greater potential. Things can happen there. It＊s relatively quiet tonight at the Straight and Narrow, but later in the week, they tell me, it will turn into a total singalong. If you hate the thought of that you are dead inside; go somewhere else. Try a graveyard, where the company will be more agreeable. Food and music are meant to go together. , which is what I have spent most of my adult life at the keyboard wrestling with, was born in restaurants like this 每 first in the drinking dens of New Orleans, then in the speakeasies and dance clubs of New York and Chicago.I like to joke during my own gigs that the musicians in  have watched people eat in some of the best restaurants in London. You can hear me making that joke in the live album we＊re about to release. Partly it＊s a collection of songs around food and drink, like Black Coffee, One for my Baby and Cantaloupe Island, tunes which celebrate the relationship between jazz and dinner. Others draw on my experience of growing up with a  who was an agony aunt, because all blues songs sound like a problem page letter. Listen carefully to the recording and you can hear the occasional clink of a glass in the background. Music like this demands liquor and the sound of it. (If I said it was available for purchase from  and also for download would that be overkill? Probably.)In his memoirs Stephen Fry wrote about meeting the head of the Nederlander theatre dynasty in New York, who was thinking about bringing the musical to Broadway, for which Fry had rewritten the book. For a musical to succeed, Nederlander said, it had to ※have heart§. The same should be said about restaurants. The Straight and Narrow has heart. It does not occupy a pretty space. One side of Narrow Street is made of classic ancient warehouses, doubtless with interiors that glossy magazine editors would die for. The restaurant is on the other side, on the raised ground floor of a much more modern development. It＊s not quite ＊s flat-roof pub, but it＊s on nodding terms. What matters is that, inside they are both playing and cooking up a storm. Not in an ostentatious way, but with care and attention to detail. The Straight and Narrow is the neighbourhood restaurant you want around the corner; the one which will leave you feeling someone gave a damn about you having a good time without trying to extract a down payment on the Greek debt.After my rant about  a few weeks ago I suppose I can＊t really let them off the hook for having a section of the menu called British tapas. Except that those Yorkshire tapas were crimes against good taste and these are very lovely. We order three as a starter. A Scotch egg, with a golden shell made of properly seasoned sausage meat mixed with cubes of apple, comes with a yolk just on the edge of running. There is a finely whipped mackerel p?t谷, full of oils and acidity, with gossamer ribbons of pickled cucumber and melba toast. Veal meatballs, in a sauce of fresh tomatoes cooked down to the essence of themselves, are peppery and satisfying. All of these are priced at between ?4.50 and ?6.50.Main courses, priced in the teens, offer the kind of European-inspired, bistro cooking utilising British ingredients that is the food we really want to eat most of the time. It is roast chicken with risotto and fillet steak with chips. The nearest thing to ostentation is soy-glazed pork belly with Asian slaw and salted peanuts. I only don＊t order it because people have been gossiping about me and pork belly. They＊re saying we＊re a thing. I don＊t like to encourage gossip.Instead I have slices of a substantial piece of lamb rump, roasted to crisp fat outside, cherry pink inside, piled on roasted courgettes. At the base, soaking up the jus, is a disc of puff pastry laid with roasted tomatoes. A dribble of basil oil finishes it off. A slab of hake with crisped skin and pearly flesh lies on a meadow of summer peas and baby leeks dressed with a garlic butter sauce, with enough acidity to push it towards a beurre blanc. Dill gnocchi give ballast.Desserts are exceptionally good, the sort that make you wonder if there has been some grand hotel training involved (although apparently there hasn＊t). A salted caramel tart has dark pastry with an echoing crunch and a deep golden filling that stays the right side of cloying. A marmalade ice cream lives up to its billing without dominating the proceedings. A peach melba bavarois, alternate layers of mousse and sponge, with a raspberry sorbet on the side, demands a round of applause before you demolish the lot. Oh, but it＊s pretty.Service is engaged without being stalkerish. The wine list is short and sensible. In this room, you don＊t want to think too hard about ordering the second bottle and these bog-standard sauvignons and pinot grigios are designed for that.As the evening closes, somebody requests Billy Joel＊s Piano Man which is a clich谷 but only so for being true. The musician in a restaurant creates the soundtrack for the inner lives of others. I am not quite a part of the regular crowd that shuffles in, but having eaten the food and drunk the wine and listened to the tunes, I could quite easily imagine becoming so.← In New York, chef Marcus Samuelsson＊s  is part restaurant, part gig.

"Tiles, carpet fragments, antiques, drawings and paintings voraciously collected by the late Sir  are to appear at auction.Sotheby＊s has announced it is to sell about 400 items from a collection that shines a fascinating light on how the mind of one of Britain＊s most distinctive painters worked.Hodgkin, known for his explosively colourful and emotional paintings, . The sale reveals that he was a keen scourer of auctions, identifying objects of beauty he wanted as must-haves and then filling his house in Bloomsbury, London, with them.His partner, the writer Antony Peattie, said there were emotional and practical reasons for the sale. ※After he died the house was so sad and all these objects remained in place but, after 33 years that we spent together, everything had changed,§ said Peattie.※It was so poignant and difficult that everything in the house spoke for Howard and Howard wasn＊t there to speak for himself, I found that very hard ... I had to start again.§Peattie said he did not want the house to be a shrine and he had been persuaded by the former Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota that a Hodgkin museum was a bad idea. ※It works for 10 years and then you get into trouble following on ... who runs it? Who＊s it for? Artist＊s reputations go and then you＊ve got this millstone.§There is also a practical reason for selling. ※Howard wanted to give a lot of money away to people after his death and left a letter of his wishes ... but that presupposes that there is money to give away.§Hodgkin made good money from his art but he was not a saver. He liked buying things. ※If Howard needed it he bought it, sometimes for a lot of money once he could afford it,§ said Peattie. ※He didn＊t believe in bargains and if something was really good he went ahead and paid the price for it.§Hodgkin loved auction catalogues, whether from Christie＊s, Sotheby＊s or Bonhams as well as auction houses in Salisbury, Lewes, Edinburgh and others in Europe. He would often turn up in person, holding up his pencil until he had won what he wanted.The objects being sold include vibrantly coloured Ottoman, Indian and Islamic tiles, textiles and rugs as well as fragments of calligraphy, Italian pietra dura marbles and prints, mezzotints and engravings.The collection also includes artworks by his friends such as Patrick Caulfield, represented by a blue still life of a sweet bowl, which comes with an estimate of ?300,000-?500,000; a work by , The De-Luxe Tailors (estimate ?250,000-?350,000) and a Peter Blake postcard on a green felt background, which he gave Hodgkin in 1974 (?8,000-?12,000).Peattie said Hodgkin liked the idea of a sale after his death because the objects had served their purpose. They had ※in some mysterious way, fed his work§.Frances Christie, head of Sotheby＊s modern British art department, said the Hodgkin collection ※really gives you an insight into how his mind worked and what his true passions and personal inspirations and excitements were.

"his title has a pun which is probably too weirdly pedantic even to count as groanworthy: an immediate, contemporary war being fought on the issue of electrical current. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, who has worked in TV and as second-unit to film-makers like Alejandro G I?芍rritu, before making the 2015 feature Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, has now re-imagined the late 19th-century battle between electricity pioneers Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse to establish their own dominant electrical system. A comparable movie could yet be made about the battle between Beta and VHS.In the 1880s, Thomas Edison astonishes the world by illuminating a section of Manhattan at night using his new-fangled electrical light 每 and Westinghouse, whose business had until that moment been based on gas, resolves to challenge him with a different system. Edison favoured direct current and Westinghouse alternative current, and it was a titanic war of personalities and ideas, which incidentally involved a gruesome minor battle, which this film tactfully passes over: Edison tried to get the rival AC approach identified (and stigmatised) in the public mind with the death penalty and the electric chair, whose frazzling executions were macabre and often bungled.At any rate, Gomez-Rejon＊s film is not about that; it is high-minded and poised and interestingly it does not offer the obvious notion that Edison and Westinghouse were as different as chalk and cheese. Rather the reverse: their contest was all the more dramatic because they actually had a good deal in common, for all that Edison was the more unconventional of the two. It is more like a strategic confrontation between rival generals or statesmen. Westinghouse is shown hoping for a compromise, in which they might yet divvy up America＊s energy market between them, being responsible for production and distribution. But Edison is not receptive to this approach. Michael Shannon is cast a little against type as Westinghouse: a mutton-chop whiskered gentleman, to be seen here at a grand dinner, like a figure in Edith Wharton or Henry James. His wife Marguerite, played beautifully by Katherine Waterston 每 making the most of a supporting role 每 is resplendent with the social cachet that goes with being the wife of a captain of industry. Benedict Cumberbatch＊s Ediston is more mercurial, more bullish, less established. He is insistent that he will never take money from munitions or the dealers of war and death, and is in fact reliant on an exasperated patron: JP Morgan, nicely played by Matthew Macfadyen. Tuppence Middleton plays his wife Mary, far less of a grande dame than Marguerite.The real wild card is the legendary genius and scientific maverick Nikola Tesla, played here straightforwardly by Nicholas Hoult 每 and without much of the obvious rock-star allure that he had when he was played by David Bowie in Christopher Nolan＊s 2006 movie The Prestige. This film is not offering the traditional opposition of Tesla the inspired master versus the boring stuffed shirts of what might be called MSS: mainstream science. Here it is Westinghouse and Edison who are important, with Tesla being co-opted finally onto Westinghouse＊s team.This a watchably stylised period film, with interesting visual setpieces and faces looming up at us out of intricately contrived backgrounds. Gomez-Rejon＊s style reminded me a little of Paolo Sorrentino at times, striving for something mythic or operatic. The performances from Cumberbatch and Shannon are workmanlike and serviceable, but with perhaps fewer sparks flying than they usually get from their roles. Overall, the voltage isn＊t as high it might have been.																																											"
"till in his 30s, the brilliant American novelist Joshua Cohen has already published several novels, books of short stories and a masterpiece,  (2010), which is basically two-thirds David Foster Wallace to one third Philip Roth, but somehow adds up to considerably more than the sum of its parts. , his latest novel, combines the same ingredients, but perhaps adds up to rather less.The book begins as the story of David King, the middle-aged proprietor of King＊s Moving in the New York Tri-state area: ※David King the Moving King Will Move Your Mothertrucking Everything§. David is a kind of Jewish Tony Soprano, entirely vivid, his politics ※aspirational, inferior: he was in favour of contacts, contracts, the right not to diet, and the right to jump lines at dessert stations§. David has got?a lot of baggage 每 literally and metaphorically (David King = King, David, King David, yes?). The son of Holocaust survivors, he is divorced from his wife Bonnie, and his daughter Tammy has decided that Israel is a ※criminal regime§: ※What I learned at NYU was just how psycho Jews are,§ she tells him.He also has a vast warehouse full of unclaimed goods, ※your possessions repossessed, stored inside concrete pillboxes wallowing in septic and brine§. For David, ※Throughout all this, what＊d bolstered him was Israel: the ideal of it, the abstraction. To have?family in the country was to have?the country in the family, the whole entire?country.§So things start to get really complicated for David when his 22-year-old cousin, Yoav Matzav, arrives in the US to work for him, fresh from his discharge from the IDF, having served with the ※Kivsa Brigade, Akavish Battalion, Tziraah Company, Platoon Bet, Squad Bet 每 the Death Alley Ewes, the Heroes of Shujaiyeh, the Martyrs of Salah al-Din Road 每 [not] a special unit, just a specialish unit, not elite, but elite enough§. It＊s like having Israel itself rock up on your doorstep.Yoav brings with him a friend from his unit, Uri, and between them these two young ※Raelis§ try to make sense of living in America, a country where it＊s every man for himself. ※Yoav would do a full day with a guy who＊d tell him every detail about fucking his wife, how he fucked her, how she came, how?he came wicked buckets, and then he＊d just 每 evaporate: Yoav would never work with him again, no one would ever mention him, no one would even remember [＃] it was Yoav＊s flaw to regard their transience, and the transience of institutional memory, as rude, because the truth was, it was life.§They are employed by David, it turns out, not merely to move furniture but also to evict the unfortunate inhabitants of foreclosed homes; it soon becomes clear that Cohen is establishing a series of parallels between the work of the young Israelis in America and their work back home.※Back under the Occupation, there had been shooting and here in America there was no shooting, or none aimed at them. Back under the Occupation, there had been sleepless stretches with nothing to eat and nothing to drink and here in America there were scheduled breaks and just a staggering range of fastfood options for both takeout and delivery.

"In some ways it＊s just like any other Chicago neighbourhood. There are three Starbucks, a gym, a department store and a friendly dive bar. But no one lives here. There＊s no natural daylight. And many Chicagoans have never heard of it.This is the Pedway 每 a network of tunnels running beneath 40 blocks of the Loop, Chicago＊s central business district. Built piecemeal since 1951, it provides a weatherproof route for pedestrians to walk between buildings, including Macy＊s and City Hall 每 though relatively few use it. Many stores, hotels and bars connected by the network have entrances at street level and underground, while a few cafes serve only the Pedway.Margaret Hicks owns Chicago Elevated, which runs tours of the tunnels. ※Even locals don＊t know about the Pedway,§ she said. ※They certainly don＊t understand it.§The layout is more maze than grid. Each building linked to the underground network is responsible for its section of the Pedway, so no one is in charge. Few attempts have been made to promote its use 每 until now. A local not-for-profit organisation, the , has raised $125,000 (around ?100,000) to spruce up the tunnels and turn them into a tourist attraction. In July, the centre announced plans to promote the Pedway ※both as a destination and as a desirable way to move around downtown§. Its vision includes an underground library, art galleries and a farmers＊ market. A glass cube in Millennium Park would provide public access 每 an attractive alternative to the stairwells and escalators within buildings connected to the tunnels that are currently the only way in.※If we had better navigation, signage, arts and entertainment, it would be a really cool place,§ said executive director Howard Learner, adding that city officials have given the project the green light.While the time frame has yet to be announced, others have spotted the Pedway＊s potential. For this year＊s  (until January 2018), Los Angeles  are creating installations inspired by the walkways＊ textures, fixtures and fittings. Their work will highlight ※a bit of functional infrastructure that gets far less attention than the more iconic structures it serves above ground§, said Biennial executive director Todd Palmer. These will be displayed in the Chicago Cultural Center, one on the ground floor and another where its basement joins the Pedway.However, Hicksworries that the plans could strip her ※favourite neighbourhood§ of its offbeat charms. ※Obviously, there is lots of room to improve the Pedway. I don＊t want people to feel lost and confused in it,§ she said, ※but what I love about it is its strangeness.§Hicks introduced me to wedding photographer Ed. He spends his days watching the doors of the marriage court beneath City Hall, for potential customers. ※I＊ve never seen him in daylight,§ she whispered. Strip lights flickered in the ceiling. On our right was an entrance to Macy＊s basement floor. Opposite was a gleaming row of 22 stained-glass windows, including one by Louis Comfort Tiffany. Built into the tunnel wall and permanently backlit, this gallery was organised by the Smith Museum of Stained Glass Windows at , one of Chicago＊s better-known attractions.The effect is incongruous, like a Picasso painting hanging in a barn. But everything about the Pedway is odd and, if it becomes a tourist hotspot, Hicks doesn＊t want that to change. ※The Pedway is one of Chicago＊s neighbourhoods. I don＊t want to see it gentrified.

"lthough it has legions of admirers,  has often seemed a problematic show. Stephen Sondheim＊s music and lyrics combine emotional pain and witty pastiche with a deftness that James Goldman＊s book never quite seems to match. But ＊s superb revival, reverting to the structure of the  and ditching the optimistic conclusion that marred the , gives this bleakly festive musical a poetic unity I didn＊t realise it possessed. The paradox is that Cooke achieves unity by stretching, to the limit, the show＊s obsession with duality. That idea of doubleness is built into the Sondheim-Goldman concept. We are invited to witness a grand reunion of veteran Follies showgirls in a Broadway theatre on the verge of demolition; in the background we see the ostrich-plumed incarnations of their younger selves. At the same time we are privy to a double marital crisis. Well-heeled New Yorkers Ben and Phyllis are in as much trouble as their old Phoenix-based chums, Buddy and Sally. What brings the crisis to a head is that Sally has a lifelong yen for Ben that has never been resolved. The intermingling of past and present is an idea many dramatists have used, notably Tom Stoppard in , where the older AE Housman views the sexual hesitancy of his younger self with a rueful regret. Here, Cooke＊s production lends the idea extra poignancy by making this interaction a two-way process: at one point, Zizi Strallen as the young Phyllis seems about to dissolve in tears as she gazes at the dyspeptic solitude of Janie Dee as her older but no wiser self. Cooke＊s real breakthrough, however, is to suggest that every character in the show is haunted by the ghosts of the past, something that is true even in the celebrated pastiche numbers. Arguably the most famous is I＊m Still Here, which has been appropriated by everyone from Barbra Streisand to Sammy Davis Jr and turned into a tribute to showbiz durability. Here, while acknowledging its debt to the torch songs of Harold Arlen, it becomes something more. Tracie Bennett starts as if recapitulating her career to old colleagues, even making fingertip contact with one of them as she recalls how she ※sung the blues§. Only gradually does she break free to assert her defiance and tenacity, all the time ardently watched by a spangled embodiment of her younger self. It is quite simply breathtaking.Cooke gives every character a shadow-self but takes the duality theme even further by reminding us that each of the main characters is really two people.  is unforgettable as Sally, presenting us at first with a cheerily smiling soul: her delivery of In Buddy＊s Eyes, in which Sally self-deludingly believes she is adored by her husband, had a radiant happiness that brought a lump to my throat. By the end, as she sings the Gershwin-influenced Losing My Mind, Staunton shows that Sally is a lovelorn wreck as her voice seems to dissolve on the song＊s final syllable. The other visible nervous breakdown affects Ben, who is beautifully played by Philip Quast. A UN diplomat turned financier, he initially seems the embodiment of urbane condescension. But gradually Quast reveals the desolation beneath, and in his final number, Live, Laugh, Love, he goes to pieces in the midst of a top-hat-and-tails turn with a conviction that leaves the audience unsure whether it is the character or the actor who is disintegrating. As Phyllis, Dee is brilliantly sardonic in her withering put-downs but when it came to the climactic The Story of Lucy and Jessie, where she dances alongside Strallen, I realised that this is a song about a divided self. The same dilemma afflicts Peter Forbes＊s Buddy, irrevocably torn between the stability of marriage and the excitements of adultery. The danger of Follies is that it can easily succumb to nostalgia, a tribute to a vanished showbiz glamour. But, while Vicki Mortimer＊s design combines theatrical debris and peacock splendour and Bill Deamer＊s choreography evokes the period precision of classic dance routines, the production never lets you forget the astringent sadness beneath the spectacle. In a 37-strong cast there also striking contributions from Josephine Barstow as a throwback to old Vienna, Di Botcher as a superannuated Broadway baby and Dawn Hope as a resilient hoofer. Played without a trace of camp and no interval, this is a production that perfectly captures the sustained emotional arc of Sondheim and Goldman＊s musical. I came out admiring the show more than ever. 																																											"
"Jack London hunted it down with a club. Graham Greene found it on benzedrine. For Mary Godwin it struck one wet summer night after making up ghost stories with Lord Byron and her husband-to-be, Percy Shelley.Artists have relied on muses, nature, drink and drugs to fuel their creativity, but according to new research there may be another way to boost imaginative thinking: a blast of happy music. According to psychologists, uplifting music can help people think more flexibly and avoid getting stuck in a creative rut.Simone Ritter from Radboud University in Nijmegen and Sam Ferguson at the University of Technology in Sydney decided to test the power of music by setting 155 people in their late teens and twenties a series of puzzles to tackle in silence or while listening to classical scores ranked as either calm, happy, anxious or sad.The psychologists scored the volunteers on two measures of creativity. The first, known as convergent thinking, calls for deep thought, accuracy and logic, and can help people reach the single best answer to a given problem. Ritter and Ferguson used a number of tests to measure convergent thinking, including what is known as the Duncker candle test, in which a person must work out how to fix a candle to a wall and light it without wax dripping onto a table below.The second measure of creativity, known as divergent thinking, is needed to come up with original ideas: ones that connect previously disparate ideas, for example, or which use information in radical new ways. To measure divergent thinking, the participants sat a test called the Alternative Uses Task, which scores people on the uses they can find for a common object, in this case a household brick.Music turned out to have no effect on convergent thinking. But when compared to sitting in silence, listening to happy music boosted people＊s scores on divergent thinking from an average of 76 to 94. In the study, that meant more and better ideas came from people who listened to Vivaldi＊s uplifting Four Seasons, than from those who heard Samuel Barber＊s sad Adagio for Strings; Holst＊s anxious Mars movement from The Planets; or the calm Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-Sa?ns.Writing in the journal , the psychologists speculate that happy music can boost creativity by helping people to think more flexibly. ※When getting stuck in a rut, it can be helpful, instead of digging deeper, to dig elsewhere,§ they note. It is not only artists who could benefit from happy music, the authors add. ※Music listening can be easily integrated into daily life,§ they write, and may boost imaginative thinking in ※scientific, educational and organisational settings when creative thinking is needed.§And a boost is certainly needed, the authors claim. In their report, Ritter and Ferguson describe creativity as the ※driving force behind scientific, technological and cultural innovation§ and ※one of the key competences§ for the 21st century.§. ※The problems we face in our complex and fast-changing world more than ever demand creative thinking. However, we are in a creativity crisis; people in general are thinking less creatively than before,§ they write. There is more research to be done. In future work, the psychologists are keen to explore how working to favourite musical pieces versus unfamiliar tunes affect people＊s thinking. Other questions are whether rock, pop, dance and trance affect people＊s creative powers in the same way, and whether ambient sounds, such as the tinkle of wind chimes or the grinding of machinery affect creativity as well.

"ut in the fields, little changes from year to year. Farmers are still drying their hay and collecting their wood. The cows are still tinkling and clanging in the high alps, waiting their turn to come down to the valley. There is a kind of bustling beauty all around.And at the, in the middle of all this bucolic loveliness, little changes either. The formula works: bring the best musicians in the world to this little village in southern Austria in late August and an audience will magically appear each evening.They will have spent the day walking in the hills and mountains. They may have had an early evening bowl of soup and glass of . But at 8pm sharp they will be sitting hushed and attentive for the music. Nor does the music change much from year to year. Unless I＊ve missed someone, the most contemporary composer to feature all week was  (1877每1953), who wrote evocative Edwardian art songs.It would be easy, in other words, to criticise the Schubertiade. But it is what it is 每 and what it is, is rare and rather wonderful.This year I arrived in time for the first of two recitals by the Russian-German pianist, : two Schubert masterpieces sandwiching the Eroica Variations of Beethoven. The Schubert pieces were studies in contrasts: the Allegretto D915 sounding almost like a fantasy, such was its freedom and looseness; the penultimate sonata, D959, more rhythmically structured. The second movement was heart-tuggingly tender.Tuesday brought a brio-filled  quintet and a beautifully executed Schubert Octet with velvety playing by the French clarinettist .On Wednesday it was the turn of the  and two late Beethoven string quartets, Ops 132 and 130. There is so much unresolved pain and questioning in these works that they need to sound raw and unsettling as well as sublime. In Op 132, the Emersons sounded a little too polished and polite. They changed gears for Op 130 and by the time they reached the  in history 每  每 they sounded possessed.On my final night, Igor Levit was back for the . The opening Aria was played in poetry rather than prose, and with such ever-changing ornamentation that we could almost have been listening to improvisation. Levit plays with liquid delicacy and thoughtfulness. By the time he reached the end of the painfully intense Adagio 25th variation he looked utterly drained. Somehow he dug deep to find the energy to finish the work off.The variations demand complete concentration for an audience, never mind the . One measure of a great performance is how completely the figure sitting at the keyboard can spellbind the listeners. For the best part of an hour and a half Levit did just that. He is on his way to becoming a great pianist.And so another Schubertiade visit drew to a close. The conservatism of the environs is deceptive. Look carefully at the landscape around the villages and you＊ll see strikingly contemporary design and craft. Eat in the surrounding hotels and restaurants and you＊ll become aware this is an area with much small-scale organic food production. Many of the villages in the Bregenzerwald are powered by . Small-c conservatism blends with rather contemporary conservation. And, while the repertoire is hardly experimental, young performers such as Levit are finding new ways of playing and thinking about the greatest of all music.

"ivienne Westwood dedicated her 1983 collection to witches, and paganism and the occult was a recurring theme for Alexander McQueen, who traced his family tree back to the Salem witch trials. But this autumn, supernatural vibrations are being felt by a new generation, as witches cast their spell over everything from fashion to politics.※I＊ve always loved witches,§ says designer Edward Meadham, as he explains his inspirations for his latest collection. ※In my work I have always tried to distort the perceived meanings of the visual female archetypes, including witches,§ he says. ※For me, they are the primary example of the feared and maligned women.§Fashion fans will know Meadham from cult label Meadham Kirchhoff, which is now closed. His new label, which marries street style with gothic romance, is called , though he had toyed with the idea of calling it Witches. The collection, which featured witches on T-shirts and hoodies, alongside graffiti-style illustration, pearls, and frills, immediately sold out when it went on sale at Dover Street Market last month. Meadham is not the only designer flirting with witch style this season. Rising womenswear designer Clio Peppiatt will be presenting her upcoming collection at London fashion week in September, and witches will feature heavily. Themed around , the 30-piece collection will feature detailed embroidery and embellishment taken from Peppiatt＊s own illustrations.The Love Witch＊sluridstyle owes much to the campy horror movies of the 60s and 70s. ※I loved the obsessive attention to detail throughout the film,§ Peppiatt explains. ※The colours, the set, the costume and the production; the way everything hangs together is so gorgeous. But, while aesthetically everything is beautiful, the core is very macabre.§ For her upcoming collection, Peppiatt illustrated her own tarot cards 每 inspired by the original Rider Waite deck〞and worked from the designs. ※The initial imagery is so rich and detailed,§ she says.Witchcraft also has a rich visual legacy in the music industry. Stevie Nicks and Kate Bush were early pioneers: from a dove-carryingNicks explaining that her song Rhiannonis about ※an old Welsh witch§, to Bush＊s Waking the Witch, from her Hounds of Lovealbum. And Courtney Love sang about the ※witches inside us§ in 1993＊s 20 Years In The Dakota.Love＊s grungy 90s aesthetic was a reference point for Meadham in particular. ※The witch symbol I used on a hoodie for the last Blue Rosescollection was stolen from the inside cover of Hole＊s Live Through This, and it is a symbol I＊ve used before in my work,§ he explains. ※I love the idea of my clothes being a uniform for a coven of disruptive girls.§Certainly, the new witch aesthetic owes much more to 90s fashion〞think The Craft or Sabrina The Teenage Witch. In particular, The Craft has a lot to answer for when it comes to our current trends: small, coloured sunglasses, chokers, dark lipstick, and kilts all feature prominently in the cult 1996 film about a coven of teen witches. Expect more of the same when the much-awaited remake, currently in development, finally hits our screens.But why has the fashion world embraced witchcraft? In part, designers like Peppiatt and Meadham have glommed on to it as a fashionable aesthetic due to the influence of teen girl internet culture, specifically platforms like Tumblr and Instagram.Today＊s modern witch is as likely to cast a binding spell on Donald Trump or espouse the virtues of motherwort as she is to celebrate the vernal equinox or mercury retrograde finally ending. Modern witches are fashionable, sexually liberated, young, and often actively engaged in political activism.In the hyper-masculine age of Trump, tarot, astrology, crystal healing and witchcraft are firmly in vogue. Dazed Digital has just appointed a self-proclaimed witch Lauren Bowker, who runs a mystical magic laboratory THEUNSEEN, and will be science editor-at-large for the site. American Vogue has hopped on the broomstick, recently curating a ※Witchy Week§ featuring tips on how to have a moon ceremony and which potions to include in your beauty regime. And influencers like  and  position themselves at the vanguard of modern witchcraft, with an Instagram-friendly aesthetic and huge followings. ※The world is in such a crazy state right now,§ says Peppiatt, ※I wonder if people are looking for something greater to believe in.§To help them find their way, Elisabeth Krohn launched Sabat in 2016, as a magazine that fuses feminism and witchcraft. ※The modern witch offers us another path, one that is mystical and nature-orientated, where we come into our feminine power as women and witches,§ she says. ※For the girls that grow up today, this world is dominated by patriarchy and consumerism. Can we really be and do whatever we like? Do we have powers?§But how best to channel your inner witch? ※I feel there is a witchy look for every mood or occasion,§ Krohn says. ※We can claim belonging to tribes of thought and practice, dress for protest like the guerrilla feminists of activist group W.I.T.C.H. or cling on to personal talismans to feel strong or safe. And we can choose alternative and perhaps more ethical ways to consume and create fashion as an art of every day that also honour broader values like caring for the earth and other creatures.§And if you can＊t find a rowdy, raucous coven to join, why not create your own?

"Former White House press secretary  made a surprising appearance during Sunday night＊s Emmys, mocking his former boss＊s obsession with crowd sizes during host Stephen Colbert＊s opening monologue.Colbert, who regularly takes aim at Trump on The Late Show, used his opening monologue to make fun of Trump, who during a presidential debate last year said he ※should＊ve won§ an Emmy when his show The Apprentice was nominated.※If he＊d won, I bet he would not have run for president,§ Colbert told the crowd. ※So, in a way this is your fault.§※I thought you people loved morally compromised anti-heroes,§ Colbert added, referencing the character Walter White of Breaking Bad and calling Trump, along with Alec Baldwin, ※the biggest TV star of this past year§.Then, Spicer stepped on to the stage with a podium that looked identical to the one he delivered his often confusing briefings from as press secretary. The  crowd, including Melissa McCarthy, whose infamous impression of Spicer made waves earlier this year, was noticeably surprised.※This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period!

"his summer, I read the entries for this year＊s , and discussed with my fellow judges the vexed question of how the ※best§ might be identified. This was both a pleasure and a serious challenge: the form of the story is so capacious and diverse that at times we were comparing apples and pears, or at least looking at an unfamiliar fruit and arguing over whether to call it an apple or a pear. (Rest assured, though: the challenge is not impossible. An apple is always better than a pear.) You can assess our choices after the shortlist is announced this Friday evening on BBC Radio 4. All five finalists will then be broadcast on successive afternoons on BBC Radio 4 () starting on 18 September. But this challenge has been nothing against the request to choose stories to fit the title for this piece. Guardian, please! There are approximately 17m to choose from. Where do I even begin? Where are all the stories I haven＊t read, or have loved and then unfaithfully forgotten? (I am a fickle and forgetful reader.)This list, then, is not hierarchical or canonical. My choices are, simply, 10 tales from this century that I have read and that I think do something interesting or startling or just downright swoony with the form of the short story. Clicking on the titles will lead you to the stories themselves, if you haven＊t already read them. I look forward to having my reading horizons broadened in the comments.Sorry to be so predictable, but I do love George Saunders. With this story, and the rest of the collection it comes from, Tenth of December, he was clearly taking his gifts for voice, character, and satire, and pushing himself to do something much harder and more humane. This story starts awkwardly, in tune with its two gangly teenage protagonists, and stutters through a lovely character study to suddenly burst into an action tale and an unlikely outbreak of heroism. It also offers a dazzling response to the writer＊s dilemma of whether to move to a happy ending or a sad ending. On the last page, you can see Saunders looking at the options he has created for himself and simply opening his hands a little wider and saying, ＆Yes, we＊ll have both of those.＊This was my personal standout in the already very strong . I＊m increasingly drawn to any story that has a more expansive sense of a story＊s possibility than the ※snapshot of life§ model insisted upon by the Carver/Hemingway school. This story begins at the dawn of time and ends round about now, which is expansive enough for anyone, I feel. It also has beautiful sentences, and there are not enough of those in the world.This does one of my favourite things in a story: something you weren＊t expecting. It＊s an apocalypse tale, of which we seem to have had many lately and for which I am quite the sucker, but it＊s a whole other and new form of apocalypse, wherein a howling wind rips everything loose from the ground. A real feat of imagination, and all the more terrifying for being set in the made-newly-strange streets of my Norwich childhood.Barry is great at drawing you quickly into the confidence of his voice; the first few sentences of any of his stories have that quality of strapping you in for the ride. ※So I bought an old hotel on the fjord of Killary,§ the narrator tells us at the outset of this one, and we can already hear the sigh in his voice. ※It rained two hundred and eighty-seven days of the year, and the locals were given to magnificent mood swings.§ We lean in, and listen on.Five women talking in a hair salon while one of them has her braids done: this is all the narrative structure Gappah needs to build a complex social landscape, telling these women＊s stories through perfectly pitched dialogue and delicately measured details. The recurring refrain that ※Kindness is late§ is brilliantly deployed, and the whole story quietly makes the point that hair is always political.As is usually the case, I＊ve only just started reading Zambra after years of being urged to do so. This story, of a robbery that starts off violent before fizzling out into a chat about football and a lift home, is told in a jarringly languorous and anecdotal tone, which both draws you in and leaves you uncomfortably dissonant.This story, from , published by the excellent Comma Press, is by turns terrifying and wonderfully banal. In Baghdad＊s Green Zone, Hajjar keeps a rabbit while waiting to be briefed on an operation. The rabbit lays an egg. Things get stranger and darker, and Blasim lays his tale out with a wonderfully dry bar-room simplicity that makes the ending all the more explosive.This recently won , and it＊s not hard to see why. Written in a misleadingly offhand deadpan, Track covers seemingly familiar ground 每 an abusive relationship, a young woman adrift in the big city, the pitfalls of fame and money 每 at such an oblique angle that it demands repeated reading. It＊s also very funny, and very sad.I could have chosen any of the stories from  每 and in fact I would urge you to read the collection as a whole, its sum being, unusually, greater than the parts. I have plumped for this simply because it is so painfully funny. The narrator, ※determined to host a low-key, but impeccably conceived, soir谷e§, details at great length her preparations and in the process reveals almost everything about her own hurt and loss. Bennett＊s language is an ornate and long-winded riposte to all those pared-back minimalists, and I love it.This is a stone-cold masterpiece, as you will see by following the link above. It proceeds with the strange and relentless quality of a dream or fable, while being almost macabre in its realism, and feels like the story Antrim has been writing towards for his whole career. The beauty of it is hard to pin down, but it has a finished and inevitable quality 每 which it＊s occurring to me now could be called soul.																																											"

It＊s high totals are more astounding, considering that the film, directed by Andy Muschietti, cost only $35m to produce.The film＊s success was helped by a lack of other new releases over the weekend, save for the Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy Home Again, which came in a very distant second with $9m. In third place was The Hitman＊s Bodyguard, with $4.9m, Annabelle: Creation took fourth with $4 million, and Wind River rounded out the top five with $3.2 million.The success of It also comes after an underperforming summer moviegoing season that left the year to date box office down 6.5% from last year, and . Now, with It factored in, the year is down only 5.5%.※There has been a lot written about the demise of the box office. This seems to come up every few years and it＊s all content driven. If there are good movies out there, the public will embrace them and be excited to see them. If we come up with movies they are not interested in, they stay away,§ Goldstein said. ※This is a movie they wanted to see.§Starring Bill Sk?rsgard as the homicidal clown Pennywise, It is the first of a two-part series.

"Comic-book writer and artist Len Wein, co-creator of Wolverine and Swamp Thing, died on Sunday at the age of 69.A master of many aspects of the form, Wein worked as an artist and editor, but was primarily known for his writing, having written for a veritable who＊s who of classic characters, including Daredevil, Flash, Superman, Spider-Man, Batman and the Hulk.Born in New York in 1948, Wein originally had ambitions to be a comic artist, regularly visiting DC Comics＊ offices with friend 每 and eventually fellow writer 每 Marv Wolfman. DC editor Joe Orlando at last gave them both their first freelance work in 1968.Switching mainly to scripting, Wein worked for DC until the early 1970s, when he moved to Marvel. There, with artists John Romita Sr and Herb Trimpe, Wein created the character Wolverine, who debuted in an issue of the Incredible Hulk. Wolverine later became a mainstay of the  Universe when Wein and artist Dave Cockrum revamped the X-Men, a super-team originally created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in the 1960s. When Wein and Cockrum＊s Giant-Sized X-Men #1 was released in 1975, X-Men had not been published for five years, with the two introducing new characters including Storm, Collossus and Nightcrawler.After returning to DC, Wein came up with the idea of Swamp Thing while riding the subway in Queens. He wrote the first issue in 1971, working with artist Bernie Wrightson (). A shambling monster with the mind of a man, Swamp Thing was taken over by Alan Moore in the 1980s, with Wein serving as editor. The two would later work together on the classic comic Watchmen, with Moore writing, Wein editing and art by Dave Gibbons.Wein had suffered from various health complaints, undergoing a quintuple heart bypass in 2015 and regularly updating fans on Twitter with hospital updates, many written by his wife, photographer and lawyer Christine Valada. In March, Wein tweeted that he was going into surgery with the hashtag , a joke about the near-invulnerability of his cantankerous creation. Most recently he had undergone surgery for an abscess on one of his heel bones. Two days before he died, Valada tweeted: ※Out of surgery, which went very well.§Comics fans and professionals posted tributes to Wein. , author and comic book writer Neil Gaiman said: ※I just learned that my friend and writing inspiration @LenWein passed away this morning. My love and condolences to his wife. He wrote Swamp Thing, Phantom Stranger, & my favourite Batman stories. He showed 12 year old me that comics could be literature. Len Wein was the editor who brought the British creators to DC. He was one of the nicest people I＊ve met, in 30 years in comics. He will be missed. And I will miss him.§: ※Len Wein, co-creator of Wolverine and Swamp Thing and more responsible for the X-Men you love than he gets credit for. Thank you§, adding: ※He was VERY kind to me when I first started at Marvel. Encouraging and shiny. Sadly, not all his peers are. He was inspiring.§Actor , who portrayed Wein＊s creation Wolverine on screen wrote: ※Blessed to have known Len Wein. I first met him in 2008. I told him - from his heart, mind & hands came the greatest character in comics.§Dave Wielgosz, assistant editor at  added: ※You can＊t be hyperbolic when it comes to Len Wein＊s legacy. He created, wrote and edited more great superhero stories than anyone. RIP.§																																											"
"hen I first read Mansfield Park, I heard music. That doesn＊t always happen when I read, and it certainly didn＊t happen with Jane Austen＊s other novels. But there＊s something about this particular book that provoked musical ideas.Music is often involved in Austen＊s stories: there are dances and private concerts, many of her heroines play the piano (as did Austen herself) and some of them sing. In Mansfield Park, Fanny Price＊s opponent Mary Crawford plays that dangerously romantic instrument, the harp.But what elicited music to me was not the presence of instruments in the story, but something beneath the surface. I think it was the way the heroine so often suffers in silence. Austen offers clues to her feelings, but unlike the lively Emma Woodhouse or the high-spirited Elizabeth Bennet, Fanny does not express them. To me, her reticence invited music, a way of revealing those hidden emotions.Two scenes stood out as especially poignant 每 and musical.In the first, Fanny＊s beloved Edmund is distracted and entranced by the vivacious Mary Crawford, but one evening he joins Fanny to gaze out of the window at the stars. Fanny is overjoyed 每 but then Mary starts to sing, and Edmund is drawn back into the room away from the window where Fanny now stands alone, looking out into the night. This follows a scene in which Fanny 每 alone, seated on a bench 每 helplessly watches Edmund as he walks off to explore a wilderness beyond the garden with Mary Crawford. These scenes have haunted me for years. Fanny＊s pained silences gave me the impulse to write music for her, and I began to think about a Mansfield Park opera.It was an idea that wouldn＊t go away. In between other projects, it resurfaced and asked for attention. The kind of music that I imagined for it changed and developed over time (it was only when I started to write in earnest that it really crystallised) but the feelings the story provoked remained surprisingly constant. I discovered that I was not the first to think that Mansfield Park could make an opera. In 1946, while rehearsing  at Glyndebourne, Benjamin Britten was asked by John Christie to think of writing a comedy, and he started working on Mansfield Park. He made a detailed synopsis, and Ronald Duncan got as far as drafting the libretto for act one. Britten wanted a mezzo-soprano to play Fanny Price. (I independently came to the same conclusion. The inward nature of her character suggests that darker voice, while the extrovert Mary Crawford needs all the flamboyant display of a soprano.) Britten was imagining Kathleen Ferrier as Fanny Price, and Peter Pears as Edmund Bertram. But work stalled.  每 the director who worked with Britten at the English Opera Group 每 told me that when tongues started to wag about the new opera, Britten abandoned it: the composer hated public speculation about his work in progress. Instead, he wrote .Over the years, I often mentioned my fantasy Mansfield Park opera. Peoplesometimes shared my enthusiasm, but it never went any further. Then in 2006, while rehearsing , John told me about the newly formed  company, of which he was a patron. The outfit specialised in taking opera to stately homes and historic buildings, and it dawned on me that this might be the perfect company to commission and produce my fantasy opera. I＊d always imagined it happening in a stately home, accompanied by just a piano. After all, singing around the piano is an entertainment that Jane Austen would immediately have recognised. And a central scene in the novel involves a group of young people rehearsing a play in the drawing room of a country house.Heritage Opera made my dreams into reality, and my chamber opera was premiered at Boughton House in Northamptonshire in 2011. I was pleased with the four-handed piano accompaniment: it suggested something of the music-making of the period and, in a chamber space, provided ample support for the voices. The music does not pretend to be exactly of the period, but I hope it suggests to 21st-century ears something of the early 1800s, and the unique world of . With Alasdair Middleton＊s libretto making some radical cuts to the novel we were able to tell the Cinderella-like story with a cast of just 10. For a lot of the time, the characters sing in Jane Austen＊s own words.In its original chamber form, the opera has already enjoyed several productions in the UK and beyond, playing in theatres as well as ballrooms and large halls of stately homes. No sooner did I start wondering what it would be like with an orchestra than I could hear a small chamber ensemble 每 around a dozen players, still with the piano prominent, but using all the sounds of the period. And I realised that, while I was composing for piano, I had all along been subconsciously imagining other instrumental colours. In the first scene of Act Two, I had even imagined musicians in a distant room practising dances for the ball 每 a tricky thing to convey when all you have on stage is a single piano. To orchestrate the opera would release those latent ideas, and make them tangible. And so, with celebrations across the world of the bicentenary of Austen＊s death, the Grange festival commissioned a new, orchestral version of her third novel. It is pleasing to think its premiere takes place at the Grange in Northington, just a few miles from Jane Austen＊s birthplace, Steventon.It seems unlikely that Austen would ever have imagined any of her novels as operas 每 I can＊t remember her ever mentioning the artform. But I like to think she might enjoy this one. Film and television adaptations of her work often strike me as far too slow and quiet, compared to the teeming inner life of her characters and the high spirits and caustic remarks of the author. The experience of reading Austen is always energising. I like to think that the opera does a better job of reflecting something of the exuberant vitality of her writing.																																											"
"YouTube＊s best-paid star Felix Kjellberg, better known as PewDiePie, has yet again used a racial slur on the video-sharing site.The 27-year-old video blogger called an opponent a ※fucking nigger§ , before correcting himself to ※fucking asshole§, adding: ※I didn＊t mean it in a bad way.§It isn＊t the first time the YouTube star has crossed the line. In February this year, he lost partnerships with  and  after  of his regular use of antisemitism and Nazi imagery as props for shock humour.This time, his racist outburst has prompted a bottom-up response, with games companies stating they will fight his attempts to use their work to create his videos. Sean Vanaman, the co-founder of games developer Campo Santo, tweeted that he would be filing a copyright claim in order to force  to remove Kjellberg＊s video of Vanaman＊s game Firewatch.The video has almost 6m views on YouTube, rendering it a potent source of publicity for Campo Santo and a revenue stream for Kjellberg.Vanaman : ※I am sick of this child getting more and more chances to make money off of what we make. ※I＊d urge other developers and will be reaching out to folks much larger than us to cut him off from the content that has made him a millionaire.§Kjellberg has almost 60 million subscribers on YouTube, and reportedly earned $15m (?11m) from the site in 2016. But the revelations over the course of 2017 may mean his earnings drop substantially.An investigation earlier this year revealed  over a six month period contained either antisemitic jokes or Nazi imagery, and led to Kjellberg losing valuable revenue streams. Disney-owned Maker Studios co-launched Revelmode 每 a multichannel network that produced videos, mobile apps and merchandise 每 with the YouTube star, until the partnership was dissolved following the revelations.Google＊s YouTube also parted ways with Kjellberg. The company removed him from its premium advertising network, which pays better rates than the company＊s programmatic adverts and attracts prestige clients. He had also been producing a series with YouTube＊s subscription service, YouTube Red until Google pulled the plug. The YouTube star eventually hit back with an angry video  in an attempt to destroy his career. ※Old-school media does not like internet personalities because they are scared of us. We have so much influence and such a large voice, and I don＊t think they understand that,§ he said.																																											"
"t the centre of debates about green belts is the question of trust. In theory it should be possible to build on a very small proportion of the nation＊s green belts in such a way that affordable housing and sustainable communities are created, and more people have more and better access to nature than before. In practice few people trust that this will happen, as the available evidence is that we will get instead a smearing of developers＊ standard products across the countryside, for sale at inflated prices.The promise of what＊s called the  is that it will indeed achieve these good things. Here the University of Cambridge is turning 150 hectares of what was flat, inaccessible and somewhat featureless farmland, located between the city and the M11, into a billion-pound urban district the area of which is not much smaller than the historic centre of Cambridge itself. Three thousand homes are planned, half of them affordable, plus 2,000 postgraduate student bed spaces, 100,000 sq m of research facilities, and the schools, shops, surgeries and the like needed to sustain them. Two new public parks are being created, one between the new development and the old city, the other a series of lakes and mounds that buffer the sights and sounds of the motorway.The development is motivated by the extreme effects of growth in Cambridge, resulting in house values that have priced out key workers, including researchers and young academics, without which neither university nor city can function. In this way  acutely experiences pressures felt in other parts of the country, which has put it at the forefront of finding ways to do something about them. Change doesn＊t happen quickly: discussions of expansion have been going on since the 1980s, with the current plans in development for over a decade.There is a patent desire to be responsible and exemplary in everything. The North West Cambridge Development sets out to achieve high levels of sustainability, including many photovoltaic cells to gather solar energy, low levels of car use and the recycling of rainwater for irrigation and the flushing of toilets. It has been masterminded by the multinational AECOM, which is one of the largest engineering and design consultancies in the world, with landscapes by Townshend, who have worked on large commercial developments such as King＊s Cross in London. An array of well-respected architects have been brought in to design individual buildings: the Stirling prize winners Alison Brooks, Witherford Watson Mann, Wilkinson?Eyre and Stanton Williams; , the Dutch practice Mecanoo and Muma, best known for their . I am told that they also wanted ※young§ architects, although these practices are almost entirely led?by over-50s.The plan is now taking physical form and, so far, it is doing what it said it would. The first homes have been completed in Eddington, which is the name given to the first phase. Residents have started moving in. A ※market square§ is complete. A new Sainsbury＊s opened last week. A primary school has been open for two years. Swirles Court, housing for the graduate students of Girton College, is also complete. Unusually, in comparison with most commercial developments, it is the affordable housing and the shared facilities, rather then the more profitable high-value homes, that are being built first.Cambridge has never been a throbbing metropolis and its suburbs less so. By the time you get to the environs of north-west Cambridge the city is petering out into detached and semi-detached houses. Yet Eddington is in the form of apartment blocks, three to five storeys high, in density more like an inner suburb of a large Victorian city, with the intention of building a lot of homes without using up too much space. It＊s a surprising typology, but it makes sense.The architectural style is bricky, rectangular, austere with a few outbreaks of playfulness. Ludwig Wittgenstein, who spent his last months in nearby Storey＊s Way, once praised the plain Georgian terraces of Dublin for having ※the good taste to know that they had nothing very important to say§, and the same might be said of this style. Metropolitan types call it the ※new London vernacular§, but it turns out it＊s at home here too, on the edge of the fens. Its best qualities are its thoughtfulness 每 the unusually high ceilings in ground-floor flats, the proportions of windows, the use of galleries with expansive views to give access to upper-level flats.The more public buildings loosen up a bit, though not too much. The school, by Marks Barfield, is an elegant flat doughnut with a calm, protected space in the centre. Muma＊s nearly complete nursery school and community centre, designed for things like ※dance classes or zumba, Brownies or film clubs, fashion shows, weddings or fairs§, will offer a lively inner world of contrasting volumes, while still being quite quiet on the outside. So the overall effect is of a development that is thoughtful and considered but also, even after making due allowance for its unfinished state and the fact that plants need to grow, overdoing its sobriety.Here the landscaping, which should be crucial, is unfortunately the weakest part. It should soften and animate and make places distinctive and sociable. What＊s there, all good quality to be sure, has its moments 每 there＊s a nice grassy swale running through the development that＊s part of the rainwater system 每 but it tends towards the generic. The market square (where, for now, no actual markets are planned) is a could-be-anywhere bit of tasteful corporate design, for which some funky benches are not a sufficient antidote. There＊s a long straight pedestrian-friendly street that looks promising as a place to congregate, but its hard and rectangular planters are oddly discouraging. The beige Mondrians of paving too often beat the planting. You can＊t yet see spaces in which it would be a positive delight for children to play.More fundamentally the distribution of design intelligence is out of whack. In a way that almost always happens in projects of this scale the big efficient companies like AECOM are asked to make the really big decisions, whereas the Stirling prize winners and ※young§ architects get to play with a fairly limited range of choices about proportion and disposition. If the imagination and skills of the latter had been applied to the orchestration of a potentially rich array of shared spaces,?and to an overall idea of the kind of place that is being created, it would have turned North West Cambridge from a good to a world-beating piece of planning.But these weaknesses should not detract from what is likely to be a fundamental success of the development. To the basic question to be asked when building on green belt or any green land 每 is it better than it would have been had it stayed as fields? 每 the answer is yes. More people will enjoy richer forms of nature in the new parks than in the past, and many will find homes at high levels of design and sustainability. The clout, wealth and wisdom of the university has been vital in achieving this, but if the model can be followed in other green locations across the country we might find a way to create large numbers of decent homes and respect nature at the same time.

"s you would expect of any series about muscle cars, machismo and the importance of family, the  franchise craps whiny little arguments among its co-stars.

",  and  all employed a?voice that was then new to fiction: that of?a?powerless child indicting power misused. It is a compelling tactic, used by contemporary novelists so often that I＊ve wondered whether adults are allowed to tell stories any more. It＊s a risky tactic, too; for if we see innocence and wisdom only in children, and all adults as wicked and uncaring, the indictment is not of reparable wrongs and misdeeds but of maturity itself.In , American novelist Claire Messud, whose previous books include  and , avoids such sentimental cynicism. Her story of a?childhood friendship, recounted in the voice of a girl of 16 or 17, does not demonise adulthood or dismiss maturity as valueless; but neither does it say that growing up is going to help much. These children are not merciless judges of their parents, or vice versa. There is a good deal of sympathetic understanding on both sides. The problem, perhaps, is not so much power misused by adults against the helpless as a general powerlessness.Aged 11, the two bright, sensitive protagonists, Julia and Cassandra, can still escape from stifling social pressures and the demand for conformity into imaginative invention, but it is already a rather desperate escape. They enact their fantasy-dramas in an abandoned mental hospital for women, a ruin haunted by misery. By 12 they have lost?even that refuge. Their emotional focus narrows to preoccupations fraught with anxiety: sex, the changing body, social class. Imagination is limited to speculation on immediate, daily, local reality. Learning is test-taking. Admired achievement is possible only in sports. Celebrities are the sole role models. Competition, envy and spite dominate group relationships, and under this pressure friendships grow uncertain. Cassie and Julia drift apart, without a quarrel, and though there is a deep permanent bond between them, it will not be renewed.Messud captures young adolescence vividly and unjudgmentally, as it was in 2013 for middle-class white kids of the electronic age in America. The shining goals are wealth and success, but the jobs offered to the young are nanny, barista, waitress, janitor. Work?is seldom presented to them as something to be done for its own sake; purpose doesn＊t mean much. These kids are likely to see their lives not as a continuity of being with an imaginable past and an imaginable future, but as a rapid succession of unrelated events without history and without promise. And therefore without hope.There is a lot of grief in this novel. I?resist novelists who want to take me on a guilt trip and at first I thought that＊s what Messud was doing, but I?was wrong. Her novel is, rather, a kind of ceremony of mourning. Julia, the narrator, writes: ※I was scared, some type of low-level scared, all the time 每 in the back of my mind, but always there.§ Julia＊s parents are affectionate and reliable, but her feminist mother can＊t give her much reassurance: ※It＊s a?sick society,§ she says. And: ※Cassie was hardening,§ Julia says, ※small, tight, unsparing, even her laugh turned?brittle, and her little girl＊s body seemed at once unfinished and withering on the vine.§Cassie gets in with a bad crowd at school, and her mother, a widow who made her daughter her friend, takes up?with a dreadful man with his eye more on the girl than the mother. Life at home deteriorates into persecution, till she is driven to seek safety if not salvation from the person she considers her ※guardian angel§, her father. He?was killed years earlier in a highway accident, or so her mother says. But the mighty search engine of Google provides Cassie＊s angel, a man of the right age and almost the right name, living only a couple of New England states away. So Cassie climbs on the bus and becomes a Missing Person. Her journey, its outcome and its aftermath are narrated with sober honesty.Painful as it may be, this is a hard book to stop reading. Messud is a story teller: the ability to compel and hold the reader＊s interest may not be the crown and summit of the art of novel-writing, but it＊s the beginning and the end of it. And despite some rather self-conscious passages and improbabilities of voice, the story rewards the reader right through to the end.When I was about 15, an excellent teacher put in my hands , Alain-Fournier＊s lyrical novel of doomed adolescence. At that?age of course I swallowed all the romanticism of Meaulnes＊ mysterious domain and wanted only more. More thn 70 years later, I hopefully followed these two girls seeking their own mysterious domain in an abandoned mental hospital, even if I knew only too well that all the romance was imagined, and that any attempt to return to it would end in tragedy.

"s it reasonable to hope for a better world? Study the cruelty and indifference of governments, the disarray of opposition parties, the apparently inexorable slide towards climate breakdown, the renewed threat of nuclear war, and the answer appears to be no. Our problems look intractable, our leaders dangerous, while voters are cowed and baffled. Despair looks like the only rational response. But over the past two years, I have been struck by four observations. What they reveal is that political failure is, in essence, a failure of imagination. They suggest to me that it is despair, not hope, that is irrational. I believe they light a path towards a better world.The first observation is the least original. It is the realisation that it is not strong leaders or parties that dominate politics as much as powerful political narratives. The political history of the second half of the 20th century could be summarised as the conflict between its two great narratives: the stories told by Keynesian social democracy and by neoliberalism. First one and then the other captured the minds of people across the political spectrum. When the social democracy story dominated, even the Conservatives and Republicans adopted key elements of the programme. When neoliberalism took its place, political parties everywhere, regardless of their colour, . These stories overrode everything: personality, identity and party history.This should not surprise us. Stories are the means by which we navigate the world. They allow us to interpret its complex and contradictory signals. We all possess a narrative instinct: an innate disposition to listen for an account of who we are and where we stand.When we encounter a complex issue and try to understand it, what we look for is not consistent and reliable facts but a consistent and comprehensible story. When we ask ourselves whether something ※makes sense§, the ※sense§ we seek is not rationality, as scientists and philosophers perceive it, but narrative fidelity. Does what we are hearing reflect the way we expect humans and the world to behave? Does it hang together? Does it progress as stories should progress?A string of facts, however well attested, will not correct or dislodge a powerful story. The only response it is likely to provoke is indignation: people often angrily deny facts that clash with the narrative ※truth§ established in their minds. The only thing that can displace a story is a story. Those who tell the stories run the world.I came to the second, more interesting, observation with the help of the . It is this. Although the stories told by social democracy and neoliberalism are starkly opposed to each other, they have the same narrative structure. We could call it the Restoration Story. It goes like this:Disorder afflicts the land, caused by powerful and nefarious forces working against the interests of humanity. The hero 每 who might be one person or a group of people 每 revolts against this disorder, fights the nefarious forces, overcomes them despite great odds and restores order.Stories that follow this pattern can be so powerful that they sweep all before them: even our fundamental values. For example, two of the world＊s best-loved and most abiding narratives 每  and the Narnia series 每 invoke values that were familiar in the middle ages but are generally considered repulsive today. Disorder in these stories is characterised by the usurpation of rightful kings or their rightful heirs; justice and order rely on their restoration. We find ourselves cheering the resumption of autocracy, the destruction of industry and even, in the case of Narnia, the triumph of divine right over secular power.If these stories reflected the values most people profess 每 democracy, independence, industrial ※progress§ 每 the rebels would be the heroes and the hereditary rulers the villains. We overlook the conflict with our own priorities because the stories resonate so powerfully with the narrative structure for which our minds are prepared. Facts, evidence, values, beliefs: stories conquer all.The social democratic story explains that the world fell into disorder 每 characterised by the Great Depression 每 because of the self-seeking behaviour of an unrestrained elite. The elite＊s capture of both the world＊s wealth and the political system resulted in the impoverishment and insecurity of working people. By uniting to defend their common interests, the world＊s people could throw down the power of this elite, strip it of its ill-gotten gains and pool the resulting wealth for the good of all. Order and security would be restored in the form of a protective, paternalistic state, investing in public projects for the public good, generating the wealth that would guarantee a prosperous future for everyone. The ordinary people of the land 每 the heroes of the story 每 would triumph over those who had oppressed them.The neoliberal story explains that the world fell into disorder as a result of the collectivising tendencies of the overmighty state, exemplified by the monstrosities of Stalinism and nazism, but evident in all forms of state planning and all attempts to engineer social outcomes. Collectivism crushes freedom, individualism and opportunity. Heroic entrepreneurs, mobilising the redeeming power of the market, would fight this enforced conformity, freeing society from the enslavement of the state. Order would be restored in the form of free markets, delivering wealth and opportunity, guaranteeing a prosperous future for everyone. The ordinary people of the land, released by the heroes of the story (the freedom-seeking entrepreneurs) would triumph over those who had oppressed them.Then 每 again with Marshall＊s help 每 I stumbled into the third observation: the narrative structure of the Restoration Story is a common element in most successful political transformations, including many religious revolutions. This led inexorably to the fourth insight: the reason why, despite its multiple and manifest failures, we appear to be stuck with neoliberalism is that we have failed to produce a new narrative with which to replace it.You cannot take away someone＊s story without giving them a new one. It is not enough to challenge an old narrative, however outdated and discredited it may be. Change happens only when you replace one story with another. When we develop the right story, and learn how to tell it, it will infect the minds of people across the political spectrum.?But the best on offer from major political parties is a microwaved version of the remnants of Keynesian social democracy. There are several problems with this approach. The first is that this old story has lost most of its content and narrative force. What we now call Keynesianism has been reduced to two thin chapters: lowering interest rates when economies are sluggish and using countercyclical public spending (injecting public money into the economy when unemployment is high or recession threatens). Other measures, such as raising taxes when an economy grows quickly, to dampen the boom-bust cycle; the fixed exchange rate system; capital controls and a self-balancing global banking system (an ) 每 all of which  saw as essential complements to these policies 每 have been discarded and forgotten.This is partly because the troubles that beset the Keynesian model in the 1970s have not disappeared. While the  was the immediate trigger for the lethal combination of high inflation and high unemployment (※§) that Keynesian policies were almost powerless to counteract, problems with the system had been mounting for years. Falling productivity and rising  (wages and prices pursuing each other upwards) were already beginning to erode support for Keynesian economics. Most importantly, perhaps, the programme had buckled in response to the political demands of capital.Strong financial regulations and controls on the movement of money began to weaken in the 1950s, as governments . ＊s decision in 1971 to suspend the convertibility of dollars into gold destroyed the system of fixed exchange rates on which much of the success of Keynes＊s policies depended. The capital controls used to prevent financiers and speculators from sucking money out of balanced Keynesian economies collapsed. We cannot hope that the strategies deployed by global finance in the 20th century will be unlearned.But perhaps the biggest problem residual Keynesianism confronts is that, when it does work, it collides headfirst with the environmental crisis. A programme that seeks to sustain employment through constant economic growth, driven by consumer demand, seems destined to exacerbate our greatest predicament.Without a new, guiding story of their own, allowing them to look to a better future rather than a better past, it was inevitable that parties who once sought to resist the power of the wealthy elite would lose their sense of direction. Political renewal depends on a new political story. Without a new story that is positive and propositional, rather than reactive and oppositional, nothing changes. With such a story, everything changes.The narrative we build has to be simple and intelligible. If it is to transform our politics, it should appeal to as many people as possible, crossing traditional political lines. It should resonate with deep needs and desires. It should explain the mess we are in and the means by which we might escape it. And, because there is nothing to be gained from spreading falsehoods, it must be firmly grounded in reality.This might sound like a tall order. But there is, I believe, a clear and compelling Restoration Story to be told that fits this description.?Over the past few years, there has been a convergence of findings in different sciences: psychology, anthropology, neuroscience and evolutionary biology.  points to : that human beings are, in the words of an , ※spectacularly unusual when compared to other animals§. This refers to our . We possess an unparalleled sensitivity to the needs of others, a unique level of concern about their welfare, and a peerless ability to  that generalise and enforce these tendencies.We are also, among mammals, the supreme cooperators. We survived the rigours of the African savannahs, despite being weaker and slower than our predators and most of our prey, through developing a remarkable capacity for mutual aid. This urge to cooperate has been hard-wired into our brains through natural selection. Our tendencies towards altruism and cooperation are the central, crucial facts about humankind. But something has gone horribly wrong.Our good nature has been thwarted by several forces, but perhaps the most powerful is the dominant political narrative of our times. We have been induced by politicians, economists and journalists to accept a vicious ideology of extreme competition and individualism that pits us against each other, encourages us to fear and mistrust each other and weakens the social bonds that make our lives worth living. The story of our competitive, self-maximising nature has been told so often and with such persuasive power that we have accepted it as an . It has changed our perception of ourselves. Our perceptions, in turn, change the way we behave.With the help of this ideology, and the neoliberal narrative used to project it, we have lost our common purpose. This leads in turn to a loss of belief in ourselves as a force for change, frustrating our potential to do what humans do best: to find common ground in confronting our predicaments, and to unite to overcome them. Our atomisation has allowed intolerant and violent forces to fill the political vacuum. We are trapped in a vicious circle of alienation and reaction. The hypersocial mammal is .But by coming together to revive community life we, the heroes of this story, can break the vicious circle. Through invoking our capacity for togetherness and belonging, we can rediscover the central facts of our humanity: our altruism and mutual aid. By reviving community, built around the places in which we live, and by anchoring ourselves, our politics and parts of our economy in the life of this community, we can restore the best aspects of our nature.Where there is atomisation, we will create a thriving civic life. Where there is alienation, we will forge a new sense of belonging: to neighbours, neighbourhood and society. Community projects will proliferate into a . New social enterprises will strengthen our sense of attachment and ownership.Where we find ourselves crushed between market and state, we will develop a new economics that treats both people and planet with respect. We will build it around a great, neglected economic sphere: . Local resources will be owned and managed by communities, ensuring that wealth is widely shared. Using  will supplement state provision, granting everyone security and resilience.Where we are ignored and exploited, we will revive democracy and retrieve politics from those who have captured it. New methods and  will ensure that every vote counts and financial power can never vanquish political power. Representative democracy will be reinforced by participatory democracy that allows us to refine our political choices. Decision-making will be returned to the smallest political units that can discharge it.The strong, embedded cultures we develop will be robust enough to accommodate social diversity of all kinds: a diversity of people, of origins, of life experiences, of ideas and ways of living. We will no longer need to fear people who differ from ourselves; we will have the strength and confidence to reject attempts to channel hatred towards them.Through restoring community, renewing civic life and claiming our place in the world, we build a society in which our extraordinary nature 每 our altruism, empathy and deep connection 每 is released. A kinder world stimulates and normalises our kinder values. I propose a name for this story: the Politics of Belonging.?Some of this can begin without waiting for a change of government: one of the virtues of a politics rooted in community is that you do not need a national movement in order to begin. But other aspects of this programme depend on wider political change. This too might sound like an improbable hope 每 until you begin to explore some of the remarkable things that have been happening in the United States.The  developed by the campaign to elect  as the Democratic nominee is potentially transformative. Rather than relying on big spending, big data and a big staff, it uses proliferating networks of volunteers, who train and supervise more volunteers, to carry out the tasks usually reserved for staff. While Hillary Clinton＊s campaign was organising money, the Sanders campaign was organising people. By the end of the nomination process, more than 100,000 people had been recruited. Between them, they ran 100,000 events and spoke to 75 million voters.His bid for the nomination was a giant live experiment, most of whose methods were developed on the job. Those who ran it  by the time they stumbled across the strategy that almost won, it was too late. Had it been activated a few months earlier, the volunteer network could have abandoned all forms of targeting and contacted almost every adult in the US. If the techniques they developed were used from the outset, they could radically alter the prospects of any campaign for a better world.When, after reading , I argued in a  that this method could be used to transform the prospects of Jeremy Corbyn＊s Labour party, I was widely mocked. But it turned out to be true. By adopting elements of the Sanders strategy, Labour, , almost won an election that was largely predicted to be a Conservative landslide. And the method that propelled this shift is still in its infancy.I believe it could become still more powerful when combined with some of the techniques identified by former Congressional staffers in the ※ to influencing members of Congress§, an online ※practical guide for resisting the Trump agenda§. These people studied the methods developed by the Tea Party movement and extracted the crucial lessons. They discovered that the key is to use local meetings with representatives to press home a single demand, film and share their responses on social media, then steadily escalate the pressure.The Tea Party honed this technique until its requests became almost impossible to resist. The same thing can be done, though without the harassment to which that movement sometimes resorted. Supported by the Big Organising model, using its proliferating phone-bank teams and doorstep canvassing, the Indivisible methods could, I believe, be used to flip political outcomes in any nation that claims to be a democracy.But none of this will generate meaningful and lasting change unless it is used to support a new, coherent political narrative.Those who want a kinder politics know we have, in theory at least, the numbers on our side. Most people are . Most people would prefer to live in a world in which everyone is treated with respect and decency, and in which we do not squander either our own lives or the natural gifts on which we and the rest of the living world depend. But a small handful, using lies and distractions and confusion, stifle this latent desire for change.We know that if we can mobilise such silent majorities, there is nothing this small minority can do to stop us. But because we have failed to understand what is possible, and above all failed to replace our tired political stories with a compelling narrative of transformation and restoration, we have failed to realise this potential. As we rekindle our imagination, we discover our power to act. And that is the point at which we become unstoppable.  is published by Verso.

"If it is to be believed that Brooklyn is the epicentre of all that is happening next, then we are in for a wave of noughties nostalgia. Yep the noughties 每 a mere 10 years ago.A new exhibition at a pop-up museum on Atlantic Avenue is celebrating 2000s pop culture with a particular focus on the contribution of Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears and Mischa Barton., looks at this period of time through the lens of Nicole Richie＊s infamous party 每 where the leaked invite said to wear your tightest Tsubi jeans and ※sluttiest tops§. The invitation also stipulated that guests should ※start starving now§ as no girls over 100 pounds (45kg) would be allowed in.The exhibition also commemorates Lindsay Lohan＊s home detention ankle bracelet, Naomi Campbell＊s community service work, Barton＊s OD and the reality show The Simple Life.It＊s not just a 00s themed museum. There＊s  每 a seriously great oral history by music writer Lizzy Goodman that I devoured last month. It＊s a world from not so long ago, steeped in the stovepipe trouser, boozy parties in Williamsburg lofts, short sharp three-minute rock songs a la the Strokes, the White Stripes, Interpol, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and the Killers, with cameos by the Vines, Jet, the Libertines and Franz Ferdinand. Ten years goes in the blink of an eye yet many of the bands are no longer with us. The White Stripes have broken up, the Vines and the Libertines have blazed out and  are being written for the Strokes, who are still together but haven＊t capitalised on their early promise.Reading Goodman＊s book made me nostalgic for the summer of 2007. I was living in London and from every shop they played Rihanna and Jay Z singing Umbrella (a good change from the ubiquitous shop floor crooners, Travis). In every tabloid there was a paparazzi shot of a dishevelled Amy Winehouse (bloodied ballet slippers, collapsed beehive, Blake) and gastro pubs serving half-decent food were appearing on every corner. And if you wanted to chill at home, you＊d just slip your thong off (where it sat just below your tramp stamp), change into your comfortable velour Juicy Couture tracksuit, play Norah Jones on your iPod, power up your hair straightener and log on to this new thing that everyone was talking about called Facebook.But what else? Nights in chilling with your pals and the (pink) box set of Sex in the City. Everyone watching Sopranos and The Wire. The sudden ubiquity of online porn and the trends that followed: Brazilian waxes and sex tapes (see One Night in Paris, 2004). Bald Britney. The iPod and later the iPhone. The generation＊s torch songs being the ones that featured in Grey＊s Anatomy (Snow Patrol, Enrique Iglesias, Lily Allen, Gomez, The Fray). Everyone reading Jonathan Franzen.Some things of that time have stayed with us: Ri Ri and Beyonc谷 are still among this decade＊s biggest artists. Much of fashion too has stayed the same 每 particularly that  kicked off in the noughties by Sienna Miller, Kate Moss and Alexa Chung. You＊ll also still see the occasional aviator sunnies, Uggs, American Apparel deep V T-shirt, distressed denim and trucker cap. Thankfully no one wears Ed Hardy anymore.But what were the noughties really about? Does what happen then bear much responsibility for what is happening now? Of course. The decade that gave us September 11 and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq has given way to Isis, the ※alt-right§ and Donald Trump. By 2016, the hope 每 and the moderate road 每 of the Obama years collapsed towards the hard right (Trump, Steve Bannon and the alt-right) and, less potently, the left (Sanders, and the rise of Antifa). In Britain, the optimism of New Labour gave way to lies on Iraq and WMDs and deep voter distrust. In Australia the election of Labor＊s Kevin Rudd in 2007 after the conservative years of John Howard turned out to be a false dawn. The time between 2007 and now has flown by in the blink of an eye. So why the nostalgia? Why the books and the museum? Why the tug 每 always the tug with the past 每 that things were better then?Because 每 maybe, just before the financial crisis of 2008 hit 每 they were. But not for everyone. And not by much.																																											"
"One of the most frequent questions authors are asked is, ※Who are you writing for?§ The audience I had in my mind while writing Carpentaria was the ancestors of our traditional country. I concentrated on the way our people speak to country and each other. In that way, it always felt as though I was writing a story to the old people about the complexities and bravery of our world today but also, by linking the past and the present in this way, I was bringing the ancestral realm into a story of all times.I wanted to describe the powerful nature of our traditional country, which we know about through the law stories that have been upheld over countless millennia, and protected by our people to this day. In creating the main characters of Norm Phantom, Will Phantom, Angel Day and Mozzie Fishman, I wanted to demonstrate how the powerful essence of country is in our people. We are also the country＊s spirit. Country and its people are one. This was the story I wanted to construct, to achieve for the possibility of future readers, although I was the main reader who needed to be satisfied that this book was developing in the way that I wanted it to.While I was writing it, I was not thinking about where this book would be in 10 years time. Although authors hope that their book will have a future, it is hard to visualise it. Like Sam Cooke sings in his song of hope A Change is Gonna Come, ※I don＊t know what＊s up there, beyond the sky§.The future was not what I was concentrating on. My focus was on how to give the story its spirit, to create its heart. This was always the challenge, even though it was familiar ground because the quest of what is in the spirit and heart is related to how storytelling is being shaped in our times as Aboriginal people.Deeper in my mind, where the rational part of the brain weighs up what was really likely to happen to ambitious thoughts, I realised that this book might never be published because of the narrative storytelling style. This is the fear of taking risks and what you have to constantly fight against, to believe more than being fearful, that you are doing the right thing whatever the odds.Any other thoughts about the book＊s worth were more humble. You doubt that you will ever finish the book, until one day you finally admit that the book is finished 每 that you cannot take it any further, years after you started with a few ideas and images jotted down on a piece of paper. You now have a manuscript printed on about two reams of paper. It is not perfect, although in the mind of the author it is 每 more or less.This is the point where the book, and its world, starts to grow away from your imagination, taking with it all of the thoughts you have devoted to its creation. This is the day that you say goodbye. The book divorces the author, or the author divorces the book. You let the book go.It was initially a very sad day to lose the imaginary world of Carpentaria and, with it, the powerful characters whom I had liked working with, but the intensity of the work, and its risk-taking, had also taken its toll. It would take a year for my mind to heal from the intensity of this level of creativity, and to regain enough of my former physical energies to begin working on new creative ideas.When I talk about risk-taking in literature, this has more to do with the low levels of risk-taking in Australian publishing than with what was considered normal in the Aboriginal domain, where we are quite familiar with the idea of asserting our own ideas. I was attaching to literature my own storytelling influences, cultural criteria and aesthetics. I came from a very specific oral storytelling tradition and its visual imagery holds a strong influence over my thinking. These influences initially came to me through my own family, especially my grandmother, and through years of working and living in our communities alongside our own song men and women, some of the most masterful practitioners of storytelling, story-keeping and story-making you could find anywhere in the world.In my earlier book Take Power, a book of stories and essays celebrating the first 20 years of land rights in central Australia, there are many stories from or about important keepers of Aboriginal law stories. One story tells of an elder, a master geographer of his traditional domain, who carried more than three thousand site names in his head 每 each with a sacred song, a Dreaming and sacred history. While I was developing this book, I walked around at night from one fireplace to the next, where people were camping in cleared ground in the spinifex, to collect some of these stories from members of the Central Land Council after their meetings in remote areas of Central Australia. These men and women were the memory keepers of the ancient stories and song cycles for hundreds, if not thousands, of places all across their country where they had traditional responsibilities. How could I write like this?A very senior Warlpiri man of great knowledge who I recorded told a story in his own language about country, about who belonged where. He told his story in exactly 40 minutes. He then pulled out from his bedding his own cassette and retold this same story for a second recording. He explained that he wanted to keep his own copy, rather than waiting for me to go back to Alice Springs hundreds of kilometres away, make him a copy and post it back to him. He told me that he wanted to leave his cassette playing somewhere, so others could hear it as they walked around in his community, rather then having to directly tell particular people that they needed to go back to their own country. This recording was exactly the same length as the first recording. He was a memory man of important stories, a religious man of high degree in our culture. I have been very fortunate in life to have been able to work beside many of our men and women of great wisdom and strength who have been a major influence in my thinking. They knew how to bring people together through stories, through ideas that our people would understand.How do you learn an oral storytelling discipline to keep the story straight, a story that might take days or months to tell, yet tell it properly, so that it can be passed down correctly through the generations, so that it will always be remembered in the correct way?After I finished the manuscript for Carpentaria每 this strange blackfella book in the time of John Howard 每 it was rejected by publishers and had very little chance of being published. Luckily, the independent publisher Ivor Indyk of Giramondo Publishing thought about what I was trying to do as a writer, and also seriously challenged me about what I was doing. Then he was prepared to publish my book about our heroes.I now find it very humbling to think about what has happened since Carpentaria was first published in 2006, and then in 2007, when it unbelievably won the Miles Franklin and other major literary awards.The novel took on a life of its own with the growing momentum of interest in the book and I have been overwhelmed by the way that it has reached into the hearts and minds of readers.The interest in Carpentaria spread further afield than anything I could ever have realised, after it won these prestigious awards, and through the work of reviewers as far as afield as the New York Times. This interest would extend even more seriously for my next novel, The Swan Book.At that time I was reunited with the book. I had to think about it again. I went all over the country and to many different countries to speak about it. I carried this heavy book across India where I heard some of their best academics give brilliant analyses about the work to students, and I would speak to schoolchildren in classrooms throughout the country.I went to China, to the UK, to Europe and to some of the most prestigious writers＊ events in the world. I spoke to young schoolchildren in Coober Pedy who were full of enthusiasm and asked how many pages, words, then letters there were in Carpentaria. I worked with publishers and translators across the world and helped them to promote the book in their countries. There were too many invitations to travel overseas to help promote the work. These were all good opportunities, because I was given the time to talk about Indigenous issues, and to promote our literature and learn from other countries. The tattered book I carried around now sits in my bookcase.I travelled with Carpentaria for about three or four years until I decided the book could do its own work. I could not keep up with this book and go to all parts of the world where it was going, to talk about it, to help it on its journey. This book no longer needed me tagging along. I had tried to make the most of the opportunities as they were presented to me but, in the end, I felt that I would never write again. I did not want to keep up with an endless gruelling program of traveling from one country to the next, and with the major distraction these trips were having on the creation of The Swan Book.I never thought Carpentaria would go into the hands of readers across the world and that people would respond so positively towards it. This book has travelled to far-distant places to be studied, for example, in Inner Mongolia, and in universities in India, and other places that sometimes I learn about. I have been humbled by the way Carpentaria has been thought about in the minds of people who have given the book their respect and trust, have passed it on to others to read, have talked aboutit in their book clubs, and have thanked me for writing it. Carpentaria＊s long life has been created through the thoughts of people who keep it alive in this way and by many people who have written about it, translated it and teach it.I have seen numerous streams of thought and study of this book and I have admired the intellect and skilful understandings of scholars who bring new ideas into the world through this book. This is all part of how literature helps to create better knowledge about our world. I have helped academics who were writing papers on the book, and students who had very kindly chosen to study it for their doctoral and post-doctoral studies in Australia, China, India, United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Japan and many other countries. I have been deeply moved by such attention and thought given to our world through this book, and by all the young students around the world I have met who have felt it was important to them.I am particularly proud of the way that Carpentaria has been welcomed in China through the work of the literary translator Dr Li Yao in Beijing. China＊s Nobel laureate, Mo Yan, launched the Chinese translation in Beijing, and it became a major feature in the Chinese literary journal World Literature. The translation of literature is an incredible thing because it helps to break down the barriers of language and distance, and creates communication, instead of silence.I saw this when I was introduced to writers from Inner Mongolia when I went to China in 2008. They were able to read the Chinese translation of the first chapters of the book and began making comparisons with the similarities and values of their own people, and with the geographical features and the grasslands of the Gulf of Carpentaria.And I will never forget the young Lebanese woman who gave me her copy of her work on Carpentaria, which had been translated for a small publication distributed in Syrian refugee camps in Lebanon.Some of the most important acknowledgements of this book came to me though my own people, such as our strong Gulf of Carpentaria country leader Murrandoo Yanner who told me how he instructed white people in how to read Carpentaria: ※Keep reading§, he told them, ※it will start to sink in.§ Or being told by one of our own Waanyi leaders: ※I hope you are proud of your people, because your people are proud of you.§ It is the greatest honour when my own people tell me how much they have care for this book. This has meant the world to me.I feel that Carpentaria is doing its work if it can do its small part in being a shield for us. I have admired the work of the legal scholar Dr Kathleen Birrell in her book Indigeneity: Before and Beyond The Law in the way that she analyses the legal implications of the book＊s story. That in the eyes of Aboriginal people, our law is more powerful than Australian law.Carpentaria has opened the way to new directions in my life since I started it. Those were the days when it took two years to understand how to write the novel and then a further six years of writing it. Every day I balanced the risks I knew I was taking to write a book to honour my ancestral homelands. I knew it would be very different to the style of Australian fiction by writing it in a narrative style of Aboriginal voices, in particular, in the way that I have heard older Aboriginal men and women speaking all of my life but whose voices were ignored by non-Indigenous Australia.I have had opportunities that few Australian authors have to create fearlessly, to experiment wildly and to work with new ideas with space, dignity and integrity, and the serious intent that ought to be given to produce works of art.The experience of writing Carpentaria has helped me to become a more thoughtful writer. I have worked with the Western Sydney University＊s writing and society research centre since it was established in 2008 with a small core group of writers and literary thinkers. At the centre, I completed The Swan Book and my new novel, Praiseworthy, and have worked with some of the best writers and literary thinkers in the country. I have now begun research on another fictional work that will be an epical journey across the waters of my ancestry, and deeper into our own heartlands. I have been able to undertake a literary research program from the writings I have been interested in across the world, and to develop greater knowledge in my own culture＊s storytelling traditions. I also feel very honoured that I was able to work with my good friend, the late Aboriginal visionary leader Tracker Tilmouth, to produce Tracker, a new non-fiction book about him. Trackeris a monument of his thinking about many of the important stories of our times and will be published by Giramondo in November 2017.Recently I was asked to talk about what had inspired me to write Carpentaria after not speaking about the book for a long time. Reflecting on what I had said earlier about its inspiration, I thought I had such a clear vision for this book. I knew what I wanted to achieve. This reflection was quite troubling because I started to wonder about what had happened to the person I once was. The one who had written this book. She seemed long gone.I do not feel like I am the same person anymore. Where was the idealistic person I used to be? The one who knew exactly what to do, who had been so determined to write this book. Who believed anything could be achieved 每 all it took was the will to do it. This was just like the belief I once had in the creation of Aboriginal self-government in the Northern Territory. Now wouldn＊t that have made a better difference than the spite and waste of millions of dollars of the failed and on-going NT Intervention, which is killing the spirit of so many of our people?The difficulty of writing Carpentaria never really caused me to doubt my belief in myself. How great the challenge would become was never an issue or, more likely, I had no idea about the scale of the challenge in the first place. I just went ahead. The clear vision I had for Carpentaria was that it would celebrate our heroes in the Gulf country, because I have always admired the strengths of our people. This is what I wanted the world to know, about who we were. That we were people of high culture. That we were so much more than how we were demonised as anti-mining and un-Australian because of our opposition to the destruction of sacred sites, and our desire for a fairer economic share from the resources that would be extracted from our land in the development of the Century mine.I felt that I was living in parallel worlds when I was writing this book but possible worlds nevertheless, where anything could be achieved. The real world of the difficult and heartbreaking work of vision and hope to hold our world together, and the imaginary world of the book and its heroes moving with the same purposeful intent across the landscape of our traditional domain.Now the world of reality seems more impenetrable than fiction, and is moving further and faster in the opposite direction to many of the things that I once thought were possible. I now find that I have to make the same energies go much further to achieve greater challenges, to hold a work together in the language of art.																																											"
"DNA evidence taken from the recently exhumed body of Salvador Dal赤 has shown that he is not the father of a .Pilar Abel, a 61-year-old tarot card reader and fortune teller from Girona, has spent the past 10 years trying to prove that she is the fruit of a liaison between her mother and Dal赤 in 1955.In June, a court in Madrid ordered the artist＊s body to be exhumed after previous attempts to determine paternity had failed. A month later, experts entered the crypt beneath the  in his home town of Figueres, Catalonia, to take DNA samples from his hair, nails and bones.However, on Wednesday, the , which controls the artist＊s lucrative estate 每 and which had opposed the exhumation 每 said analysis of the remains had shown that he was not related to Abel.The foundation said a report submitted to the court by the National Institute of Toxicology and Forensic Sciences had established that Dal赤 was not her biological father.※This conclusion comes as no surprise to the foundation, since at no time has there been any evidence of the veracity of an alleged paternity,§ it said in a statement. ※The foundation is pleased that this report puts an end to an absurd and artificial controversy, and that the figure of  remains definitively excluded from totally groundless claims.§It said the DNA samples would be returned shortly, adding: ※The Dal赤 Foundation is also pleased to be able to focus again on the management of its extraordinary artistic legacy and in the promotion of the work and figure of Salvador Dal赤.§Abel told the Spanish newspaper El Pa赤s that neither she nor her lawyers had yet received the results of the tests. ※Until I＊ve got official word, they can say what they like,§ she said. ※I＊m not hiding away and no matter what the result is, positive, negative or invalid, I＊ll give a press conference to all the media to explain the result.§She added: ※If it comes out negative, I＊ll still be  Pilar.§Abel had claimed that the resemblance between her and the artist was so marked that ※the only thing I＊m missing is a moustache§, adding that she had first learned of her supposed parentage from the woman she thought was her paternal grandmother.Abel claims she told her: ※I know you aren＊t my son＊s daughter and that you are the daughter of a great painter, but I love you all the same.§ She also noted that her granddaughter was ※odd, just like your father§.Ten years ago, Abel was granted permission to try to extract DNA from skin, hair and hair traces found clinging to Dal赤＊s death mask. The results proved inconclusive.A second attempt to retrieve samples followed later that year using material supplied by the artist＊s friend and biographer Robert Descharnes.Although Abel has claimed she never received the results of the second test, Descharnes＊ son Nicholas told the Spanish news agency Efe in 2008 that he had learned from the doctor who conducted the tests that they were negative.Had the DNA evidence supported her claim, Abel would have been heir to a quarter of Dal赤＊s fortune, which he bequeathed to the Spanish state and the foundation that bears his name and that of his wife and muse, Gala.The latest twist in the extraordinary saga in the life and death of the surrealist had made headlines around the world 每 as .Narc赤s Bardalet, the embalmer who prepared Dal赤＊s body after his death in 1989 and helped with the exhumation, said he had been thrilled and touched to see the surrealist＊s best-known feature once again.※His moustache is still intact, [like clock hands at] 10 past 10, just as he liked it. It＊s a miracle,§ he told the Catalan radio station RAC1.※His face was covered with a silk handkerchief 每 a magnificent handkerchief ＃ When it was removed, I was delighted to see his moustache was intact ＃ I was quite moved.

" has delivered Channel 4 one of its biggest ever audiences after record numbers of viewers watched the programme on catch-up services.Viewing figures for the first episode of Bake Off on Channel 4 revealed it was watched by a total of 12 million people.  but also 1.5 million watching repeats aired since then and 1.1 million watching it on Channel 4＊s catch-up service All 4 over the past seven days, which is a record.The viewing figures were the third highest audience for a Bake Off launch since the show began in 2010, although the first episode of last year＊s series on BBC1 attracted a total audience of 13.6 million.Channel 4＊s highest ever audience is 13.8 million, for the drama series A Woman of Substance in 1985, while Big Brother brought in almost 10 million viewers at the peak of its popularity at the start of the millennium. Bake Off＊s performance puts it in the top-10  audiences of all time.Last week＊s episode of Bake Off was the first to be shown on  since it paid ?75m to take the show away from the BBC, which aired the first seven series. Judge Paul Hollywood is the only one of the original stars of Bake Off to have made the move to Channel 4, with  and presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins all leaving.Hollywood is joined in the new series  and presenters Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding.Bake Off attracted 2.7 million 16每 to 34每year每olds, making it the biggest programme for younger viewers on any channel in 2017 according to Channel 4.Jay Hunt, Channel 4＊s chief creative officer, said: ※Bake Off has well and truly landed on Channel 4 with episode one delivering the highest number of young viewers for any show on any channel this year. ※I＊m thrilled viewers have warmed to Paul, Prue, Noel and Sandi and are enjoying the exceptional standard of baking.§It is vital for Channel 4 that Bake Off attracts a significant audience so it can recoup its costs. Hunt had previously said that Bake Off needed to attract  and that she would be delighted if the programme attracted between 5 million and 7 million viewers.Viewing figures for the second episode of Bake Off on Tuesday night dipped slightly to an average live audience of 6 million. This was enough for a 27.6% share of the audience, but it was beaten by the return of BBC1 drama Doctor Foster, which attracted 6.3 million viewers. Bake Off aired between 8pm and 9.15pm, while Doctor Foster ran from 9pm to 10pm, meaning there was a 15-minute overlap. Doctor Foster stars Suranne Jones as Dr Gemma Foster, a woman coping with her ex-husband coming back into her life.																																											"
"o Narcos is back for a third season, which takes us beyond the death of its hitherto protagonist Pablo Escobar into the world of his rivals, the . An interesting shift is afoot if a remark from showrunner Eric Newman is anything to go by: ※Unlike Escobar, who had positioned himself as an outlaw, Cali was very much a part of the system.§Narcos season three calls the Cali cartel ※the biggest drug lords you＊ve never heard of§ 每 with good reason. The Rodr赤guez Orejuela brothers Gilberto and Miguel and Jose Santacruz Londo?o are not the household names they could, should 每 and soon will 每 be.The Cali cartel split from Escobar＊s Medellin syndicate years before his death, to become the trader of what some estimate as a 90% share of the global cocaine market, spearheading the supply into Europe during the ※yuppie§ boom of the 1980s.But unlike Escobar, the Cali cartel didn＊t wage war on the system 每 they became part of it.First they dominated their region, and then national politics 每 even compromising a Colombian president. They didn＊t want to attack the state, as Escobar did with cartel gunmen and rogue police; they wanted to be the state. Their financial affairs were so well managed that Gilberto Rodr赤guez founded and directed the First InterAmericas bank in Panama 每 he did so effectively enough to become Escobar＊s banker while also trying to kill his rival. Meanwhile, the expertise of the cartel＊s counter-intelligence systems baffled the CIA and the Drug Enforcement Agency.The series seems, estimably, to want to follow not the story of one man, but the ever-expanding business he created. In doing so, Narcos season three will also illustrate a key point about the nature of cartels: the way in which they morph and mutate from generation to generation.The famous Sinaloa cartel of , now awaiting trial in a New York jail from which he is , was a mutation of both Escobar and Cali. He was the last of the baron bosses, a ※Godfather§ revered as well as feared on his terrain. But he had moved beyond Escobar to find an accommodation with the state: his network of protection within the Mexican state made him the state＊s best bet in trying to keep a perverse ※pax mafiosa§ 每 mafia peace 每 against even more vicious drug syndicates. The latest cartel mutation is Los Zetas, from north-eastern Mexico. This is a narco-militia so brutal that 每 in contrast to Guzm芍n＊s baronial status 每 its name is barely even mentioned within the , from the Rio Grande valley down the Gulf into Central America. They rule with raw terror, not patronage. They forge into Europe, regardless of what is licit or illicit, be it cocaine, sex-trafficking, migration or oil 每 all that matters is business and ultra-violence to secure it. The Zetas are Escobar＊s great grandchildren, the Cali cartel＊s grandchildren, and Guzm芍n＊s defiant sons.Along with Narcos, the past few years have seen a flurry of films and books about narco-traffic. When I wrote a book about the drug war in  in 2010, it was one among few. Now, narco-traffic is on trend and clearly lucrative.Sadly, the narratives developed in those shows mean that audiences in the US and Europe understand it as a cops-and-robbers thriller, obscuring what narcos actually are: astute, ever-adapting businessmen in the legal and illicit economy, supplying products on which our society is more dependent than ever. The fight is seen as a just war against criminal organisations who are at war with us. Our good guys, their bad guys.But here＊s the problem: it＊s not true. The idea that there is some kind of line between ※us§ and ※them§, or the ※legal§ and ※illegal§ economies, is a fantasy and a lie. The world of narcos is not some exotic underworld horror show, because there is nothing underworld about the money.Ask yourself: what happens to the money? If Escobar＊s and Guzm芍n＊s is a multi-billion dollar business, where is it?Escobar and Guzm芍n could not drive around spending hundreds of billions out of the back of a truck. No, you have to bank it, and to do that, you have to find a bank willing to take your money. Escobar found the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and . Guzm芍n found Wachovia and  which have been caught and admitted laundering his money. Yet no one goes to jail.The New York Times articulated it rather well: ※Federal and state authorities have , the London-based bank, on charges of vast and prolonged money-laundering, for fear that criminal prosecution would topple the bank and, in the process, endanger the financial system.§ Without ※criminal§ money, the ※legal§ economy collapses. The man who infiltrated Escobar＊s Medellin cartel to bust BCCI for the FBI, Robert Mazur, put it thus when we met: ※The only thing that will make the banks properly vigilant to what is happening is the rattle of handcuffs in the boardroom§ 每 not just in the Narcos＊ palaces. ※It＊s simple§, said the whistleblower at Wachovia, Martin Woods: ※If you don＊t see the correlation between the money laundering by banks andpeople killed in Mexico, you＊re missing the point.§Series three of Narcos is unlikely to join those dots 每 it is, after all, a series about Colombia, not Wall Street or Canary Wharf. And even this is important: Colombia has just agreed a peace that ends , between its government and the Marxist Farc. A war entwined with Escobar＊s, and funded by Farc with narco-traffic. And yet despite the peace process, cocaine production continues to increase exponentially in Colombia. And the power and terror of yet a further generation of neo-cartels known in Colombia as ※bacrim§, . The Narcos series is infinite. 																																											"
"Directed by British-based , this modern-day masala western finds a two feisty young teenage girls and their mother fighting off a bandit army, led by the girls＊ uncle, determined to take the women＊s home by force. Via a clean blend of arthouse mannerisms and action-movie suspense, this based-on-a-true-story lesson in practical feminism reveals how the sisters learned shooting and self-defence in preparation for a day like this from their ill-fated father (Syed Tanveer Hussain). (Opening titles explain that land disputes such as this are relatively common in Pakistan and often victimise single women who have inherited property.) Lithe but steely-gazed Suhaee Abro impresses most as the eldest daughter, Nazo, who develops a cool head and the heart of a lioness, unwilling to let conventional wisdom or simply long odds defeat her. Masud pays homage to the filmmaking traditions of the region and to the many classic Hollywood films about homesteads, saloons and police precincts under siege.

"ince their acclaimed 2010 debut , production duo Dominic Maker and Kai Campos, AKA , have gradually shaken off their ※post-dubstep§ label with tunes better suited to sticky-floored indie dives than pensive, . On this third album they＊ve all but replaced their former glossy, fragmented electronica with live instrumentation, krautrock drums and vocals from James Blake, , Micachu and . As tracks quickly pivot between ragged indie rock, melodic dance music and wistful, tinkly tunes, the record feels disjointed, but a few productions stand out as some of their most inventive yet, particularly the intricate weave of synth and organic sounds on James Blake collaborations  and How We Got By.

"ow can we better help our readers discover new music, in the places they listen to new music? I was recently appointed as the Guardian＊s music editor, and this was one of the first things on my mind.Increasingly, as CD and download sales wither, we listen to music on services such as Spotify, streaming high-fidelity music directly from centralised servers; in 2016 streaming jumped by 60%, while music downloads fell by 20%. Many of us are also willing to pay for these services that collate music simply and smoothly 每 the number of people paying for  has increased from 50 million in March to more than 60 million at the time of writing.To reflect the growing popularity of streaming, this week the Guardian . Each edition of The Month＊s Best Music will contain 50 songs and straddle all genres of new music. My hope is that these playlists, which can be found on Spotify, Apple Music or Amazon Music (and hopefully more services in the future), will help readers navigate the huge number of new releases every month, and discover the music that speaks to them.Fifty songs sounds like quite a lot 每 and some readers told us this week they found it too many 每 but it is the same number included every week in one of Spotify＊s most followed playlists, New Music Friday, so to feature that many a month might actually be quite a modest aim, given the voracious appetites of many streamers.The playlist is put together by a team of people including the Guardian＊s music critics and general music nuts from across our staff and freelancers. We pool the tracks that have resonated with us each month, whittling them down to 50 of the absolute best. These will be the tracks we found most melodically satisfying, lyrically affecting, musically inventive.We have sequenced the songs so they move from one genre to another, allowing those whose tastes are more catholic to ride smoothly through the whole thing, while others can dip in and out of the styles they like. And if you want a more condensed experience, we＊ve also picked a top 10 from the list, and then written about these tracks 每 the most culturally significant and zeitgeist-y of the month.You might argue that streaming services obviate the need for intervention like this 每 why do you need Guardian journalists telling you that something is good, when you could just listen to it and decide for yourself? For a start, there＊s the issue that a lot of new music just isn＊t very good. As the music theorist Mat Dryhurst : ※Sound and music is abundant. Purpose and vision is scarce.§ While there is accounting for subjective taste, the Guardian＊s role is to champion the objective good in music: authentic emotional insight, be it in a lyric or solo or piano chord. A cheesy pop song or burst of atonal noise can share these values just as much as an earnest ballad, but millions of songs don＊t.Time-poor music lovers also need a helping hand; all this endless choice invites curation. Streaming services try to do this themselves, suggesting similar music based on your listening habits, but this doesn＊t take into account the caprices of human taste. As one reader told us: ※I struggle to find new music and detest algorithms telling me ＆If I like that I＊ll love this＊§.Spotify curates its own playlists too, of course, but we think that it＊s important for the Guardian to be a voice beyond streaming services, selecting and recommending brilliant new music free from marketing influence. Ultimately, we＊ve launched these playlists because streaming is making music far more egalitarian. Musicians are rightly fretting about how royalties from the pool of subscription money are being shared across a near-infinite number of tracks, but for listeners, the innate elitism that came with owning recorded music has vanished.A subscription of about ?120 a year is more than many people spent in the CD and download era, but for unlimited access to pretty much all pop music ever made, it＊s an incredible deal. Spotify and its peers have removed the economic barrier to musical cosmopolitanism 每 those who can＊t afford the fee can still dive over and over again into Japanese hard-bop, the collected works of Venom, or whatever else they fancy via the free versions of these services, albeit while also having to listen to advertisements.This freedom is changing the way music is being written 〞 reggaeton, for example, has broken through on a global scale thanks to the network effects of streaming, with British acts such as Little Mix now folding in a South American vibe to their songs. This freedom also means that someone in a tiny countryside hamlet can school themselves in straight-edge punk, say. We want to help tee up those discoveries.One reader wrote in response to the first playlist: ※Review and promote music that suits your readership, for gods sake. Stop recommending and promoting pop.§ But the Guardian＊s readership is becoming ever less definable in its tastes 每 and with these playlists, we aim to widen their already cosmopolitan outlook.

I make coffee 每 with an AeroPress: lots of stirring and shoving 每 and read until the rest of the house wakes up.I was a secondary school teacher when I wrote my first four novels, so I didn＊t see any reason to change the rhythm of the working day when I stopped teaching, in 1993.

"Late-night hosts on Thursday addressed Hurricane Irma and President Trump＊s decision to side with Democrats in negotiations over hurricane relief funding and the debt ceiling.※Hurricane Irma continues to grind its way through the Caribbean,§  began. ※It is the largest Atlantic storm in history, with sustained winds of up to 185mph. If you haven＊t already left, please follow the guidance of your local officials regarding evacuations. But if you are saying put, might I suggest following the storm-prep example of eccentric billionaire and guy most likely to make his own Jurassic Park in real life, Sir Richard Branson.§※The goat-headed demon-god actually owns a private island down in the Caribbean, and he rode out the storm yesterday in his wine cellar,§ Colbert continued. ※That＊s a smart move because I hear the Red Cross only has merlot.§※Good news, they＊re fine,§ the host went on, before urging people to donate towards hurricane relief. ※Many people are not. If you want to help, tune in this coming Tuesday for the Hand in Hand Harvey and Irma hurricane telethon. I＊ll be working the phones and, if it helps raise money, I＊ll also be working the pole.§Colbert then discussed the news that President Trump agreed to a deal with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to raise the debt ceiling.※I＊m going to say something a little weird now: the Democrats won something,§ he said. ※For the moment, they＊re riding high, because they got Trump to agree to their plan on the debt limit. It＊s the amount of debt America is legally allowed to carry. And if we don＊t raise it every once in a while, we default on everything. And America gets repossessed by China. And I think we all move down to Richard Branson＊s wine cellar.§Colbert continued: ※Republicans wanted to raise the debt ceiling to cover the next 18 months so the Democrats couldn＊t use it as a negotiating tool before the midterm elections. Democrats wanted to cover only three months. And of course this infuriated Republican leaders. One GOP operative put it this way: ＆He fucked us.＊§※So why did  side with the Democrats?§ Colbert asked. ※People at the meeting say he was anxious to get a deal done fast. And Trump＊s also hinted he might work with the Democrats on restoring Daca after he rescinded it.§ ※That＊s the best way to make people happy,§ the host concluded. ※First, scare the crap out of them, then tell them there＊s a way out. It＊s like one of those Saw movies in reverse.§ of Comedy Central also weighed in.※It seemed like the negotiation was a carefully choreographed ballet,§ Noah said, after airing news coverage in which it was revealed Trump was looking to strike a deal fast and cut off Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin mid-sentence before agreeing to Pelosi and Schumer＊s proposal.※Today, we learned it was a lot more like a molly seizure at Burning Man. Just so we＊re on the same page, the president of the US abandoned his party＊s legislative strategy because the words made him tired? If Donald Trump was Winston Churchill, Britain would have folded before tea-time.§Noah also poked fun at reports that  sauntered into the meeting mid-way through, which reportedly made some GOP legislators ※visibly annoyed§.※This is best meeting ever,§ Noah said. ※Major shit has gone down, everyone is confused, and then the door flies open and in walks Pretty Kramer.§※And this is not the first time this has happened either with Ivanka,§ Noah said, referencing numerous reports in which the president＊s daughter has walked into interviews or meetings midway through. ※She＊s basically that little girl from the BBC News clip that went viral.§Finally, Seth Meyers of NBC discussed Trump＊s decision to terminate Daca.※While he prepares to deal with Hurricane Irma, Trump is also dealing with the political storm of his own making: his decision to end Daca,§ Meyers began. ※Even Republicans, like House speaker Paul Ryan, had urged Trump not to terminate Daca so that Congress could come up with a solution instead.§※Paul Ryan did not want Trump to end Daca,§ Meyers reiterated. ※And it＊s not like Ryan would ever change his mind as soon as Trump chose to end Daca, right?§Meyers then showed footage of Ryan, days after appearing on a radio show and saying the program should not be terminated, saying Trump made ※the right decision.§※Paul Ryan flips so much he should be at SeaWorld,§ Meyers quipped. ※So now, Ryan, and the rest of the GOP leadership, which had previously urged Trump to hold off on ending Daca, have once again traded in their dignity and changed their minds to line up behind Trump. And instead of rewarding them for their loyalty, later Trump threw all of them under the bus by saying he might change his mind on Daca.§Meyers then read aloud the president＊s tweet, in which he says that, should Congress not come up with a legislative decision, he will ※revisit the issue.§※Trump＊s Pottery Barn rule is, if I break, Paul Ryan buys it,§ Meyers said. ※Reporters asked him yesterday if he was already regretting his decision to end Daca, but he insisted he was not.§Meyers showed a clip of a reporter asking Trump is, based on his tweet, he was having second thoughts about his decision, to which he replied, ※no second thoughts.§※Of course he doesn＊t have second thoughts,§ Meyers said. ※He doesn＊t have first thoughts.§																																											"
"The Moorish Screen inevitably calls to mind that famed  quote about art being like a good armchair where ※the businessman as well as the man of letters§ can relax.It is one of his rare depictions of women in the fashions of the day: his daughter and a favourite model, Henriette Darricarr豕re. They make a genteel pair, surrounded by the gorgeously patterned decor of a well-travelled, bourgeois, bohemian family.But if Matisse  to the violence and politics of his rival Picasso, that doesn＊t mean he wasn＊t interested in revolution. It＊s just that his upheaval was all about what you did with paint.This is an early work from his prolific Nice period, when he left a starker, more abstract style for one where the eroticism erupts in pattern as much as in flesh. It＊s typified by images of women, in harem pants or falling out of flimsy wraps. Yet they＊re also sites of experimentation, and an exercise in joy after the horrors of war.																																											"

"Grime MC Stormzy has expressed his dismay at , calling her a ※paigon§ at the GQ men of the year awards.The epithet is popular among some black Londoners and generally used to describe untrustworthy individuals; Stormzy＊s fellow  nominee J Hus had an underground hit with the scornful , for example.

"During rehearsals for , I＊ve sometimes felt that Harold Pinter was trying his hardest to disprove . The play depicts three men 每 a tramp named Davies and two brothers, Mick and Aston 每 who each in their own way seem trapped entirely in their own individual worlds. The plot is minimal: Aston brings Davies back to his junk-filled flat after the latter has been involved in a fight. They proceed to try and work out a way of living together, but any chance of connection is persistently disrupted by Aston＊s protean and unpredictable brother, Mick, who torments, deceives and bullies Davies at every opportunity.The story is absurdist, but despite having been  it also feels tragically relevant for today＊s world. Davies＊s homelessness is acutely poignant in the context of the. And it is impossible, in the current climate, to tell any story about the search for a home without feeling aware of the shadow cast by the burnt husk of .What is most pertinent, though, is the fact that time and again in the play, Davies＊s status as an outsider is reinforced by the hostility he encounters from Mick. This has striking resonance in a world where we see a virulent and xenophobic nationalism arising in response to a global refugee crisis and the perceived challenges of mass migration. And what makes this issue feel particularly alive in our rehearsal room is the fact that the actor playing Davies, Patrice Naiambana, is himself a migrant to the UK. Patrice originally came to this country from Sierra Leone and, having lived in a number of different countries throughout his life, has an acute sense of his position within the UK as that of ※an outsider looking in§.When you read the script through the prism of a migrant＊s experience, it suddenly brings all sorts of things in the play to life. Early in the story, Davies admits that he has been going under the assumed name of ※Bernard Jenkins§, and when asked where he was born he quickly becomes defensive. It would be easy to assume from this that the character is just an inveterate liar. But is it actually a sign of a much deeper identity crisis? Perhaps, in his desperation to fit in and to be accepted, he has had to construct an entirely new version of himself. In this context, his evasiveness about his origins becomes a survival mechanism in a hostile world. On numerous occasions during the play, Davies tells us that his ※papers§ are in Sidcup 每 he says he left them there 15 years ago and has not yet got around to getting them back. On the surface, this might seem to be evidence of an epic capacity for procrastination. But perhaps he is actually avoiding going to get them because he worries that they are no longer there. As a migrant or an asylum seeker, the question of whether or not you have the correct papers can be the difference between being able to start a brand new life and being forcibly returned to an existence you have tried desperately to escape.Clearly when Pinter wrote the play, he hadn＊t intended for the part to played as an African migrant. But I do wonder whether he had imagined Davies to be an Irish or, given his own background, Jewish immigrant. After all, both groups of people have long been the victims of prejudice and discrimination in this country 每 and a desire to assimilate would fit with much of Davies＊s behaviour.What makes The Caretaker so remarkable is the fact that, decades after it was first written, it remains so elastic and open to new interpretation. Whether or not Pinter intended Davies to be played in this way, it works because, through the character, the play identifies something profound and universal about the human condition. Davies＊s anxieties might have their roots in the hidden aspects of his past, but his loneliness and fear of isolation is something we can all recognise.																																											"

"＊s first single as Coldcut 每 the 1987 white label Say Kids What Time Is It? 每 was one of the earliest records to be entirely made up of samples. They celebrate 30 years since its release 每 three decades that have been filled with groundbreaking remixes, productions, DJ sets, club nights and occasional forays into the charts 每 with a new and doubtless thrilling audiovisual show.Of all the current crop of British MCs,  feels the most idiosyncratic. His debut album, , was restrained, lyrically downbeat, big on mournful piano and jazz guitar, suffused with a very British kind of melancholy, and came furnished with a spoken-word endorsement from his mum (※He was and is a complete joy,§ she proudly offered). He＊s a genuinely unique talent, and this tour contains his biggest show to date, at London＊s Brixton Academy.The Barbican＊s season of New York movies has a distinctly musical slant. It opens with a triple bill of rarely seen films about the 70s punk scene, including Amos Poe＊s legendary 1976 document Blank Generation, and takes in everything from 80s hip-hop drama  (30 Sept) to Smithereens, Susan Seidelman＊s feature film set in and around the downtown music scene and starring Richard Hell (30 Sept), and Seidelman＊s later Desperately Seeking Susan (1 Oct), one of the few films starring Madonna that can be safely viewed without losing the will to live.The exemplary series of box sets charting the course of Bowie＊s career reaches its third volume and the , The 11 CDs or 13 albums include Low, ※Heroes§, the double live set Stage, Scary Monsters and a compilation of non-album tracks including Bowie singing Brecht from the Baal EP.

Next, presumably, Bowie＊s 80s: gulp!Another intriguing career turn from mainstream pop＊s most off-message figure, after 2015＊s psychedelic . That featured the Flaming Lips, a song called Milky Milky Milk and a cover photo of an impossibly stoned-looking Cyrus smearing her face with glitter: this, however is heralded as a return not to the electropop of  but to her country roots and a more conservative image, apparently inspired by the election of Donald Trump.Richmond, Virginia＊s Spacebomb has succeeded in carving out its own musical niche.

It＊s a strategy that＊s produced only minor hits thus far, but you never know.Since her last, eponymous album in 2014,  has become infinitely more famous, a state of affairs that has less to do with her music than her private life: you can＊t date one of the world＊s most famous supermodels without the tabloids taking a prurient interest. Her fifth album should redress the balance: she is, after all, one of the most consistently fascinating singer-songwriters around, and the tracks released thus far from Masseduction 每 electro-fuelled and ※all about sex and drugs and sadness§ according to its author 每 suggest no slip in quality. Attempting to singlehandedly start a mod revival at the height of punk should have been a foolhardy and doomed undertaking: incredibly, Paul Weller pulled it off, as documented by this lavish five-disc box set, clearly aimed at the middle-aged feather-cut Christmas market. It explores The Jam＊s oft-overlooked early years in depth, collecting their debut In the City and its wobbly, undercooked follow-up This Is the Modern World alongside umpteen demos, live performances and TV appearances. Rapper Stormzy recently caused baffled consternation by referring to Theresa May as a ※§. Had people been paying attention to the oeuvre of his sometime collaborator , they would have been familiar with the term thanks to his 2015 track Dem Boy Paigon. Since then, his star has risen considerably. This year, his intriguing blend of hard-hitting grime MCing and music influenced by Afrobeat and bashment has resulted in a top ten album and single: a brief tour rounds the year off. On paper, a feature-length documentary about an  doesn＊t sound like the most fascinating cinematic experience imaginable. But Avicii is clearly a more complex and troubled character than his DayGlo music suggests.

True Stories promises to be ※a cautionary tale that explores the taxing nature and intensity of fame.§The announcement of the ＊s seventh album, Luciferian Towers, came complete with a list of demands, among them ※the total dismantling of the prison-industrial complex§ and ※the expert fuckers who broke this world never get to speak again§.

Live, however, he＊s a potent presence: funny and compelling in equal measure.You would have a hard time arguing that  Goldie has led an insufficiently incident-packed life to warrant an autobiography: from a childhood spent in care homes to international celebrity, All Things Remembered promises ※an explosive story of abuse, revenge, graffiti, gold teeth, sawn-off shotguns, car crashes, hot yoga and redemption through reality TV§.＊s journey from something approaching an outsider artist turning his turbulent life story into shaky, harrowing, lo-fi music to something approaching mainstream success 每 his music now turns up in adverts, he models for fashion magazines 每 is a fascinating one. This year＊s album  proved a career highlight and one of 2017＊s best: a less straightforward pop album than it first appears, where lyrical strangeness exists alongside melodic richness and sonic ugliness disrupts the spectral beauty.  currently finds herself in a unique position. There aren＊t many uncompromising, comics-obsessed intersectional feminist female rappers apparently poised for commercial success, but the music on her mixtape 1992 每 recently reissued by Rough Trade with a plethora of new tracks attached 每 is good enough to snare a wider audience and her rhymes are smart and sharp and funny. These shows may well represent the last chance audiences get to see her in smaller venues. It says something about how  Shabazz Palaces＊ earlier oeuvre was that a pair of interlinked concept albums about an alien called Quaraz very much represented their most approachable work to date. But amid the sonic experiments and incomprehensible storyline, the Quaraz albums offered moments of unexpected directness 每 gorgeous melodies, snappy, relatable lyrics 每 without ever surrendering the duo＊s uniqueness: they remain like nothing else in hip-hop. Run the Jewels＊ Pyramid stage performance was . The duo came on stage immediately after ＊s rapturously received speech and were scarcely less triumphant, the potency of their music and their ability to switch their set＊s mood from rage to humour to poignancy and back again fully in evidence: proof, should it be needed, of what a great live act Killer Mike and El-P have become. H邦sker D邦 are one of 80s alt-rock＊s great lost, pioneering bands: others, including Pixies and Nirvana, made far greater commercial capital from harnessing hardcore＊s rage and noise to pop melodies, but H邦sker D邦 did it first. Their back catalogue has long been in a state of , never treated with the care and attention it deserves, until now: this exhaustive box set from Numero Group, chronicling their raw, warp-speed early years, is a treat and revelation. Taylor Swift＊s sixth studio album is by some considerable distance the biggest pop release of the autumn, guaranteed to provoke an infinite number of think pieces. If the two  are anything to go by, Reputation sees a shift away from 1989＊s Springsteen-ish AOR towards a more electronic sound and lyrically continues her habit of opaquely referencing her umpteen feuds and gossip surrounding her private life: it remains to be seen if every song is a kind of millennial You＊re So Vain.Multi-instrumentalist  has played with everyone from Suicidal Tendencies to Erykah Badu, but it was his work on Kendrick Lamar＊s To Pimp a Butterfly that really catapulted him into the spotlight, winning him a Grammy.

Live, he＊s as off-kilter as you might expect.The announcement of Morrissey＊s first new album since 2014＊s  brings with it the usual mix of excitement and apprehension. A return to peak form or more fair-to-middling? Will the lyrics reflect his passion for Brexit, love of Nigel Farage and belief that Sadiq Khan ※talks so quickly that people can＊t understand him§? How long until his much-trumpeted new record deal collapses amid blood-curdling acrimony? We shall see. Riding high again after the critical and commercial success of their  revisiting 1987＊s The Joshua Tree, U2 finally unveil the much-delayed companion piece to 2014＊s much-derided , its original incarnation scrapped following the election of Donald Trump, and new songs recorded live in the studio with producer Steve Lillywhite. Whether it＊s enough to quell the band＊s evident fear that they＊re seen as a heritage act in the wake of the Joshua Tree tour is an intriguing question. Held at seven venues across London, this festival provides an intriguing reminder that Korea＊s music scene stretches far beyond K-pop and Gangnam Style.

"hatever may be thought of Angelina Jolie and the  way she auditioned young people for this particular film 每 a Netflix production which airs later this month 每 she has created an accomplished piece of work which is possessed of a genuine artistry. It is something to compare to the films of Vietnamese director , especially the dreamily sensual epiphanies of The Scent Of Green Papaya (1993) and At The Height Of Summer (2000).The action is set in , a country with which Jolie famously has a personal connection; her 16-year-old adopted Cambodian son Maddox is credited as an executive producer. Jolie has adapted the 2000 memoir by Cambodian author Loung Ung, about growing up in the mid-to-late 70s at the time of the Khmer Rouge＊s campaign of violence, which wiped out one quarter of the country＊s population.Newcomer Sareum Srey Moch plays Loung, a little girl whose father is a policeman under the old US-backed regime. When the Khmer Rouge arrive in revolutionary triumph, her terrified parents (played by Phoeung Kompheak and Sveng Socheata) realise that they must efface any hint that they were once the hirelings of a government for which the newcomers have .The father must pretend that he is just a manual labourer when the zealots come round looking for people to kill or throw into ※re-education camps§; he must forget that he ever spoke French, the language of the oppressor, despite KR soldiers jeeringly speaking to him in French, trying to get him to crack. The family are brusquely taken away and set to back-breaking physical work on an agricultural collective. But the point is not to grow food; it is to feel ashamed and afraid, and to reinforce the new rulers＊ theatre of cruelty and power. The children are always hungry; there is a hair-raising scene when a horribly big spider is caught, cooked and eaten. With cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, Jolie contrives some eerily beautiful overhead shots showing their ideological fear farm from above: the people working there do indeed look like insects. When Loung＊s sister dies, her mother is allowed no more than a few seconds to weep, then she must continue to work. Loung＊s other sibling explains to her the idea of reincarnation: the dead person stays intensely asleep for three days, then realises she is dead, goes to the river and then prepares to return. Loung replies grimly that she hopes her sister does not return 每 to this. Finally, they are told by their mother that they must run away.Jolie frames the action with a political context which places the blame not merely with Pol Pot but with Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger and their unofficial bombing campaigns against a neutral country. In Cambodia, the US government really did find a way to prove their ※domino§ theory: the grotesque violence caused pain, anguish, rage and Khmer Rouge popularity in a chain of consequence, factors which toppled against each other like dominoes. Yet the film＊s real ferocity is saved for the ideologues of terror.The woozy visual stillness, with which Loung had originally registered the sheer strangeness of their Maoist new life in the country, is now no longer in evidence. There is just hardship and pain. The film＊s final scenes, showing the actual figures themselves as grown adults, gesture at healing, closure and forgiveness. But it is very hard to forget the horror of what has gone before.																																											"
"n case the  每 I hesitate to say ※resolution§ 每 of  has left a hole in your life the approximate shape and size of David Lynch＊s soft-serve quiff, the DVD release of (Thunderbird, 15) could not have been more cannily timed. Ostensibly a documentary about the aberrant auteur＊s creative process, Jon Nguyen＊s film is nothing so prosaic. Instead, it＊s a wayward, stream-of-consciousness tour of a mind that knows no process, as related and embellished by the man himself, drolly revelling in formative anecdotes and dream fragments. Lynch＊s ventures into fine art, as opposed to film, are the springboard for these musings, but it＊s all of a piece,?betraying the same fascinating, febrile imagination; it＊s an internal portrait almost as eerily riveting as a Lynch original.Keep the subtle shiver going with Mubi.com＊s latest hand-picked exclusive: , a blurred-at-the-edges documentary from Venezuela. The title alludes to a pervasive sense of isolation in the country＊s crumbling social fringes; it＊s also the name of a ruined, rambling Caracas mansion owned by the family of director Jorge Thielen Armand, now inhabited by a pinched working-class family who won＊t be able to stay much longer. In a peculiar way, this is a study of economic downturn as ghost story: there＊s a strange, delicate twinge of the supernatural in its folds, but the colonial house is really haunted by memories of previous, more affluent residents, of generations and possibilities that no longer exist for their inheritors.(EIV, 15) is a high-concept curiosity worth seeking out simply for the brazen what-if extremes of its premise; teasing out the success or otherwise of its execution is part of the fun. Anne Hathaway is the errant, alcoholic writer who somehow 每 deep breath here 每 ascertains that her daily actions and errors are puppeteering the apocalyptic rampage of a Godzilla-type beast on the other side of the globe; what ensues is a woolly, genuinely anomalous fusion of brash monster movie and therapy drama, crying out for attention and analysis. Demanding merely the former, and hardly earning it, is (Fox, 15), a gunky, shrieky mom-com (right) that somehow already feels years old. Goldie Hawn＊s long-missed, still sparky timing gives it a handful of redeeming points; shame she＊s mostly cast as the straight woman to onscreen daughter Amy Schumer, whose usual straight-shooter act isn＊t given any good punchlines to fire.The last days of summer feel like the right moment to face the sharp, parched comic truths of Greek director Argyris Papadimitropoulos＊s debut  (Eureka, 18). A deeply discomfiting portrait of schlubby male midlife crisis in the face of oppressive island-holiday beauty, it sees the masculine ego elevated, taunted and tattered with ruthless, recognisable specificity. The cycles of insecurity, denial and release for older women, meanwhile, are negotiated with classic French elan in  (Curzon Artificial Eye, 12), a slight framework for two strong Catherines 每 Deneuve and Frot 每 to act their guts out.Finally, either a warning, or a clarion call for connoisseurs of catastrophe: Sean Penn＊s (Lionsgate, 15), practically placed in cinematic quarantine after last year＊s , has slipped straight to DVD. It is, and I don＊t wish to put too fine a point on this, one of the worst films ever made: a gaseously pompous white-saviour romance set in darkest war-torn Africa, where children are dying to the musical accompaniment of the Red Hot Chili Peppers while Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem fight out the bigger problem of their tempestuous attraction. ※She＊s leaking urine, but she＊s still dancing!§ one side player immortally observes of an abused African martyr; the same might be said of this perversely unforgettable film.

"here is a scene in the first 20 minutes of Jairus McLeary and Gethin Aldous＊s observational documentary  where a grown man cries. It＊s no ordinary cry; this is a full-body sob; a keening wail bottled up for literally years; the desperate, feral cry of someone in unimaginable pain. He wants to feel what it＊s like to mourn for his sister. ※Take me with you,§ says one of the man＊s colleagues when he bites his lip, trying not to surrender to the tears. ※I＊m not going anywhere.§ And so they come, in floods. Watching this scene is a visceral experience. Some moments are unbearable to watch; others are utter catharsis.At Folsom state prison, a medium security institution in California, inmates and members of the public come together twice a year for an intensive four-day group therapy session. Bartenders, museum associates and teaching assistants sit with former members of gangs and cults, and scary-looking guys who used to belong to the . All must leave their preconceptions at the door to deal with daddy issues, addiction, grief, depression and suicidal thoughts. The breakthroughs come in waves; there＊s no third-act climax or big reveal, just a steady stream of broken people struggling to summon the strength to put themselves back together. ※Right down next to where we hurt the most is our medicine,§ says one of the group＊s facilitators, explaining that vulnerability is the key to healing. Sceptics may enter Folsom with suspicion, but these are extraordinary scenes, so shocking and dynamic they might be mistaken for exorcisms. Whether you buy into the techniques on display or not, it＊s a privilege to witness these men take themselves, and one another, ※over the edge§.																																											"
"South Park returns on Wednesday night for its 21st season, and the celebrated Comedy Central series, which has long  of those on both the left and the right, will take on white supremacists in its season premiere.In the wake of the events in Charlottesville last month, where a counter-protester was murdered at a white nationalist demonstration, the show＊s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have decided to use the animated series to comment on a fraught political climate. A short promotional clip from the episode, called White People Renovating Houses, shows a rally consisting of white people holding Confederate flags and chanting ※you will not replace us§ 每 one of the slogans chanted by white supremacists in Virginia.※Protesters armed with tiki torches and Confederate flags take to the streets of ,§ the episode description reads, adding that the character Randy Marsh will [come] to grips with what it means to be white in today＊s society§.Another scene in the 15-second clip released by  Central ahead of the premiere shows Randy Marsh pleading with a judge to get the protesters to ※stop waving the Confederate flag every chance they get§.In an interview with ABC News last month, Parker and Stone said they had planned to have the new season steer clear of political satire, but the first episode of season 21 shows they can＊t stay away for too long. ※They＊re already going out and doing the comedy,§ Parker said of contemporary politics. ※It＊s not something you can make fun of.§Stone added: ※It＊s really tricky now as satire has become reality. We were really trying to make fun of what was going on [last season] but we couldn＊t keep up. What was actually happening was way funnier than anything we could come up with.

"he thick black curls that helped make  look so manic in all those 1980s comedies, and which he then tore at as a tormented Bruce Wayne in , are long gone; but the satyr-like eyes are unchanged. As he walks into a London hotel room on a grey Saturday morning, holding a cup of coffee, he looks strikingly different from the man I have spent four decades watching on screen: he has the trim, spry build of a wiry woodsman rather than a 66-year-old actor, thanks to half a lifetime spent in rural Montana, fishing and hunting. His walk is reminiscent of a rooster＊s strut, with his chest puffed out and a bounce on his toes; that swagger we saw in , for which Keaton won a Golden Globe as the eponymous former superhero actor, was not a put on, it turns out.※Hadley, huh? My niece is called Hadley,§ he says, shaking my hand, and embarks on a winding digression about Ernest Hemingway, whose first wife was called Hadley, and various Hemingway descendants whom Keaton has met over the years, and do I know them (I do not), and how I really ought to meet them. So was his niece named after Hadley Hemingway, I manage to ask.※Huh? Oh no, I just think her mom liked the name,§ he says, and he＊s off again, talking about everything from whether or not he＊s a liberal (he is, mostly) to why climate change shouldn＊t be politicised. Keaton is not a straight Q&A kind of guy; his approach to conversation is a little like his eyebrows, looping in memorable and unexpected directions.He has made a career out of taking the unpredictable route: you can never guess his next role, and then he never plays it the way you＊d expect. In his breakthrough movie, , Keaton played a stay-at-home father at a time when such a concept was almost unheard of, and he played him as a man who has no idea how to do any of the stereotypically masculine jobs around the house; when asked if he＊s rewiring the house with 220 volts, Keaton adlibbed, ※220, 221, whatever it takes§. He was the dazzlingly frenetic lead in Tim Burton＊s , a largely improvised performance opposite fellow ghosts Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. With Burton again, he played Batman as a conflicted nerd, rather than a grinning muscle man. In Birdman, he plays an actor so neurotic, he ends up running through Manhattan in his underwear.He surprises me today by arriving with a big grin, which is unexpected in a man who has never made any secret of his dislike of interviews: you don＊t move to the middle of Montana at the peak of your celebrity if you enjoy being the centre of attention. But he is clearly having a ball on this, the second wave of his career. Since Birdman, he has played the editor of the Boston Globe＊s investigative journalism team in the , which won a Best Picture Oscar; and he was a curveball choice as Ray Kroc, the man who turned McDonald＊s into a franchise, in 2016＊s too-little-seen .※It＊s all fun, man,§ Keaton says, ※and at a point when you don＊t have anything to prove? Yeah. We＊re all here for a millisecond, so how bad can this be?§ he says, his drawn-out vowels (※maaan§, ※baaad§) revealing his Pittsburgh origins. This month, he plays a CIA special ops trainer, Stan Hurley, in the Bourne-esque . Hurley is training up a new damaged-but-brilliant recruit (Dylan O＊Brien), who wants to kill Middle Eastern terrorists after they killed his girlfriend. Keaton＊s crazy eyebrows are put to good use as the on-the-edge mentor, but it is a somewhat baffling choice for him: the movie is undeniably generic for an actor who has always eschewed straightforward genre. But maybe this is just another of Keaton＊s surprises?※Yeah, exactly, and not to be cute or ＆cheeky＊, as they say§ 每 he switches mercifully briefly into an appalling English accent 每 ※but that＊s what keeps me interested. My boredom level is fairly low. And that＊s too bad, but that＊s the way it is, and this genre, a committed action thriller movie, was just different for me. A change.§I don＊t get the impression it＊s a change he＊ll necessarily repeat. When I mention one particularly intense scene, he shrugs: ※I think I＊m OK in it. I＊d like another shot at it, but the director wanted to turn the volume up. You have to ask yourself, ＆OK, what kind of movie is this? It＊s an action movie. OK.＊ You have to buy into the programme.§After becoming known for his hyper-comedic performances in the early 80s, Keaton switched to dramatic roles 每 first as a recovering drug addict in  (a flop) and then as Batman (one of the biggest box office hits of its day). In the space of five years, he went from total unknown to household name. He also got married, to actor , and had a son, Sean. Can he even remember any of that presumably pretty overwhelming decade?※Not really, no, and that＊s a good way of putting it: married, house, kid right away, career, a lot of attention, which is not something I＊m crazy about. I don＊t hate it, but it＊s never my first choice. It was mostly good,§ he says. He and McWilliams divorced in 1990.Keaton＊s Batman completely changed the way superheroes were portrayed in Hollywood movies, coining the reluctant, self-loathing alter ego that is still de rigueur 30 years later (,  almost all of ). But he was a controversial choice and fans bombarded the Warner Bros studio with furious letters, insisting Keaton was too weird and weedy, not understanding that this was exactly why Burton cast him: ※He＊s got all that wild energy in his eyes, which would compel him to put on a bat-suit... He does it because he needs to, because he＊s not this gigantic strapping macho man,§ Burton later said. and, meeting Keaton, it is obvious why the two men feel such an affinity (they are currently working together again, on ). Although Keaton isn＊t as outwardly eccentric, he has a similar tendency towards unmediated stream-of-consciousness responses, and blunt plain-speaking 每 both the opposite of slick Hollywood schmooze. It must have been particularly hard for them, facing so much scrutiny during Batman, but Keaton insists he wasn＊t aware of it 每 or not until he happened to pick up the business section of a newspaper and saw a cartoon of his face in an article suggesting that he, personally, would damage Warner Bros＊ stock. ※I truly didn＊t understand why people cared one way or another, and I can＊t believe people still care. I just thought, ＆I know what I＊m doing, and I could be wrong, but in terms of what Tim and I discussed for the movie, I knew we were right on,＊§ he says now.And they were: Burton＊s first Batman film remains one of the most interesting big-budget movies ever made, with Keaton＊s psychologically subtle performance a major part of that. But unlike Riggan, the  character who becomes obsessed by his superhero alter ego, Keaton walked away, refusing to make Batman 3 when Burton wasn＊t rehired as director. Was he also just sick of the bat-suit by then?※[The film] just wasn＊t any good, man. I tried to be patient, but after a certain point, I was like, I can＊t take this any more, this is going to be horrible. But, look, there was some really horrible taste in the 90s, and I probably contributed to that, unfortunately. It was a time of nouveau riche excess 每 everyone was known for their jets and their stuff. And I thought, I＊m in this job for the long run, I don＊t want . And the truth is, I＊m not boasting, but I was correct. There are a whole load of people who ran things that are long gone.§Joel Schumacher＊s two Batman movies were notoriously terrible, starring first  and then . A few years later, Keaton had a cameo as a detective in Steven Soderbergh＊s  with Clooney. Did they swap bat tales?※ didn＊t,§ he says, ※but he used to shout at me, ＆Hey, the brotherhood!＊ And I＊d go, ＆Hey!＊ But I had no idea what he meant. Swear to God! And he did it a bunch of times: ＆Brotherhood!＊ And then someone explained it to me and I was like, ＆Ohhhhh!＊ I mean, I think I＊d forgotten he was in [Batman].§After Batman, Keaton took a series of notably unstarry roles 每 a tenant from hell opposite Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine in , a hammy Dogberry in Kenneth Branagh＊s . There was a run of comedies, including Harold Ramis＊ , in which he played a man who clones himself, that were smart and funny, but never going to set the world on fire. Was he deliberately trying to get out of the shadow of the bat signal, or did he just like the scripts?※It was both,§ he says. ※I do what interests me.§So he would never do anything just for the money?※Look, it＊s not like I don＊t think about the business 每 I am cognisant of that side of things 每 but if you overthink the money part, you tend to mess it up. I actually thought [Birdman] might not work, but I also thought, even if it doesn＊t work, I want to be a part of this kind of creativity. I want to be around this. It＊s like making movies with Tim [Burton],§ he says, those eyebrows rising in various directions. ※Being around that is so much fun, you just want to be in that environment.§After Out Of Sight, he pretty much disappeared for next 16 years. What happened?※Look, there＊s two different things here,§ he says, leaning forward and tapping my knee, emphasising his points in a manner that feels more paternal than creepy. ※There＊s me taking a pause: I really like life, doing things, having a normal life. So there was that. And there was me getting bored, hearing the sound of my voice, seeing the same old tricks. So I may have lost interest, combined with a whole lot of people not knocking on my door. It wasn＊t just me. But I also consciously started to slowly change things internally, and it worked.§What does he mean by changing things internally? Dealing with the mental side of things?※Yeah, yeah. Just thinking about things, asking what you want, what you don＊t want, how am I going to get to there? And it takes a lot of stumbling around, and it takes discipline.§He spent those years hanging out in Montana, hunting with neighbours and walking in the woods. His family visited him, and there have been girlfriends (he is in a relationship now, but it＊s the one subject he refuses to discuss), but in the main he was on his own. It＊s the life, he says, that he dreamed of as a little boy.***Michael Keaton grew up just outside Pittsburgh, and his real name was and remains Michael Douglas; by the time he started acting,  had got there first. Did he ever tell him that he stole his name? Keaton literally spits out his coffee with laughter. ※Kinda! Once we got something mixed in the mail, something from one of the [acting] unions, and I had to return it to him and we talked about it then. He＊s a really nice guy, Michael, but it＊s not even their name, I think?§No, Kirk changed it from Danielovitch, I say.※Russian Jews, right? It＊s funny.§Keaton was the youngest of seven children in a working-class family, and they never went to the cinema because it was too expensive to buy tickets for all the kids. But he loved to watch old movies on TV, especially ones starring James Cagney and John Garfield. Was he drawn to acting because he was used to having an audience of siblings?※Probably. I was talking about this with  the other day on the Dumbo set, actually, because he＊s another youngest, and we youngests always relate to one another. You also get away with more, because by that point your parents are like, ＆Who＊s that again? Oh, yeah, he＊s cute, he＊s been around a while.＊§He describes himself as a ※weird§ kid, but then corrects himself: ※I mean, I don＊t think I was weird. I＊d be happy having me as a kid. I was a kid who liked adventure stories, who fantasised too much, who was extremely physically active. I had friends at school, but I wasn＊t really social. I didn＊t really like sleepovers 每 I liked sleeping outside.§This gets him thinking about his son, Sean, now 34, when he was a boy. ※He was just a really social little guy, so thoughtful and sensitive and practical, and always hanging out with friends, whereas I wanted to be on my own playing in the woods,§ he says, his voice softening.Presumably that＊s because he had to fight for space, whereas Sean was an only child and happy to fill the house with friends?※Yeah, probably. He was always hanging out in groups and going to someone＊s house, I remember that,§ he says.After he and Sean＊s mother divorced, Keaton moved to Montana. He dated , and , but never married again. I ask if it was strange having an only child when he grew up in such a big family.※Not strange, exactly. I wished I＊d had more, but then Sean told me he liked being an only child,§ he smiles. is now a Grammy award-nominated songwriter who has worked with Madonna and Demi Lovato, and who is routinely referred to as ※Michael Keaton＊s hot son§. The two are often each other＊s dates to award ceremonies: Sean came to the Golden Globes when his dad won for Birdman, and Keaton tearfully thanked him, calling him his ※best friend§. When Keaton was last year added to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Sean gave the speech: ※I＊ve seen everything from Batman to bath time when I was a young kid. I＊m so proud to be your son. You＊re my hero, my best friend and I love you so much.§ Keaton, standing behind his son and moving excitedly from side to side, pinked with delight.Initially, Keaton thought about going into comedy rather than acting, and you can still find some of . The most striking thing about them is how little he has changed: on stage, he comes across as a nervy, neurotic fast-talker given to flights of surrealism. In one routine, he talks about how just a look from a stranger on the streets of New York can send him into therapy; in another, he imagines what it would be like if the cartoon strips that used to come with gum packets explored philosophical concepts. ※My mom＊s side of the family and my brothers and sisters are really funny 每 that＊s the Irish Catholic side. My father＊s side, the Scottish Protestant side? Not so much,§ he says.I tell him I always thought it was a shame he didn＊t do more John Hughes comedies after Mr Mom. Keaton reels back in his chair, hands over his face. ※Aw, man!  每 that＊s the movie I really wish I＊d been in!§ he says, citing the 1987 John Hughes classic starring John Candy and Steve Martin. ※Do you remember when people would write off John Hughes and those movies he made?§Actually, I say, .※?§ he cries, bouncing out of his seat. A publicist comes in to tell us our time is up, but he waves her away. ※Wait a minute, she＊s really smart and I need to talk to her about this,§ he says pointing at me, although I suspect this is more about John Hughes than my intellect. ※I mean, if you look at the specificity of John Hughes＊ direction in those movies, it＊s incredible,§ he continues. ※These weren＊t just cute little movies; these were about the economy, employment, unemployment, small towns. Man, you got me going on this!§We spend 10 minutes nerding out over , before he thinks back to when he met Hughes while making Mr Mom: ※I read the script and I thought, ＆Wow, this is really funny, this guy has something.＊ And then I met John and I said, ＆You ought to direct this [too].＊ But he said no, he was off to direct those movies starring people closer to your age,§ he says, referring to the teen movies, which is sweet, because I am in my late 30s. ※But, yeah, I would have loved to have worked with him.  would have been an experience.§Michael Keaton,  fan?

" few years ago I wrote , about the predilection of publications like , the  and  for authors under the age of 40. The problem hasn＊t gone away and on Tuesday I wrote an open letter to the Royal Society of Literature, .Encouraging young writers is laudable. After all, it＊s increasingly difficult to get started. Publishers＊ advances are low and getting lower; arts degrees are more expensive than Stem subjects; social security is fiercely tested. Which must mean that those most able to pay for a writing course, or those most able to take time off work to write while still young, are those most likely to have money, security, contacts, confidence. There＊s a correlation between setting an age bar and encouraging the already privileged.All writers were young once, and many start writing young, but not all begin their careers as published authors at that point. Leaving aside the fact that some only decide to start writing later in life, many factors affect one＊s ability to commit to writing seriously. Besides income issues, age bars can lead an organisation into worrying territory. Authors from outside the perceived cultural mainstream who do not already see their voices represented 每 LGBTQ writers, writers of colour 每 are sometimes slow to recognise the contribution they can make, or to feel like their voices will be valued. Age is a feminist issue. Carers, delayed by years looking after children or other dependents, are mostly women; residencies that offer no childcare or require long stays are an easy way to sift female candidates out of contention. Older women are already told every day, in ways ranging from the subtle to the blatant, that they are irrelevant and should shut up. Multiply this by, say, race or gender, and the courage required to put work out is even greater. Or the potential writer might not be the carer, but the cared-for. Writers who live with a disability or ill-health may not start out until they have found a way to write with their condition 每 which may take longer than this 40-years-old rule allows for.Since writing to the RSL, I＊ve been sent heartrending accounts from well-published writers, several of whom specified that it wasn＊t until their late 30s that they were finally able to take the time to write, making age bar of 40 not only arbitrary, but a particularly cruel irony. Some writers ※emerge§ despite challenges, and they should be celebrated 每 but it is unreasonable to put arbitrary barriers in the way of less privileged applicants and expect them to perform better than those more advantaged.The EU Employment Equality Framework Directive establishes general guidelines for fair treatment. It ※aims to protect everyone in the EU from discrimination based on age, disability, sexual orientation and religion or belief in the workplace§. Writers, , rely on awards and residencies as income as well as validation. Age-based criteria work against the spirit, if not the letter, of this directive.Over-40s are barred from many prizes already. Despite the Royal Society＊s good intentions to increase the narrow age range of their fellows, an arbitrary cut-off point contributes to an atmosphere of exclusion, something the Turner prize realised when. The intersections of ageism for the young and old are complex and could be better addressed via a variety of initiatives, which could include proper research combined with outreach. Disadvantaged young writers need support and development; not a cutoff point at precisely the age many of them finally reach publication.Rereading my original piece about ageism, I feel I could have written more forcefully. But I was a ※new§ writer and I lacked the confidence that has since come with the validation I＊ve gained, partly through being awarded residencies, the occasional grant and even one prize. I no longer need to be so polite. I am angry. Make no mistake: if you run a prize, a ※best of§ list, a residency, with age guidelines you can＊t fully justify then, however otherwise diverse your awardees, you and your organisation are consolidating racism, sexism, class and gender discrimination. I know you don＊t want that. The good news is that it＊s so easy to replace the word ※young§ with ※new§. If you run a prize or scheme, be a hero: with just one word changed, a whole wall disappears.

L?hns explores the Violin Sonata with a cello-like grace, and the 16-minute Bol谷ro is a tour de force of rhythm-layering minimalism compounded by Sheppard＊s improv with a sax-and-brass quartet.

"ome things were familiar 每 the round concrete space of  is not far off the size and shape of the Royal Albert Hall＊s Arena, and the audience stood or sat in the middle 每 but this late-night programme, put together by Radio 3＊s Open Ear, was not your regular Prom. It was right at home in a gallery space: you could argue that the five works were all art installations in which the concept was equally or more important than the sound.One work had been created with this specific space and occasion in mind. ＊s Prisma Interius V even tried to give the building itself a voice: a synthesiser on one side of the performing space processed ambient sounds gleaned from a microphone placed on a high balcony outside the Tate Modern.

"Martin Shkreli, the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals who last month was convicted of two counts of securities fraud, has listed the sole existing copy of the Wu-Tang Clan＊s album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin on .Two years ago, Shkreli was revealed as the winner of an auction for the album, released in the form of a single CD. His winning bid was $2m. On Tuesday night, he put the album back up for auction on Ebay for $1; as of late Wednesday morning, the highest bid was $100,000. Shkreli, who earned the nickname ※pharma bro§ by jacking up prices for life-saving HIV/Aids medication and routinely making crass, sexist statements in the media, wrote on the eBay listing that he would donate half the proceeds of the album＊s sale to medical research. ※I decided to purchase this album as a gift to the  for their tremendous musical output,§ Shkreli wrote. ※Instead I received scorn from at least one of their (least-intelligent) members, and the world at large failed to see my purpose of putting a serious value behind music. I will be curious to see if the world values music nearly as much as I have. I have donated to many rock bands and rappers over the years to ensure they can continue to produce their art when few others would.§Shkreli once promised to release the album if Donald Trump won the presidency. But ultimately, Shkreli . Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, a double album which was recorded over six years in secret, remains the most expensive album ever sold.

On top of the two convictions for securities fraud, the 34-year-old Shkreli was also convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud.※At any time I may cancel this sale and I may even break this album in frustration,§ he wrote on the eBay listing. ※I will donate half of the sale proceeds to medical research.

"The glory days of the Hungarian cinema from the mid-1960s to the mid-70s came about mainly because of the relative liberalisation of the communist regime under the Soviet loyalist J芍nos K芍d芍r. K芍roly Makk, who has died aged 91, was among leading Hungarian directors such as , , ,  and  whose films were beginning to be shown and acclaimed more and more in the west.Because of problems with censorship under the previous, Stalinist puppet regime, Makk, who had been making films since 1955, had to wait until 1971 to gain international recognition with . ※I asked every year for six years for permission to make it. The political elite finally gave in because it was part of a rejection of the Stalin years.§Love tells the story of Luca (Mari T?r?csik), a young Hungarian woman whose husband is in jail after being arrested by Stalin＊s secret police on a trumped up political charge. Left to take care of her old and dying mother-in-law (the celebrated stage actor Lili Darvas), she writes letters purporting to come from America telling of the son＊s glittering success as a Hollywood film producer and reads them to the old lady. Whether the mother-in-law believes the letters is left deliberately ambiguous, as is the truth of her extravagant memories of a Viennese girlhood.An exquisitely wrought film about love, falsehood (political and personal) and illusion, it won the jury prize at Cannes, gained special mentions for the performances of Darvas and T?r?csik and led to Makk＊s eclectic career in Hungary and abroad, including a best foreign film Oscar nomination for Cat＊s Play (1974). However, his 1982 film about a lesbian romance, Another Way, was initially nominated by  for the Oscar but was later withdrawn on orders from K芍d芍r.Makk was born in the town of Beretty車迆jfalu, in eastern Hungary, where his father, K芍lm芍n, owned a cinema, which gave his son the chance to watch many movies. His parents, who like many Hungarians had lost their business after the country came under Soviet rule, initially intended him to become an engineer, a common profession on his mother＊s side of the family. Instead, he entered the nationalised film industry, working his way up from assistant to screenwriter and director.His eventual success with Love enabled him to make Cat＊s Play. It tells of an elderly widowed music teacher (Margit Dajka), living in Budapest, who focuses her life on her wealthy but paralysed sister in Germany, with whom she communicates by letter and telephone, and on her old flame, a retired opera singer, who comes to dine every Thursday evening. When a woman from the past appears, the balance and security of her existence are badly disturbed. As in Love, Makk concentrates on the survival mechanisms of the old. Poignant and unsentimental, beautifully photographed by J芍nos T車th, it effectively utilises flashbacks (as in the previous film) to summon up the heroine＊s memories of youth.A Very Moral Night (1977) is set in a small Hungarian town early in the 20th century, where a young student frequents the local brothel. He eventually moves in, and shares a chaste bed with one of the young women. When his puritanical mother turns up to visit him, the madame and the young women encourage her assumption that the brothel is a boarding house. Though rather old-fashioned and missing some of the comic potential, it is nevertheless beautifully shot, again by T?th, and acted.Looking at parts of Makk＊s filmography, it seems that he was comfortable inhabiting the bittersweet romantic world of Hungary＊s most famous playwright, . His connection with Moln芍r extended to Darvas, the playwright＊s widow, who had the co-lead in Love. Makk also adapted Moln芍r＊s previously filmed The Guardsman, a Hungarian-US co-production he retitled Lily in Love (1984), starring Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith. Other international productions Makk directed were Deadly Game (Die J?ger, 1982) in German, starring Helmut Berger and Barbara Sukova; and The Gambler (1997), adapted from Dostoevsky, in English, with Michael Gambon, Jodhi May and , making a comeback at 86, in her last film.Most of these commercial productions received mixed reviews, but Makk＊s reputation was sustained by Another Way 每 about a lesbian love affair between two journalists following the 1956 Hungarian uprising, with the attempted murder of one by her husband and the death of the other.Based on the semi-autobiographical bestseller by Makk＊s co-scriptwriter Erzs谷bet Galg車czi, the film is politically courageous and a touching and intelligent plea for tolerance. The two Polish leads (Jadwiga Jankowska-Cie?lak and Gra?yna Szapo?owska), as the doomed lovers, give remarkably perceptive performances, with the former winning the best actress award at Cannes.Makk＊s best films demonstrate how living under state oppression affects fidelity, love and faith, and how traces of humanity persist in such difficult circumstances.Makk married three times, and is survived by his daughter, Lily.

"lio Barnard is the fiercely intelligent, visually inventive and innovative film-maker who gave us the brilliant docu-hybrid  and then , an inspired interpretation of Oscar Wilde set in Bradford. Her third feature, Dark River, is never anything other than acute and sensitive, with some very good actors giving well directed performances. But for all this movie＊s qualities, it is a British social-realist picture in a well-understood idiom which perhaps doesn＊t quite give us the shock of the new that her previous films delivered. And the appearance of a shotgun early on triggers the ancient Chekhov law about what happens to a gun that is produced in Act One: we are heading to a slightly melodramatic and functional ending.Ruth Wilson is excellent as Alice, a young woman who has been earning money with seasonal work on farms. Then she receives news that her widower father has died, and she must return to the family home, a tenant farm in North Yorkshire, which her brother Joe (Mark Stanley) has let become a ruin. He has driven himself almost to a breakdown looking after their ill father and is enraged with Alice for running out on them, leaving him to do all the work. Their relationship explodes into open warfare when Alice fiercely reveals that she intends to apply to the farm＊s freeholder for permission to become the sole tenant, effectively in control. She believes this is what she is owed, because the awful truth is that her father abused her. And as for Joe, he has his own motives for making a counter-claim to the tenancy.Their troubled past is revealed in disturbing flashbacks, with Esme Creed-Miles and Aiden McCollough as the younger Alice and Joe, and Sean Bean as their father, like a vivid ghost, as Alice is haunted by memories of the house 每 particularly her own bedroom, which she cannot bear to go near. Ruth Wilson＊s face and body language give us access to the wounded and unhappy girl that grew up there. But as an adult, she can see how the farm is becoming increasingly unprofitable. Naturally, Joe resents her interventions; Barnard＊s writing and Stanley＊s performance show how he does not have the emotional language to express his resentment, fear and guilt in anything other than violence. And of course this violence is heading only in one direction.Their escalating confrontation is complicated by two faces of officialdom who appear on their property. One is a prissy land agent in spotless Wellington boots; the other is a breezy estate management executive who tells Joe about how certain factors could see him favoured for the tenancy over his sister. Wilson and Stanley are both excellent performers and they are the mainstays of a valuable piece of work, but I felt the ending was contrived and a bit grandiloquent. However, the visual style and fluency of the film are obvious.																																											"

"conoclasm never fell out of fashion, but it has almost always been metaphorical: if you wanted to find the last time monuments were destroyed to significant political effect in this country 每 adding a mohican haircut to  doesn＊t count 每 you would probably have to reach back to the English civil war. Then came , which lit on the statue of Cecil Rhodes in the University of Cape Town as a flashpoint in a wider movement to decolonise South African education. The contagion was swift, arriving at Oriel College, Oxford, by the end of the year.The arguments have the adamantine quality of the statues themselves. Those defending statues, whether that＊s Donald Trump saluting the big beasts of slavery, or Chris Patten telling students to admire Cecil Rhodes for the sake of ※freedom of thought§ 每 do so on the basis that they are a part of history. To remove or destroy them is to deny or erase history. Those wanting to tear them down argue that it is not history that they want to erase, but a manipulated version of it, in which the villains are valorised and the victims erased.This should be relatively easy to resolve: the danger, if a statue of Rhodes were removed, isn＊t that we will forget history. Rather, it is that we will revisit history, and ask who we actually want to memorialise. In a more relaxed age, we could perhaps agree to add some words to Rhodes＊s plaque - ※politician, adventurer, resource vulture, white supremacist§, while choosing someone more pro-social for the next statue.However, it probably wouldn＊t have come up: iconoclasm is, above anything, an attempt to bring to a head a debate that is operating at a subcuticular level. Colonialism, good or bad? Slavery, good or bad? These questions are boiling under, like suppurating sores, poisoning issues from Brexit in the UK to police racism in the US. Coming out trenchantly against a long-dead enemy is one way of forcing the confrontation to the surface. Statue-crushing is not something that happens in an era of consensus.If the violence that resulted in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month, when white supremacists marched against plans to remove a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee (under the gaze of a statue of Thomas Jefferson), wasn＊t surprising, the extent of it 每 the tragic death of  and the injury of 19 others 每 was. So was the chillingly neutral statement made afterwards by the police: the white supremacist marchers were simply better armed than they were. But various statue-actions across the US have held another surprise: when you pull down a Confederate monument, they ※come down with a tiny tug, then crumple like a paperclip§,  of the online magazine Mic. These Confederate statues aren＊t carved marble; they are cheap bronze casts, and they went up not straight after the civil war, but in two waves, one at the turn of the 20th century, one in the 1960s, coinciding both times with a growing civil rights movement. Their sponsors 每 the Daughters of the Confederacy, standing $200 statues for towns with the will to memorialise the glorious old days, but not the means 每 are not a historical record of Robert E Lee standing among his peers. They are a propaganda history-grab many years after, undertaken on the principle that if you shape the past, you own the present.Very lavish sculptures, intricately carved in marble or stone, have their own peculiar insult, of course: the ownership of history by the richest. Yet incredibly cheap, tinny monuments, with ※Daughters of the Confederacy§ stamped on them like a Primark label, are pretty vexing, too. If you are going to appropriate history, it should at least cost you.Statues, in real life, offer nothing to the historian of the man himself (oh, yeah 每 it＊s always a man, unless it＊s a horse, or, as one of the readers who nominated the statues below has pointed out, a naked unnamed nymph), but they do offer a pretty solid account to the nation of what it should be proud of. Trying to upend the blood-drenched narrative has, so far, spilt more blood. It seems that you can only tell a new story by erecting new statues. , who was born in 1759, was the original suffragette and the first feminist. She was a woman so extraordinarily ahead of her time that if she were here today, writing the same things, living the same life, she would still be considered a radical. A woman from a bleak background, who gave birth to a child out of wedlock, she dragged herself up to be an independent, bestselling author on human rights and gender issues.※I do not wish [women] to have power over men, but over themselves,§ she wrote, in  每 as well as arguing that women were capable of reason but merely lacked education. She was right, of course, but feminists the world over are still making the very same argument and receiving the very same response 每 aggressive trolling by people with louder voices.Wollstonecraft did not just write about independent women; she lived as one and was derided both then and after her death by those whose power she threatened. So dangerous were her views to the establishment that her voice had to be delegitimised. Horace Walpole wrote of her that she was a ※hyena in petticoats§.A statue to Wollstonecraft would be two fingers up to the naysayers of the time and to their modern-day descendants, who spew anti-woman bile across the world. If it were up to me, I would have her standing in her Stoke Newington community in north London, resplendent in petticoats, with hyenas at her feet and a wry, knowing smile on her face. An up-yours to the world and a beautiful testament, a thank you from all the women who, for the past 250 years, have picked up her kick-ass mantle.If legacy is a requisite for a statue, then there can be no argument when it comes to . His achievements as a broadcaster and naturalist are without parallel. For more than 60 years he has been the nation＊s guide to our planet and its natural wonders. Generations of us have travelled vicariously with him to the tops of mountains, the bottoms of oceans, to deserts, rainforests and the icy expanses of the poles. We have crawled into caves, climbed trees, burrowed into termite mounds, scrabbled under hedges. We have been shown that even in the most inhospitable of places, as well as right on our own doorsteps, there is life, everywhere, on Earth.And once Attenborough has helped us make that discovery, there is no need for hyperbole, for a stream of trump-card statistics, because he knows the natural world can speak for itself. He knows it can leave you speechless, breathless with delight, and he allows us that moment, so that when he goes on to explain that every living thing, from the vast to the tiny, from the magnificent to the nondescript, has a role, a purpose, we don＊t simply understand why that is important 每 we care.And by opening our eyes and making us care, Attenborough has been able to educate and inspire and influence people of all ages and all backgrounds. There are 每 and will be for a long time to come 每 scientists, conservationists, naturalists, and broadcasters who will cite Attenborough as their role model, who will take up his baton and ensure that for future generations there will still be life on Earth.I first came across  in 1999, when I was a student and read a book called  每 a very rich, poetic take on the life of this extraordinary figure and her collaboration with the inventor Charles Babbage. It opens with a scene that is imbedded in my psyche: in 1833, a young girl came across a machine that would change her life and the world for ever. That machine was the . Since then I have returned to her time and time again 每 her life and work are a constant source of inspiration.Lovelace is a controversial figure 每 historically, socially, conceptually, mathematically. While Babbage saw his machine as a calculator, she glimpsed that it could do more than simply crunch numbers, and in one set of notes she speculates on the possibility of the machine being capable of producing music. Computer historian Doron Swade sums this up very succinctly: because of her speculations, she is perhaps the first person to see that numbers could be more than just a quantity but an entity 每 ie, they are not just for counting apples, bananas and sheep but could represent images and music themselves 每 this was the first glimpse of data and code. Her insight led to an artwork of mine, in which a series of female innovators respond to a machine and release its potential. It is called the .Babbage and Lovelace were not allowed to show their machine in the Great Exhibition of 1851, but had the Difference Engine been there it would have been as important, in terms of its implications, as the locomotive. Lovelace died the following year, aged 33, a painful early death. Her doctors diagnosed hysteria brought on by the study of mathematics. It was, in fact, ovarian cancer.The idea of a monument to her is an incredible one, and important, too. I would certainly relish the challenge.※In India, if a man dies, the woman throws herself on to the funeral pyre. If a man dies in this country, the woman just drags herself into the kitchen and says: ＆Seventy-two baps, Connie. You slice, I＊ll spread.§And there we are. The British, as seen by , in all their defining emotional and linguistic parsimony. She saw the best, worst and every nuance in between in us, beamed them through the prism of her talent, and the results prostrated us with laughter at the glory, absurdity and bleakness of our national way of life. How can we not publicly recognise a woman who so recognised us?Plans to put up , possibly in character as Bren from Dinnerladies, have stalled, but it is hard to imagine that there won＊t be one somewhere in the north (※The north! The north! I never marched from Jarrow, but those men＊s feet ache in my heart!§, as Jim Broadbent, playing the professionally boreal author Wood encounters at a party, puts it, shortly before revealing that he lives in Chiswick). She moved down south 15 years before she died, but all of her sensibility and every one of her cadences were, and will be for ever, northern.Anywhere in Manchester would do. Wood also loved Morecambe, but that already has Graham Ibbeson＊s statue of Eric, and she deserves her own unadulterated space. We could put it somewhere that would mean something to fans, and detonate the cascade of shared memories, quotes and laughter that is the best part of revering Wood. It could be in Urmston, Kirkcudbright, the left bank of the blinkin＊ Limpopo or somewhere bizarre 每 where was it? Oh, yes; Doncaster. And it should be of the young Victoria, with a chiffon scarf round her neck with her bronze lifesaving medal attached to it, kicking the bottom of a bus stop and an inscription that reads: ※Well, actually, Dennis Beasley, my auntie knows Simon Dee, so ner-ner-ner.§Brian Haw was a peace activist who stood opposite the Houses of Parliament for 10 years, 24-hours a day, to remind all of the politicians of the consequences of Britain＊s disastrous foreign policy in the Middle East.There is probably no one else nominated who was literally a human statue. He was kicked in the head by strangers at nighttime and sworn at all day long by passers-by. Eventually, he used crutches to help him stand 每 and his physicality came to represent the perseverance, endurance and dedication of the peace movement in Britain. He represented centuries of proud resistance to imperialism.A statue of Haw would be a great way to remind politicians that although the anti-imperialists are in the minority, they have been here for a long time. I certainly hope that their utopian visions of England＊s relationship to the rest of the world will come to pass 每 and when that day comes, it would be great if the young people could look back and see figures such as Brian Haw.Sculptor Amanda Ward has already created a maquette, which pretty much sums up how a statue could look. She has captured Haw very well. If I was playing him in a play, that would be the expressive mould: even though he cannot support himself on two legs any more, he is still there, standing. The most obvious place for him to stand would be in Parliament Square, but he could also stand outside the Imperial War Museum.The statue could include some of the extraordinary banners and artefacts surrounding him, as well as all the badges on his hat and a megaphone in his hand. The maquette is a small-scale model of a sculpture 每 but I wouldn＊t mind if it was this size, because he is representative of the small man, the powerless man. Whether you agreed with him or not, there is something about his refusal to move that warrants a statue.Dadabhai Naoroji is remembered for being the first Asian member of parliament elected to the House of Commons, but he was much more. Known to many as the ※Grand Old Man of India§, he was also a leading academic, the founder of the first Indian company to be established in Britain, and an avid campaigner for minority rights. Later in life, he would mentor Mahatma Gandhi, having served for three terms as president of the Indian National Congress.Naoroji＊s pursuit of an egalitarian society arrived at a time when prime ministers had failed to grant minority rights, and were actively derisory about them. His parliamentary legacy and wider achievements in both industry and academia stand as an obvious rebuke to the then prime minister, Lord Salisbury, who stated that Britain was ※not ready to elect a black man§.If he is honoured with a statue, it should be in his former London constituency of Finsbury. Although he is currently honoured by a plaque at the town hall, and a statue in Mumbai, his legacy surely warrants greater recognition in the UK. London is home to hundreds of thousands of first-, second-, third- and now fourth-generation immigrants from the subcontinent. A statue for Naoroji would be a fitting testament to a man who paved the way for British Asians to thrive.As our country attempts to forge a ※global Britain§, post-Brexit, a statue of this excellent parliamentarian would be a welcome reminder of our reciprocal duties of care to the countries and people we hope to trade with on an ever greater scale.While people were trying to turn Theresa May into a new Iron Lady, another far more legitimate Iron Lady was being maligned, abused and even sent death threats. It is one of the many strange dislocations of Brexit that May, a woman who has changed her mind about almost all the big decisions in her political life, was the subject of a feverish rebranding campaign as someone who was ※strong and stable§, while Gina Miller, someone who has stood by her convictions, was seen as a traitor.And Miller＊s convictions are not as simple as merely wanting to see Brexit reversed. That is a wilful misreading of her position. She cares about democracy 每 not the populist, posturing kind that hides behind empty phrases such as ※the will of the people§ in order to abdicate responsibility, but the real kind. The sort of democracy that ensures that the mechanisms of government are empowered to properly further the interests of their voters, rather than be a crude club for them. A democracy that reminds us that politicians are our representatives, not our delegates.We have heard a lot about British values since the EU referendum. I am still not sure what British values Brexit represents, apart from misplaced nostalgia. If Brexit＊s British values are meant to include independence from group think and a dignified self-assurance in the face of a mob, then no one embodies them more than Miller. Give her a statue, wrought of iron, and erect it at the steps of the High Court of Justice.Zaha Hadid was a pioneering architect and artist who created a totally unique language, and I have no doubt that her work will be remembered for decades and centuries to come. She also had immense courage, determination and energy, and completely changed what was previously a male-dominated profession. At the Serpentine gallery, we were honoured to have collaborated with her on many projects; she was a trustee of the gallery, she designed the Serpentine Sackler, and we held an exhibition of her early works just after her death, the final project we planned together during her lifetime.I think one of the things that makes her work resonate is her experimentation. Hadid said there should be no end to experimentation, and that＊s our mantra, too. Monuments don＊t usually tend to move, but a statue commemorating her would need to reflect her spirit of dynamism and the weightless quality of her buildings: it couldn＊t be static.There is, of course, already a statue of David Bowie, or at least a prototype: the real, Kickstarter-funded thing is set to be unveiled in Aylesbury＊s Market Square next March, the latest of umpteen pieces of public art to have sprung up in the wake of Bowie＊s death. It is not difficult to understand why people want to see him commemorated. Quite aside from his artistic legacy and incalculable influence on music and fashion, there is a sense that Bowie had a genuine positive social impact on Britain.It wasn＊t just young gay fans who felt energised and emboldened by his emergence in full Ziggy drag in 1972, although it is hard to overestimate his impact upon them (※in one nonchalant move, [he] made homosexuality seem daring and colourful rather than shameful,§ wrote Martin Aston in his history of LGBTQ pop Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache) but also on a vast swath of previously marginalised misfits: no matter how weird and alien you felt, you couldn＊t be as weird and alien as Bowie and his band looked. Indeed, you could argue that Bowie represented Britain as we would like it to be seen: inclusive, eccentric, innovative, always moving forward and changing.There＊s something deeply irritating about Peter Tatchell 每 and that＊s the beauty of him. His sea-green incorruptibility gets under the skin. He has a single-mindedness of purpose, which makes you know that he will never compromise with prejudice and injustice, so you might as well get on and recognise that he is right. When he tried to perform a citizen＊s arrest on Robert Mugabe for his human rights abuses, even the Daily Mail had to admit a smidgen of respect.The change in attitudes to homosexuality has been so sudden in this country that it is difficult to remember the courage Tatchell showed when Aids provoked irrational paranoia about gay men and when Thatcher brought in section 28 banning teachers from portraying gay relationships in a positive light.Yes, there were out actors and singers, but gay politicians bore the full brunt of vitriol from the hypocritically prurient and judgmental British press. Anyone who dared to suggest that homosexuals should be treated equally under the law was derided as dangerously immoral, branded as a member of the ※loony left§ and hounded out of office. Tatchell knows this better than any. He was defeated as the Labour candidate in the Bermondsey byelection in 1981 thanks to a hateful campaign by the Liberals, whose leaflets referred to ※a straight choice§. He was assaulted by neo-Nazi thugs for campaigning for LGBT rights in Russia.Tatchell＊s courage has been vindicated. We now have an equal age of consent, same-sex marriage, gay adoption and anti-discrimination laws. The politicians who brought in those changes (Blair, Brown and Cameron) would not be his heroes, but even they would admit they owe him a debt of gratitude.The life of multicultural Britain can be divided into two distinct periods: BL and AL, or Before Lawrence and After Lawrence. In the BL period 每 before, that is, the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993 每 minority Britons would proclaim that they perennially received unfair treatment from the authorities. The standard response was that the complaints were overblown and that the real issue was too many chips on shoulders.Then came the Macpherson report, the culmination of the Lawrence family＊s campaign to expose the racism, indolence and institutional hostility that led to Stephen＊s murder and the Met＊s failure to catch his killers. Suddenly there was the evidence, for all to see, not just of the attitudes and failures in Stephen＊s case, but of the mindset that underpinned widespread discrimination in Britain.The problem hasn＊t gone away, but in the AL era, we no longer deny the problem exists. Doreen Lawrence, now a peer, now a tireless community leader, dragged us to that new reality. A statue is the least she deserves. was very influential in Britain: he established a discipline 每 cultural studies 每 and a journal 每 the New Left Review. He was very involved with the inauguration of Channel 4, arguing for access, and that too many voices were excluded from the main bastions of British broadcasting. He was part of the establishment of the  in Rivington Place, east London, and involved in important inquiries into policing. He was a theorist as well 每 a figure respected in the academies, who also did much work outside of the academy, to build the cultural mix we take for granted in Britain today.In my film , Hall takes Fanon＊s ideas about depersonalisation and translates them for a contemporary audience. He was very sophisticated at that 每 explaining questions around racism so that everyone could understand. But I wouldn＊t want to confine his works to race, because he was also a spokesman for the cultural left in this country.His ideas were prophetic; in the early 90s, he was already talking about questions of identity production, violence or terrorism, how the media creates moral panics and how migration is used as a red herring, especially in times of political crisis. All are relevant to Brexit.I think he would be rather horrified by a statue of himself, because he was very much about his ideas and keeping them alive. His books, his writings,  每 those are all ways in which we might want to memorialise his legacy.When Danny Boyle outed himself to the Guardian in 2013 as a republican, the film-maker had a suggestion for who might replace the monarch as head of state. Why,  每 she who had done such a majestic turn in Boyle＊s 2012 opening ceremony for the London Olympics.After all, Rowling had to her name a mammoth achievement, a series of novels that had found global success, winning over a generation of children to the joys of reading and whose characters had secured a place in the national imagination. She was also a serious philanthropist, funding action for orphans, for single parents and for those living with MS. And she was that rare billionaire who paid all her taxes.All that might not be enough to have earned Rowling the throne, but it surely entitles her to a statue. She embodies the admirable virtues of determination, creativity and generosity 每 all of which deserve public celebration.As for its location, I am with the anonymous reader below. The Scottish capital is where, as a single mother living on benefits, Rowling wrote the Potter novels, but it is also the home of the  每 the MS centre established with the help of a ?10m donation from the author and named after her mother, who died from the disease aged 45.There is one more reason why Rowling is the ideal candidate for a major public landmark. On Twitter, she has become a fierce opponent of Brexit, of Donald Trump and of Scottish nationalism. Which means any statue of her would be controversial. And what＊s a new statue without a big old row?There is something paradoxical about a statue to celebrate the life of . She was so dynamic, energetic, and even restless, that she would never allow herself to be imprisoned by the fixed shapes carved by a stonemason. Somehow, any memorial would need to be a cinematic statue to convey her true determination and spirit. She would also have laughed at the idea of the reverence implicit in a dusty statue. She cared passionately about the issues that animated her, and the people she sought to help, but she never set herself on a pedestal, let alone a plinth, or apart from anyone. She would have laughed herself to pieces at the idea.The whole basis of her political work was cooperation, to break down divisions in communities, at Westminster and even between nations. That meant searching for the best in everyone, drawing it out, listening and looking for a human language to create shared ground. Most responded to that humanity.It did not make her views bland, or anodyne mush. Her views on humanitarian intervention in Syria, such as UN aid drops, took her to difficult places that would make the current Labour leadership uneasy. Politicians＊ equivocations over Brexit would have frustrated her.Her politics were led by values, not tribes. At a time when forces of hate and division have been unleashed, she stood for cooperation, and in the end cooperation is the prerequisite for a successful democracy. She was a modern democrat, and for that reason she was killed, and for that reason she requires our memorial.What might a statue of the painter  look like? If the idea is to honour him, it could scarcely be a simple, realistic bronze figure. Bacon tore the human figure apart. His meaty existential vision of a godless world is spattered with blood, semen and faeces in paintings of lovers wrestling, popes in glass prisons and flesh that looks bomb-damaged. A statue of him should be similarly brutal. Fortunately, there is an obvious candidate. His admirer Damien Hirst would surely love to put up a disembowelled bronze colossus near Bacon＊s old Soho hangouts.Whether Bacon would have wanted such an honour is another question. He was not the kind of artist who flaunts a positive contribution to society. His art is utterly preoccupied with personal obsessions 每 including Nazi regalia 每 and gleefully elitist in its painterly passion for the grandeur of baroque art. His ghost would almost certainly urinate on such a statue 每 probably not even aggressively, just when blind drunk.This is why if anyone should have a statue, it is Bacon. There are too many celebrations of the virtuous. Bacon was the kind of subversive reprobate we should remember. Or is he to be honoured as a gay man who painted explicitly years before the 1967 Sexual Offences Act? That makes him sound like the soft-centred Bacon played by Steve Pemberton in the TV comedy . The joke is that Pemberton plays Bacon as a nice, positive man, whereas his art and biographical legend suggest the opposite. Bacon is not someone to sentimentalise 每 it would be an insult to his tragic art. A statue of him should be as grotesque and troubling as the man himself.																																											"
"n this inane sequel to Michael Dowse＊s 2011 Canadian sports comedy , Seann William Scott returns as Doug Glatt. An ice hockey hero, captain of the Halifax Highlanders and ※a huge, Jewish freight train§, Glatt is good natured and more than a little slow. When he gets his face pounded in on the ice by blond-haired baddie Anders Cain (Wyatt Russell), he hangs up his skates and takes early retirement. He tries his luck with a new job in the basement office of an insurance company (※Doug Glatt 每 storage room. That＊s you!§), while pregnant wife, Eva (Alison Pill, doing her best but not showing her range), tries to keep his spirits up, but it＊s not long before he＊s sneaking back to the rink.Directed and co-written by Jay Baruchel (one of the stars of the little-seen American TV drama  and the voice of ＊s Hiccup), ＊s puerile jokes won＊t be to everyone＊s tastes, though fans of North American gross-out comedies (and of jocks punching one another) may have fun spotting the scene＊s stalwarts as supporting characters, among them Elisha Cuthbert and Liev Schreiber.Baruchel, too, has written himself a small but shouty role as Pat, an irritating, foul-mouthed nerd who wears a string vest and a baseball cap that says ※Fuck white people§ (he＊s better behind the camera than he is in front of it, which isn＊t saying much).

"he last of Roald＊s books that were illustrated in his lifetime were  and . I worked on the first, while the other was commissioned from Patrick Benson. Benson is an artist I know and admire; his book was a large format and in colour, and he made something wonderful of it, with dramatic and detailed views of fire and smoke and of forest and clouds.Early in 2015, 25 years later, my publisher, Penguin Random House, approached me about a possible reillustration of the book. This was not because of any dissatisfaction with the existing work, but because Penguin had, over time, become aware that there was no way that the existing version could appear except in the original format; the scale and detail of the pictures wouldn＊t allow it. The publishers realised that they needed a book that could sit alongside the other Dahl titles, go into paperback and be stuffed into pockets. Would I take this on?I was reassured to know that the original version was to be kept in print. Although my text was to be identical, it was going to be called , which was the alternative title that appears in Roald＊s handwriting on the original manuscript. The new book, in small format, would have about 120 pages; the words would run to nearly 60 pages, so that virtually half the space was available for illustration.I have said ※the new book§, and to me it did seem very like a new book. Forty years after I first read the manuscript of , I was setting about a story that, excitingly, I felt I didn＊t really know. Now words and pictures ran very closely together, hand in hand. The text was divided into chapters; I was allowed to invent the titles but, even more interestingly, it meant I had to cut up the printed text (in the old-fashioned way) and make a complete layout of the book: Billy＊s increasing panic, for instance, as he is pursued by the frightening Gruncher 每 the sequence of expressions on his face and the quantity of smoke is followed over several pages.The accompanying revelation to me was that Billy stopped being any small boy in a frightening situation, and became more of an individual 每 another of the company of ＊s young heroes and heroines. I wanted him to look distinctive and distinguishable from the others and I still have the sketchbook in which I started to imagine what he looked like 每 rather small, skinny and agile. The standing-up hair, I hoped, would suggest something of the liveliness and rebelliousness in his nature.And then I was able to get really close to the Minpins themselves. Dahl mentions them having old-fashioned costumes, in brown and black, of two or three hundred years ago, and I suppose my Minpins are in a sort of confused 17th-century attire. They are also described as having eccentric headwear 每 another rewarding opportunity. And they are referred to as being present in thousands: that is easier for a writer than an illustrator. I hope I may be forgiven in the pictures for them being merely numerous. What I most wanted to do was to get into the close-ups 每 to show the variety of their shapes and sizes, and to work in as many possible permutations as my pen could think of.My feeling, as I approached the end of my work on the drawings, was that there was something very special about the book, almost in some way light-hearted. Billy＊s insouciance contributes to this; the threat of the Gruncher isn＊t personal, and there is no threatening individual. And then, once the swan appears, the mood changes dramatically and Billy finds himself in a series of extraordinary experiences, flying into the clouds, through the night and into the bowels of the earth. Dahl was a storyteller, not a poet, but he was also a flyer, and what we have here is an expression of his own poetic vision. Billy and the Minpins is published by Puffin.

"n January 2015, Tommy Caldwell and his partner Kevin Jorgeson  of El Capitan＊s Dawn Wall in Yosemite National Park, California, arguably the most difficult rock climb in history. The two attracted global media attention as they reached the summit. Caldwell in particular was already famous among rock climbers, but the Dawn Wall captured imaginations across the world.The clamour was perhaps unsurprising. The project took seven years of planning, training and strategising, and the successful attempt required 19 days of living on the wall, sleeping on ※portaledges§ suspended from the rock face. The climbing was so difficult that most considered the Dawn Wall impossible to ascend ※free§ (using nothing but hands and feet, with ropes and gear employed only to halt deadly falls). During the building media excitement, it was common to hear that the edges Caldwell and Jorgeson were using in their climb were ※no bigger than a dime§. In fact this was selling them short. Think instead of the blunt edge of a razorblade for fingers and grape-seed sized bumps for feet.In the context of Caldwell＊s fame, a?book deal is no surprise. The result would perhaps be expected to be a collection of the usual platitudes and cliches, the sort of kitsch that characterises many sporting biographies, but this is not what we get at all. stands out as a genuine achievement in its own right 每 and is about much more than just climbing.Presumably Caldwell＊s co-writer Kelly Cordes deserves credit for how well written the book is, but even so the authenticity of Caldwell＊s voice comes through clearly in passages of well crafted prose.  is also intelligently structured, each chapter interspersed with flashes forward or back, layering the narrative of his life, from awkward childhood to climbing phenomenon. The book is ostensibly divided into four parts, but it is better to see it as a three-part work, capped with a final culminating act 每 the Dawn Wall ascent 每 and with each revolving around a significant relationship in Caldwell＊s life.The first concerns his father, a former competitive body-builder who introduced the young Tommy to rock climbing and nurtured his talent. Yet after Caldwell won a competition aged 16 (one he entered at his dad＊s insistence), doubts and fears crept in to the father-son relationship. Did his dad love him for who he was, Caldwell wondered, or only for his climbing achievements? Among hyper-masculine sporting men, who can find it difficult to speak about emotions, such questions are liable to fester. Much of the rest of the book is about Caldwell＊s working out what kind of son he was, in order to decide what kind of man he wanted to be.The second part centres on his marriage to his first real girlfriend, Beth Rodden, an elite climber in her own right. A major trauma seems retrospectively to have doomed their union from near the start. On a climbing trip to Kyrgyzstan in 2000, Caldwell, Rodden and two others were taken hostage by Islamist rebels, who murdered a Kyrgyz soldier in front of them, before force-marching the Americans in circles for days. Eventually they escaped, after Caldwell pushed one of their captors into a ravine. The incident left them deeply affected. Rodden in particular 每 who had tried to?break up with Caldwell a few weeks before the trip 每 fell into depression. She felt smothered by his love, and eventually left him for a mutual friend.The third part of the book is about the relationship Caldwell developed to come to terms with the subsequent divorce, and an estrangement from his father. Here the relationship is not with a person, but a 3,000ft face of sheer granite in central California. It was by taking on the  that he found a way, he writes, to work through his pain. Over the seven years of preparation, he grew and matured, became reconciled with his father, met his second wife and became a father. His wife and son become star players in the story. is not simply a book about rock climbing, then, but about human relationships and the ways in which we can hurt each other while trying to be kind. Caldwell, for all his magnificent achievements on stone, reminds us that in the end, the only really serious enterprise is living.  is published by Michael Joseph.

The last time I carried a bag on my back, it was a school satchel and I wore a cap. No wonder I＊m ashamed. A man should not look like a boy.

"here＊s a joke a friend＊s father used to tell, a variant of an old Mae West line. ※I＊ve been rich and miserable, I＊ve been poor and miserable. And let me tell you: rich is better.§ The Upside, a Hollywood remake of the , is a movie about a depressed quadriplegic and unloved ex-con, and still manages to be an aspirational film in the Nancy Meyers vein because of friendship, the triumph of the human spirit and really luxurious Park Avenue apartments.The penthouse Bryan Cranston＊s Phil lives in is practically Wonka＊s factory to Dell (Kevin Hart), who lives in public housing when his girlfriend hasn＊t thrown him out. Dell is a deadbeat dad who needs to prove he＊s still going on fruitless job interviews to appease his parole officer. A mix-up lands him at Phil＊s just as he and his major-domo (Nicole Kidman) are taking applicants for a new aide specifically trained in the lifting, feeding and being an all-around lifeline for someone paralysed from the neck down. In an act of defiance (or maybe he just has a good sense), the well-groomed Phil decides this unkempt loose cannon is the only man for the job.When Dell first moves in there＊s some rags-to-riches schtick (a talking shower - in German!) and with Hart＊s abundant comic ability one is reminded of the Eddie Murphy film Trading Places. Cranston (whose career began in American sitcoms like Seinfeld and Malcolm in the Middle before achieving a greater level of notoriety on Breaking Bad) is a perfect straight man for Hart. Phil is the square rich guy one minute (the line ※nor she I§ gets a big laugh); thinking one step ahead of the streetwise Dell the next. The Hart and Cranston show is an unending volley of zings and these two men are more than pros 每 they＊re heroes.Things soon get weird, though. Even though The Upside (and the original French film) is loosely based on a real story, the suggestion is that all a bummed-out wealthy dude needs to get his blood pumping is to keep a pet  around the house. He＊s irreverent and clever and eager to fix problems, and with just a little training he starts liking the snooty stuff he once scorned like opera and painting.Director Neil Burger (The Illusionist, Limitless) and screenwriter Jon Hartmere inject some self-aware commentary, but that doesn＊t totally negate a racial queasiness that permeates the entire film. There will be some audience members that, no matter how funny Hart and Cranston are, will reject another Driving Miss Daisy scenario, and it＊s very difficult to argue that they are wrong.This is not much more than a light crowdpleaser, but when you＊ve got two powerhouse performers like this it is very difficult not to find oneself at least temporarily charmed. (Kidman, alas, is very much in the background, but is sturdy, as are smaller players like Julianna Margulies and Golshifteh Farahani.) There are some extended sequences, like a drawn-out bit involving a catheter, that mostly plays to the cheap seats, but much of the verbal jousting is really sharp. Truly, this extremely by-the-numbers, manipulative and formulaic film is as funny as its framework allows it to be. It wouldn＊t surprise me if the American remake is as financially successful as the original. 																																											"
"Hurricane Irma has devastated many Caribbean islands (, 6 September). Sadly, there is little that can be done about the tragic loss of life. However, there would be no better course of action than sequestering the billions in evaded tax residing in many of the territories to fund the vital reconstruction needed to rebuild indigenous people＊s lives. Lucy Mangan thinks nitric acid is enough on its own to dissolve a wedding ring (, 6 September): it isn＊t. But if you look carefully at the sequence in Doctor Foster, it＊s clear that she is also using a second unspecified liquid, presumably hydrochloric acid, to make aqua regia, which will dissolve gold. At last, my training in chemistry has proved useful! While it is true that too many acres of rainforest have been destroyed for soybean crops (, 7 September), it should be noted that the vast majority of those beans are used to feed the livestock that in turn destroy millions more acres. The merits of vegan junk food can be discussed ad infinitum, but there should be no mistake that a vegan lifestyle is better for the planet on every level. I endorse the environmental case for veganism (, 6 September). But you should have acknowledged the case for supplementing or fortifying the diet with certain micronutrients (eg vitamin B12), especially for pregnant or lactating vegans. So car drivers are horrible to cyclists, cyclists are unpleasant to pedestrians and swift pedestrians are rude to slower pedestrians (, 7 September). I?think I＊ll stay on my boat.																																											"
"There were three in the relationship: Rudolph Valentino, Pola Negri 每 the Latin Lover and the Femme Fatale, two of the greatest stars of the silent screen 每 and the massive jewel on her finger, said to be the fateful ring that cursed a string of owners.Within a year of the smouldering portrait by the Spanish artist Federico Beltr芍n Masses 每 which is expected to sell for up ?15,000 at a  on 27 September 每 Valentino had died from peritonitis aged 31, and several women and at least one man were killing themselves in anguish.Negri turned his funeral into a publicity bonanza, insisting the pair had been engaged, sending 1,000 red and white roses spelling out the word Pola, hurling herself fainting on to his coffin in New York and then accompanying the coffin on a train journey across the US, weeping becomingly at each one of the dozens of stops along the route toward his burial in California.The ring was also the stuff of Hollywood legend. Negri chose it as a keepsake from his estate, despite 每 or possibly because of 每 its lurid reputation. Valentino bought it from a San Francisco jeweller, despite being warned it had brought disaster to several owners before his untimely death. Negri gave it to the actor Russ Valentino, noted as a Valentino lookalike, who died in an accidental shooting. His best friend and heir, the entertainer Joe Casino, was run over by a truck after spending months pondering whether to wear it. It was then stolen from his brother＊s home by a doomed burglar who was shot dead by the police with the ring in his pocket. It was borrowed by a young actor for a screen test who inexorably died of a rare disease within weeks, before it finally vanished after a fire at the bank where it was kept under lock and key.Negri recovered from her grief sufficiently to marry a Georgian prince within the year, but he turned out to be a compulsive gambler, which swiftly brought her back from retirement. She survived the transition to the talkies, and her 1935 film Mazurka was said to be one of Adolf Hitler＊s favourites, though she successfully sued a French magazine for suggesting they had been lovers. She made several comebacks before her death in 1987 aged 90.Bonhams paintings expert Charles O＊Brien called the portrait ※ethereal and beautiful§ and said the artist, as a friend of Valentino＊s, had succeeded in capturing a moment of stillness in the tumultuous lives of the couple.

"hen  finished his 1886 novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, he tied up the tale with apparent finality: the lawyer, Gabriel Utterson, has in his pocket letters explaining that the two title characters (century old plot-spoiler 每 they＊re the same person) are both dead, following the discovery of Hyde＊s corpse. Ingeniously though, the Australian-born, Edinburgh-based novelist Anthony O＊Neill has managed to fashion a sequel from this apparent dead end: . In O＊Neill＊s continuation, Utterson is startled, seven years after the events described by Stevenson, by the appearance of a mysterious gentleman claiming to be Dr Henry Jekyll 每 who, logically, can not exist. Although the premise is clever 每 a story about divided personality now becomes one of apparent identity theft 每 its negotiation of what seemed to be an insuperable obstacle to the story＊s furtherance suggests that the classic sequel has become an unstoppable force. Another Stevenson banker, Treasure Island, has at least 10 assorted prequels and sequels by other authors, including two follow-ups by the former poet laureate Andrew Motion:  and . The popularity of the form can mainly be blamed on Hollywood, where the quality of a script is increasingly judged on whether the title could reappear followed by a ※two§ and ideally a rising succession of digits. Taking their cue from movie studios, writers and publishers began to imagine a second go at stories that had seemed to be one-offs.  The modern market was started by , Alexandra Ripley＊s 1991 continuation of Margaret Mitchell＊s Gone With the Wind, authorised by Mitchell＊s estate. Then came  (1993), extending Daphne du Maurier＊s Rebecca, and  (2006), which expanded Louisa May Alcott＊s Little Women. But while Brooks won the Pulitzer prize for hers, other fictional supplements have been less warmly received. The heirs of Victor Hugo attempted to prevent Cosette, , while lawyers for JD Salinger gained restrictions against John David California＊s  (2009), which picked up from The Catcher in the Rye. Legal letters, though, are not necessary to keep some great books within their original covers. There are three main reasons for respecting the writer＊s final full stop: a feeling that the work is too revered or important to be extended by another hand; the sense that the narrative is fully completed; and an obstructive estate, foundation or appreciation society. F Scott Fitzgerald＊s The Great Gatsby meets all three criteria, although that did not stop  being publishing online in 2013. A disclaimer classifies the work as ※fan fiction§, a genre that means every classic novel will now probably have some kind of sequel somewhere. I had guessed that George Eliot＊s Middlemarch 每 which must have a case to be the most complete novel ever written 每 might have gone un-stretched, but research revealed The Ladislaw Case by the Swedish writer Imke Thorm?hlen.That book happened even though Eliot took the precaution of including her own epilogue, a kind of compressed sequel. So the best strategies for authors keen to avoid the possibility of their books carrying on without them is probably to write multiple sequels yourself 每 as  did, in his Barsetshire and Palliser sequences 每 or, even though Dr Jekyll and Mr Seek cleverly finds a way through the storytelling brick wall that Stevenson seems to have constructed at the end of the original, to concentrate on tragedies with a significant final body count.Thomas Hardy, for example, does not leave much of a cast list for anyone contemplating taking on Tess of the D＊Urbervilles or Jude the Obscure.  also made sure that no one could write The Decline of Miss Jean Brodie, with the retired spinster teacher looking back from old age. Even in stories where key characters remain alive, their creators can leave a firm sense that everything necessary has been said. It is easy enough to imagine Ralph and Jack, two of the feral schoolboys stranded on an island in Lord of Flies, as a banker and cabinet minister later in life, but it would also be pointless. William Golding＊s novel expects and encourages readers to speculate about the men the boys might become. A great novel will often contain such resonance that its sequel is implied 每 and should not be written by anyone else.																																											"
"avid Lynch＊s debut Eraserhead was the greatest home movie ever made. Shot over five years in a disused stable block behind the American Film Institute where the director was living at the time, it was painstakingly constructed frame by frame by a group of committed friends 每 the very definition of a labour of love. Exactly 40 years later, Lynch has just completed his most personal project since. Twin Peaks: the Return may have had a starry cast, cutting-edge digital effects and an 18-hour run time. But at heart, it was just another home movie: the work of an artist coming full circle, incorporating everything he＊s learned in four decades as a filmmaker back into the hands-on, DIY template he established with his first film.At times, the Return resembled a checklist of familiar Lynchian motifs: hapless criminals, crusading lawmen, slinky femmes fatale, coffee, pie, alternate dimensions. Even the cast list reads like a reunion party: almost every lead had worked with Lynch before, and not just in the original Twin Peaks. Laura Dern starred in Blue Velvet and Inland Empire; Naomi Watts and Robert Forster appeared in Mulholland Drive; Balthazar Getty was in Lost Highway; Harry Dean Stanton was in Wild at Heart, The Straight Story and . These weren＊t just collaborators, they were lifelong friends.Appearances from original  regulars often felt less like integral plot points and more like old pals popping in for a catch-up. Warren Frost (co-writer Mark Frost＊s dad, now deceased) delivered his performance via Skype, while David Patrick Kelly as Jerry Horne wandered lonely in the woods, stoned out of his gourd and only interacted with other characters in his first and final scenes. Ben Horne and his daughter Audrey both had plotlines that went precisely nowhere, while Norma and Big Ed dropped in, rekindled their love then promptly dropped straight out again. Eraserhead veteran Catherine Coulson had four heartbreaking scenes as the Log Lady, all filmed shortly before her death from cancer. Her last appearance was perhaps the series＊ most memorable moment, as Lynch broadcasted what was essentially an intimate eulogy to one of his closest friends.The Return also delved back into the director＊s creative back pages, and not just his screen work. What was the Evolution of the Arm (the stick-like sculpture brought in to replace wayward Peaks icon Michael J Anderson) if not a 3D representation of one of his more oblique artworks? The series incorporated acting roles or singing cameos from Chrysta Bell, Rebekah del Rio, Trent Reznor and Julee Cruise, all of whom have made music with Lynch over the years, alongside returning composer . Elements of earlier Lynch films and TV projects were constantly woven in: a castle in the sea like something from Dune, a sticky-bug creature straight out of Eraserhead. Agent Cooper＊s multiple personalities nodded to the ※psychogenic fugue§ of Lost Highway, while the final episode＊s abrupt left-turn on to an entirely new plane of existence closely mirrored the closing scenes of Mulholland Drive.But it was in this final hour that the Return made its most notable break from Lynch＊s past, as Agent Cooper and his assistant/muse/lover Diane journeyed across dimensions to a place that felt uncomfortably like the ※real§ world (albeit one where motels change their faces and unearthly voices echo from thin air). The show had already staked its claim as the most socially conscious Lynch work to date, digging like Dr Amp right into the ※shit§ in which we find ourselves, nodding both to America＊s increasing poverty problem and its propensity for violence: ※the glow is dying§, reported the Log Lady in her final address. Not all of Lynch＊s political insights worked 每 his own speech of acceptance to cross-dresser Denise Bryson was a bit awkward 每 but it was bracing to see this most inward-looking filmmaker embracing larger concerns.Still, the final episode went several steps further, feeling more unsettlingly earthbound than anything Lynch has attempted before. The town of Odessa, Texas was presented in stark terms, full of traffic and grime, a literal world away from the hazy nostalgia of Twin Peaks. Even the roads had lost their mystery 每 a set of eerie headlamps in the rearview mirror turned out not to be a gang of criminals, but just another car. The episode, and the series, culminated with a weary, ordinary-looking Agent Cooper leading Laura to the door of her own home, only to be confronted with the baffled face of Mary Reber, the woman who actually owns the Palmer house in Everett, Washington. Was this Lynch bidding a final farewell to fiction? At 71, has he closed his own loop? This year＊s heartwarming documentary  seemed to imply that he＊s more of a homebody now, happy to potter around the studio with his toddling daughter and his paintbrushes. If Twin Peaks: the Return turns out to be the last David Lynch movie 每 and given his age and work rate that could well be the case 每 it＊s hard to think of a more fitting swansong. Perhaps that title didn＊t just refer to the town of Twin Peaks, or to Agent Cooper＊s slow road back to sanity. It could also mark a return for its creator, setting aside the dense, violent, strangely comforting worlds he＊s spent four decades creating and stepping back into some semblance of reality. 																																											"
"he saga of the Joubert Singers＊ route to their debut UK gig is both heartwarming and incredibly convoluted. Lengthy scholarly articles have been written about the curious afterlife of Stand on the Word, a track from a privately pressed 1982 gospel compilation that until recently represented their entire recorded oeuvre. In short: it briefly enjoyed success in New York clubs thanks to the legendary DJs  and Walter Gibbons; was subsequently forgotten for decades before being rediscovered by cratediggers, erroneously credited as a remix by another disco legend, ; it turned up on compilations and film soundtracks, inspired the sound of Justice＊s 2007 track D.A.N.C.E., and a  became a hit in France.You can＊t really blame its composer, Phyliss McKoy Joubert, for capitalising on its belated success: the Joubert Singers have started touring and recently recorded their debut album. Something about the track seemed to have an appeal that stretched far beyond the usual audience for obscure gospel disco rediscoveries 每 the vast majority of those assembled in the Jazz Cafe look substantially younger than the track itself. Delightful as it is to see a great piece of music find a new audience decades after the event, there＊s no getting around the fact that there＊s something slightly peculiar about a gig entirely predicated on four minutes of music from 35 years ago. ※Thank you very much for enjoying my song and ＃ the other songs,§ offers Joubert as she walks on stage, to a round of slightly nervous laughter. It＊s a state of affairs compounded by the fact that aside from Joubert, who vocally takes a back seat, it isn＊t entirely clear how many, if any, of the singers actually performed on the original track. They bookend the set with versions of it 每 it sounds great, its jubilant power intact 每 and in between there＊s substantially less gospel than you might expect, the vocal pyrotechnics displayed on versions of Ezekiel Saw the Wheel and Joyful Joyful vastly outweighed by pop and soul covers: Purple Rain, I Will Always Love You, Like a Prayer. If the crowd are disappointed, they do an immensely good job of covering it up, and you can see why. You don＊t get anywhere in the world of gospel by quacking on like Mark E Smith, and the vocalists duly sing up a storm. If it ultimately amounts to padding, it＊s entertaining padding, so long as you don＊t dwell too long on the question of precisely what it has to do with the record that belatedly made the Joubert Singers famous in the first place.

"he theme music from Lawrence of Arabia comes to a close and John Suchet tees up a movement from Henry Litolff＊s Concerto Symphonique No 4 with an anecdote about how a warrant was once issued for the composer＊s arrest. Over the rest of the final hour of his weekday flagship morning show on Classic FM, he fits in some William Boyce, the third movement of Beethoven＊s Pastoral Symphony and a Maori folk song.Suchet is warm, engaging and, above all, brief on air. After the composer and performers get the obligatory namecheck 每 he seldom bothers with details of what key a piece is written in 每 he moves quickly on to the next track; sometimes via the merest mention of something that has caught his attention in the news, sometimes via a fun piece of history relating to the music and sometimes via nothing at all. As the mood takes him. On Classic FM less is more when it comes to chat. While presenters on other radio stations frequently use their shows as echo chambers for their own egos, on Classic FM they are merely there to fill the gaps between the music. Much loved and highly valued link-up presenters, but link-up presenters nonetheless. In any hour it is rare for any presenter to speak for more than four minutes in total. This may come as a shock to some classical music purists who have always been a bit sniffy about Classic FM. They don＊t like the way the station seldom plays a work in full. They don＊t like the ※don＊t frighten the horses§ emphasis of its output. They don＊t like crossover artists such as  and . They don＊t like the way film and video game music is treated on a par with Mozart and Chopin. They don＊t like ＃ well, pretty much everything really.None of which bothers Suchet. ※We＊re not here to tell people how they are supposed to listen to classical music,§ he points out. ※Our remit is not to educate. If people want to go on a journey of discovery that＊s fine, but we＊re here to play them the music they want to listen to. We understand that people are often listening to the radio at the same time as they are doing something else. They are driving the kids to school, on their morning commute or have got the radio on in the background at work and don＊t necessarily want to be particularly challenged by what they are listening to. Our mantra is, ＆If you don＊t like what＊s playing right now then stay with us for a few minutes and we＊re sure you＊ll like the next piece.＊§It＊s a formula that has proved remarkably successful. When presenter Nicky Bailey launched Classic FM with Zadok the Priest on 7 September 1992, few radio insiders gave the station more than a couple of months. The collective wisdom was that there was no market for a commercial station playing classical music and that anyone who was interested would already be tuned to  3. Fast forward 25 years and Classic FM is the biggest commercial radio station in the country, attracting more than 5.8m listeners per week, not to mention tens of thousands more online around the world.Classic FM＊s success has been built on a creative tension between innovation and an instinctive desire to play safe. Nowhere is this more evident than in its playlist. If you want to listen to opera, then tune in elsewhere. The most you are going to hear is the very occasional bit of Puccini or Mozart. Nor will there be much in the way of mainstream composers such as Mahler, Bruckner or Britten. And certainly nothing from the likes of Bart車k and .Quite how something gets on to the Classic FM playlist is kept closely guarded. All managing editor Sam Jackson will say is that, ※It＊s not death by focus group.§ Though it certainly has that feel. Whether the station has a panel of experts who arbitrate on every piece of music or whether it has a select group of trusted listeners who act as guinea pigs, the result is much the same. If a piece of music gets the thumbs down then it＊s consigned to the bin, never to be heard on the station again.There is some leeway. Some new music will be given the odd trial play to give listeners a chance to make up their mind whether they like it or not. But in general the rules are clear. If you＊re out, you＊re out. Which goes a long way to explain why some record companies are going to such lengths to make sure their albums get the thumbs up. ※More and more we are finding that labels are coming to us and asking what bits of the repertoire we would like them to record,§ says Jackson. Having an album played on Classic FM is every label＊s dream. If the station hadn＊t made a point of playing and promoting film music there＊s no chance that  would have been the best-selling classical album of the past 25 years.The danger in all this is that the playlist becomes almost self-selecting. Every Easter weekend,  in which listeners are invited to vote for the year＊s top 300 most popular pieces of music. Jackson insists that everyone is free to vote for whatever they like, but people invariably vote for the pieces they＊ve heard and know, and each Hall of Fame tends to resemble the previous one. The odd new piece may make an appearance 每 it was Classic FM that pushed  into the regular orchestral repertoire 每 but the feel and the tone is much the same: brand Classic FM.Not that this is any concern to anyone at Classic FM. Suchet is sent the following day＊s running order the evening before and that＊s that. He can try to make one or two changes if there＊s something he particularly wants to play, but everything has to be signed off by his producer. If a piece of music isn＊t on the list or has been played too recently on another show then the answer is invariably no. Does it bother him? ※Not at all,§ says Suchet. ※My producer knows what I like and tries to play to my strengths but it＊s not always possible. Of course I have favourites I＊d like to play 每 I＊d love the chance to play some , but that doesn＊t test well with audiences.§Everything comes back to the audience. Even the stations＊ live shows. Back in 2001, Classic FM launched a partnership with the and in the early days made a point of trying to help promote the orchestra＊s less popular concerts. But the audiences weren＊t best pleased to be sent to hear music they didn＊t always much like, so now the station concentrates instead on helping the orchestra sell out its mainstream repertoire. It＊s a matter of trust.Yet to write Classic FM off as a lowest common denominator station for a conservative audience is to miss the point. Classic FM hasn＊t just sat back and let its audience come to it; it has gone out and shaped people＊s tastes. By tinkering at the edges, both by being less dogmatic about what is and isn＊t considered to be classical music, and by programming mood music shows 每  每 in much the same way as pop radio stations have chill-out hours, it has created a whole new market and audience.There＊s a popular idea that the typical Classic FM listener is someone in their 50s or older, sitting in an armchair wearing a cardy. And there are clearly still plenty of those types around, otherwise P&O have been wasting their money by advertising their cruises on the station. But that＊s only part of the story. These days, the station has 1.2m listeners under the age of 35, many of whom are students.※There is a far bigger audience crossover between us and Radio 1 than there is between us and Radio 3,§ says Jackson. ※We also have a huge digital engagement. Last month our Facebook videos received more than 17m views and our daily Facebook reach is 2m. One week we got more hits than Buzzfeed. Young people don＊t have any preconceptions about how classical music is supposed to enjoyed; they are used to listening to individual tracks so they completely get our approach.§If the future of the station lies in the under-35s, its present is still very much in the hands of the over-60s. Back in the studio,  is getting ready to take over the afternoon show. After a long career on the BBC Breakfast sofa, Turnbull is one of the newest additions to the roster of presenters. But he is an ideal match for the station. Unthreatening, unpatronising and uncomplicated, he doesn＊t pretend to know more than he does and is just happy to give the listeners the music they want to hear.The first two hours of the afternoon are taken up with listeners＊ requests. First the soundtrack from Lord of the Rings and then , for someone from Scotland who has a stressful car journey ahead. Ring in and request a Beethoven late string quartet and you＊ve made a wasted call. Like Suchet, Turnbull is knowledgeable, wry and 每 of course 每 brief. It＊s the music, stupid.  Classic FM＊s 25th Birthday Concert with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Michael Seal is .1. Vaughan Williams: The Lark Ascending 2. Rachmaninov: Piano Concerto No 2 in C 3. Vaughan Williams: Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis4. Elgar: Enigma Variations (includes Nimrod)5. Beethoven: Piano Concerto No 5 in E flat Major op 73 (※Emperor§)6.

"s a rule, I try to avoid blogs and books about teaching practice. They tend to be full of ※strategies§, whingeing about Ofsted and images of teachers with their heads on piles of marking. The problem with educational writing is the same as the problem with the profession itself, and has not changed since the 1960s, when George Dennison derided the statistics, percentages, curriculum changes: ※Everything, in short, but the one true object of all this activity: the children themselves.§ My book, , is a composite account, based on my experience teaching in an inner-city state school, which features many common gripes: observations, governmental interference, data obsession, the end of humanism ＃ and, yes, marking. But I also wanted to depict the antidotes to such soulless technocracy: the joy of teaching zesty, hilarious kids; the humanity; the passing on of some infinite thing. As an English teacher, this list is unapologetically literary. An honourable mention in this context needs to go to Doris Lessing＊s  whose preface to its 1971 edition is a clarion call for the literary autodidact, with this lacerating assessment: ※Ideally, what should be said to every child, repeatedly, throughout his or her school life is something like this: ＆You are in the process of being indoctrinated. We have not yet evolved a system of education that is not a system of indoctrination. We are sorry, but it is the best we can do.＊§In 1969, George Dennison wrote about his experience setting up the First Street school on the Lower East Side in New York. This was a ※free school§ in its purest, libertarian sense, infused with the radical philosophies of AS Neill, John Dewey and Leo Tolstoy. Dennison and his colleagues taught 23 black, white and Puerto Rican kids 每 all from low-income families, many with behavioural issues 每 who are depicted with tenderness and humanity by a graceful and elegant writer of the American old school. The kids read, take the bus, go to a baseball game, talk trash, hang out, fight, learn and grow. This book made me want to become a teacher.Another classic of US literature, this exquisitely melancholy novel became a surprise bestseller in 2013, almost 50 years after it was written. William Stoner is a farm boy who falls in love with books and becomes an academic at the University of Missouri. Williams describes the transformational power of literature, its value in keeping the noisy world out, and the bitchy departmental infighting recognisable to all teachers. To be a teacher was to be ※simply a man to whom his book is true, to whom is given a dignity of art that has little to do with his foolishness or weakness or inadequacy as a man§. A touching and inspiring autobiographical novel about a classically educated West Indian (played with characteristic dignity by Sidney Poitier in the 1967 film) who comes to the East End of London to become a teacher of a class full of unruly, unmotivated ※peasants§. Like Dennison, Braithwaite＊s radical approach involves treating the kids as human beings and leading them out into the world. The kids overcome the ※hateful virus§ of their racism and learn to treat their teacher with respect. ※Sir§ encapsulates how teachers often feel: ※O God, forgive me for the hateful thoughts, because I love them, these brutal, disarming bastards, I love them.§Another teacher committed to education in the Latin sense (: ※to lead out§). In 1930s Edinburgh, Miss Brodie 每 a cultish teacher from the Dead Poets school who behaves with Calvinist assurance that she has been chosen 每 teaches six girls art history, the classics, fascism and adultery. ※Give me a girl at an impressionable age,§ she boasts, ※and she is mine for life§.Prospero is the master of the isle who can tame nature with his ※potent art§. However, he suffers the frustrations and inadequacies of a teacher, as Ariel, Miranda and Caliban test his magic, his fathering skills and his colonial legacy. The latter berates him: ※You taught me language, and my profit on＊t / Is that I learned how to curse.§An inspirational portrait of the architect of , a New York school for disadvantaged kids. The book is indispensable for anyone who wants to understand how to address the deepening inequalities in our cities.  and the film , which features one of the most galling scenes about education, showing children watching the official draw to assign their school places. The lottery of life depends on being one of the lucky few sent to a school like Canada＊s.Here, Socrates sets out his ideal curriculum: men and women should receive the same education, consisting of the basic virtues of wisdom, courage, justice and temperance. And PE, which will help prevent illness and weakness. Philosopher-kings are given further education in ※goodness§: military training, 10 years of maths, further maths, astronomy and music, five years of ※dialectic§ training, then 15 years working as teachers, leading people out of the cave of illusion into the sunlight of knowledge. They finally graduate, at 50, with good PhDs.Robinson is the avuncular guru of creativity in schools, whose videos are some of the most popular on the web (see his  animation and TED talk ). In this book, Robinson develops his theory that the industrialised model of teaching is harmful; and that collaboration, creativity and personalised education are the only way to prepare kids for a future economy that we cannot predict.The pendulum is swinging back to  again. Christodoulou argues that the progressive, collaborative teaching practices beloved by Ofsted are devoid of content and knowledge. Facts and ※drilling§ must return to the classroom. This kind of education does not stifle creativity; indeed, we need restriction to flourish. Shakespeare learned Latin, Greek and history by rote, in what today would likely be considered sterile exercises of memorisation. His plays, shot through with blazing invention, are a testament to the saying ※discovery favours the well-prepared mind§.Forty-nine effective techniques to help new teachers create excellent classroom management. OK, it is a how-to book full of ※strategies§, but every department worth its salt has a copy of this lying around, so teachers can dip into it during a free period to find a whizzy plan for the next lesson.

"A spin-off from the acclaimed  stealth adventures, Death of the Outsider pits popular background character Billie Lurk against the God-like figure at the centre of the first two titles. After , Life is Strange: Before the Storm and , it＊s another big title with an intriguing female protagonist, and the putrid grandeur of this steampunk universe is always worth wallowing in.In development for several years, the much-anticipated platform adventure boasts a thrillingly authentic 1930s cartoon aesthetic, inspired by the classic works of Disney and Fleischer Studios. The titular protagonist must explore a surreal world filled with bizarre, cavorting monsters while attempting to repay a debt to the devil. Playable alone or with a friend, expect a wild, unpredictable ride.Four years ago, Indie developer Tom Francis built a huge fanbase for his excellent 2D stealth puzzler . Now he＊s back with a top-down sci-fi strategy adventure, where players hijack a series of procedurally generated spacecraft, filled with enemies, gadgets and loot. Through the intricate interlocking systems, new challenges and adventures emerge in unpredictable and challenging ways making this a truly cerebral combat experience. Not a game, but a games machine 每 a miniaturised version of the legendary  which comes complete with 20 old favourites including Super Mario Bros, Yoshi＊s Island and Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. For ?70 you also get two controllers for those competitive Mario Kart and Street Fighter II sessions, and an HDMI cable so it＊ll plug straight into your modern TV. Nintendo has even thrown in Star Fox II, the space shooter sequel that was never released at the time. A retro gaming feast. Everyone expected a conventional fantasy hack＊n＊slash game when  arrived three years ago. Instead, the game＊s ingenious , which gave enemy soldiers the ability to recall fights with the player and seek revenge, made it a truly engrossing and individual thriller. The sequel promises a more complex take on the Nemesis concept, as well as allowing you to build an army and partake in epic siege battles. The subversive cartoon remains as divisive as ever, but most critics agreed that Ubisoft＊s 2014 video game tie-in, , was a genuinely funny role-playing adventure. The sequel sticks to the same combination of familiar characters and vague video game parody, this time involving a league of stupidly named superheroes formed by Cartman to combat the town＊s growing criminal underworld. Expect gross-out humour that will delight giggling teenagers (and giggling teenagers-at-heart).

Muscle-head protagonist BJ Blazkowicz is back as well, building a Resistance army to defeat the occupying forces 每 who now have advanced laser weapons and giant killer robots. Don＊t ask, just grab a laser gun and join in.Two interesting things about the follow-up to EA＊s stylish and well-executed Star Wars shooter, : it now has a full single-player campaign; and that campaign follows not a rebel hero but an Imperial pilot, Iden Versio. She witnesses the destruction of the second Death Star and sets out for revenge against the Alliance. Added to this is a deeper multiplayer mode that features maps, vehicles and characters from all eras of the Star Wars franchise. Will likely prove irresistible to fans as they await the eighth movie.Parisian developer Dontnod Entertainment made its name with supernatural teen adventure  每 now it＊s taking its mature and nuanced narrative design to a post-first world war London over run with vampires. You play as a recently turned doctor, Jonathan Reid, who must search the foggy city for unwilling blood donors while battling undead gangs. It＊s dripping in atmosphere and loaded with contemporary detail. 																																											"
"here are actors you turn to when you＊re looking for someone to save the world, and those who can make audiences swoon with just one careless smile. Then there are the men who are at war with themselves 每 and no one does that quite as well as Richard Dormer.From the garrulous, troubled Terri Hooley in sleeper hit  to murderous sheriff Dan Anderssen in  and Game of Thrones＊ much-resurrected warrior Beric Dondarrion, Dormer specialises in tormented souls. ※It＊s true!§ he laughs when I point this out over lunch. ※Dan is destroyed, Terri had problems, and every time Beric dies he loses a part of himself so he＊s constantly mourning the human he used to be ＃§ His latest role only cements this reputation. Gabriel Markham, the lead detective in tricky new BBC drama Rellik [killer, backwards] is both a dogged cop and the survivor of an acid attack. He＊s a man whose damaged exterior is matched by a riven interior. Dormer admits the part was physically and mentally gruelling. The prosthetic makeup he wears over much of his face and neck took two hours to put on. ※You overheat wearing it, and you can always feel it. It＊s pretty grim.§ And the timeline of the narrative, which plays out entirely in reverse, was equally challenging. ※Because the story goes backwards you＊re aiming towards the person you were before this began rather the one you will be, which is a bit of a head fuck. It really gets under your skin.§Filming Game of Thrones is arduous in a different way. ※The episode  took five months ＃ it just went on and on. The fight sequence took five weeks to film and lasts five minutes. Just climbing on the dragon took maybe a month 每 and on screen it＊s an eye-blink.§ If the cast and crew weren＊t so lovely, he says, it would be awful work, because ※it＊s not nice being soaking wet and very hot and yet very cold at the same time and trudging up and down the most beautiful glaciers in the world 每 but not even being able to look because you feel so tired.§His downtime was spent playing world domination game Risk with his co-stars. ※There were a lot of arguments, mainly because Iain Glen [Jorah Mormont] is so competitive. He would just sit there going ＆Noooo why? Why are you all attacking me?＊.§ So who was the best at it? He doesn＊t hesitate: ※Kit Harington [Jon Snow].§But his biggest issue was trying not to set fire to stunt men while filming. ※Because Beric only has one eye, I＊d be temporarily blind and swinging the flaming sword 每 which is real, not CGI ＃ every time I hit them they＊d go whumpf and guys would charge in with extinguishers.§ A small price to pay for wielding Game of Thrones＊ most memorable weapon: ※※Let＊s face it, I have the coolest weapon on the show. It＊s better than a lightsaber ＃§The Star Wars reference is not accidental. When he was cast in , director Alex Graves drew comparisons with Alec Guinness and Beric, who has come back from the dead six times, certainly has more than a touch of the mystical sage about him. Dormer describes him as Obi-Wan Kenobi after a night on the tiles: ※He carries his burden very well and is lightly philosophical about it.§Raised in Lisburn just outside Belfast, Dormer won a scholarship to Rada but admits his experience was mixed at best. ※While Rada is an amazing place there＊s something unnatural about it,§ he says. ※I didn＊t really trust it. I remember walking into a received pronunciation class and they were all going ＆How Now Brown Cow＊ and I said ＆Do you huv a spur churr?＊ Everyone burst out laughing, and the teacher said, ＆That＊s how not to do it＊.§Coming from Northern Ireland led to an identity crisis of sorts: he speaks of feeling like a second-class citizen who didn＊t know where he was from. ※I grew up with the idea that someone might hate you if they knew what religion you were; being afraid to open my mouth because my accent might make people think something about me. Or even if they didn＊t, would they understand me?§He dealt with it by refusing to take certain roles. ※There was that sense that as soon as a Northern Irish person opens their mouth you go ＆ah terrorist＊ so I refused to do TV and film. Instead, I did theatre for 20 years.§ The switch to screen came at 40, when he acquired a new agent who gave him confidence that he could make it. He stopped doing theatre for a year and did loads of auditions. But didn＊t get anywhere. ※I was 40 thinking ＆This is ridiculous 每 my career is over before it even started＊.§ And then Good Vibrations turned up, a script good enough to make him to break his own rule about Troubles-set films. He broke it again for the propulsive . He hasn＊t stopped working since.Having come to his screen career late, is there any role he＊d love to play? His answer? Star Trek, no question. ※It＊s all about friendship and compassion,§ he says. ※Gene Roddenberry is one of the greatest guys who ever lived because he gave us hope that the future might be bright and we could accept one another for whoever we were, even if we were alien. That＊s an amazing message, don＊t you think?§ 																																											"
"Luck was barely on speaking terms with Grant Hart. When, in 1986, his group H邦sker D邦 became the first from America＊s teeming hardcore-punk scene to sign to a major label, Hart could scarcely celebrate 每 he＊d been misdiagnosed HIV-positive, and believed his days were numbered. A year later, H邦sker D邦 toured what would be their final album, Warehouse: Songs and Stories 每 a tour overshadowed by the suicide of the group＊s manager, David Savoy, the night before they set off on the road. Hart began taking methadone in an attempt to kick the heroin addiction that was souring his already tempestuous relationship with his bandmates, guitarist/singer Bob Mould and bassist Greg Norton. But as their tour van reached Columbia, Missouri, Hart discovered that his bottle of methadone had broken, and he wouldn＊t have enough to see out the rest of the tour. Hart swore that, even despite his withdrawal symptoms, he＊d be able to play the rest of the dates; nevertheless, Mould cancelled the rest of the tour, and H邦sker D邦 never recorded or played together again.On 14 September, Hart lost his battle with cancer at the age of 56.Formed in Minneapolis in 1978, H邦sker D邦 expertly fused the velocity of punk rock with the melody of purest pop, and a powerful streak of angst that would differentiate them from all the other thrash-punk acts touring the states during the Reagan years. As a forthcoming long-awaited box set, , proves, even in their earliest days the group＊s competing singers, Mould (guitars) and Hart (drums), possessed stronger songwriting chops than their angry adolescent contemporaries; their debut album, a 1981 live set aptly titled Land Speed Record, proved they could thrash faster and harder than anyone.But it was when H邦sker D邦 slowed their velocity and allowed their pop sensibility to come to the surface that their genius shone brightest. Their 1984 release Zen Arcade 每 a double album recorded on a shoestring in a single weekend 每 was a furious masterpiece, a concept album of sorts following the misadventures of an abused punk kid who leaves his broken home but finds himself preyed upon by the denizens of the street. It contained some of the group＊s most violent, painful music 每 the second side is a sustained blast of punk catharsis, and titles such as The Biggest Lie and Masochism World spelled out the grim subject matter 每 but also their sweetest, most poignant pop yet. The competition between Mould and Hart had begun, pushing each songwriter to best his partner: Mould served up the anthemic confusion of Something I Learned Today, Hart responded with the acoustic confessional Never Talking To You Again; Hart penned , a tale of a junkie prostitute＊s fatal overdose that was among the best he＊d ever write, and Mould replied with Whatever, a heart-rendingly vulnerable confession that found the gay singer-songwriter howling: ※Mum and dad, I＊m sorry ＃/ I＊m not the son you wanted / but what did you expect? / I made my world of happiness to combat your neglect.§And so H邦sker D邦 continued, for four more years and four more albums (and the last one was another double), a blistering production rate that saw their gift for melody mature alongside their lyricism, from the buzz saw bubblegum of 1985＊s New Day Rising, to the dark, sugary pop of the same year＊s Flip Your Wig. And after the group left hardcore punk label SST Records for Warner Bros, for 1986＊s Candy Apple Grey and the epic end-of-adolescence crises of 1987＊s Warehouse: Songs and Stories, many tipped the group for actual, proper commercial success, to match their growing critical acclaim. It never came 每 but their metallicised pop would lay the groundwork for Nirvana＊s breakthrough with , in 1991.By then, neither of H邦sker D邦＊s songwriters seemed in a position to savour the reflected glory. Mould followed H邦sker D邦 with two powerful solo albums, the acoustic reveries of 1988＊s Workbook, and 1990＊s pulverisingly dark Black Sheets of Rain. The latter album sold barely 7,000 copies on release, and he was dumped by his new label, Virgin.  as the rising grunge tide carried many of the scene＊s primary influences to newfound success, however; a new trio, Sugar, made good on H邦sker D邦＊s unfulfilled commercial promise, their two-and-a-half albums finding him on the finest melodic form of his career, and winning him a whole new audience, many of whom would follow him through his subsequent post-Sugar solo excursions.Hart, meanwhile, cut a solo album, , containing two of his very best songs 每 The Main, a heartbreaking shanty chronicling his struggles with heroin, and 2541, a break-up song that was widely read as a metaphor for H邦sker D邦＊s demise 每 before forming a new group, Nova Mob. But Nova Mob＊s 1991 debut album, an ambitious time-travel concept album involving former Nazi scientists and the eruption of Mount Vesuvius titled , was barely released before the collapse of the Rough Trade label stole it from the shelves. After cutting an excellent second, self-titled album for a new label, fate intervened again, a car accident while gigging in Germany scuppering the tour, and ultimately ending the group.Hart kept a low profile for the rest of the decade, surfacing again in 1999 with a second solo album, Good News for the Modern Man, an album of haunting, bewitched pop, from the Spector-ish Think It Over Now, to the wracked but dignified balladry of You Don＊t Have To Tell Me Now, and followed it up a decade later with Hot Wax, recorded in part with members of . He cut a fourth solo album, , in 2013, another ambitious conceptual piece, this time inspired by Milton＊s Paradise Lost, and scoring some of the best reviews of his career.The success balanced out more misfortune in his private life, not least a house fire in 2011 that left him homeless and destroyed many of his possessions, including the beloved Gibson guitar he＊d been playing since H邦sker D邦＊s demise. Hart and Mould had remained on bad terms for many of the years that followed the split, reuniting only once, and fleetingly, at a benefit concert for Karl Mueller of fellow Minneapolis rockers Soul Asylum in 2004, playing two H邦sker D邦 songs and warning attendees not to expect any further collaborations. But in recent years, relations  to the point where they joined forces to begin legal proceedings to win back their back catalogue from SST Records, so they could reissue it for the 21st century. The first fruits of the project, Savage Young D邦, collects material recorded before they signed to SST; it is unclear if they have yet succeeded in regaining possession of the tapes for their 1980s masterpieces.In July this year, Hart was the subject of an emotional tribute show at Minneapolis＊s Hook and Ladder Theater and Lounge, featuring members of Soul Asylum and Babes in Toyland, and even old H邦sker bassist Greg Norton. Hart himself closed the night, with a performance of some of his most beloved songs, though his gaunt appearance let those in the audience know he was struggling with his health. ※Emotions ran close to the surface,§ , covering the show, ※and many tears were shed.§ It＊s fitting, somehow, that Hart＊s final public appearance was in the company of musicians who he＊d inspired, playing the songs that continue to move audiences, and will continue to inspire and move in the years that will follow. Luck might＊ve been a stranger to Grant Hart, but his talent, and the humanity that informed his great, great music, were in abundance. 																																											"
" dead child lies, bone white and fine-featured, between its mother＊s thighs. The mother is a hulking creature, something from a nightmare, caught in what is every parent＊s worst nightmare. Her body has the heavy muscles of Mary in , but here grief has turned her into an animal rather than a saint. Shadows of sorrow spread across her naked limbs. Her mouth is fixed on her child＊s chest. She seems to want to suck her offspring back inside her.There＊s no air in Woman With Dead Child, K?the Kollwitz＊s most famous image of war. The picture＊s edges press in on its subjects like the mother＊s despair. Four different versions form a crescendo of anguish in the final room of Birmingham＊s Ikon Gallery, the awful tableaux repeated with varying background tints and denser shadows.I want to make a joke, to relieve this awkward lump in my throat, but there is no room for jokes in Kollwitz.  The prints, part of a show marking the 150th anniversary of Kollwitz＊s birth, were created between the end of the 19th century and over the course of two world wars. They contain scores of worn faces, broken backs, hungry, hollow-eyed mobs and sick babies. These are lives she saw first-hand as an artist and doctor＊s wife in Berlin＊s downtrodden Prenzlauer Berg, an area where cheap labour fed the city＊s fast-paced industrialisation. The surgery was in the family house, and so was the studio where she taught herself print-making. It took up less room than painting, which, against the odds as a woman, she had studied. The granddaughter of a radical Lutheran pastor, Kollwitz was raised on social duty and egalitarianism. It＊s the spine of her work, the body of the people being forever abused by the system. In Peasants＊ War, one of her print cycles on the theme of revolution, a man is all but reduced to a beast, pulling his plough on all fours. His prone form is echoed by a woman abandoned in leaves nearby, an image of rape. People seem literally stamped down, the earth ready to envelop them. Such images have all the righteous horror of great protest art. Yet while Kollwitz responded to some of the 20th century＊s major upheavals, her sensibility doesn＊t quite chime with our own. There is none of the absurdity that lifts Goya＊s or Picasso＊s takes on old age and war. Her campaigning vision is a black tunnel of mourning. Critics have grumbled about it being one-note. Though she spent her formative months in Paris in the early 1900s, the radicalism of the modernists seems not to have touched her. She is a child of the 19th century, drawn to realist work such as Zola＊s novels and printmaker Max Klinger＊s urban parables about the woman＊s plight. But such questions about her place in art history melt in the face of the work itself. Her portraits of ordinary Prenzlauer Berg women, conjured from scores of expressive lines and smudgy shadows in etchings and lithographs, have the majesty of figures carved in stone, their features chiselled by hard knocks. Staring into the middle distance, their gaze is turned inward on troubles we can only guess at. The triumph is Bust of a Working Woman With Blue Shawl, a Madonna for the industrial age, with shadowed downcast eyes and set mouth.We meet the artist herself in the first room, as an old woman with a penetrating look to rival Rembrandt＊s late self-portraits. Kollwitz was only in her 40s and 50s in many of the careworn images she created of herself, yet the death of her youngest, cherished son Peter had, she believed, left her prematurely aged. He＊s the boy model in Woman With Dead Child, lying for hours in her lap while she worked, reassuring her, according to her diaries, that ※it will be very beautiful§. It was another 11 years before his terrible death in 1914, shot down as soon as he was sent to the front in the first world war. Too young to enlist without his parents＊ permission, he was only able to go after Kollwitz pressed her husband to sign the relevant papers.While her son＊s end meant her later output was driven by guilt and grief, death was her lifelong creative companion, frequently tearing her work in opposite directions, a thing of arbitrary cruelty and sensual appeal. Its push and pull is given a full-blooded, ghoulish literalism in 1910＊s Death and Woman, a creepy gothic threesome where a voluptuous naked mother struggles, apparently in ecstasy, between a skeleton and a baby. The theme got full rein in a late series of lithographs in the 1930s, of which just one telling image is displayed here. It＊s a self-portrait: Death＊s hand touches the artist＊s shoulder and she turns her cheek towards it like an old lover.																																											"
"elevision ripped from the headlines doesn＊t usually fare too well. When Homeland delved in, there was an embarrassing moment , while Scandal＊s treatment of real-life events was so ham-fisted that other show＊s parodies . The latest TV trend involves the idea of real life directly informing TV, but takes things up a notch by centering it around one of the most divisive subjects in US politics: immigration.In the past two weeks, three new projects have found homes at major US channels, and they follow half a dozen more which were given the green light in the past 12 months. Last October, it was confirmed that the memoir of the Orange is the New Black actor Diane Guerrero would be made into a series. The show , meanwhile, will focus on a group of siblings whose parents are deported 每 a situation that Guerrero really experienced when her parents were sent to Colombia.The network leading the way is the CW, best known for Gossip Girl and Gilmore Girls. More recently, though, the channel＊s crown jewel has become Jane the Virgin, the telenovela remake starring . And it＊s Rodriguez who is executive-producing the Daca drama Illegal, which follows a student who finds out he is undocumented, for the channel. (Casa will also be on the CW, while Rodriguez is bringing Have Mercy 每 a remake of the German immigration drama Dr Illegal 每 to CBS.)For Rodriguez, this is a chance for more stories involving Latinos to be seen and heard. ※When we talk about inclusivity, there are a lot of communities that aren＊t being discussed,§ she recently told . ※And the Latino community, we have waves of Latinos doing projects 每 but do they get exposure?§Immigration dramas have proved to be  in the US to have their stories on the small screen.  was adapted from the memoir of the ※food personality§ Eddie Huang, who detailed his life growing up in America after moving from Taiwan. That show has balanced ideas of assimilation with the pressure of new and old cultural norms colliding (Huang＊s love of hip-hop perplexes his parents) and pulled off something enlightening, but above all funny.Most of these new shows have a comedic element: Illegal is described as ※an edgy Latino version of The Wonder Years§, while another new show, Welcome to Maine, is set to find the funny as a Syrian refugee enters a rural community. But such sensitive subject matter can easily leave networks in trouble. A comedy called Mail Order Family, which focused on the travails of a young woman from the Philippines, was recently cancelled after an outcry.Dissecting rather than reinforcing stereotypes seems to be a prerequisite to making these shows a success. Rafael Agustin, who is working with Rodriguez on Illegal and was undocumented himself,  with the LA Times about why these shows need to be made. ※It＊s important to understand the complexities of immigration. When people see a face to these issues, it＊s different. It doesn＊t become villainizing. We＊re not fake, shadow people taking jobs.§With creators who are immigrants themselves telling real stories, the next wave of immigration could be coming from the TV.

"eath to poetry, long live science!§ So cries  in ＊s new play about the period when the Swedish dramatist renounced drama to pursue his obsession with alchemy and the occult. But, while Brenton＊s play has a strange fascination, it seems unsure whether to view Strindberg＊s bizarre experiments as a sign of madness or a necessary part of his artistic development. Brenton seizes on the month of February, 1896, when Strindberg was holed up a Paris hotel and dedicating himself to alchemy 每 a process recalled in his autobiographical novel, Inferno. In Brenton＊s version the solitary writer is haunted by three women who become yet more obstacles in his scientific progress. First Lola, a provocative cleaner, hints at seduction while threatening to have him thrown out of the hotel. Then Strindberg＊s first wife, the Finnish Siri von Essen, turns up to re-enact the traumas of their marriage while begging him to help restore her acting career. Finally his second wife, the Austrian Frida Uhl, arrives to warn him against Siri and her plans to certify him insane. In 90 minutes, Brenton manages to condense much of Strindberg＊s personal history, and his life is shown to echo his plays 每 such as when he is confined to a straitjacket like the hero of The Father. Brenton also writes with his usual aphoristic vividness, as when Strindberg is told that his love/disgust conflict about sex stems from his being a lapsed Protestant, or when he announces that ※plays should always be written in anger§. But this play seems to derive from two totally contradictory impulses: on the one hand, confirming that Strindberg was insanely paranoid and, on the other, suggesting that alchemy is akin to the artistic process and stimulated the productive experimentalism of the dramatist＊s later years.＊s production, ushering in a new regime that will later bring us Brenton＊s version of Miss Julie, is, however, vividly done. Jasper Britton, with wild eyes and unruly locks, admirably suggests that Strindberg is a man in the grip of an id谷e fixe and tormented by his shifting attitude towards women. Susannah Harker as the aristocratic Siri, Gala Gordon as the beguiling Frida and Laura Morgan as the pragmatic Lola also rightly play his various partners from their own spirited point of view. However, the play left me feeling that Brenton, while enlightening us about Strindberg＊s alchemical phase, had not quite succeeded in turning it into theatrical gold.

"ou know you＊re witnessing something special when it＊s 7am and a school marching band is battering the hell out of their drums while a person of indeterminate gender cavorts near-naked in glittery hot pants with an enormous psychedelic peace sign strapped to his/her/their back, as you and everyone around you belts out Curtis Mayfield＊s civil rights anthem Move On Up.And that was just a tiny fragment of Taylor Mac＊s astonishing miesterwerk, A 24-Decade History of Popular Music. The show takes you through American history a decade at a time, from 1776 to the present day, using the popular songs of each era to present an alternative history of the USA 每 one which venerates the outsiders, eccentrics and visionaries who built the nation＊s counterculture.At 246 songs and 24 hours long, it has only been performed once in full without breaks 每 in New York last October, an epic performance  (and yes, I stayed awake, apart from an hour＊s nap I took during the 1940s, in a communal bed situated on a balcony overlooking the stage). But next month the Melbourne arts festival will get A 24-Decade History in four six-hour chapters 每 the first time the whole work has been performed in Australia. (For those who can＊t afford the hefty $700 to watch the full show,from Monday you can buy two-chapter packages at $399每 and Mac will also be playing highlights from the show at two other festival events, the ※§ and the .)Whatever the portions in which it＊s delivered, Mac＊s show is an unforgettable kaleidoscope of performance art, cabaret, music gig, burlesque, puppetry, pageant, immersive theatre, poetry 每 in fact it＊s hard to think of an art form that it doesn＊t somehow encompass (film, maybe?). Mac, who is bringing a 31-person team to Australia and will have 125 performers cast around it 每 including acrobats, burlesque dancers and two choirs is looking forward to taking the show, and its 24 costume changes, back overseas. ※Someone like me doesn＊t normally get to represent America, especially in this time of Trump,§ Mac says, on the phone from New York. ※It＊s nice to say, ＆No, the crazy drag queen is the thing that represents America.＊§Born and brought up in California, Mac studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Art in New York and wrote judy＊s first play, The Hot Month, in 1999. Judy is the pronoun Mac has used for the past few years, in homage to Judy Garland. ※I was getting introduced onstage and written about, and some people would say ＆he＊ and others would say ＆she＊ and neither really felt right for the art I was making,§ Mac explains. ※My friend Justin Vivian Bond started using the gender pronoun ＆v＊, and that made me think I could choose my own. ※The other part is that I＊m an artist, and it＊s part of my job to make people think outside their norms a little bit. And I wanted a gender pronoun that was fun, and that immediately emasculates you 每 because you can＊t roll your eyes and say ＆judy＊ without being camp.§ Though still an unknown quantity to the mainstream, Mac has performed all over the world and won awards by the score; A 24-Decade History was shortlisted for the Pulitzer prize. Mac was in Sydney, touring the show Comparison is Violence: Or the Ziggy Stardust Meets Tiny Tim Songbook, when the inspiration for the marathon struck.※Martin Sharp, a visual artist and a pop artist who was friends with [musician] Tiny Tim came to the show, and he was telling me about how Tiny Tim had created this 24-hour show as a fundraiser for a park outside Sydney,§ Mac says. ※I must have misheard him or misinterpreted it because in the research I＊ve done since, the show wasn＊t that. But it didn＊t matter, because what I heard was the solution to the form that I was looking for. ※I thought, ＆Oh, that＊s what I want to do 每 I want the show to be so long that the audience is falling apart, I＊m falling apart, we＊re all falling apart and we＊re also building bonds.＊§ A 24-Decade History, Mac says, is ultimately about the communities in American history who have done the same: redefining themselves after having been torn apart 每 particularly the generation of gay men ravaged by Aids.Involving a whole phalanx of supporting musicians, dancers and helpmeets (some of whom assist Mac＊s trips to the toilet during the marathon), A 24-Decade History is an incredible challenge for the performer 每 not least because Mac has to learn the lyrics to 246 songs (※It＊s tricky, but that＊s the job!§). Its subtitle 每 ※a radical faerie realness ritual§ 每 is an invocation to explore the complexity of life.※The rituals we have are sporting events and the church, and they ask you to be one thing, to worship one god or to root for one team,§ Mac says. ※We don＊t have rituals that allow us to express the full range of ourselves. I really think of the show as a ritual sacrifice, and what you＊re sacrificing is your obstinate sense of self. We＊re going through this history together, we＊ve got the onslaught of history, all this weight on our shoulders, and what are we going to do with it?§That question is more pertinent than ever in the wake of , a flashpoint set off by the removal of a statue to Confederate general Robert E Lee. A 24-Decade History gleefully subverts the story of America as traditionally told by the colonialist oppressors. For instance, in one section there＊s a wrestling bout between the queer poet Walt Whitman and Stephen Foster, who wrote American minstrel songs including Camptown Races. Mac plays Whitman, an audience member plays Foster, and it＊s all refereed by Tigger: a man in a jockstrap with an interesting genital piercing.※We have all these minstrel songs in the show,§ Mac says. ※We don＊t just sing My Old Kentucky Home 每 we＊re going to tear that song apart.§ Many other songs are subverted, such as Snakeskin Cowboys by Republican favourite Ted Nugent, which Mac turns into a slow dance, requiring audience members to dance with someone of the same gender. Like Confederate statues, racist minstrel songs are evidence of the oppression embedded in American culture which A 24-Decade History roots out and examines. It＊s not a golden oldies-style review.※All those songs we use to disrupt something 每 except for maybe Purple Rain. That＊s the only one we give ＊em.§The New York marathon performance happened the day after , and its technicolour queerness seemed to stand as a rebuke to 每 and shelter from 每 the toxic masculine heterosexuality his presidency represents. Nonetheless, Mac stresses that his themes are far broader than identity politics. ※I think my work is about heterogeneity,§ he says. Even Mac＊s 2015 play Hir 每 about a marine who returns to the family home to discover that his sister is transitioning and his bullying father, recovering from a stroke, is being fed oestrogen and dressed in women＊s clothes by his mother 每 is, Mac says, about more than just gender. ※There is one line in Hir which is: ＆Gender isn＊t radical, it＊s not even progressive, it＊s just an everyday occurrence＊ 每 so basically, get over it. To me, identity politics are always a subplot; I＊m not interested in it enough to ever make it the point, because I want to change my identity! I always say that my gender is performer, and performing gender.§ . Mac hopes that A 24-Decade History will also resonate in Australia, despite its explicit dealing with American history. Australia has its own history of racial oppression after all, which continues to be suffered by Indigenous people; and the show＊s challenge to historical narratives also seem particularly pertinent, as Australia＊s interminable row about marriage equality rumbles slowly to a conclusion.None of this is new, Mac says: ※The tactics that were used to stop Hillary Clinton from getting elected were the same used in the 1780s to stop women creating the women＊s lib movement.§ Similarly, the performer suggests, the US＊s alt-right thugs have merely exposed an ugly face that＊s been long-familiar to America＊s minorities, but which white liberals preferred to ignore. ※Trump is doing his whole thing, like ＆Oh, the Tiki torches have come out!＊ But they were always there,§ Mac says. ※The rest of the country is seeing the reveal of the underneath, because Trump is taking charge. But he hasn＊t really taken charge 每 just for now. We＊ll get that fucker out.§ A 24-Hour Decade will certainly outlast the Trump administration: it＊s set to be turned into a 24-part series for a streaming service, which will combine concert footage and new material, and there will also be a live album. Mac, meanwhile, is moving on from his epic, too 每 judy has written two new plays, is working on a third, and there＊s also an intriguing-sounding project in the works which Mac describes as a ※performance art theatre movement tone poem which is nothing but entrances and exits performed by an ensemble of clowns§.Mac isn＊t concerned about the prospect of following up such a landmark show. ※I＊m not worried about this being the defining moment of my life. I hope it is! It should be! It doesn＊t mean I＊m going to stop ... I＊m glad the thing which is defining my artistic life at this point is a total joy.§ 																																											"
"ersistent drizzle and umbrella-wrecking winds are not the best weather for a waterborne 30th birthday party, but ＊s celebration went ahead regardless. The ensemble was conceived in 1987 by Simon Rattle as a new-music offshoot of the , and though many of its players are current or former members of the orchestra, it has carved out a niche as one of the UK＊s leading specialist ensembles.The specially commissioned birthday piece was a collaborative effort between three composers, resulting in a canal serenade to be performed on narrowboats at the convergence of three of Birmingham＊s main waterways in the centre of the city.  contributed Music for Barges, in which a solo trombonist (Tony Howe of BCMG) summoned electronic responses (supplied by Beast, Birmingham University＊s resident electronic ensemble) from loudspeakers on three boats approaching the junction from different directions. ＊s Share the Space was a setting for voices () and percussion of words taken from canalside signage, while ＊s Birmingham Canal Songs, with tenor  accompanied by accordion and percussion, set a specially commissioned poem by  evoking life on the canals.The three pieces were interleaved, but it seemed rather disjointed and never really coalesced into a convincing musical experience.

The call-and-response effects of Kyriakides＊ composition disappeared into the wind, while the sight of the members of Ex Cathedra muffled in waterproofs, and Andreas Borregaard playing his accordion from under a plastic poncho just about summed things up.BCMG returned to more familiar 每 and drier 每 territory in the CBSO Centre for the second half of the celebration, a short programme, conducted by Emilio Pom芍rico, that was something of a manifesto for the group＊s new artistic director . There was another piece by Ad芍mek, Sinuous Voices, which translates vocal lines 每 a Czech prayer and a New Caledonian lullaby 每 into strikingly bold instrumental writing, and a wonderfully volatile performance of ＊ Into the Blue, teetering between high-register and gravelly grumblings in the extreme bass. Best of all was the most lucid performance that I＊ve heard of ＊s ※...zwei Gef邦hle...§, Musik mit Leonardo, with Peter Hoare and Paul Carey Jones as the perfectly dovetailed speakers, and tinglingly precise instrumental playing under Pom芍rico.

" am in , having never been to this lovely city before. Perhaps it is an illusion, but some parts of downtown feel the way : an old-fashioned friendliness with cosmopolitan charm. And the feelgood factor is promoted by something I have never encountered at any other festival on this scale: volunteers. Outside every venue an army of smiley,  who do their level best to help you with information and directions. I sometimes find myself prefacing questions with ※Sorry to bother you?＃§ just for the verbal TLC of them replying: ※Oh, ! It＊s no bother !§ When have I ever experienced this level of civic helpfulness?Maybe in the Apple Store, with the  at the , although they are trying to sell you stuff that will need to be upgraded sooner than you think. But then it hit me. The London Olympics of 2012. That was the last time I walked past  wearing T-shirts who really were trying to make your life easier. And did. With a smile. I＊m tempted to demand some publicly funded programme for year-round T-shirted volunteers in every British city, but the strain of niceness might cause them to crack and kill someone. Anyway, this is a lovely novelty.It＊s not all smiles here in Toronto actually 每 a media-diplomatic froideur has developed, centred around the figure of Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher, author and former Daily Telegraph owner who served three years in a US prison for fraud, but has returned to be a  in conservative political circles. The website  linked to his dismissive and outdated attitudes to indigenous Canadian peoples. It begins: ※Conrad Black has been found dead in his rented Toronto home. Due to a decade-long slide into relative penury, and the impending demise of his vanity project, the National Post, his death is of little importance to Canadians.§Some at the National Post 每 which Black founded in 1998 每 are ; Black himself has coolly called it ※bilge§. Meanwhile, in his own , Black says that ※racism is dying, yet hateful people are still accusing non-racists of it§, and says of President Trump that ※the accusation that he has sympathy for Nazis or the KKK is a monstrous falsehood unsupported by a scintilla of evidence§.Black does not appear to be aware of Trump＊s comment that there were ※very fine people§ at the Charlottesville nationalist march 每 which perhaps counts as just such a scintilla. Conrad Black continues to be a weird dark cloud in the sunny skies of Canadian equanimity.The sheer niceness of Canada has been reinforced by news of a Toronto-based dog welfare charity called Redemption Paws that has been on an epic journey to storm-hit Houston on a quest to rescue dogs stranded in shelters. They got more than 50 shivering dogs out of there 每 from great danes to chihuahuas 每 and , where the charity received more than 2,000 offers of adoption.But the most heartbreaking moment came when the dogs＊ three handlers, who had looked after them all the way back from Texas, had to say goodbye. ※Just having three grown men, sitting in a van, bawling their eyes out was something that I was not going to forget any time soon,§ a volunteer called Curtis Cluett told reporters.A film with Owen Wilson, Adam Sandler and Kevin Hart must surely be in pre-production.

"n the often-woolly world of personal development, Gretchen Rubin is a practical and grounded sort. She doesn＊t even 每 shock 每 like meditation. Rubin has spent the past decade researching and writing about happiness. A former lawyer, it was her fifth book,  written in 2009 每 for which she spent a year testing different theories about how to live a more fulfilled life 每 that became a bestseller and made her a star of the self-help world (she also runs a popular ).Her latest book, , develops ideas first explored in 2015＊s , in which she looked at how happiness and habits were linked. ※[People] wanted to run,§ she says, ※but for some reason they couldn＊t make themselves exercise. Or they wanted to write a novel in their free time, but somehow they weren＊t doing it. It was trying to figure out why people did and didn＊t break habits.§She came up with her own personality framework 每 the idea being that each of us fits into one of four characteristics she calls the four tendencies. Rubin claims it explains the reasons behind why we do what we do, based on how different people respond to expectations 每 either outer ones (from, for example, a boss at work) to inner ones (things you want to do for yourself). According to Rubin＊s categories, ※upholders§ easily do what is asked of them by themselves and others, while ※obligers§ need accountability. ※Questioners§ need to know why they＊re doing something and ※rebels§ resist expectations. She says she truly felt that ※I＊d uncovered a law of nature: human nature§.After Better Than Before came out, Rubin says, she was, ※deluged with questions§ about this idea. Thousands took her  to work out what type they were, and she started to wonder if our tendency had much more influence over our lives than whether or not we could stick to a diet. ※It＊s related to habits, but it＊s much bigger than that,§ she says on the phone from her home in New York. ※It might also shape something such as having a fight with a co-worker, or having a better way to communicate with your child.§The result is her new book, which explores her theory further, and provides advice on how to deal with the four types. She says the failure to understand other people＊s tendencies can be responsible for everything from relationship breakdowns to failing public health campaigns, and that working with other people＊s tendencies can improve the way bosses and employees relate; help doctors encourage their patients to take control of their health, and help teachers get the best from students.The biggest thing she has learned in more than a decade of thinking and writing about happiness, she says, is that ※there is no one-size-fits-all solution. We can only be happy, healthy, creative and productive if we take into account our own nature, our own values and interests. The question is: what kind of person am I, what works for me, what do I care about?§ Even so, Rubin is game for creating rules and lists (she＊s an upholder). What, then, are some of the things she has learned on her quest for a happier life?In The Happiness Project, Rubin created ※12 commandments§ by which to live her life, including ※act the way I want to feel§ and ※enjoy the process§ 每 but she stresses that someone else＊s list will probably be different. ※My first personal commandment is to ＆Be Gretchen＊, because in the end there is no one best practice, there is no best way,§ she says. ※When I started, I thought I would find the secret [to happiness]. There are universal things 每 relationships make people happier. But in terms of should you get up early, or stay up late? Are you more creative if you＊re in a messy environment or a simple environment? It＊s so much about who you are.§ found that learning to do something new could be stressful and frustrating to begin with, but paid off in terms of greater overall happiness. ※I thought ＆oh no, I like familiarity and mastery＊,§ says Rubin. ※I just felt like it wouldn＊t be true for me, but I have become a huge believer in the power of novelty and challenge and how this is a big engine of happiness.§※Another thing that surprised me is the degree to which outer order contributes to inner calm. Over and over people tell me that if they get control over the stuff of their life, they feel more in control of their life generally. They feel more energetic, creative, they can tackle bigger things. Somebody said to me: ＆I cleaned out my fridge, and now I know I can switch careers＊. There does seem to be a connection for most people, but not everybody.But if you want to give yourself a boost, sometimes clearing clutter can help.§※Your physical capacity matters 每 getting enough sleep, getting some exercise, getting natural light, not letting yourself get too hungry.§ If you are starting from a position of feeling comfortable and rested, she says, ※you give yourself a lot more wherewithal to tackle things such as staying patient, not losing your temper, eating right, going to the gym 每 all these things take energy and self-command, and they＊re easier if you manage your body§.※This comes in two different varieties,§ she says. ※One is that you think: ＆My life is so full of comfort and security already so if I want to be happier, I really must be spoiled and self-indulgent because I already have so much.＊ The other is to think, in a world full of suffering, that it＊s not morally appropriate for people to seek to be happier. But research shows that happier people are more interested in the problems in the world and in the people around them. They＊re more altruistic,they give away more money, they volunteer more time, they are more likely to help someone who needs a hand. They make better team members, they＊re healthier, they suffer less burnout. When people are unhappy they tend to become isolated, defensive and preoccupied with their own problems. When you＊re happier, you can turn outward and think about other people.§																																											"

"y earliest career ambition was to be a butterfly. Thankfully, dreams change, and I was still quite young when I fell in love with radio. My sister and I started a ※station§ that we recorded on to cassettes and made our parents listen to.

Our station was called Funky Funky Funky Radio, because, well, we were children, and good things often come in threes.Less than a decade later, my first real media job was on the radio.

"ondon, late September 1938. Slit trenches are being dug in Green Park and at home children are fitted with gas masks. Hitler is determined to invade Czechoslovakia in his scheme to reclaim lost German territory. Chamberlain is equally determined to prevent another war. Europe holds its breath as a last chance for peace goes up for grabs at a?conference in Munich.As history this feels so well known as to defy a further rehearsal. Chamberlain＊s piece of paper has become as pathetic in its way as Desdemona＊s handkerchief: a white flag in the face of oncoming tragedy. As fiction, though, we＊re just getting started. Amid this febrile atmosphere  has parachuted one of his trusty old-school protagonists through the interstices of historical events, sticking tight to the record but suggesting how things might have turned out differently. Hugh Legat, late of the Foreign Office, now a private secretary to the PM, is privy to the ※real truth§ about Britain＊s home air defence. The RAF has only 20 fighter planes ※with working guns§ to defend the entire country, so a war would be not only morally repugnant but strategically disastrous. Legat, a brilliant Balliol scholar, is also an upright, downright, forthright stiff, perhaps deliberately: Harris doesn＊t want a ※colourful§ lead stealing any of the narrative＊s thunder.Meanwhile, in Berlin, a high-born diplomat named Paul Hartmann has joined a group of conspirators plotting against Hitler. Hartmann has got hold of a document outlining Germany＊s expansionist ambitions, including their intention to launch a surprise attack and ※smash§ the Czechs. If the plotters can somehow convey this dynamite to a sympathetic ear in Whitehall it might provoke the British government to take action, and stop ※the madman§ in his tracks. The first hundred or so pages of  are full of tight little huddles, grave-faced men darting in and out of offices. At times the documentarist in Harris seems to be rather crowding out the novelist, hugging the shore of verifiable fact instead of boldly striking out on the choppier waters of fiction. I＊m not sure, for instance, of our need to know that the F邦hrer＊s train south to Munich went ※at an average speed of 55 kilometres per hour§. But then a couple of pages later Hartmann, aboard the train as an assistant translator, visits the toilet and notes the tiny steel swastikas adorning the taps 每 the vigilant novelist has reasserted himself. ※No escaping the F邦hrer＊s aesthetic, thought Hartmann, even when one took a shit.§After the pianissimo first section the book turns up the volume as the dual plotlines converge: Hartmann, who was a friend of Legat＊s at Balliol, is relieved to discover that the Englishman is also on his way to Munich, aboard the PM＊s plane. Both men must operate under a?lowering cloud of suspicion as they inch closer to the respective centres of power, revealed to us in telling pen portraits. Chamberlain, nearing 70, a?Victorian throw-back?in stiff wing-collars, constantly surprises his staff with?his energy and his ※ostentatiously modest§ way with the spotlight. Hitler, impatient and dour, presents a more enigmatic figure: how did this unexceptional man (※it was almost compelling how nondescript he was§, thinks Legat) bewitch a?mighty nation into surrender? And just for good measure Harris throws in this sulphurous firecracker: he has the body odour of ※a workman who had not bathed or changed his shirt in a?week§. On top of everything else, Hitler stank.As the negotiations grind on the scene is enlivened with touching squiggles of detail, such as the crowd outside the British delegation＊s hotel striking up with ※The Lambeth Walk§ to make the visitors feel at home. Munich itself comes to life in the poignant contrast between the gracious city of botanical gardens Hartmann once loved and the new brutalist parade-ground spiked with gigantic flagpoles and swastika banners. During a midnight flit outside Munich he gives Legat a terrible glimpse of where Nazi Germany is heading, and both men come to a private reckoning of their failure to make a mark. A tense encounter in Hitler＊s apartment is the book＊s thwarted climax.A tantalising addition to the inexhaustible game of ※what if?§,  is one of Robert Harris＊s more contained performances, less daring than , not as compulsive as , his best novel. The story of a crisis averted is, perforce, something of a pulled punch.

"eading Australian James Bradley＊s ※cli-fi§ novel as large areas of Asia and Texas are flooded ramps up the disturbing effect of its incrementally apocalyptic scenarios. Bird die-offs, mass fish deaths, wildfires and storms are just the beginning as Bradley zooms into the future via a sequence of linked narratives. The ※clade§ of the title is the set of all the descendants of Adam Leith, a climatologist; each chapter focuses on the next generation of Adam＊s family (and naturally his name has symbolic resonance), enabling Bradley＊s predictions for Earth to fast-forward at -like speed while the human actors replay their inherited traits of awkwardness, poor communication skills and attachment issues. The structure, at once intimate and epic, works well as a means of delivering human-scale stories against the backdrop of the most human story of all: our heedless despoiling of the home planet. Almost inevitably, there is something of the blockbuster movie about this: the beleaguered family battling to stay together as the world ends. But Bradley＊s deft merging of near-future predictions and cutting-edge science into a convincing setting for his family drama enables us to focus on the interactions between the characters.

"rand Finale is as apocalyptic a work as  has ever made. Squaring up to the precariousness of our world, the political and ecological disasters we＊ve created for ourselves, it＊s a work fraught with violence, dread and a manic kind of defiance. This is Shechter＊s dance around the abyss, his waltz for the end of time. Yet as darkly dystopian as its premise may be, Grand Finale is lit with a curious optimism, as if the choreographer, in facing up to our terrifying zeitgeist, has also been able to exorcise some of his own private demons.Those demons have long been familiar to British dance audiences. Early works such as  were fuelled by Shechter＊s conflicted attitudes to his homeland, Israel, the intoxicating earthiness of the movement in tension with the choreography＊s brutal, almost militarised floor patterns. In , he dwelt on the pain of his mother leaving his family when he was young. In , a disconcerting mix of pastoral prettiness and anarchy nagged away at the imponderable issue of how to justify art in a disintegrating world. The sometimes self-sabotaging elements of banality in  spoke of Shechter＊s need to force himself outside his creative comfort zone.As he once said, he has always been terrified of making choreography without ※feeling the reasons for what I＊m doing§. It＊s an explanation, perhaps, for his desire to keep his demons close, as the touchstone of his artistic conscience; also, perhaps, for why he＊s so wary of allowing himself to create a perfectly polished product.On one level Shechter can be a consummate showman. He has a rare talent for channelling raw dance energy into patterns of shimmering, rhythmic intricacy; the knotted, gnarly grace of his signature style is purely his own. When his 2010 work Political Mother was staged in an expanded ※choreographer＊s cut§ at the Brixton Academy in London, the event was more like a rock concert than a contemporary dance show, holding its audience rapt.Yet so often Shechter mires his choreography in grooves of needless repetition, introducing material that seems wilfully obtuse. And with Grand Finale he is no less contrary. Sections of this new work are both superbly achieved and movingly personal, as if he is finally giving himself permission to enjoy his own talent. But others are frustratingly overlong and misshapen, as if he fears committing himself to a final edit.The curtain rises to a sense of bleakly elegiac beauty as a sextet of classical musicians play in the shadow of a huge black slab, the tombstone perhaps of a dying world. As 10 dancers emerge from the darkness they look like a scattering of survivors 每 bodies hunched, hands raised in pleading or surrender.What follows may be a flashback to the preceding disaster. As the sextet play Franz Leh芍r and Tchaikovsky against the thrash and howl of Shechter＊s own recorded, electronic score, they look like the band of the Titanic, heroically making music as the ship goes down. The dancers meanwhile start to party, the choreography flickering, flashing and glinting with a hectic edge. But threat and violence start to invade the stage. Mid-movement the dancers＊ mouths gape open in silent screams; bodies fall lifeless to the floor to be dragged across the stage or propped up, awkwardly, by their partners. At moments, the sliding panels of ＊s set squeeze the choreography into frighteningly claustrophobic spaces. When the stage falls still and the dancers quietly sing together, it seems as through the end is very near.There is nothing as direct as narrative, however, and as striking as the imagery is and as superb as the performances are, the choreography seems to drift and meander through the long 55 minutes of its opening half. A noticeable number of people leave in the interval, assuming they＊ve seen all there is to see.Yet in the second half, Shechter concentrates his focus. Much of the movement material is repeated but the band are now playing in a raucous style and the dancers are liberated into a wilder, freer energy, as if laughing in the face of disaster. When the work winds its way back to the very first elegiac image, the band are no longer playing on an empty stage. The dancers are now spotlit in quietly human vignettes, kissing, holding each other, praying. If the world is dicing with death, Shechter chooses to react with a glimmer of optimism.With so many fine elements 每 music, staging, performance and a hard-won lightness of tone 每 Grand Finale ranks among Shechter＊s most sophisticated creations. Some sympathetic and stringent editing could have made it his best.At , until 16 September. Box office: 020-7863 8000.																																											"

Readings from famous fans will recreate some of the best loved spells, potions and magical moments from the series.Joe Orton Laid Bare, which uses the playwright＊s own words from his personal memoirs, stage and TV plays to examine his life and work, is also planned for BBC2. The programme will celebrate his unique and ambitious voice 50 years on from his death.It will feature contributions from Kenneth Cranham, Sir Michael Codron, Christopher Hampton, Dame Patricia Routledge and Joe Orton＊s sister Leonie.BBC4 will tell the story of the mountaineer, explorer and linguist Gertrude Bell in Letters From Baghdad. The programme has been given unique access to more than 1,600 letters, and will follow her journey into the uncharted Arabian desert and the inner sanctum of British male colonial power at the turn of the 20th century. It will also explore the complex history of Iraq, with recorded reminiscences from those who knew her and Bell＊s own words voiced by Tilda Swinton.BBC1 has confirmed that the Strictly Come Dancing star the Rev Richard Coles and Mariella Frostrup will return to host The Big Painting Challenge when it comes back in 2018. Ten new amateur artists will compete in six weeks of challenges.The channel will also bring back Fake Or Fortune? for a seventh series, presented by the art dealer Philip Mould and journalist Fiona Bruce, who search for lost masterpieces.Mark Bell, the head of commissioning for BBC Arts, said: ※We hope our arts programming will cast a spell over audiences with an in-depth look at the real-life inspirations for JK Rowling＊s magical world.※We can also offer BBC2 viewers the privilege of spending time with four great dames as they reflect on their incredible lives and careers on stage and screen, and alongside a fantastic season of programmes exploring Mexican art and life we will also examine the lives of British icons including Gertrude Bell and Joe Orton using their own writings.※And The Big Painting Challenge will hopefully again inspire people to pick up a paintbrush and have a go.§ 																																											"

"The media regulator has found that  seriously breached the broadcasting code by naming the wrong man as the Westminster terror attacker, and has heavily criticised the programme for a string of major mistakes in recent years.Ofcom has taken the highly unusual step of forcing  News to make an on-air broadcast of the outcome of its investigation.The programme reported that Abu Izzadeen, an Islamist activist formerly known as Trevor Brooks, was the person responsible for  who had been shot dead by police.During coverage of , which left four people dead, Simon Israel, Channel 4 News＊s senior home affairs correspondent, identified Izzadeen as the attacker. Later in the programme Jon Snow, the newsreader, interrupted the broadcast to issue a correction saying that Izzadeen＊s brother had been in contact to say that he was, in fact, still in jail.※Sorry to cut you off. We＊ve got a little bit more on this fast-developing story about today＊s attack in Westminster,§ said Snow. ※Channel 4 News has been contacted by Abu Izzadeen＊s brother, who tells this programme that he is in fact still serving a prison sentence. That from Yusuf Brooks, brother of Trevor Brooks, also known as Abu Izzadeen.§Snow apologised at the end of the programme, which was subsequently pulled from the Channel 4+1 service.※We found Channel 4 News committed a serious breach of broadcasting rules, after it wrongly identified the Westminster terror attacker,§ said  in a statement. ※Channel 4 News incorrectly referred to the same person throughout its report, and subsequent steps to mitigate the error were insufficient.§In a statement, the broadcaster said the mistake came during a ※fast-moving story§ and that Channel 4 News had ※moved swiftly to correct and clarify the facts as conflicting information came to light§.※We note that Ofcom acknowledges Channel 4 News made appropriate corrections while on air; removed the programme from other platforms and carried a full correction and apology the following day,§ said a spokeswoman. ※We are working with Channel 4 News to review and improve their existing editorial and oversight procedures.§Channel 4 News said it had not made an apology or offered payment for reputational damage done to Izzadeen in the case of mistaken identity. A spokeswoman added that the programme had not received any request or demand for financial amends or an apology from or on behalf of Izzadeen.The programme also said no action was taken against Simon Israel over the on-air gaffe, and that he continues to report in the same role.The media regulator took the unusual step of ordering Channel 4 News to broadcast its decision because it is the latest in a string of accuracy lapses in recent years.It is very rare for Ofcom to order such a public broadcast of a decision 每 especially against one of the UK＊s most high-profile and respected news organisations.The last time Ofcom did so was in 2015, when it told Russia Today to make two on-air broadcasts after the TV company was found to have . ※This is the fourth time in three years we have found Channel 4 in breach of its requirement to report news with due accuracy,§ said Ofcom. ※We are particularly concerned that another serious breach has happened, given Channel 4＊s previous assurances to Ofcom that improvements to its compliance processes were being made.

"Nigel Farage has accused concertgoers who waved European Union flags at the Last Night of the Proms on Saturday of being in denial about Brexit, as remain campaigners claimed a publicity victory when  at the traditionally patriotic event.Anti-Brexit activists claim they handed out around 7,000 free EU flags to ticket holders and musicians at the Royal Albert Hall in a carefully planned, crowdfunded campaign that angered the former Ukip leader and other leave supporters.※I got chucked out of the Albert Hall three times last night for handing out flags inside,§ said Clive Lewis, 60, a consultant engineer and one of the lead organisers of the Flags at the  campaign, which raised more than ?4,000 from 250 members of the public. ※I think we gave out about 7,000 flags to people going in and musicians.§That was far more than the  shortly after the referendum result.TV pictures of the concert, conducted by Sakari Oramo from Finland, showed large numbers of EU flags being flown inside the Albert Hall alongside union flags and flags from Germany, Sweden, Japan and beyond. In some cases concertgoers held union flags and EU flags together as they sang along to Elgar＊s Pomp and Circumstance March No 1 and Parry＊s Jerusalem. They also heard a Swedish opera singer singing Wagner and songs by Kurt Weill, a German Jew who fled the Nazis in 1933. TV pictures from parallel concerts in Hyde Park, Glasgow, Enniskillen and Swansea, where there were no comparable EU flag campaigns, showed notably fewer EU flags.Lewis said he was delighted with the response at the Albert Hall: ※We got on the BBC and we got a hate piece in the Mail. We just want to get the message out there that we are not giving up. We want to remain and we want to get that out there as much as we can.§But Farage told the Guardian: ※These people are still in denial over the referendum result. They are trying to make it all about them instead of a great concert. The British people want to leave the EU no matter how many flags they fly.§Before the concert Farage had told the  that he would be asking the former Ukip donor Arron Banks to fund the supply of a large number of union jacks to counter the EU flags, but that plan did not appear to have come to fruition.Earlier in the prom season, campaigners who unfurled large EU flags over balconies in the auditorium during a performance which included Beethoven＊s Ode to Joy, which has become an EU anthem, were ordered to put them away by venue staff.Before the concert the BBC and the Royal Albert Hall had resisted calls from some pro-leave groups calling for EU flags to be removed from concertgoers. A BBC spokesman said: ※The BBC Proms is a music platform, not a political one, with the Last Night of the Proms offering a celebration of two months of extraordinary music making.※As part of that tradition, flags are permitted in line with the Royal Albert Hall＊s guidelines, and as in previous years, we are sure there will be a wide variety of flags on display.§																																											"

It＊s a great pity.§Her husband＊s biographer Donald Sturrock, who was also being interviewed, said the change to a white character was driven by Dahl＊s agent, who thought a black Charlie would not appeal to readers.※I can tell you that it was his agent who thought it was a bad idea, when the book was first published, to have a black hero,§ said Sturrock. ※She said people would ask: ＆Why?＊§The revelation about Dahl＊s original wish for Charlie may surprise those who . The allegation stemmed from the fact that the Oompa Loompas in the original version were black pygmies from Africa.The news in 1970 that there was to be a film of the book drew the attention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to the work and they said the importation of the Oompa Loompas to the factory had overtones of slavery. Dahl insisted there was no racist intent behind the Oompa Loompas but also said he found himself sympathising with the NAACP. As a result, he rewrote them in time for the second US edition as white hippyish dwarves hailing from an invented place, ※Loompaland§.

"ith Secret Garden Party packing away its tit-glitter for good, is the wasted White Rabbit calling time on the boutique festival? Last year Bestival, at its original Isle of Wight site, : Britain＊s wildest costume party gauging the sour national mood and winding down, with fields once full of techno trees, rum shacks and underground pirate restaurants abandoned to camping.Transferred to a smaller site at Lulworth Castle, this year＊s event feels at first like a V&A exhibition about . Previous years＊ centrepieces such as the world＊s largest mirrorball, the clockwork robot and two giant astronauts are displayed like monuments, and a miniature replica of the once-mighty Wishing Tree stands by the campsite entrance, forlornly whispering reggae remixes. All that＊s missing is an audio tour in which the Cuban Brothers inform you how many breaths it took to blow up the world＊s biggest bouncy castle.The newest exhibit is Happy Kanye, an illuminated rainbow enshrouding the giant inflatable face of Kanye West, which represents 2017＊s costume theme of colour 每 and the acts duly oblige. Little Dragon＊s Yukimi Nagano hits the stage in a neon-red veil and kabuki dress, like Grace Jones playing Ziggy Stardust. If only their amorphous electropop were as vivid; it has as much flavour and substance as yesterday＊s gum.London＊s post-gender collective  are another eye-aching sight, featuring a blue-haired dandy sailor, a catwalk Bay City Roller and a singer in a lime green Let＊s Dance suit. Somehow their theatrical sound-clashes 每 channelling Fischerspooner, Adam Ant, Suede, Bond theme fanfares and an ultra-camp Nick Cave 每 match up well. also got the memo. Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe appear against luminous spheres wearing sci-fi Malteser helmets and lead a band of metallic bird people through a hit-shy set of brainiac synthpop about the pitfalls of commercialism and love being a bourgeois construct (it isn＊t). By the time they break out West End Girls, It＊s a Sin and the big cover tunes that sell their magnificent pop songwriting short, Tennant is in a silver rainbow jacket, multicoloured bubbles hang from the stage roof and Lulworth Castle has become English Heritage＊s most rainbow-washed edifice.Friday bill-toppers the xx don＊t play ball, instead dealing in monochrome magic. With Oliver Sim swinging his bass like a Game of Thrones dragonslayer and Romy Croft coming within a fringe flick of rocking out, their formerly stillborn alt-soul has been brought to life by an emergency infusion of Balearic electronics. Once they were the house band at the sort of introverts＊ disco where Morrissey might＊ve been able to pull; now they conjure spectral dance music that manages to be both tempestuous and vulnerable. Loud Places and the superb On Hold are the euphoric dancefloor payoffs their tantric set of zero-gravity Adele songs always demanded. Though they tell us ※we＊re so excited to be here§ as convincingly as David Davis claims he＊s fully prepared for the next round of negotiations, the cheering rightly lasts an age.Bestival＊s Lulworth relaunch battles a deluge of vibe dampeners. Torrential rain slimes around the hilly new setting, Wiley and Justice cancel, and wind shuts down the entire site on Sunday afternoon. By far the most dominant costume onsite is the very convincing body-armoured policeman. But Bestival parties on regardless, and the firing of the world＊s largest confetti cannon on Saturday afternoon is the starting pistol on a new era of that grand Bestival tradition: getting munted with random Freddie Mercurys. Dizzee Rascal＊s populist grime anthems send the crowd bonkers and, after-hours, the compact site creates a Khao San Road of themed clubbing areas. Glittery Neptunes, complete with tridents, slide and slither between neon 80s disco, a battleship rave, a woodland dub cinema and a hilltop Buddhist temple, chasing the strains of Despacito. Here, DJ Shadow is king with his geometric rap sampling and  is his queen, demanding she ※fuck you like an animal§ while covering Nine Inch Nails in her Late Night Pop Dungeon.Bestival＊s broadmindedness survives the sea crossing too. Laura Mvula＊s space-age soul shows up Rag＊n＊Bone Man as the pointless throwback he is. A Tribe Called Quest＊s farewell gig 每 full of moving tributes to late member , who is present on backing track 每 is a hip-hop masterclass. Indie rock stages a fightback in the form of Jamie T, Twin Atlantic, Honeyblood＊s ball-busting grunge and Circa Waves, whose Hawaiian-shirted indie has the crowd standing on each others shoulders despite the distinct lack of T-shirt weather. And the boutique mindset? That lives on in the bloke going round making people wear 3D glasses that turn all the stage lights into love hearts. The Bestival spirit, it transpires, is stormproof.																																											"
"he malfunctioning studio system has foisted many subprime ideas upon us recently, but this opportunistic, -age hybrid of war-on-terror drama and YA fantasy numbers among the junkiest. Ex- Dylan O＊Brien plays Mitch Rapp, an emotionally volatile sort picked up by the CIA after pursuing the sleeper cell who gunned down his holidaying fiancee in one early breach of basic cinematic decency. Thereafter he＊s assigned Aviator-sporting ex-Navy Seal mentor Stan Hurley (, bent once more towards career self-sabotage), passed through whizzy VR training exercises and dispatched to Europe alongside a babelicious colleague to recover a stray nuke while generally kicking ass for the US of A.

"I sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds, and bowers,Of April, May, of June, and July-flowers.I sing of maypoles, hock-carts, wassails, wakes,Of bridegrooms, brides, and of their bridal cakes.I write of youth, of love, and have accessBy these to sing of cleanly wantonness.I sing of dews, of rains, and, piece by piece,Of balm, of oil, of spice, and ambergris.I sing of time＊s trans-shifting; and I writeHow roses first came red, and lilies white.I write of groves, of twilights, and I singThe court of Mab, and of the fairy king.I write of Hell; I sing (and ever shall)Of Heaven, and hope to have it after all.In May 2009, my blogpost about  included, by way of introduction, four lines from The Argument of His Book. This week, that ※Argument§ takes the starring role as Poem of the Week, a little  of sunlit harvest to set us up for the autumn days.  It＊s the opening poem of Herrick＊s only collection, Hesperides, and summarises some of its topics. Argument signifies ※theme§ or ※contents§ and is not a defence. In , the author observes that ※Hesperides is the only major collection of poetry in English to open with a versified table of contents.§ I wonder if this is still the case, and would be interested to hear of any contemporary contenders setting out their poetic wares in this way, with or without rhyme and metre. Herrick＊s art here lies in the trimness of his selection (there were 1,400 poems, after all, in the original collection) and in its ordering, allowing various configurations of the list-as-narrative. There is harmony as well as contrast, and a satisfying arc is formed from line one＊s spring blossoms to the final hope of Heaven＊s largesse.  The alliteration fairly bubbles along in the opening line. It＊s a playful, pretty string of nouns, and might seem somewhat random, so in the second line Herrick begins to build his calendar and show his pastoral credentials, separating the seasons and specifying July flowers as if to notice the different flora produced by the changing months. Then he moves us on to the larger celebrations in the rural and Christian year. ※Hock-carts§ are the decorated carts that bring home the harvest, ※wassails§ the toasts especially associated with Christmas and the new year. ※Wakes§ are not necessarily funereal vigils, but can be held for various celebratory purposes, such as the dedication of a church. My Everyman selection by Douglas Brooks-Davies (also the source of the current text) notes that a wake can also be a fair.  There＊s the sense of an almost boyish appetite when the bridal cakes appear in the next line: the term offers a handy rhyme, of course, but it＊s the sort of detail that brings a poem sharply alive. And yet Herrick is not always the delightfully simple literalist he first seems. For instance, there＊s a metaphorical bride later in the collection. ※To the King, Upon his Coming with his Army to the West§ imagines ※the west§ transformed from drooping widowhood so that she ※looks like a bride now, or a bed of flowers / newly refreshed both by the sun and showers§. Similarly, it＊s possible that the reference to ※rains§ indicates a kingly pun, which isn＊t to say Herrick disdains the primary meaning of flower-friendly cloudbursts. So to love and that ※cleanly wantonness§ that might be considered his speciality. The  Foundation essayist points out the shift from ※I sing§ to ※I write§ in line five, suggesting that it ※may hint at the hundreds of epigrams on amatory themes and the other subjects that are scattered throughout Hesperides§. Perhaps it also denotes the respectability of translation and imitation, activities allowing Herrick access to the classical poets as his permissive muses. That engaging oxymoron, ※cleanly wantonness§, fluently carries us to a new place among the evocative, somewhat erotic moisturisers of lines seven and eight. Dew, a seemingly trivial phenomenon, appears in a number of poems. It fills primroses and resembles tears, and it adorns Julia＊s hair with glittering radiance. There are frequent tears in the collection, and, in the poem called His Sailing from Julia, death is imagined as a lonely, uncertain sea voyage. But, in the Argument itself, no one overtly weeps, and if a voyage is distantly conjured, it brings a cargo of exotic luxuries such as spices and ambergris. Large themes and the more trivial mingle in the last six lines: that resonant proclamation ※I sing of time＊s trans-shifting§ may encode the major historical changes in England at the period, and the effects they had on Herrick personally but, perhaps wisely, they＊re not spelled out, and charming if sentimental legends about roses and lilies replace them.  into ※groves§ and ※twilights§ and, finally, fairy-land, before the traveller gets serious 每 though not solemn 每 and entertains the prospects of Hell and a blissful Heaven, which will no doubt overflow with custards and curds, spices and cherries, and all the marigolds, roses and daffodils imaginable. Herrick＊s collection included sacred poems, entitled Noble Numbers; or, His Pious Pieces, and a few of these are not far beneath George Herbert＊s in quality. A list poem this Argument may be, but at sonnet-length it has the sturdiness required to carry a weight of associations. Its slightly trundling metrical wheels are accompanied by some compelling melody. Of course, it was not intended to be read separately from Hesperides. Yet it amounts to more than a taster, and can be enjoyed as a solo the author sings in sheer celebration, both of the pastoral life and of the language that brings it, rich and shining, into our imaginations. This article was amended on 12 September 2017, to correct the artist＊s name in the picture caption.																																											"
"Today, Waiting for Godot is the most celebrated of Samuel Beckett＊s plays, but newly digitised material from the depths of the  shows how its first audiences responded in horror to its ※lavatory references§, while some anticipated that ※this ugly little jet of marsh-gas§ from ※the late James Joyce＊s secretary§ would soon be forgotten.The correspondence about Beckett＊s play is among more than 100 items from the archives of 20th-century playwrights that have been digitised by the library as part of its free online resource, . It sits alongside drafts, letters, notes and manuscripts from 13 other major dramatists, including John Osborne, JB Priestley, George Bernard Shaw and Harold Pinter. Aimed at students, teachers and the general public, the new additions to the online archive range from the manuscript of Shelagh Delaney＊s A Taste of Honey 每 which a 19-year-old Delaney sent to Joan Littlewood, asking her to read it ※because no matter what sort of theatrical atrocity it might be it isn＊t valueless as far as I＊m concerned§ 每 to Priestley＊s letters from the trenches and Beckett＊s production notebooks.The correspondence reveals the reaction to Waiting for Godot from the Lord Chamberlain＊s Office, then the censor for all British theatre. It required various ※objectionable§ passages to be cut from the play, including references to ※piss§, ※arse§, ※his hand pressed to his pubis§ and the falling of Estragon＊s trousers. The letter also takes issue with the religious allusions: ※I don＊t like Estragon comparing himself to Christ.§ This outraged Beckett, who called the changes ※so preposterous that I＊m afraid the whole thing is off§.Once the play was shown, correspondence digitised by the British Library shows how Lady Howitt called for the play to be banned over its ※lavatory references§. It was subsequently viewed by examiner CW Heriot, who in his report to the Lord Chamberlain said that he had ※endured two hours of angry boredom§ for ※a piece quite without drama and with very little meaning§.In scathing terms, he advised the Lord Chamberlain that he should ※allow public opinion to disperse this ugly little jet of marsh-gas§, reporting on how during his viewing of the play, the man next to him fled crying ※brother, let me out of this!§, while ※several women were apologising to their escorts for having suggested a visit to such a piece§.Only ※a sprinkling of young persons in slacks and Marlon Brando pullovers with (according to sex) horsetails or fringes§ seemed to enjoy it, Heriot wrote dismissively.In its own response to Howitt, the Lord Chamberlain＊s Office had described Beckett as ※the late James Joyce＊s secretary§, saying that the play had been submitted for consideration earlier that year ※with some trepidation: and quite rightly, because the original was appalling, and some of the more outrageous passages were deleted, much to the author＊s rage§.The letter continues: ※What is left is unpleasant enough, but the Lord Chamberlain felt that to cut more would be tantamount to banning the whole production,§ adding that ※it is not an immoral play and as the Lord Chamberlain＊s authority does not cover matters of taste, frequently he finds that he has to pass plays which, from that angle, he would far sooner ban.§Along with script extracts from Oh! What a Lovely War, and the earliest surviving draft of The Deep Blue Sea by Terence Rattigan, the new resource, which launched on Friday, includes letters Priestley wrote home during the first world war while he was in the trenches. One letter, dated 1 January 1916, is written ※from my dugout (about two feet high and five feet long) by the miserable light of a guttering, little bit of candle§, following a ※nightmare evening§ when ※the troops in the frontline made two bomb attacks on [the Germans], and we＊d to support them§.The British Library pointed to the poignant contrast between Priestley＊s ※vivid evocations of deafening machine-gun fire§ and his exclamations of gratitude: ※I enjoyed the parcel hugely, and the pudding was splendid!§ Priestley＊s experiences in the army would give him a ※strong sense of class injustice§, said the library, a key theme in his 1945 play An Inspector Calls.As well as contemporary reviews, production photographs, posters and programmes, the online archive also features John Osborne＊s notebook for his play Look Back in Anger. Although the play＊s title helped popularise the phrase ※angry young men§, which spoke to a generation of writers, the notebook reveals some of the alternative names Osborne was considering: Bargain From Strength, Man in a Rage, Close the Cage Behind You, and My Blood Is a Mile High. It also shows how he wrote the play quickly, with few revisions, with an early autobiographical section about his feelings of betrayal over his wife＊s affair crafted into dialogue for his protagonist Jimmy Porter.Anna Lobbenberg from the Discovering Literature team said: ※In discussions we＊ve had with teachers, we hear stories about young people believing that classic works of literature fall out of the sky on to the printed page. And teachers have said that showing them manuscripts is a brilliant way of demonstrating ＃ the creative process behind these works.§, first digitising material relating to Victorian and Romantic writers, and then.

She left and drove away in her car, before being stopped by police under suspicion of driving under the influence; the alleged rape victim meanwhile is said to have been ※carried out of the bus§ by the band members following the attack, whereby she called police. Police caught up with the band, who left Spokane following the alleged incident, in Los Angeles. Their lawyer Steve Graham has since commented: ※Decapitated plan to fully fight the allegations that are brought against them, and we are fully confident that the other side of this story will be heard.§ He added that ※we have witnesses that can testify to the fact that the accuser came to visit the band of her own free will and left on good terms§.

"A storm over artistic freedom and censorship has erupted in  after an art exhibition at a multinational bank＊s cultural centre was cancelled following a campaign by rightwing protesters.The controversy broke out when the Queermuseu 每 Queer Museum 每 exhibition at Santander Bank＊s cultural centre in Porto Alegre was abruptly closed on Sunday, a month ahead of schedule.Supported by evangelical Christians, protestors from the Free Brazil Movement accused the exhibition 每 which included 263 works from Brazilian greats such as Candido Portinari and Lygia Clark 每 of promoting blasphemy, paedophilia and bestiality, charges its curator vigorously denied. ※They are passing the limits of tolerance and we are giving them a response,§ said Silas Malafia, a leading evangelical pastor.Brazil＊s artistic community has attacked the protest as dangerous censorship in a country that lived through 21 years of military dictatorship. ※It is an exhibition that deals with issues of identity,§ the curator Gaud那ncioFidelis told the Guardian. ※This is a frightening moment in Brazilian life.§The exhibition had been open almost a month when protestors from the Free Brazil Movement 每 a group of free market liberals known for  calling for the impeachment of leftist President Dilma Rousseff 每 began picketing its doors.A video by protesters  described one of the works, one of two paintings by artist Bia Leite from a series called ＆Crian?a Viada＊, or ＆Gay Children＊, as ※practically child prostitution§.The children are fully clothed in the painting and the accusation that it promotes paedophilia is unfounded, Fidelis said.※Thework is about bullying, about prejudice,§ he said.Fidelis said that a painting which protestors said depicted an act of bestiality was actually a work about colonialsm. Another work by Fernando Baril called ＆Crossing Jesus Christ Goddess Shiva＊ was also accused of being blasphemous by the protestors.Fidelis found out the exhibition had been cancelled when Santander published a notice on its Facebook page on Sunday.※We sincerely apologise to anyone who felt offended by any work that was part of the exhibition,§ the bank said. Santander had previously fully approved all the works, Fidelis said.The Free Brazil Movement has grown in influence since helping to oust Rousseff on charges of breaking budget rules and has adopted increasingly rightwing positions, such as advocating freeing up gun ownership laws.Kim Kataguiri, one of its leaders, said he saw no contradiction in free-market liberals attacking an art exhibition, arguing that they had called for a boycott of the exhibition, not censorship.※We did the boycott because the exhibition involved public money in the promotion of bestiality, paedophilia and offences to the Christian faith,§ Kataguiri told the Guardian.Kataguiri said gay friends of his had also objected to the Queer Museum. ※The exhibition shows gays as bestial and aggressive beings,§ he said. ※Brazilians always had Christian values, but now they have the courage to defend them against the noisy minority who attack us.§ Supporters of the exhibition have organised a counter-attack, and 34,000 have signed a petition demanding it reopen. A demonstration was organised for Tuesday afternoon by LBGT groups.※The mobilisation is important because it shows that Porto Alegre will not be a backwards community,§ said Luciano Victorino, 23, a law student and organiser of the Porto Alegre Without Prejudice Facebook group, one of the organisers.Alvaro Clark, son of the late Lygia Clark, a prominent Brazilian artist who had three works in the exhibition, was flying down from Rio de Janeiro to take part.※Lygia would detest it,§ he said of the closure. ※Civilised Brazil is much more than this.§ 																																											"
"S, the south London singer-songwriter  was better known as a guest vocalist on other people＊s songs, has won one of the UK＊s most prestigious music prizes. The artist, full name Sampha Sisay, won the  for his critically acclaimed debut album . At the ceremony, Sampha performed, to silence then wild cheers , which, for emotional types, was one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful singles of the year.Afterwards, he said it was an amazing feeling to win. ※It＊s taken me quite a while to feel like I was emotionally stable enough to write my own record and people have just been incredibly lovely and understanding ＃ it feels like a weight off my shoulders.§Sampha＊s gorgeous, distinctive, soulful voice has appeared on songs by some of the biggest names in US hip-hop and R&B including Beyonc谷, Drake, Solange and Kanye West. But it has taken some time for the 28-year-old to blossom into a  in his own right, with an album heavily influenced by the death of his mother from cancer and fears for his own health.Sampha was one of five south London artists nominated for this year＊s prize and is probably the most unassuming of all the nominees. Asked what he would do with the prize money he gave the most un-rock＆n＆roll answer it＊s possible to give.※Put it away? Save it up? Saving is always good.§ How would he celebrate? ※I just want to see my family and friends, have a couple of drinks.§He said artists always struggled with self-esteem, so to win the Mercury ※definitely does give you a boost§.Sampha had been among the bookmakers＊ favourites to win, up against artists including Kate Tempest, , and  who, with the best will in the world, no one expected to pick up the prize. Another debutant, , had been heavily tipped too.The actor Idris Elba gave Sampha his ?25,000 prize at a ceremony with performances from the shortlisted artists at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, London.The long time favourite to win had been Tempest for her angry, melodic, . But it was not to be and Sampha＊s victory continues the run of men winning the album award. Since PJ Harvey won her second Mercury prize in 2011, the only artist to win two, it has been won by Alt-J, James Blake, Young Fathers, Benjamin Clementine and last year, .Alt-J were again nominated, for their album , although it＊s fair to say they did not hold out much hope of repeating the win. Singer Joe Newman admitted before the ceremony that even his family were not optimistic. ※My sister has put a bet on J Hus, which is reassuring,§ he said. If they were to win they would give the money to the mental health charity Mind, but they did not expect it. ※There are a lot of great acts here and we＊re just happy to be part of it really.§There was similar pessimism among the four former Oxford schoolfriends who make up Glass Animals, although at least singer Dave Bayley＊s mum had put a bet on them winning 每 ?5 at odds of 33-1, which was before a late flurry of betting propelled them to a price of 11/4.Drummer Joe Seaward said: ※It is very nice to be asked at all, I don＊t think we＊ve got that far down the road of thinking about winning. We＊ve got a song to play.§They were looking forward to the evening and then a 7am flight on Friday to the US to begin their tour.The prize is decided on the night by a panel of judges who this year consisted of musicians Ella Eyre, Jamie Cullum, Marcus Mumford and Lianne La Havas, the Guardian＊s deputy music editor Harriet Gibsone, DJ MistaJam, critic Will Hodgkinson, Mojo and Q magazine editor-in-chief Phil Alexander, the head of music at Radio X, Mike Walsh, and the head of music at BBC 6Music and Radio 2, Jeff Smith.How their discussions went will no doubt emerge, although Mumford gave a glimpse into the shortlist meeting, telling the BBC: ※We were only allowed to talk about positive things. So I shut up quite a lot.§Last year the judging panel were split between giving the award posthumously to David Bowie, or to Skepta for his album .Whatever the merits of deciding the best album from such a diverse range of genres 每 jazz, folk, grime, indie rock, although as yet no death metal in the prize＊s history 每 one thing is certain. It dramatically boosts sales. In the case of jazz, trumpet-led Dinosaur, they rose by more than 38%, according to an analysis of Official Charts Company data. The average increase across the 12 albums was 15% in the six weeks between the shortlist announcement and last Friday＊s chart.The prize began in 1992, won by Primal Scream for Screamadelica. Since then it has been won by bands including Pulp, Gomez, Arctic Monkeys, Elbow, and solo artists including Talvin Singh, Ms Dynamite and Dizzee Rascal.The full list of this year＊s nominees was Alt-J, ; Blossoms, ; Dinosaur, ; Ed Sheeran, ; Glass Animals, ; J Hus, ; Kate Tempest, ; Loyle Carner, ; Sampha, ; Stormzy, ; The Big Moon, ; and the xx, .The culture secretary Karen Bradley said the  reinforced the UK＊s claim ※to be the most exciting place for music in the world§.She added: ※Britain＊s vibrant music scene contributes billions towards our economy, but it is also deeply engrained in our cultural DNA and loved by millions of people.§																																											"

"oo much, this is too much,§ declares Edith, the mother of grownup sons, Matthew and Adam, who have gathered with their partners for Christmas to welcome home the family patriarch, Francis, who has been in hospital. The audience may think the same of ＊s knowing comedy as it layers on family dysfunction like icing on a Christmas cake. The evening begins in Ayckbourn mode, turns into something more vicious and becomes an all-out farce where the food flies and it is not only the turkey that gets stuffed. Holcroft＊s play,  and is getting its regional premiere under the guiding hand of director , is an odd beast. It revels in the conventions of traditional domestic comedy, but then ups the ante ingeniously by playfully showing us the rules by which each of the characters live and their destructive patterns of behaviour.So, when Matthew tells a lie, he must sit down. When Adam wants to mock (which he does, all the time), he must affect a silly accent. Edith must clean to stay calm and Matthew＊s girlfriend, Carrie, must make a spectacle of herself until she gets a laugh. The device certainly ensures some laughs, but it becomes wearying and the rules the writer has imposed upon herself sometimes look in danger of sinking the play. The characters and their quirks too often seem set up to deliver comedy, rather than reveal any truths. They are stock characters: the emotionally blackmailing matriarch; the sons who could not live up to their bullying father＊s expectations; the girlfriend who wants a wedding ring; the wife who despises her husband and has become obsessed with her teenage daughter＊s health. It is hard to like them and even harder to feel for them or see them as mirroring our own neurotic behaviours. There are implausibilities, too 每  每 and Holcroft withholds information to suit herself, rather than the audience. But there are a few comic moments that are such crackers that it doesn＊t feel too odd to be celebrating Christmas in September. 																																											"

And even though the core remit of NMC is to champion living British composers, it also does a noble line in saving important recordings that fall through the cracks.

Holst＊s music is potently expressive and generous, reminiscent but never maudlin. ※I＊d much rather be dealing with crotchets and quavers than people,§ she once told Britten, and although her music can be introverted, these superb performances by Court Lane Music make sure the huge warmth of the writing wins out. Holst was a lifelong advocate of other English composers; we owe it to her, and to ourselves, to keep listening to her brave and confessional works. 																																											"

For traditional broadcast and cable networks it＊s no longer enough to make hit shows. They must make them available for streaming and downloading on multiple platforms or risk losing advertising and subscription revenues.And to grab a share of those revenues, and to differentiate their products and services, technology companies must own content 每 either by buying or making it.Original content, especially prestige fare such as The Handmaid＊s Tale, defines a company and fuels subscriptions, said Erwich, of . ※This is something that we can own, that comes out of our DNA.

But since hiring Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg 每 Sony executives who shepherded hits like Breaking Bad and The Crown 每 and earmarking $1bn to build an arsenal of original TV shows, the iPhone maker is expected to become a formidable player.※That billion-dollar number is a very clear signal that Apple is a lot more serious about original content than a year or even six months ago,§ said Jan Dawson, a media analyst with Jackdaw Research. ※They want to produce quantity and quality.

He meant that content creators would eventually create their own streaming platforms, and stop giving them to .He was right. Last month, Disney announced it would end its deal with Netflix and launch its own streaming service in 2019.Netflix, however, has been busy creating a vast library. Its budget for original programming soared from $300m in 2013 to $6bn this year, a massive war-chest that will fund the release of at least 20 shows.YouTube, despite boasting 1.5 billion logged-in-users per month, and 1bn hours watched a day, also feels the need to cultivate original content. It is scheduled to release more than 30 original shows and films through its subscription service, Red, this year, and more than 40 next year. ※We want YouTube original programming to stand for premium, entertaining content,§ said Susanne Daniels, global head of original content. She cited Step Up: High Water, a dance show; Cobra Kai, a Karate Kid-inspired comedy series; and partnerships with YouTube creators and celebrities such as Demi Lovato and Katy Perry.In addition, Facebook will spend as much as $1bn this and next year to cultivate original shows for its new Watch video platform, the.

"nce upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. One day, while strolling about in a dark wood, she happened upon a charming cottage. Actually it was more of a filthy den dug deep in the earth. Goldilocks knocked, but when no one answered, she crawled down into the den.On the table in the den, she found three bowls of porridge.No she didn＊t. Bears don＊t have the fine motor skills to build tables, nor can they cook. And they don＊t like porridge. What Goldilocks actually found was the rotting remains of three dead rabbits.But she was very hungry. So she tried one. It was horrible. She tried another. It was no better. The third rabbit was disgusting, so she ate a cheese sandwich instead.Goldilocks felt sleepy. She lay down in the first bed, which was less a bed than a pile of leaves mixed with mud and bear excrement. The second bed was the same. And the third. But Goldilocks was tired, so she fell fast asleep anyway.As she was sleeping, the three bears came home. They did not say, ※Someone＊s been eating my porridge,§ or ※Someone＊s been sleeping in my bed§, because bears can only speak bear.They did what bears do. They ate her. And they lived happily ever after.There are many people who believe this is the proper way to tell a fairy story. With facts.

Study science, economics and maths, the government urges, and pursue a serious career 每 such as business, law, banking and finance. A real career, where you can make real money.There is, of course, nothing wrong with studying mathematics and science. But without the arts, that study is wasted. You need imagination to be a great scientist (or a great politician or a?great lawyer), just as you need it to be a?great musician or writer. Imagination and the ability to tell a story will make anyone better at anything.As Albert Einstein said: ※If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairytales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairytales.§ Einstein recognised the importance of imagination and storytelling when grappling with the most complex and difficult problems of the universe.Science tells us that 7 billion improbably designed humans live on a ball made of iron, rocks and silicates, floating in a regular ellipse around a hot star in the middle of unimaginable infinite space. And furthermore, these humans have designed Teslas, cricket and waterboarding.Is there a more unlikely story? Most scientific explanations for the workings of the universe are so weird, you＊d have to be  to think them up. The most popular begins with a huge explosion out of nothingness, from which a vast infinity of objects emerge, moving away from each other for billions of years until one day the whole thing loses momentum and shifts into reverse, collapsing to the size of a raisin.Really?Dawkins thinks the whole idea of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden?is absurd, but what sane person dreamed up the big bang theory?At the start of every amazing story 每 literary or scientific 每 is a person with enough imagination to ask a good question. A physicist might ask: ※What makes up all that empty space in the universe?§ A geneticist might ask: ※Is there a different way to cure cancer?§ A?science fiction writer might ask: ※What do creatures in another galaxy look like?§ You or I might ask: ※Will anyone ever want to have sex with me?§ or ※How can I live in a world where Donald Trump is president?§The job of every human is to imagine what one life might achieve, to think about why we live and why we die, why we fall in love with one person and not another; why there＊s war, why some people are black and some white, some rich and some poor. Our job is to think about how to live on this planet without destroying it, to reimagine the past and the future of the human race; to examine all the complex, terrifying, hopeful possibilities in history, in politics, in space 每 and in the space inside our heads.One of the best ways to start answering questions such as ※who am I?§ and ※what can I do in the world?§ is to read?books.I would say that. I＊m a writer. But in my lifetime I＊ve lived thousands of lives. I＊ve lived on other continents and other planets, been a champion runner, a neurosurgeon, a standup comedian. I＊ve survived Auschwitz and a plane crash in the Andes, fought with the East India Company in the 1857 uprising. I＊ve bombed Ferrara, crossed the Pacific on a raft, advised Henry VIII not to marry again. I＊ve lived inside the head of a man, a horse, a vampire, a gentle Neanderthal. I know what it feels like to be different, to be on the wrong side of history, to be someone other than a middle-class, middle-aged suburban-born American writer who now lives a somewhat ordinary life in London.Much of this I have learned by reading books.Imagine a person who never reads books. Perhaps a person like the president of the United States. What might it do to your brain, never to be anyone other than yourself, in your own here and now? To be a person who knows nothing about how it feels to be a Roman legionary, a Victorian chimney sweep, to be poor, queer, a refugee, a Muslim, a North Korean, a woman, a child, a warrior 每 who knows nothing about how it feels to be someone else.Without stories we are trapped in a static version of ourselves.Stories give us choices. In 2013, a 16-year-old girl stood up at a book festival I attended, saying how much she appreciated the way teen novels were helping to change gender and sex stereotypes at her school. There was less bullying, she said, more acceptance of difference. Since 2013, it seems as if our entire understanding of gender and sex has changed 每 what was once considered unnatural has become mainstream.  made celebrity history. Stories told us how it felt.Each of us is writing a life story. Every day we write another chapter. Some sections are page turners, cliffhangers, potboilers. Others drone on endlessly without incident 每 the hero will never fall in love, find a career, figure out how to be a person. Each of us is responsible for imagining the best life possible: the funniest, bravest, most meaningful.Most days I wake up thinking that the world is a mess. I worry about , refugees and world war III. I worry about  and  and sexual slavery and children dying of starvation.On those days, I think about TH White＊s , and Merlin speaking to the young King Arthur. ※The best thing for being sad is?to learn something,§ says Merlin. ※That＊s the only thing that never fails.§I＊ve learned to write my own fairytales. In my fairytale, the bears don＊t eat Goldilocks. She and the baby bear fall in love. They run off together, grow up, have their own baby. The baby is half-human, half-bear; brave and strong and fierce. They call her Celeste, and she grows up to be president of the United Nations of Earth. She governs wisely over a happy and peaceful world for generations to come.That＊s my fairytale.

Already familiar with the refugee crisis through the work of her brother, the al-Jazeera film-maker Karim Shah, she was spurred to write a song, . ※Every day, there were more harrowing stories and images, and it was impossible to write about anything else,§ she remembers. ※At the time, there were no whispers that anyone else was writing about the same subject, and that shocked me.§Around the same time, however, Paul Smith of Max?mo Park was writing about the plight of refugees in the Mediterranean. He had been inspired by  (Moas), a Malta-based foundation that rescues refugees from the sea. He was also disgusted by the callous reaction of some MPs. ※It＊s like someone＊s dying on your doorstep and you say that you＊re not going to open the door,§ he says. Like Shah, he thought he was alone.Both songs came out this year, and, it turns out, they had company. It just isn＊t true to say that nobody was singing about refugees before that. There have been songs by  and , and public statements by  and . But it is certainly a theme whose time has come, with a flotilla of songs including , , ,  and much of Benjamin Clementine＊s new album, I Tell a Fly. ※I had that feeling I＊m sure a lot of people can identify with,§ says Mulvey. ※＆I want to do something. What can I do?＊ When you don＊t see the messages you want to see in the world, you go and make them yourself.§Shah and Smith considered, and indeed hoped, that their songs might be irrelevant by now. If only. In the two years since  became the defining image of the Mediterranean refugee crisis, at least 8,500 people European governments, now focused on deterring refugees rather than saving them, have largely ceded responsibility for search and rescue to the dysfunctional Libyan coastguard and NGOs such as Moas. At the current rate, Amnesty International predicts that the death toll in 2017 promises to be ※§.The metabolism of political songwriting is unpredictable. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young released  days after the killing of four students at Kent State University in 1970, but it took three years after the death of South African activist Steve Biko for Peter Gabriel to deliver . In the case of the migrant crisis, musicians took their time finding the right tone. In the 80s, sincere yet gauche songs such as Do They Know It＊s Christmas? and We Are the World portrayed Ethiopians as a mute, suffering mass, dependent on western charity. Now, great care is taken to give the subjects of songs a voice. Any artist under 40 has grown up aware of the pitfalls of writing songs about political and humanitarian issues, which can easily come across as sanctimonious, exploitative or crude.※When you are writing about someone else＊s life, you have a responsibility to do it justice,§ says Shah. ※The aim was to play a tiny part in humanising the dehumanised. There are over 20 million refugees globally; these figures take away the personal element. In order for people to properly listen, they have to be able to see themselves in other people.§To that end, she did extensive research, watching documentaries and conducting interviews with refugees and NGOs in the UK, France and Turkey. ※It was the most difficult album for me to write because I had to go back and fact-check it. I was very aware of having to make sure that what I was saying was correct.§Mulvey found writing Myela a similarly painstaking process. Inspired by Peter Gabriel＊s ※journalistic§ approach to Biko, he and his co-writer, Federico Bruno, explored the archive of first-hand accounts of refugee journeys on the website of the UNHCR, the United Nations＊ refugee agency. The animated video was directed by Majid Adin, an Iranian refugee who came to London via the now-demolished Calais refugee camp known as the Jungle.※I felt unworthy to write my own poetry around this subject,§ Mulvey says. ※How could I presume to know that degree of uncertainty and trauma? So we decided to make a research project out of it. We thought: why don＊t we use their words in the song? If you present the facts as they are, there＊s no need to be moralistic. The rights and wrongs of the situation are so clear.§Max?mo Park＊s Risk to Exist, the title track of their current album, is more overtly political, addressing the legacy of Europe＊s colonial past and military interventions, but it also encourages listeners to identify with refugees. ※Hopefully, there＊s empathy in the song rather than distant benevolence,§ says Smith. ※If you were in that position, what would you do? Would you wait for your family to shrivel up and die or would you try to move to a place that has been sold to you as the dream? You＊ve got to be sensitive. If I didn＊t deal with it correctly as a lyricist, it wouldn＊t come out.§ For Clementine, the desire to close the gap between artist, listener and subject means rejecting words such as ※refugee§ and ※immigrant§. ※I hate those words,§ he says. ※We have to remember that we＊re all travellers. We move around. That＊s what we＊re made for. We＊re all seeking refuge, we＊re all seeking safety, we＊re all seeking hope. We should stop putting names on human beings for just being human beings.§I Tell a Fly, which he describes as a musical play, includes songs called Welcome to the Jungle and Phantom of Aleppoville, but also draws on his own experiences of living on the streets in Paris and London. ※I have been through a lot in my life,§ he says. ※When people are beyond hopeless, I understand that. There＊s nothing you can do but wait, or fight until you get what you want.§Just as an old-fashioned, paternalistic protest song would sound jarring today, an all-star benefit concert such as would be less effective now. On 20 September, Amnesty and Sofar Sounds are organising . ※The sense of home is something we all empathise with,§ says Augusta Quiney, the director of the charity＊s offshoot, Art for Amnesty. ※It feels more meaningful than that big-concert format.§. ※We found we were pushing at an open door,§ says Quiney. ※I have to say, we have been bowled over.§One of the main people recruiting artists for Give a Home is Stephen Budd from Africa Express, the ever-changing international collaboration established by Damon Albarn and journalist Ian Birrell in 2006. ※There are perhaps fewer boundaries than there once were: less of an idea that you should stay in one place and sing about one thing,§ says Smith, who participated in Africa Express＊s 2012 train tour of the UK. ※This pluralism is undoubtedly contributing to a more globally aware idea of what a pop song could be.§For at least one of Give a Home＊s performers, the crisis is personal. Last summer, Hamsa Mounif of the Orchestra of Syrian Musicians was touring Europe with Africa Express when she decided not to go home. In Damascus, she had received threats from Islamic fundamentalists, saying she would be killed if she continued to sing. After a terrifying introduction to Britain, when a flatmate attacked her, Mounif obtained permission to settle permanently, and now lives in Leicester with her husband.※That moment when I decided was not easy,§ she says. ※When we were playing the Royal Festival Hall, I couldn＊t stop crying. Nobody wants to move from his house and sleep in his neighbour＊s house, even if that neighbour is good. You can say thank you, but you miss your home. My heart is in my country.§Mounif wants to present a positive image of refugees to counter negative stereotypes in the tabloids. ※Sometimes the media gives a bad reflection of refugees. They judge them. I am full of hope to do something good here. I want to be part of this country that said: ＆You can stay here.＊§Despite inhospitable rhetoric from many politicians and parts of the media, a recent survey by the World Economic Forum found that 73% of 18 to 35-year-olds worldwide would welcome refugees to their country. ※Not only are world leaders backtracking on their commitment to support and respect refugees＊ rights but they＊re actively seeking to demonise and scapegoat refugees,§ says Quiney. ※We need really bold action to grab attention and make it clear that everyday people do not accept where our leaders are taking us. Musicians are the perfect people to do that.§Being thoughtful about the responsibility of writing songs about a sensitive issue goes hand in hand with a realistic assessment of what those songs might achieve. Amnesty has specific goals in mind: raising money and awareness, lobbying governments and working with local organisations to help refugees. The practical utility of a song is more nebulous. Now that Brexit and Trump are squeezing so many other stories out of the headlines, songs and concerts can at least help to remind people that the refugee crisis is worse than ever. ※News is a form of entertainment, and at one point this was almost ＆trendy＊,§ says Shah. ※It would get a lot of traffic. Now it doesn＊t. If all we＊re doing is putting it at the forefront of people＊s minds, then that＊s a great thing.§Is that enough? Clementine thinks not. ※I＊m not doing this to raise awareness. How much awareness can one raise? Everyone knows what＊s going on. I＊m doing this so I can help people. I＊ll be donating some of the profits from my album to people who need help.§Many artists are doing similar things. Coldplay and Max?mo Park have both teamed up with Moas, while Mulvey has donated all the proceeds from Myela to Help Refugees UK. Last December, Ellie Rowsell of  collaborated with Help Refugees UK to stage Bands 4 Refugees, a benefit concert in which members of bands such as Alt-J and Years & Years performed cover versions. She hopes other bands will take up the project. ※It can be intimidating to talk about politics, but I think with the refugee crisis it wasn＊t about politics,§ she says. ※It was about showing compassion toward fellow human beings.§A song, Rowsell says, is only one way to make a point. ※It＊s not that I＊ve never considered it, but I find it hard to put social commentary into poetry. I feel, like with social media, you don＊t have to put your opinion across in your music. Things seem to be getting worse, and when that happens the rights and wrongs become a lot clearer. It gives you confidence to speak about it.§Mulvey thinks the influx of songs about refugees is symptomatic of a new wave of political engagement rippling through music. ※Since Trump became president, I＊ve felt part of a global artistic response and a remembering of our duty, and that＊s hugely inspiring,§ he says. ※This is not an isolated issue. I heard Naomi Klein say that refugees and climate change aren＊t issues, they＊re messages, and the message is that the system is broken.§Recently, a friend asked Nadine Shah if she was OK with  releasing a song about refugees, assuming that she would see it as competition. ※Of course I＊m OK!§ Shah says. ※It fills my heart to know that my peers are taking a stance. For years, people were complaining that musicians weren＊t writing political music. All of a sudden, there are lots of people. And so there should be.§?																																											"
"s belligerence between the US and North Korea grows, this is a timely and sober book. Written by a former ambassador to the USSR, it is a trenchant and stimulating analysis of nuclear deterrence as a reaction to a perceived threat (although the US long ago let the genie out of the bottle by bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki).Braithwaite sets out the scientific, social and political developments that led to an arms race, the legacy of that choice and how we manage it. He says maintaining the independent deterrent and the ※special§ Anglo-American relationship determined our foreign policy for decades, ※sometimes to the detriment of other British interests§. He concludes by asking why it hasn＊t all ended with a bang 每 perhaps because we＊ve just been ※very lucky§.   by Rodric Braithwaite is published by Profile Books (?25).

"ere＊s an intriguing and cerebral quasi-genre picture from the Japanese auteur Hirokazu Koreeda. It＊s a complex courtroom drama that can be read at least partly as a piercing 每 if not precisely passionate 每 rebuke to the death sentence. Capital punishment is still on the statute book in Japan, . A more obviously campaigning movie might concentrate on the possibility of hanging the wrong person, or on the squalor of state-sanctioned killing. Instead, The Third Murder is more elusive and relativist. It is about fighting a losing battle to establish the facts, and to grasp a truth that appears to change shape and disappear over the horizon. In the past, Koreeda has been celebrated for his movies in the classic Japanese ※family drama§ style, and has said they are inspired by . But it might be his homage or theme-variation on Kurosawa＊s Rashomon, about the crime, which refuses to reveal itself objectively.The veteran Japanese actor Koji Yakusho plays Misumi, who is shown bludgeoning a man to death at night: the manager of a food-canning factory where he was employed. Misumi took the victim＊s wallet.It seems to be an obvious case: murder and robbery. Misumi has confessed. This man has, moreover, only just been released from prison, for a murder he committed in the 1980s. Despite grounds for clemency due to his confession, as a self-declared two-time killer he will almost certainly get the rope 每 the third murder of the title, perhaps.The state defender acting for him is Shigemori (Masharu Fukuyama), who happens to be the son of the now retired judge who considered Misumi＊s case 30 years before. Yet Shigemori realises there is no material evidence against his client, other than this confession. If he can get Misumi to say something else, something different, some new extenuating circumstance might induce the court to reduce the sentence from hanging to prison.But what Misumi has to say plunges everyone into turmoil. He is vague, slippery, non-committal, claiming not to know why he did it. Koreeda escalates the dismay and anxiety as Shigemori and his legal team find, to their astonishment, that Misumi has given an interview to a supermarket tabloid claiming that the victim＊s wife persuaded Misumi to kill him in return for a share in the life insurance. A deposit into Misumi＊s bank account looks as if it might be a down-payment for such a deal, but it hardly counts as proof, and there is at least as much evidence that Misumi was blackmailing the man over mislabelling cans containing spoiled food.And then there is another theory: Misumi murdered the man out of protective rage because the man was abusing his own teenage daughter, whom Misumi had befriended. But why on earth should the sane-seeming Misumi withhold these things from his own lawyer, and how on earth can they be reconciled with each other?Misumi is to offer yet another explanation as his trial begins, and the surreality of this constantly shifting story and the sheer strangeness and tension of the interview-room face-offs between Shigemori and Misumi are striking. Their faces fill the screen. Often, Koreeda＊s camera will linger on just one, with the other＊s reflection in the security glass superimposed. Shigemori is out of his mind with frustration. Is Misumi making some point against the system? I suspected a certain legal narrative used by Fritz Lang, or even that Misumi is assuming  behind bars. But it is more opaque and unknowable even than this.Perhaps The Third Murder can＊t be made to tie up, and perhaps the point of the film is that without video footage, or even with video footage, evidence for what happened in the past resides in human testimony: people believing other people when they say what happened. And witnesses are fallible and unreliable. The Third Murder is a captivating puzzle.																																											"
"nce a fading 1970s synthpop star, Gary Numan＊s career has been gradually revitalised since Sugababes＊ 2002 smash  mashed up his  and Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson  of electronic industrial gloom. There＊s plenty of the latter on his 21st studio album. Guitars and keyboards crash like falling slabs of granite, percussion pulses throb and synths purr ominously. Numan＊s dystopian worldview hasn＊t been exactly cheered by climate change or leaving Britain for Los Angeles, only to find a Trumpocalypse. ※We live in a windswept hell, not even God remembers§, he sings, bleakly. However, tunefulness permeates the intensity like rays of sunshine. Huge, Cars-type banks of synthesisers fire Bed of Thorns and The End of Things and the east Asian-tinged  (featuring 11-year-old daughter Persia) is one of his catchiest songs in years. For all the retooling, the vintage Numanoid still has a pop star＊s beating heart. 																																											"
"The force is strong with , who will take charge of  following the departure of the film＊s original director Colin Trevorrow.In a statement released on Tuesday, Lucasfilm confirmed that Abrams, who directed first instalment of the current sequel trilogy , would return to direct and co-write the as-yet-untitled film. ※With The Force Awakens, JJ delivered everything we could have possibly hoped for, and I am so excited that he is coming back to close out this trilogy,§ Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said.The decision to install Abrams as director of Episode IX comes a week after the departure of Trevorrow, who Lucasfilm said had ※mutually chosen§ to part ways with the company. The  director was the latest high-profile departure from a Star Wars production after Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who were replaced by  on the Han Solo spin-off movie in June. Lucasfilm also removed  director Josh Trank from an unknown Star Wars standalone movie in 2015. Abrams＊ return to the Star Wars universe was predicted by some in the industry given the success of The Force Awakens, which became the third-highest-grossing film of all time behind Avatar and Titanic when it was released in 2015. The writer and director was also responsible for another successful reboot in the form of the recent  series. Abrams will co-write Episode IX with  screenwriter Chris Terrio. Production for the film is due to begin in February 2018, with the film＊s  from May 2019 to 20 December 2019. Episode IX will be preceded by the eighth instalment of the Star Wars series, , which will reach cinemas on 15 December.

"The remains of victims of concentration camps in  which were gathered by a German racialist scientist for use in experiments have been found in the collection of a major US museum, campaigners claim.Representatives of the Herero and Namaqua peoples of Namibia say skulls and skeletons dating to the German occupation of south-west Africa in the decades before the first world war are being held by the  in New York. Barnabas Veraa Katuuo of the Association of The Ovaherero Genocide said two of the eight human remains in the museum identified as from  were probably those of people who died in concentration camps during an attempt by the German authorities to crush a rebellion by the Herero and Namaqua between 1904 and 1908.The Germans＊ apparent attempt to exterminate entire peoples has led to the killings being described as the ※20th century＊s first genocide§. The museum declined to comment.Historians have described how authorities in Namibia collected and cleaned large numbers of skulls which they despatched to  to be used in pseudo-scientific experiments to support racist theories regarding the inferiority of the African races and the superiority of the German peoples.It is thought some reached the US when the museum bought the private collection of a German anthropologist in the 1920s.※The discovery of remains at the museum is a highly significant event, in that it shows that the genocide of the Herero and Nama peoples in Namibia in the early part of the 20th century involved not only the mass killing of men, women and children, and the confiscation of their lands and livestock, but also ... the desecration of their remains when literally hundreds of skulls and skeletons were carted off to Berlin by German scientists and researchers,§ Katuuo said. Berlin annexed a new colony on the south-west coast of the continent in the 1880s as part of the broader ※scramble for Africa§ among western imperialist powers. The Herero people 每 also called the Ovaherero 每 were subjected to racially motivated violence, rape and murder and rebelled in January 1904. More than 100 German civilians were killed. The smaller Nama tribe joined the uprising the following year. Lothar von Trotha, the German general sent to quell the revolt, ordered his men to shoot ※any Herero, with or without a rifle, with or without cattle§, including women and children. The order was rescinded, but  Tens of thousands were forced into desert regions where wells were deliberately poisoned and livestock killed. Survivors were sent to concentration camps, where they were beaten and worked to death in squalid conditions. Half of the Nama population were also killed. The total death toll is thought to have exceeded 100,000.The remains found in the AMNH were originally collected by Professor Felix von Luschan,   The killings in Germany＊s African colonies are seen by some historians as important steps towards the Holocaust in  during the second world war. Until recently, the episode had been largely forgotten in GermanyGerman officials rejected the use of the word ※genocide§ to describe the killings of the Herero and Namaqua until July 2015, when the Social Democrat foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier,  indicating that the massacre should be referred to as ※a war crime and a genocide§. demands that their representatives be included in negotiations between the government of Namibia and Berlin over reparations. Berlin has repeatedly refused to pay direct reparations, saying that its development aid worth hundreds of millions of euros since Namibia＊s independence from South  in 1990 was ※for the benefit of all Namibians§.

I＊m really sorry if I offended, hurt or disappointed anyone with all of this. Being in the position I am, I should know better ＃ and I owe it to my audience and myself to do better than this.§Kjellberg＊s statement has received a mixed reception from commentators. While it is a more conciliatory apology than that issued by the star following the Wall Street Journal＊s investigation 每  into his use of antisemitic imagery as punchlines to jokes 每 it repeats the defence that Kjellberg used racist language only ※in the heat of the moment§.※I＊ve played video games my entire life and I＊ve definitely done and seen people do dumb things ＆in the heat of the moment＊,§ . ※But I＊ve never seen a friend hurl a racist slur at another player just because they were angry.※Hearing people yell the n-word over voice chat is easily one of the worst things about video games and internet culture in general, and this is the type of behaviour Kjellberg participated in and promoted to his 57 million subscribers on .§																																											"
"f you see one film about a Hungarian hitman in a wheelchair this year, make sure it＊s this one. Writer-director Attila Till＊s plucky comedy-drama isn＊t quite the radical  it seems to think it is, but has its heart in the right place.Non-professionals Zolt芍n Fenyvesi and ?d芍m Fekete play young men with serious mobility issues (the actors themselves are physically disabled in the exact same ways as their characters) residing in an assisted-living home. They start writing a comic book about their adventures with an older friend, Rupaszov (Szabolcs Thur車czy), a greasy-haired badass paraplegic and contract killer for a Serbian mobster (Dus芍n Vitanovics) who runs with a pack of rottweilers. As far-fetched as the concept might seem, Till just about makes it work by stressing the intense physicality of the performances, especially that of veteran character actor Thur車czy who displays the upper body strength of a circus acrobat. Fenyvesi, meanwhile, has an especially soulful face and one can＊t help but hope that film-makers will employ him further. The final twist is annoyingly predictable, but, otherwise, there are very few duff notes.																																											"
" recently received a kidney transplant from television actor Francia Raisa due to her struggle with lupus, the actor and singer revealed on Thursday.Gomez disclosed in an Instagram post confirmed by her publicist that she has been out of the spotlight this summer because she was recovering from the procedure. The 25-year-old calls the transplant ※what I needed to do for my overall health§.The post didn＊t reveal Gomez＊s current condition or say where or when the procedure took place. Gomez＊s publicist declined to release more information. Gomez wrote ※there aren＊t words to describe§ how she can thank Raisa, who she says gave ※the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney.§※I am incredibly blessed,§ she added.The Instagram post includes a picture of Gomez and Raisa holding hands while lying side-by-side in hospital beds and another photo of a scar on Gomez＊s abdomen. The 29-year-old Raisa is best known for her role on the ABC Family series The Secret Life of the American Teenager. Raisa＊s publicist didn＊t immediately return a request for comment Thursday.Gomez revealed her lupus diagnosis in 2015 and took a break from her career last year to deal with anxiety, panic attacks and depression stemming from her battle with the disease.Lupus is an autoimmune disease, where the body mistakenly attacks its own tissues, sometimes including the kidneys. One healthy kidney is all the body needs, so a single kidney transplant can resolve the problem, said Dr David Klassen, chief medical officer for the United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the nation＊s transplant system.※Lupus tends to be a disease of younger women, and younger people tend to do better with transplants than older patients, so the expectation is she would do quite well,§ he said of Gomez.Lupus also tends not to come back after the operation 每 ※the drugs that prevent kidney rejection are also very good for treating lupus, the underlying disease,§ Klassen said.The causes of lupus are unknown. Symptoms can include bloody or foamy urine, unexplained weight gain, high blood pressure or swelling in the legs, ankles or around the eyes.Only about 3% of kidney transplants are for lupus most are due to diabetes or chronic damage from high blood pressure.There were about 19,000 kidney transplants in the US last year.Gomez, whose hits include Good for You, Same Old Love and Come & Get It, has been in the spotlight since she was a child. She appeared on Barney and Friends before breaking through as a teen star on the Disney Channel＊s Wizards of Waverly Place. She has a massive following on social media. Her 126 million followers on Instagram are the most on the platform.She is due to star in a Woody Allen movie next year.Gomez, who has been dating the singer The Weeknd for several months, also has had success behind the scenes as the executive producer of Netflix＊s 13 Reasons Why, the controversial young adult series that became a summer sensation this year.

"n unhappy-looking woman reads a magazine at the kitchen table. She pauses, looks up, deep in thought, then she gets up to go and fetch a pair of scissors from a drawer. Oh God, she＊s not going to do something awful, is she? No, she＊s just cutting out an article from the mag. It seems to have affected her deeply.But then she does do something awful: with a big safety pin, she pins the cutting to her chest, actually through the flesh. And it gets worse still, as she heads over to the oven ... A very literary suicide, and the start of  (BBC1), the second adaptation of the detective novels by Robert Galbraith (AKA JK Rowling).Cormoran Strike 每 the first fictional detective whose name sounds like the cause of a plane crash, a low-flying plane, over the sea ＃ Anyway, the lugubrious gumshoe has become a?feature of Sunday evenings. A?welcome one and very compelling, too, as played by Tom Burke.After Strike＊s success in the first series, , things are looking up at his Denmark Street offices. People are actually turning up, wanting his services. Holliday Grainger＊s character, Robin Venetia Ellacott, PA/PI-in-training, has been retained. Clients can even be turned away; they take on only the cases that interest them, such as that of Leonora Quine. (Leonora is played 每 brilliantly, as ever 每 by Monica Dolan. I don＊t know why Dolan isn＊t more of a household name; maybe it＊s because she＊s too good, her range so great, she＊s such a?human chameleon, that people simply don＊t realise it＊s her.)Anyway, Leonora＊s husband, Owen Quine, a novelist who never lived up to the potential of his first book, has disappeared. This has happened at the same time as a manuscript for his latest work, Bombyx Mori, a?thinly disguised and savage attack on everyone Owen sees as being responsible for the downward spiral of his career, lands like a?turd on the well-tended lawn of literary London. A turd that stinks of bitterness and vengeance, splat. Still, Leonora would like her husband found, even if he does serially?cheat?on?her.Strike does find him, though sadly dead. Horribly so, too 每 tied up, gutted, laid out to be eaten, an exact reenactment of a scene from Bombyx Mori, as it happens. Yes, it＊s also that kind of book 每 full of sadomasochism, necrophilia, cannibalism, as well as slander. Nasty. Still, that narrows down?the fields of suspects a bit. And?No 1 is?Leonora.What! Why would she go to a?detective if she dunnit herself? To which you shout: did you not see The Cuckoo＊s Calling, in which exactly that happened, rather unsatisfactorily? (It＊s better in the book to be fair, why the brother went to Strike, it was to do with framing someone else, but that was lost in the adaptation.)I like this one better. The scene, the people, publishers and agents, rivalry, snarky literary feuds, all ring so true. And the bitter writer, once the next big thing, now increasingly forgotten, he could be so many people. It＊s almost a shame there isn＊t the opposite, a?book that is rejected by lots 每 12, say 每 publishing houses, before going on to be quite a successful series ... although that could look like gloating.Cormoran and Robin＊s relationship gets more interesting, professionally and personally. She＊s still with the dullest man on the planet, Matthew, they have a date set for the wedding, only eight weeks away. Don＊t do it, you＊re (I＊m) shouting. Hey, and if you married Strike, took his name (I know, not cool) and continued up the ladder professionally, you could be the second detective whose name could be the cause of a plane crash 每 a small plane, flying around a garden ＃For now, though, Robin gets to show off her driving skills rather thrillingly, across a west country field. Fiat could extract that section, as is, and put it out as an advert for the Panda. I know about these things, I used to be a renowned motoring journalist, you might remember. You don＊t? Oh well, next I＊ll be found tied up and?disemboweled.The sad lady at the beginning? Another writer, the wife of Owen Quine＊s great rival, whose career has been going rather better than his. And the piece she read, before pinning it to herself and heading to the oven? A?cruel parody of her own novel, possibly written by her own husband. Ouch.																																											"
"hen I called the artist  last year to arrange a meeting, Pauline Portrait, his studio manager, told me he was recovering from a serious bicycle accident. I met with Van der Werve some months later in his studio in Prenzlauerberg, Berlin, and talked about his work as a film-maker, and the aftermath of the accident. It had been a close call 每 doctors said it was only his very strong constitution, built up through marathons and triathlons, that had got him through. You could say he had been saved by art.For more than a decade Van der Werve, now 40, has been making films based on extreme physical endurance and skill, involving climbing, cycling, swimming and running. He combines these with music that he composes, and often performs, paying tribute to the Romantic composers he admires. He is by his own admission a romantic, but a rather mad one, undercutting the existential seriousness of his work with an offbeat humour often veering into absurdity.We sit around a computer screen and watch one of his first films, (all his works are numbered in Dutch and subtitled in English), made in 2003 while he was a student at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam. It shows Van der Werve walking backwards into the suburban street in front of his childhood home, before being knocked down with some force by a car. Ballerinas appear from the back of a police van and dance around his inert body to Corelli＊s .※It was very strange, considering what has happened,§ Van der Werve says grinning, typically deadpan. He wore protection on his leg, he explains, and consulted a stuntman, who told him to lean away from the car, putting his weight on the other leg 每 that way he would bounce over it rather than getting dragged under.Van der Werve is not the first artist to subject himself to often violent physical testing in the name of art, using his own body as an artistic medium. During the 1970s the American artist  had himself shot with a .22 calibre rifle, and nailed to the bonnet of a Volkswagen. The Dutch artist  was lost at sea in 1975, trying to cross the Atlantic in a tiny one-man vessel. But no other artist has pursued the idea with such a sense of the epic. For (2007) Van der Werve stood still for 24 hours on the geographical north pole, shuffling slowly, rotating in a circle as the world revolved the other way 每 anticlockwise 每 beneath him. The film is shot in timelapse, compressed into eight minutes or so, showing him jerking about, trying to keep warm. He used the same methods as the guards at Buckingham Palace, he says, and listened to audiobooks to help beat the boredom. Even more spectacular was his , in which he was filmed walking alone on sea ice in the northernmost part of the Baltic Sea, followed by a vast ship, breaking through the ice with a terrible creaking and shattering sound. was the performance art equivalent of , updated for an age of environmental apocalypse. is always in some way about testing limits, risking failure. For Van der Werve attempted to climb Mount Aconcagua in Argentina, as a prelude to climbing Mount Everest 每 for art. ※I almost died,§ he says, ※it was just very hard and I found myself at a height where human beings shouldn＊t be in the first place.§ He decided not to climb Everest after all.In another film he runs for 12 hours around the holiday house he and the artist , his girlfriend, own in Finland. The film is one shot lasting 12 hours. ※Some guy in New York watched the film all the way through,§ he says, both impressed and bemused. We fast forward to the final few minutes, where he disappears behind the house for a long time, before emerging slowly, dragging his legs. Another epic run is the ※ultra-marathon§ he has completed annually since 2010, 33 miles from New York City up to ＊s grave in the small upstate town of Valhalla. He carries a bunch of chamomiles 每 the national flower of Russia, he explains 每 to place in tribute.Last year＊s run was cancelled, naturally, but he hopes to be fit enough to restart the tradition next year. ※We＊re really focused on the present moment,§ Ketola says, sitting close by, ※our sense of time has changed.§ A couple of months ago, she adds, they ran 10km for the first time since the accident. He clocks up 100km daily on the fixed bike he rides in the studio, he tells me, on whose frame he has inscribed, in English, a version he once read of Chopin＊s last words: ※I don＊t feel the pain any more.§Van der Werve＊s obsession with  每 the master, as he puts it, of abstracting emotion into the 12 notes of the scale 每 is at the heart of his 2012 film . It is his most complicated film to date, involving a 1,000 mile triathlon, swimming, cycling and running from Warsaw, where Chopin＊s heart is preserved, to P豕re Lachaise cemetery in Paris, where his body is buried. Chopin left Poland at the age of 20 for a musical tour and never returned: he died in Paris aged 38. His sister, fulfilling his will, had the grisly task of transporting his heart back to the land of his birth. Van der Werve intertwines his ※Chopin Heart and Body§ triathlon with scenes based on memories of his own childhood in the Netherlands, as well as a narrative about Alexander the Great, shot in locations on the campaign that took the Macedonian leader to the Beas River in the Punjab, where in 326BC he was forced to turn back, dying in Babylon before he reached home. The structure for the film is provided by the 12 sections of the requiem Van der Werve composed for it, performed by an orchestra and choir who pop up at various locations throughout the film.The mood is one of melancholy and existential striving, leavened by a strong sense of the absurd. The film opens with Van der Werve, in wetsuit and goggles, playing the opening bars of his composition on a piano in the Church of the Holy Cross in Warsaw. The orchestra pick up the theme, and he wanders out to begin his epic journey, swimming off down the Vistula. In a later movement the orchestra, playing in a park, remain indifferent as Van der Werve walks by on fire. He returns to his family home to find it crammed with the musicians, and is then winched and dangled, like a figure in a Magritte painting, in the air over the roof by a crane. His mother and girlfriend meet him along the way, helping him on and off the triathlon bike, looking helpless in the face of his obsessive quest. He finally arrives exhausted at the church of La Madeleine in Paris, taking a seat to listen to the final act of his requiem, before hobbling to Chopin＊s grave.It is a madly romantic film, and I＊m one of many viewers who have found it difficult not to be seduced. The intensely personal nature of the quest, the strange and often bizarre scenarios, and Van der Werve＊s strangely self-effacing presence spool you in. The subject is the idea of home, and not being able to get there, but also the desolate scenery of the northern plains of Europe: the riverscapes and roadscapes, postwar housing estates and industrial buildings that seem so characterless compared with the romance and heroism of the past, the lives and stories of Chopin and Alexander the Great. The theme of exile, journeys and historical reminiscence bring into the orbit of the writings of , whose books such as  and have a similar combination of the melancholy and the strange.We watch some of Van der Werve＊s most recent film, , . It is the first of his films shot in a studio, and in which he does not appear, featuring rather groups of people, some of them unclothed, instructed by a mindfulness therapist and a Dutch porn film director. The film progresses slowly in 12 parts, each determined in some way by an astrological sign, and accompanied by music Van der Werve has written for pianola. It is strange and disconcerting, a bleak vision of human life reduced to pure mechanism. The work was made in response to his father＊s death in 2013. As with his sports-based works, he says, it was an act of therapy. Van der Werve is less sure if it was at all effective 每 it at least got rid of some frustrations, he says.Before I leave, Van der Werve offers to play something on the piano. Pauline drifts in and stays a while as he sits to play Chopin＊s . He makes a great effort to concentrate, glancing up and down from hands to the music, clearly still suffering the physical after-effects of the accident. Yet he plays movingly well: the long slow ostinato middle section, the repeated low note, the drops of rain signifying, some say, the dead in the Polish-Russian war; and then the final sunshine modulation, the return to a major key and a feeling of optimism anew. Guido Van der Werve＊s work appears in an exhibition, at Somerset House, London WC2, from 21 September until 10 December, co-curated by John-Paul Stonard. 																																											"
"ne of the consolations of art is that it helps us make human connections. We can see something of ourselves (and something of the artist) in a painting, novel or piece of music. We can link into a wider network of like-minded souls, holding hands across the ages, sharing truths and emotions. And that＊s a lovely thought. While I may feel alienated from many of my fellow citizens here in Brexitannia, I can at least comprehend something of Virgil＊s sorrow for Dido, Van Gogh＊s joy at the stars or Bruce Springsteen＊s desire to bust the heck out of town ＃The idea is appealing but Harriet Paige＊s debut novel makes a convincing case that this is too simple and that there can be a disparity between an artist＊s vision and the way we receive it.Her compelling novel begins with unusual circumstances. While out walking on the beach near his Southend home in the hot summer of 1976, a quiet, lonely council worker called Ray Eccles is struck on the head by a falling seagull. The accident is witnessed by Jennifer Mulholland, a haberdashery supervisor in a local shop, who calls an ambulance, then disappears. When Ray returns home to his small bungalow, things start getting strange. The injury was not painful but ※beautiful§, according to Ray, a description that stops his neighbour in her tracks:Using any materials he can get his hands on (including food, his own blood and semen), Ray begins to paint and repaint the last thing he saw before the bird hit him: Jennifer Mulholland. After a series of playfully contrived coincidences, Ray becomes famous. He is taken in (in more ways than one) by a rich art-collecting couple called George and Grace Zoob. They put him up in their plush pad and promote the pictures of Jennifer he paints compulsively. Ray becomes renowned as an outsider artist and his paintings become the subject of endless comment, all the more fervent because Ray is unable to explain what or why he paints. He just does, endlessly, drawing on walls or even skin when he has no paper.Jennifer, meanwhile, has no idea that her face has become so important, until a friend shows her a newspaper article about Ray. At first Jennifer takes it as a kind of validation and ※proof that she existed§. But soon her reaction becomes more complicated: does Ray really know or care about her reality at all? Similarly, those around Ray find it impossible to understand what he is doing, seeing or trying to convey. There＊s more to Man With a Seagull on His Head than its interesting philosophical ideas. It is funny, sharp, engagingand beautifully written. The prose is clean, unfussy and direct 每 but also expressive. A hot early morning is ※white and dry as a blank page§. An artist＊s model has a body so soft ※it might be possible to knead it into another shape entirely§.As I read, I even found myself making sympathetic, applauding noises. There were insights that felt so true and were so well expressed that I couldn＊t help but hum in approval. I sighed over a scene where Paige describes how Jennifer ※burns§ to have a child 每 but can＊t and instead has to take her husband＊s mother in to her house ※to die§. An even starker realisation about death later on in the book had me gasping. In short, Man With a Seagull really got through to me. Which is pleasingly ironic for a novel that provides such an interesting thesis about the dangers of assuming you can ever really connect with a work of art. It is a precious and strange thing. A bona fide gem. A book that would be a credit to any shortlist. 																																											"
"n 1994 I was travelling around the UK visiting various arts festivals with an eye to setting up a new arts organisation, the future . At the , I was travelling alone. Not knowing the city, I chanced upon a small, out-of-the-way restaurant and during the meal I noticed to my great surprise that  was eating there, too, with a companion.I was, and still am, an enormous fan of  and had a momentary crisis of what I should do about this opportunity to meet him. I decided to approach his table.※Excuse me, I＊m sorry to bother you during your meal,§ I said.They both looked up at me.※But＃ ?§He nodded.※I just wanted to say how much your music has been an important part of my life, say thank you, and wondered if I could shake your hand.§※What＊s your name?§ Van Morrison said.※Jon,§ I replied.He offered his hand and I shook it.※Thank you, Jon,§ he said.I then left them to it.The next day I was walking down one of the many pedestrian precincts in Bath in the sunshine when I noticed Van Morrison coming towards me talking on his mobile phone.As he approached our eyes met and as he passed he raised his hand and mouthed, ※Hi Jon,§ to me as he continued on his way. I was rooted to the spot. I couldn＊t believe it 每 twice in two days.The following day I had finished in Bath, so travelled back to Newcastle. It was my girlfriend＊s birthday and I had a plan to surprise her with a weekend break in Dublin. We flew to the city and after checking into our hotel, decided to walk up O＊Connell Street to St Stephen＊s Green for early evening cocktails in the famous Shelbourne Hotel.The bar was horseshoe-shaped and we had seats at the end of one side. After a few minutes my girlfriend turned to me and said: ※Oh my God! You are not going to believe who has just walked in 每 Van Morrison!§I almost choked on my margarita.I turned around and Van Morrison had taken a seat at the bar opposite us. Our eyes met and after what seemed to be an eternity, he slowly raised his hand and mouthed: ※Hi Jon.§I was speechless with shock.Looking me in the eye, my companion said: ※I didn＊t know you knew Van Morrison.§																																											"
"Any film fan who spots Emily Beecham out and about this autumn might well be wary. After watching the actress star in , the eagerly awaited British film out in cinemas later this month, it would take a steady nerve to approach her for an autograph.※I＊ve had strong reactions to the part. Some people have said to me, ＆Why is she someone who deserves to have her story told?＊§ Beecham told the ., the entertainment industry journal, went further: ※It couldn＊t have been easy for Beecham to live with this character, and to her credit she doesn＊t try to make her likeable; the real mystery is why anyone wants so much as a coffee with this character.§Beecham＊s convincing performance as a sharp-tongued, wayward and unhappy young woman living alone in London is, however, earning her high praise from critics. The signs are that this could be her breakthrough moment.※It＊s a cracking little showcase for rising British actress Emily Beecham, who＊s seldom offscreen for long as the tale＊s lively, complex, intriguing quasi-heroine,§ judged the , making favourable comparisons with Lena Dunham＊s American television hit, .Beecham, 33, was last seen on the big screen playing opposite Ralph Fiennes and Channing Tatum in a much-admired comic vignette from the Coen Brothers＊ 2016 release  The film, which starred George Clooney, was an affectionate study of 1950s Hollywood and Beecham appeared briefly as an ice-cool, glossy-haired studio starlet. It was quite some distance then from her role in  as the eponymous drink-addled, promiscuous kitchen worker and university dropout.※Emily＊s lovely. Nothing like Daphne. She is very friendly,§ said Peter Mackie Burns, the film＊s director. ※And she is nothing like she was in the famous ＆would that it were＊ scene from  either.§Burns and Beecham developed the character of Daphne over several years, together with the screenwriter Nico Mensinga. For Beecham, the part answered a big need for complex and less saccharine female screen roles. ※There is a real thirst for it,§ she said. ※And they are very sought-after jobs when they do come along. Audiences may see these characters as unlikable, but from the actor＊s point of view it is great to find a real character to relate to.§The problem, Beecham suspects, is that filmgoers have been fed a diet of idealised leading ladies and as a result more realistic portrayals seem mean. ※The girlfriend roles that we are usually offered are nearly always just kind and supportive. So it is refreshing for women and for men to see something different,§ she said.Burns agreed that cinema has been slow to catch up with its representations of women. ※Film is still problematic,§ he said. ※It is a very conservative form in many ways. Television responds to things much more quickly.§Complex female characters appeared in literature, yet rarely made it to the big screen, Burns added, citing notable exceptions such as  in 1969, starring Maggie Smith, director , and  in 1967. Critics have also compared  with the 1977 American film of the bestselling book, .For the future, Burns said, he would like to ban the phrase ※strong woman§ from film-making. ※What does it mean? You should make any character three dimensional, that is all: someone you can recognise from your own experience. In  we are really asking what happens when you become the person you were pretending to be. When you have put up a carapace and then realise you are living in a way you probably should not be.§The Scottish director and Beecham, who grew up in Cheshire and Hertfordshire, have already made a short film, , based on a similar character. Burns then wrote a detailed description of Daphne, including what she reads () and what music she listens to.※I would give the pages to Emily and set her to work,§ said Burns. ※Once we got on set I didn＊t ever discuss how she would play a scene. We were very collaborative and we tried not to rehearse much or have too many takes.§Beecham found it hard to leave Daphne behind when filming finished. ※We all got attached to her as a character. We only had four weeks on the shoot and it was sad it came to an end,§ she said. ※I absolutely would revisit her. It is a rite of passage film, in a way, and I recognise myself and my friends in some of it.§Beecham is a friend of , creator and star of the acclaimed television series , and the two share views about creating better roles for women.※We＊ve known each other for about 10 years now and I relate to her feelings about what she went through. When you leave drama school you get a bit of a shock when you find you are stuck in your own casting bracket. And it is all about your looks. Now people are starting to write their own roles in response to that.§Before the British release, Burns offers his star the ultimate bouquet. ※She is like Gena Rowlands and there is no higher accolade from me. I think you forget that she is acting.§																																											"
"hen the comedian  confessed on an American chatshow last week that he is neither ※a people person§ nor ※an animal person§ and insisted he is one of the rare 2% who fit neither category, it fell a bit short of a TV scoop.His admission will not surprise anyone who has watched a video clip from David＊s hugely influential, award-winning sitcom , let alone those aficionados who have devoured all eight seasons. But what his interview with host Jimmy Kimmel did do quite nicely was remind viewers of David＊s knack for skewering the absurdities of modern parlance. It is a knack fans of the show have sorely missed in the six years since a new episode aired.From the moment  first offered a parodic glimpse of the comedian＊s Los Angeles home life in October 1999, David has been lovingly curating a public persona that is so out of sorts with the world that even in promotional mode for his new series he remains determinedly grumpy. In fact, especially in promotional mode. Asked this summer why he is reviving the show after so long, David said it was purely because he couldn＊t face the repeated question ※is the show coming back?§.Regardless of David＊s curbed enthusiasm, the arrival of the ninth series on  will rank as one of the most hotly anticipated resurrections in TV history 每 and this in spite of both the online leaking of several hacked episodes, and the undeniable truth that David＊s dyspeptic sense of humour is not everyone＊s glass of Californian ros谷.By now an appreciation of the  canon is used as a common marker of insider tastes. The show＊s most famous admirers, such as Ricky Gervais, lapped up its haphazard expos谷 of the daily irritations of someone who really has little to complain about. And its many rank and file devotees can recite sequences of dialogue just like others do with Monty Python sketches, favourite episodes of or quirky scenes from .That David, who was 70 this summer, became a major player in American television is largely down to his key creative role on , the show that starred Jerry  as a charming but callow New Yorker in search of an easy way through life. This seminal sitcom, which also starring Julia Louis Dreyfus and Jason Alexander, remains a pillar of mainstream entertainment 19 years after its final episode. Yet David walked away from it after seven successful seasons, explaining he could not cope with the pressure to stay on form. ※I didn＊t want it to fall off,§ he said. Similar fears have no doubt dogged him in the long gap since season eight of .Luckily, during the interim, another member of the David family took up the baton. Cazzie David, the comedian＊s 23-year-old daughter, put together four episodes of a show called  on YouTube earlier this year and it bore all the carefully etched curmudgeonly, shallow hallmarks of her father＊s work.※It＊s pretty amazing,§ her father said. ※I＊ve never been that happy for another person in my life. It＊s great. I＊m her biggest fan.§So what does the new  promise? Among welcome familiar elements will be Leon, Larry＊s perpetual house guest, played by J B Smoove, Cheryl Hines as his exasperated ex-wife, and Jeff Garlin as his longtime agent. What will be different? According to David, Larry will be more self-assured this time. ※Every day confirms, more and more, he＊s right! He＊s right about everything; he＊s rarely, rarely wrong. And when he is, he apologises.§ Also new will be Bryan Cranston, of  fame, appearing as Larry＊s therapist. (※Unfortunately for him.§)Those who find David＊s crotchety alter ego a depressing cultural icon for our times are already most of the way to the intended joke. Even David＊s drawled catchphrase ※preeetty good§ is deliberately lacklustre and bland. , its creator seems to imply, is no better than we all deserve. What＊s more, its improvisational style has inspired a general shake-up of on screen comedy, from Judd Apatow＊s cinematic hits, to popular British TV sitcoms such as  and .David grew up in a noisy family home in Brooklyn, the son of a garment industry worker. As a schoolboy he steered away from performance, although he enjoyed it, fearing he would seem effeminate. His move into stand-up comedy came after time spent as a student in Maryland, a place where he felt unable to fit in with the blooming hippie culture. ※I had a very difficult time with the lingo,§ he has explained. ※I couldn＊t bring myself to use those words.§Although David often denigrates his stint on the stand-up circuit, he swiftly gained the status of a comics＊ comic; a dangerous player, who would sometimes walk off stage mid-set.Once David had created , a sitcom ※about nothing§ which famously embraced a radical new mantra, ※no hugging, no learning§, he made a film, , and then planned a return to comedy clubs. But the television triumph of  intervened.According to Hines the essence of the show＊s appeal is David＊s desire to dwell on social discomfort. ※If there＊s a moment that feels awkward, most people are happy to move past that moment and never think about it again. Whereas Larry sees it and feels it and realises how funny it is and then makes an entire episode of that moment. It＊s finding that place where most of us don＊t want to stay. And he cannot wait to set up camp,§ she has said.David has described creating the show＊s plots as like ※putting together a giant jigsaw puzzle§. He writes a brief outline as the basis for the actors to improvise from, and reportedly then always loses his nerve temporarily. The end result is a show that approaches difficult subjects, both small and large, with a bold lack of cant.Not everyone is so beguiled, of course. The writer and critic Cosmo Landesman points out a lack of social context in the show 每 possibly more of a problem now in the era of Trump.※Without the grumpy schtick I wonder if David has anything funny to say,§ said Landesman. ※He has to look at the little problems because the rest of it is so smooth. There is no conflict and the whole world is kissing his arse. Is it satire? Or is it self-satisfaction?§Landesman also suspects  has had a bigger effect on the way people behave in real life than it has had on other comedians. And not in a good way. It has given people, he argues, an unhealthy licence to dwell on the minutiae of life. Certainly, the comics＊ trick of ※bravely§ drawing attention to their own failings is a standard way to establish social dominance. But David sees the TV version of himself as a projection of how liberated he would like to be.※We all have good thoughts and bad thoughts, but nobody ever expresses the bad thoughts. We just think them and don＊t say them,§ he once told Gervais. ※But the bad thoughts are funny. I＊m such a liar in my life 每 keeping things to myself, not really telling my true feelings 每 that I feel like I want to go completely the other way when I have the opportunity.§This summer, however, David suggested the relationship with his  incarnation is a little closer, and not just when it comes to a shared love of golf. §I don＊t know if you＊re aware of this or not,§ he said to assembled media, ※but TV Larry is just a quarter-of-an-inch away from real Larry.§David＊s real ex-wife, Laurie David, is kinder. ※The show-Larry is much more aggressive,§ she has claimed. ※The real Larry is very gentle and very sweet and doesn＊t like to offend people.§But the last word should go to Smoove, who plays that houseguest Larry can＊t shake off. ※They are one and the same,§ he has judged.I had a wonderful childhood, which is tough because it＊s hard to adjust to a miserable adulthood.I don＊t like to be out of my comfort zone, which is about a half an inch wide.

"e was one of cinema＊s biggest stars, but  behaved like a ※monster§ and seemed ※hell-bent on sabotaging§ , one of his last films, according to its screenwriter.When Ron Hutchinson was asked to work on a film with  star in 1996, he could not believe his luck. In adapting HG Wells＊s science fiction novel about a renegade scientist who creates an island of monsters, Hutchinson would be working with one of his great acting idols, as well as the acclaimed director John Frankenheimer. There was the added bonus of spending a couple of months on the Great Barrier Reef and in the rainforests of northern Australia.But when Hutchinson joined the production team, he witnessed ※one of the legendary movie disasters of all time§, describing it as a ※$40m train wreck§.He was shocked to discover that Brando 每 who he claims arrived on location ※weighing about 300 pounds§ 每 would not recite words written for him: ※He wanted to improvise it all.§ And Brando would rarely emerge from his trailer: ※They were flying in these hapless [studio] executives to try to beg him to come out of his damned trailer.※Brando was only answering the door when the pizza man came. This was the best news that the pizza-makers of Cairns, this small town, had ever had because Brando was consuming industrial quantities of pizza while ruminating on what the hell he was going to do when he had to face the cameras. I think there might have been an existential terror there.§Hutchinson, who was born in Northern Ireland, is an Emmy award-winning screenwriter, Olivier-nominated playwright and was writer-in-residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company before making the move to work in Hollywood. His five previous collaborations with Frankenheimer included the Emmy-winning , about the 1971 Attica prison riot, starring Samuel L Jackson.Next month, Oberon Books will publish his memoir, . In it he has relived a painful chapter of his career 每 so painful that he has never watched  since its completion.In an interview with the , Hutchinson recalled that he had been working with the director Stephen Daldry on a revival of his 1984 Royal Court hit,  when he was contacted by Frankenheimer.Although Brando revolutionised acting with his mesmerising performances in classics such as and , he was known to loathe producers, directors and even acting. Frankenheimer had warned Hutchinson that there were difficulties with working with Brando, sending over some initial footage shot after he replaced the original director, Richard Stanley.※He [Frankenheimer] said: ＆Take a look at these [tapes] before you actually commit.＊ They showed Brando sitting in a hammock with literally the smallest person who＊s ever been measured by scientists, the actor Nelson De la Rosa who was just under 28 inches tall.※Brando absolutely fell in love with this guy. He put him on his chest in the hammock and sang ＆Frog Went A-Courting＊ to him. There was 90 minutes of that. John said: ＆This is all I can persuade Brando to do.＊?§Hutchinson writes in his book: ※By this stage of his life Brando, playing the God of Moreau＊s island and emerging as the God of the production, was way beyond bored with the making of movies. Overweight, unprepared, mocking, dismissive, on the razor＊s edge where caprice becomes malice, the case for the prosecution is therefore easily made. He was indeed here to sabotage this movie.§He continues: ※Brando placed a kitchen colander on his head, slathered himself in sunscreen, fell in love with Nelson, retired to his trailer and refused to leave it.§Looking back, Hutchinson now notes the irony that, in making a film about an island of monsters, everybody in the movie turned into a monster: ※Everybody behaved monstrously to each other.§He was shocked to discover the ※poisonous§ relations between Brando and most of the other actors. Careful about mentioning names, Hutchinson refers to incidents including a ※prohibition§ on one actor being allowed to handle a gun 每 even one that fired blanks.There was such intense hatred that the executives eventually ※threw up their arms§ and asked the actors to film ※a one-man show§ that would be stitched together in post-production: ※It was an island of crazy people 每 an awful experience.§																																											"
"hirty years ago, science fiction was terminally unfashionable on British television. Few would have given a sci-fi sitcom a hope, yet Red Dwarf＊s creators Rob Grant and Doug Naylor revelled in their underdog status.The premise was ingenious: defiantly slobbish Dave Lister () wakes up on a mining vessel 3m years after the radiation leak that wiped out the crew. The last human in the universe, his only companions are magnificently irritating hologram Arnold Rimmer (), idiotic yet omnipotent ship＊s computer Holly (Norman Lovett and, later, Hattie Hayridge) and a humanoid evolved from cats (), bearing the perceptible DNA of both Prince and James Brown.Marrying the slacker aesthetic of Dark Star to the wry humour of , it had both the innate melancholy and odd-couple dynamic central to all great sitcoms. The wobbly staging added to the charm; Naylor and Grant had crafted a lived-in universe with a keen sense of self-awareness, refusing to let budgets act as a brake on their imaginations. Once  had joined as fussy mechanoid Kryten, the conceptual shenanigans 每 always ambitious and interesting 每 had a fully functioning ensemble to bring them to life. The array of ideas Red Dwarf explored was dazzling, from the implications of AI to the vagaries of memory, talking toasters to curry monsters. By 1990, it was the best British sitcom on TV, its catchphrases (※Smeg!§, ※Smoke me a kipper, I＊ll be back for breakfast§) instantly recognisable, with an?International Emmy the crowning glory. For a cult sitcom?in a niche genre, such mainstream acceptance was an extraordinary achievement.Perhaps the seventh series could only have disappointed. Grant had moved on, leaving co-creator Naylor to soldier on alone, seemingly exposed as the straight man in the partnership: an apparent lurch into comedy-drama may simply have been the result of a drought of comic invention. A disillusioned Barrie left and focused on The Brittas Empire 每 could a greater snub be imagined? 每 while (re)introducing Lister＊s girlfriend, Kristine Kochanski, as ship＊s scold gave Chlo? Annett nothing to work with. The chemistry had been fatally undermined.The jettisoning of the studio audience saw the actors playing to an invisible crowd while their characters either reverted to one dimension or resorted to navel-gazing that strove for poignancy but palled into dullness. Series eight was even worse, abandoning the idea of Lister and co being alone in space and resurrecting the entire crew for a conventional sitcom with an overreliance on bad CGI. It killed the franchise for a decade, by which time its moment had passed.Or had it? 2009. Enter Lister＊s namesake channel Dave, brimming with both witty banter and bullish confidence. Red Dwarf: Back to Earth was feverishly anticipated, making its utter smegging ineptitude all the more dismaying. Dave pressed on and . But, with the chances of matching its imperial phase receding faster than Chris Barrie＊s hairline, it might be time to abandon the crew to their fate before the whole thing starts to resemble a?subpar Red Dwarf episode about the endless reliving of one＊s glory days.

"What do guns when they are not in use?In the dead of night they double and divide,naming new owners, finding a new ruse.Carry a gun on stage, it must be fired. only lasts until undone.Better they are counted out of mind.List the ways to frame a decommission,a car-park graveyard covered with cement.Which stay on stasis is sufficient?Marking each as Keeping their provenance as you would art.Rocking the replicas back to their false start.It＊s got to be efficient.A suggestive metaphor  provides the title of Siobh芍n Campbell＊s new collection, , and sustains its resonance in this week＊s poem. The invention of the mimeograph, an early copying machine, dates back to the 19th century. It was supplanted by the photocopier some time ago. But the reader doesn＊t need to remember the mimeograph to get the reference, since imitation (as in mime) is spelled out in the word itself, and emphasised in its implied cohabitation with ※original§. The double summoning of the past, including the recent past, is surely apt. Campbell＊s larger focus is the contemporary ※matter of Ireland§. Unusually, there＊s little sense of a north-south border, or at least one that can＊t be freely trampled. The Dublin-born Campbell seems comfortable with the uncomfortable, a native not of the south or north but of the problematic, including . This poem challenges assumptions about the value of de-commissioning. Replication undermines the pledge to put a weapon ※beyond use§ (line 10 quotes the formula) and mocks the burial: the dead weapon in its ※car-park graveyard§ proliferates. These guns are not only undead: they ※double and divide§. Terseness predominates in Campbell＊s syntax as the phrasing of the opening questions signals. Not: ※What do guns do when they＊re not in use?§ but ※What do guns when they＊re not in use?§ This usage heightens the notion of the guns＊ sparky animation. The weapon has a sinister life of its own, and can find its own combatants and reasons for use. The rhyming of ※use§ and ※ruse§ is eloquent. The second stanza  about theatrical guns and broadens the poem＊s frame of reference. Campbell herself, in her thesis reads Origin of the Mimeo as a poem about poetry. Chekhov＊s rule highlights the contract of author and auditor, and could apply to any significant object, and to other literary genres than drama. The rule might be extended to embarrass the concept of the weapon as a deterrent: if it exists, it will be used. But Campbell is interested in the question at the level of this specific poem: having introduced the gun on to the stage of the poem, is she obliged to fire it?  Campbell＊s lines are mostly in trochaic pentameter; they have a terse orderliness but are never leisurely. Her single-sentence, single-line statements are perhaps meant to be verbal gunshots. Or perhaps it＊s the curtailed last line that fires the gun.  In stanza two, the moral clincher of the third line plays on the verb in apposition, ※counted out§ and its transformation into ※counted out of mind§. Previously, the italics of  remind us of a word claiming too much for itself.  In the third stanza the idea of the list is raised and mocked by the image of ※ a car-park graveyard covered with cement§. There are too many ways to ※frame a decommission§, beginning with the interpretation of ※frame§, no doubt. The phrase has an odd echo of Elizabeth Barratt Browning counting the ways of love, possibly hinting at Campbell＊s resistance to lyric sentimentality.  Lyrical grace may be suspect, the terza rima casually plaited, but there＊s an energy in the language, buried metaphors, gleams of wordplay that are more than mere lace (※stay on stasis§, ※rocking the replicas back to their false start§). The latter is particularly interesting. Campbell points out the Yeats connection with ※rocking§ in her thesis: presumably it＊s primarily . Only the decommissioning of the mind will put the gun beyond use. Meanwhile, the very word gun is potent, a disturbing image in three coiled letters. Perhaps the poem itself is mimetic, a small, loaded object with underground connections, its own forms of subterfuge and escape.  The thought is often complex. To keep  ※as you would art§ suggests the placing of a high value on the original. This may of course be an allusion to historical responsibility. In ※rocking the replicas back to their false start§, it＊s the term ※false start§ that suggests the possibility of beginning afresh. The throwaway last line can be read in several ways. It looks back to the earlier lines of the quatrain, that powerful triad of gerunds, which answered the command to ※list the ways to frame a decommission§: ※Marking each as  Keeping their provenance as you would art. / Rocking the replicas back to their false start.§) And, grammatically, the pronoun ※it＊s§ refers to the ※stay on stasis§. There＊s a complicating idiomatic twist in the line. ※It＊s got to be efficient§ can mean ※it＊s sure to be efficient§ or ※it will need to be efficient§. Then there＊s the (attractive) potential for irony 每 ※none of this is at all efficient§. The poem decommissions neither optimism nor pessimism. It＊s a finely balanced piece.																																											"
"horeographer  and director  have previously collaborated on works for outdoor spaces, but in Dead Club they move inside, to mastermind one of the most enjoyably baffling productions I＊ve seen in ages. A disorienting tangle of riddles around notions of death, memory and perception, the work messes with us from the moment we enter The Place, whose auditorium has been so radically reconfigured as to be almost unrecognisable. The area is dominated by a large raised stage, decorated with a riotous gestalt of patterns, and the audience are left to squeeze around the edges, squinting up at the performers who loom over us, like grotesques from a dream. These performers (four men, one woman) morph from precocious party children in shorts, ruffles and bright white socks, to churchy Victorians, to mild 21st-century hipsters. They sing to us, dance in wickedly tight disco formations; one man, naked but for a pair of rotting underpants, occasionally drifts across the stage like a displaced Christ. The hour-long show is part cabaret, part funeral ceremony, part end-of-the-world party. Staccato bangs and blinding flashes disrupt the action as the performers appear and disappear through trapdoors in the floor. Equally startling are the objects that drop without warning from the ceiling 每 dead crows, a severed arm. At one point the Christ figure cradles the body of a deer in his arms, as the creature appears to shiver through an exquisite death agony. There＊s a flavour of Poe here, mashed up with , Lewis Carroll and German expressionism. And with performances and design of such meticulous verve Dead Club is, at the very least, a captivatingly deviant spectacle. But the work also sends out teasing signals of meaning, which centre around a group of miniature model characters who pop up through the floor. These seem like toy representations of the recently deceased, whose memories, dreams and fantasies have been given a rampantly surreal afterlife in the party scene of the Dead Club. There＊s such a teeming mix of symbolism in the work, however, and such a riot of effects (including a beam of light that rakes over the audience, as if selecting individuals for membership of the club), that it＊s a mistake to over-interpret. The excess of confusion, the evocation of a magisterially random universe are themselves a pleasure and they stay in the mind, subversive and perplexing, for a long time afterwards.

"The prominent Turkish novelist Ahmet Altan has written an essay from his prison cell on the eve of his trial, describing his detention in a high-security jail where he is forbidden to send ※even a two-line letter to my loved ones§.Altan, the author of 10 acclaimed novels that have been translated around the world, as well as essays and journalism, was arrested last September following the attempted coup in  in July 2016. Charges against him include ※giving subliminal messages in favour of a coup on television§, ※membership of a terrorist organisation§ and ※attempting to overthrow the government§. Altan faces a possible life sentence if he is found guilty of the charges.He has been detained since September 2016, apart from a brief release on probation when he told the press: ※This country is ours, we are not afraid. We＊ll always defend law and democracy,§ before being imprisoned again less than 24 hours later. A host of writers, including Philip Pullman, Arundhati Roy, JM Coetzee and AS Byatt have called for his release,  in which they say his ※crime is not supporting a coup but the effectiveness of his criticism of the current government§.With his trial set to begin on Tuesday, Altan detailed his experience in prison , translated by Yasemin ?ongar and published on Monday by the Society of Authors and English PEN. In it, Altan reveals he is ※being held in a high-security prison in the middle of the wilds§, in a cell where he is given his meals through a hole in the door, and where ※even the top of the small, stone-paved courtyard where I pace up and down is covered with steel cages§. He is not allowed to see anyone but his lawyers and his children, he writes, and is ※forbidden from sending even a two-line letter to my loved ones§.※Whenever I have to go to the hospital they pull handcuffs out of a cluster of ironwork and put them around my wrists,§ he writes. ※Each time they take me out of my cell, orders such as ＆raise your arms, take off your shoes＊ hit me in the face.§But Altan also writes of how this is ※not the whole truth§, because the books he is reading and stories he is imagining are helping him to survive his incarceration. ※When I wake up with the whisper of the snow piling up inside the window bars in winter, I start the day in that dacha with a front window where Doctor Zhivago took refuge. Until now, I have never woken up in prison 每 not once,§ he writes. ※I talk all day with people who are seen and heard by no one, people who don＊t exist and won＊t exist until the day I mention them ＃ As I don＊t want to put them on paper in prison, I inscribe all of this into the crannies of my mind with the dark ink of memory.§Because he is a writer, Altan says, ※they may have the power to imprison me but no one has the power to keep me in prison§, because ※wherever you lock me up I will travel the world with the wings of my endless mind ＃ Like all writers, I have magic. I can pass through walls with ease.§The Society of Authors has been working with English PEN and the Publishers Association on  to free Altan and his brother Mehmet Altan, an economist and journalist who is also detained. The writers＊ organisations say that the conditions of Altan＊s detention are ※a cause of particular concern§, because he and his brother ※are reported to have very limited access to their lawyers and families, and no access to prison facilities such as the library and sports hall§. They are also banned from sending or receiving any written communications 每 making the publication of his essay ※no mean feat§.Writers backing the campaign include Chocolat author Joanne Harris, who said on Monday: ※Writers exist to question, to challenge, sometimes even to ridicule 每 the status quo. For a government to imprison a writer for doing this is to attack, not only freedom of speech, but freedom of the imagination. It is a backward, oppressive and ultimately futile gesture that can only lead to greater and more damaging social unrest. I condemn it entirely, and hope that Ahmet Altan is freed as soon as possible.§																																											"

"arwin was wrong,§ begins AN Wilson in this entertaining and maddening book. Thus having tossed a dead pigeon upon the picnic rug, he gleefully sets about ruining everybody＊s lunch. The originator of ※the single greatest idea anybody ever had§ was, we are told, an intellectual thief, a morose hypochondriac, objectionably flatulent, obnoxiously ambitious and 每 worst of all 每 mistaken.The author follows Darwin from boyhood bereavement to the deck of the Beagle, thence to the study and sickrooms of Down House and the publication of , evoking the epistemological hurly-burly of the mid-Victorian age in characteristically stylish prose. These are vividly peopled pages: here is the pious depressive Robert FitzRoy, captain of the Beagle, fretfully clutching his bible; here is Emma Darwin, who preferred her husband sickly to well. Episodes are narrated with Dickensian energy: the tubercular death of Annie Darwin is highly affecting; there＊s comical verve in the scene of the Oxford debate at which ※Soapy Sam§ Wilberforce inquired of Thomas Henry Huxley if he was descended from an ape on the paternal or maternal line (a nearby lady fainted); and there is enjoyment to be had in watching Darwin scrutinise the sexual organs of barnacles, puzzling over their relevance to his nascent theory.Such are the book＊s pleasures; but it contains, so to speak, no small number of missing links. The author deplores Darwin＊s lifelong failure ※to acknowledge intellectual debts and influences§ 每 yet in just one paragraph of one chapter of  the reader will find a debt to William Buckland and his ※long ago§ remarks; to ※our great palaeontologist§, Richard Owen; to Georges Cuvier and his discovery of fossil links; and to Joachim Barrande, than whom ※a higher authority could not be named§. There are accounts of contemporaries very nearly pipping Darwin to the post 每 Alfred Wallace, who presented a paper with Darwin to the ; Edward Blyth, whose work on the transmutation of the species faltered with the failure of his druggist＊s shop 每 but this is evidence less of Darwin＊s overweening ambition than of his operating within the zeitgeist of the age.Elsewhere, Wilson ponders the influence on Darwin of Malthusian economics, and the theory that since food supply can never match population growth, humanity must be forever locked in a struggle in which only the ruthlessly self-interested can survive. Parallels with the proposition that adaptations within species enable survival are obvious; less obvious, however, is Wilson＊s suggestion that Darwin favoured Malthusian thought because it bolstered his sense of ※superiority to the working class§, and his entitlement to personal wealth.One begins to feel that Wilson is motivated by personal dislike, as if he was once cut by Darwin at a party and has since nursed  ever since. That Darwin endured chronic gastric distress is depicted as a failure of mind,?not of body; his grief at the early death of his mother is portrayed as ※compulsive time-wasting§ and ※mindless brooding§. Pondering Darwin＊s confession that notwithstanding reservations over church doctrine he ※liked the thought of being a country clergyman§, Wilson wonders if money was the sole allure, adding waspishly: ※Dons love money. They can smell it§ 每 as if the rest of us simply can＊t abide the stuff.It is no mean task for a reviewer untutored beyond a general grasp of evolutionary theory to assess to what extent Wilson＊s critique of Darwin is inaccurate: in the , it falls to the science historian John van Wyhe to offer a pithy rebuttal, citing for example a confusion on the author＊s part between Darwinism and Lamarckism. But even the lay reader 每 certainly one who has seen, for example, the fossil  每 will frown at the book＊s thesis that an absence of ※transitional forms§ in the fossil record fatally undermines Darwin. Wilson cites the palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould, who ※quipped that the absence of transitional forms was ＆the trade secret of palaeontology＊§每 but Gould himself, exasperated at having offered grist to the creationist mill, said: ※It is infuriating to be quoted＃ as admitting that the fossil record includes no transitional forms.§Wilson states quite baldly that Darwin would respond in the negative to the question posed by an enslaved man on his grandfather Josiah Wedgwood＊s abolition medallion, §, and surmises that Darwinism informs Nazi ideology. Certainly Darwin betrayed the parochial bigotry of the 19th-century Englishman: he referred to the ※immense mongrel population of Negroes and Portuguese§, and viewed Tahitian women with open distaste. (As?an aside, this failure on Darwin＊s part to enter priapic rapture at the sight of naked women causes Wilson to glance confidingly at the reader and raise the ※unanswerable question of Darwin＊s sexuality§).No special pleading that these are views typical of the 19th century can mitigate the disfavour with which they should be met; but the argument does not evolve from here that Darwin supported the slave trade. His opposition to it was adamant and sustained. In 1861 he wrote to the American botanist Asa Gray deploring slavery as ※the greatest curse on Earth§. This was no off-hand remark: in 1863 he wrote again to Gray expressing the hope that Lincoln＊s ※fiat against slavery§ would succeed; in 1866 he celebrated the ※grand, magnificent fact that slavery is at an end§. Indeed, it might be argued that a belief in the fundamental equality of man is logically essential to Darwin＊s assertion that humans descended equally from a common ancestor 每 an assertion running counter to the scientific racism in circulation in the 19th century, when Arthur de Gobineau＊s repellent essay On the Inequality of the Human Races had popular appeal.This book, with its elisions, inaccuracies, vivid set pieces and palpable dislike for its subject, has I suspect achieved its end: the air is thick with ruffled feathers. Perhaps it will be looked on most fondly by those who find proponents of the new atheism intractable and priggish: they may well take enormous pleasure in watching a scholarly gentleman in a butcher＊s apron approaching a sacred cow.  by AN Wilson is published by John Murray (?25).

"When Nakkiah Lui first read the script for Branden Jacobs-Jenkins＊ play An Octoroon, she was ※kind of angry and really jealous§.※My first thought was, why didn＊t I write this play?§ she says.Her second thought was more practical: ※Why isn＊t anyone putting this work on?§Lui 每 playwright, actor, columnist whose previous theatre credits include  and  每 had recently been appointed to the national artistic team at Queensland Theatre, along with other emerging and established artists including The Sapphires director Wayne Blair and indie theatre company Elbow Room＊s Marcel Dorney. When she first brought Jacobs-Jenkins＊ play to the company＊s artistic director, Sam Strong, it was out of a desire to see more black works on stage.※Why don＊t we import new works by people of colour? We don＊t really do that,§ she explains. ※Why are all our classics by white people? White men, but white people? Why aren＊t we bringing in new works to put on, overseas plays, that are by people of colour, that discuss racial politics?§When we speak, it＊s a week into rehearsals for Queensland Theatre＊s production of An Octoroon, with Lui in her directorial debut. She had no specific ambition to direct the work herself, but her passion for it is obvious 每and who better to put an Indigenous Australian spin on an African-American meta-commentary on an Irish stage adaptation of an American novel? Yes, it＊s that complicated. Jacobs-Jenkins＊ play is a contemporary American reinterpretation of the 1859 melodrama The Octoroon by Irish playwright Dion Boucicault. (Boucicault himself was adapting a novel, The Quadroon, by Thomas Maine Reid.) The central narrative concerns a plantation owner, George Peyton, who arrives home from a trip to find himself financially ruined due to the mismanagement of his estate by his caretaker, M＊Closky.While being courted by wealthy socialite Dora, who may save his fortunes, George falls in love with Zoe 每 the daughter of his uncle and a slave, and the ※octoroon§ of the title (the derogatory term is used to describe a person who is one-eighth black by descent). But M＊Closky is also in love with Zoe, and knows that, due to her heritage, she is legally part of the property. So he plots to use this to his advantage 每 to have her sold off, to prevent her marrying George.The plot alone is complicated enough, but Jacobs-Jenkins＊ script reorients Boucicault＊s work to his own perspective: the central character becomes a playwright called ※BJJ§ 每 script directions state he is to be ※played by an actual playwright, African-American actor, or black actor§ 每 who breaks the fourth wall, initially to complain that all the white actors have quit his production, leaving him to play a number of key (white) roles himself. What follows is Boucicault＊s narrative 每 more or less 每 reimagined by BJJ, and punctuated by cutting and hilarious commentary.And Lui is taking the whole thing a step further 每 with Jacobs-Jenkins＊ blessing 每 removing the play from the context of the United States＊ south and giving it an Australian spin. The African-American characters in the script become Indigenous Australian (the cast includes Colin Smith, Melodie Reynolds-Diarra and Shari Sebbens among others) and the plantation in question shifts to far north Queensland. Lui says surprisingly little of the script needed to change in order to make it work for an Australian context: ※It＊s been a surprise in the room how those words fit into an Aboriginal vernacular and twang.§Part of the reason the shift works, says Lui, isbecause there are commonalities between the experiences of black Americans and . But while Australian audiences demonstrate a clear capacity to be critical of history and politics when it comes to the US, Lui says, they are remarkably less critical of what happens in their own backyard.※It＊s interesting, as an Aboriginal person in Australia, that people are more willing to engage with the history and be empathetic 每 sympathetic 每 with overseas diasporas than they are for people here,§ she says.※We will go see Django Unchained and we will cheer for Django, and we will watch 12 Years a Slave and we will lament about how bad slavery is; we will look at Charlottesville and we will think gee, isn＊t Trump a racist. We will question them about their xenophobia for building a wall; we＊re so empathetic at times.※I think Australia has this capacity ... to be critical of overseas history and politics but yet in Australia we just do not mention it. And if you mention it, you are creating a victim narrative, just for wanting the truth recognised.§She hopes that using ※an overseas lens§ will help cut through to local audiences.Boucicault＊s play prompted debate over slavery: some saw it as an abolitionist work, while others thought it was sympathetic towards slavery. (Boucicault denied his play was imbued with a political message at all.) These days, the word ※octoroon§ is considered a dated slur, and Jacobs-Jenkins＊ script both acknowledges and skewers the racism of the original text with humour and self-reflexivity 每 not least by having Boucicault himself appear in the play as a belligerent drunk.Lui says that An Octoroon spoke to her because of the way it handles everything from the racism of the original title 每 which ※appealed to the contrarian in me§ 每 to the way it inverts tropes such as blackface, in ways that are both comical and deeply political.※It＊s all about ＆passing＊ 每 not about this idea of authentic identity but ＆passing＊ 每 as in, this is what someone  you are, which is what race is in many ways,§ Lui says.She namechecks queer independent Melbourne-based theatre outfit Sisters Grimm as artists doing similar subversive experiments with concepts of identity in theatre. ※I wouldn＊t say [An Octoroon] is a piece of queer theatre, but [it plays with] this idea of what it is to reconstruct, to use stereotypes and to use people＊s assumed knowledge, and to use tropes and to skewer them. And the play uses whiteface, it uses blackface, it uses brownface. It plays with this idea of inauthenticity and caricature.§In practical terms, one of the biggest questions for Lui was how to transpose the politics of the play to the specificities of the Australian context. As she puts it: ※If Aboriginal people are black, and we are [also] First Nations, then what is the role of the First Nations character 每 the Native American 每 in that text, and how does that meaning have currency here?§As for the issue of how slavery translates to the Australian context, for Lui this is straightforward: ※Stolen wages weren＊t stolen wages; it was slavery. Let＊s call a pig a pig.§In the past, Lui has been described as a young Indigenous leader, though  每 the term ※leader§, that is, though she is vocal about the way her Gamilaroi/Torres Strait Islander heritage is used to define her, too. , Lui took aim at journalists who insist on referring to her as an ※Indigenous playwright§ while white playwrights will be named without qualifiers: ※You are saying to be a playwright is to be white. To be an authentic and good playwright, you NEED to be white,§ she wrote.It＊s not surprising this is on Lui＊s mind: it＊s a theme addressed explicitly within An Octoroon. ※Hi, everyone, I＊m a ＆black playwright＊,§ BJJ says, in the very first lines of the script. Then: ※I don＊t know exactly what that means.§※Our classics are so racialised,§ Lui says. ※When we talk about classics really we＊re talking about work from the white diaspora.§※Black theatre started as a political movement here. It was the National Black theatre; it was  ... [which] played on this idea of taking stereotypes and caricatures and racism and satirising it, and I think that this work speaks to that hugely. I wanted this work to go on for myself as an artist and as a writer, because I do think it＊s a game-changer.※It changes the way we tell stories, not just as black people but the way that white people see black theatre.§																																											"
"f one set out to crown a symbolic epicenter for the 400-odd year odyssey of white supremacy in the US, they would be hard-pressed to do better than Montgomery, .It was at the statehouse in Montgomery that Jefferson Davis was first inaugurated as the president of the Confederacy in a bid to preserve the institution of slavery and in defense of the inferiority of the black race. It was here too, nearly a century later, that Rosa Parks famously refused to give up her seat, and a young Martin Luther King launched his first direct action campaign: the Montgomery Bus Boycott.Indeed the official city seal tells some of this story in ironic juxtaposition, nesting its claim as ※Cradle of the Confederacy§ inside that of ※Birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement§.But there＊s a deeper racial history here too, one that often gets buried in favor of the hagiography of leaders and legends like Davis, Parks and King. Montgomery was also for a time the central hub of the domestic US slave trade, and that＊s part of why writer and activist Bryan Stevenson thinks is a perfect place for a ※new kind of museum§ entitled From Slavery to Mass Incarceration that will trace the history of racial capital through generations and simultaneously shine a light on the legacy of US racial terrorism. ※It all begins with enslavement and the ideology of white supremacy and what follows is lynching, segregation and many of the issues that we＊re dealing with today,§ Stevenson told the Guardian. The museum itself will be situated at the site of a building that once warehoused enslaved people before they could be sold at auction in the town square. ※They used it for livestock, cotton and enslaved people,§ Stevenson said.Montgomery was the first deep south city to be connected to the upper south by rail and this, coupled with waterway access via the Alabama river, made it a vital artery of the domestic slave trade throughout the 19th century.One fact of slavery that often gets overlooked, in part because of the unimaginable horrors of the middle passage, is that by 1808 the US had banned the international importation of enslaved people. The trade was then, for the next half-century, utterly dominated by domestic commerce. As technology advanced, the slow and expensive practice of transporting human chattel by marching them hundreds of miles, shackled, was gradually replaced by more efficient water and rail passages.※By 1860, warehouses, slave depots, and slave pens had sprung up all over the city of Montgomery. We had more slave pens, depots and warehouses than banks, hotels or commercial establishments,§ said Stevenson, the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative which is headquartered in Montgomery and is spearheading the project.That＊s part of the legacy Stevenson hopes the museum can capture, ushering visitors through a dungeon-type space populated with holographic apparitions of enslaved people awaiting sale. Guests will hear readings of real slave narratives by those caught in this purgatory before moving into a space that redirects their attention to the racial terrorism of lynching that pervaded the decades after the civil war and reconstruction.That part of the museum builds off an exhibition EJI  and connects to a whole second site being developed a few blocks away as a six-acre national lynching memorial slated to open in mid-2018. The memorial will honor the lives of more than 4,000 black Americans lynched from 1877 to 1950, whose names will be engraved on duplicate sets of more than 800 columns, two for each county in the US where a lynching was recorded.One set is to remain in Montgomery. The organizers are also asking that counties claim the facsimile columns and install them at the one of the original lynching sites, like a dandelion shedding spores of memoriam across the nation. Roughly 25% of US counties recorded at least one act of targeted racial mob violence over the span of less than 75 years.This was part of the impetus for the museum and the memorial project according to Stevenson, and it takes on extra salience amid the ※There are 59 markers and monuments to the Confederacy in [Montgomery], but yet a few years ago you couldn＊t find hardly a word about slavery. The imbalance between this preoccupation with 19th-century history but the silence about enslavement was desperately problematic,§ Stevenson said. ※I just began to realize how acculturated we are to silence about this era.§Stevenson is a veteran civil rights attorney and social justice advocate, and founded EJI in 1989 as a legal defense organization to represent clients they deem as mistreated by the criminal justice system. Since then the organization has grown to do more and more public education work while Stevenson＊s profile has grown thanks to a popular TED talk and his bestselling 2014 memoir Just Mercy. Even if the counties that host lynching sites don＊t choose to take a piece of the exhibit in Montgomery, a piece of them will be on display at the memorial. EJI has gathered jars of earth from lynching sites and will put them on display in the space.※We will have 280 jars in the museum and they＊re intended to bring you closer to this legacy by seeing lynching made tangible, and the same is true for what we＊re doing on mass incarceration and segregation,§ Stevenson said.The museum space, beyond slavery and lynching will also cover the rise of lend-lease, the practice by which many formerly enslaved blacks were resubjugated. Many southern municipalities adopted nuisance laws that could legally detain blacks for no crime at all, and sentence them to hard labor as punishment. This, EJI argues, draws a direct line to the explosive rise in the US prison population through the later part of the 20th century that has become known as Mass Incarceration, and how it has preyed on communities of color.This arc, from slavery through these more modern iterations of racial inequality speaks to the museum＊s core mission. Rather than a focus on historical artifacts, Stevenson said the project intends to walk visitors through a comprehensive narrative of US racism. Drawing inspiration from the Apartheid Museum in South Africa, which is similarly conceived, Stevenson said that the museum starts with a point of view, and one that he believes is necessary to amplify if the nation is ever to push meaningfully past its foundational racist demons.※I do think our nation is a nation that needs truth and reconciliation, and incidents like  and  just reinforce that,§ Stevenson said, but added that truth and reconciliation is not simultaneous, it＊s sequential.※You have to tell the truth before you can get to reconciliation, and culturally we have done a terrible job of truth telling in this country about our history of racial inequality. I see these projects as an effort to respond to the absence of truth and the silence that has haunted us 每 black, white and other 每 for too long.§																																											"

"f you happen to be travelling in London soon, take the Bakerloo, Northern or Jubilee tube lines and try to spot the four landmarks embedded in the fabric pattern on the seats. Peer hard enough and you＊ll see subtle renditions of the London Eye, Big Ben and Tower Bridge.These are just some of the many  by textiles duo Harriet Wallace-Jones and Emma Sewell, who have been designing together as  for the past 25 years. They have also created fabrics for the Overground, Croydon tram and the new Crossrail. ※For the first few Crossrail trains, which are running now, we rode the line and took lots of pictures of buildings and stations,§ says Sewell. ※There was a shed on the side of the track that was a beautiful grey-green colour, and that ended up as part of the design.§ She still feels proud whenever she catches the tube to their north London studio.Since teaming up in 1992, the pair have designed cushions, rugs and throws for the Tate,  and , among others. They have even recreated Jimi Hendrix＊s bedspread for his former  (now a museum). What unites their work is a love of colour. ※We＊re very choosy about it,§ says Wallace-Jones. ※Every year we have an artist whose work we refer to at the start of a new collection.§  has inspired their spring/summer 2018 scarves; other recent influences include  and Korean artist .They met while studying textiles at Central School of Art (now ), but only really became friends during their MA in woven textiles at the . ※There were 15 people in our year, so we became quite a close group. We still have meet-ups,§ says Sewell. Then, in 1992, they set up a stand together at the Chelsea Crafts Fair, making their own scarves but trading under the Wallace Sewell name. ※An accessories buyer from  in New York came to scout the show and put in an order for scarves. She came back six months later and asked what we were doing for the next season,§ says Sewell. ※Our accountant said, ＆Why don＊t you just become a partnership? It would be simpler for the books.＊§From the start, they knew they wanted to design on hand looms, but have the fabrics woven in industrial mills. ※Emma and I are influenced by , which is very much that ethos of hand craft coupled with industrial production,§ says Wallace-Jones. They chose the UK so they could be more hands-on. ※We were trying to push the limits of what could be done, both with the types of thread we wanted and using multi-colours in the warp. It was quite complicated,§ says Sewell.After trying a number of mills across the north of England, they settled on , a fourth-generation, family-run, 18th-century mill. It has been weaving their fabrics for the past 17 years.It＊s a busy time for Wallace Sewell: as well as Crossrail, they are launching their first collection of rugs at the  this month and, to celebrate their quarter-century milestone, preparing for an exhibition opening at the Fashion and Textile Museum in October.※Nine years ago, I moved from London to Dorset; so now we split the collection, designing individually on our own hand looms, then meeting up once a week to discuss everything,§ says Wallace-Jones. ※We realise in our dotage that it＊s nice we＊re not together all the time, and there＊s always a fresh eye looking at the work.§ They also go camping together with their families once or twice a year, all over the UK.One of the secrets to their success is that they are completely honest about each other＊s designs. ※We might disagree a little about something, but I think that＊s because we trained together and have worked so closely together for such a long time we almost pick the same colours,§ says Sewell. ※We have evolved our style together.§Wallace-Jones agrees. ※We＊ve never had a row; we＊re a bit like a married couple and finish each other＊s sentences.§ Indeed, one will take over from the other midway through a subject.Looking ahead, Sewell would like to ※go back to my roots and do some beautifully woven fashion fabrics§, while Wallace-Jones is keen on colour consulting.

Hillary＊s equivalent is not an offer of empathy but a demand for sympathy: she wants us to feel her pain 每 the numbing shock of election night, the anguish of having to face a hostile crowd at Trump＊s inauguration and listen to him rant about social carnage in a speech that George W Bush described as ※some weird shit§.Public figures like to claim that they＊re selflessly serving us 每 the little people, their voters and customers 每 and Clinton presents this therapeutic exercise as if she had our emotional health in mind rather than her own. ※Maybe it＊ll help you too,§ she says when describing how she healed her misery with Chardonnay, alternate nostril breathing, and a daily devotional text emailed by her pastor (whose anthology of these missives has just been pulped, since some of his feelgood smarminess was plagiarised). Then she glimpses herself in the mirror and adds: ※I doubt that many people reading this will ever lose a presidential election.§ All commiseration dries up: it＊s as self-regarding a remark as Trump＊s ※I＊m the president and you＊re not§, or his smugness when he＊s given two scoops of ice-cream while guests get only one.This is a classic tale of hubris (nowadays called ※entitlement§). Clinton packaged herself as America personified, wearing successive pantsuits 每 styled by Ralph Lauren 每 in red, white and blue for her three debates with Trump, and on election night she intended to declare victory on a stage shaped like a cut-out US map. Her garment bag that evening included the purple suit she planned to wear ※on my first trip to Washington as president elect§; she had already bought the house next door in suburban New York as overspill accommodation for her travelling troupe of White House aides. Not since Agamemnon swaggered on to the red carpet in the tragedy by Aeschylus has anyone so vaingloriously asked for a comeuppance.All this triumphalism is recalled with no twinge of remorse. Instead, others are blamed 每 James Comey for raising the alarm about ,  for splitting the progressive vote, the ※odious§ Julian Assange for WikiLeaking, and those best buddies Putin and Trump for the Darth Vader-like ※dark energy§ they conjured up. Everyone who opposed her is accused of doing so out of misogyny: is Assange＊s dumping of scurrilous information about the Democratic party really explained by the fact that he ※was charged with rape in Sweden§? Despite these accusations, her postmortem on her campaign＊s ※data analytic platform§ and ※word-of-mouth favourability metric§ reveals why the masses didn＊t warm to her. She mistakenly assumed that American politics is about policy, whereas Trump saw that it is now an extension of showbiz.Instead of recuperating, Clinton has opted for a re-enactment of a remote past. Her book grows fat on rosy reminiscences about her childhood baseball games, her first date with Bill, and Chelsea＊s breech birth, with victory laps to commemorate her achievements as a ※lady lawyer§ in Arkansas, a ※hometown senator＊ in New York (where she had never actually lived when she ran for office), and a secretary of state who travelled ※almost a million miles§. She has reason to be proud, but does any of that help explain what happened on 8 November? When the reckoning arrives, she diverges into fantasies about an alternative future. She gives details of the legislation she would now be advancing, and even prints (or, as she puts it, ※shares§) the oration she ※never got a chance to deliver that night§, which ends by declaring that ※America is the greatest country in the world§ and promising that ※we will make America even greater§ 每 lines that might have dribbled from the mouth of Trump.It＊s all very well to repeat ※I love America§, as she ritualistically does: mustn＊t she also dislike at least half of it for rejecting her? Here her immense self-possession comes to her aid. She remembers , the white supremacist who murdered the worshippers in a church in Charleston, being told by relatives of his victims ※I forgive you§. Then she asks herself what she feels about Trump voters, the so-called ※deplorables§. She answers: ※It＊s complicated§, but the preceding anecdote speaks for her. She forgives them: like the rabble of crucifiers, they knew not what they did.A brief, embarrassed reference to earlier times is inadvertently telling: Bill and Hillary were guests at Trump＊s wedding to Melania (and, as the titanically petty bridegroom still remembers, they didn＊t bring a present). ※We weren＊t friends,§ says Hillary defensively. Then why go? It turns out Bill was ※speaking in the area that weekend§, so they went for a laugh; Hillary calculates that Trump wanted them for their ※star power§. The comment reflects as badly on the Clintons as it does on Trump: they remind me of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who subsidised their residence at the Waldorf Astoria by charging a fee for attendance at Manhattan cocktail parties.There is one wrenchingly perceptive insight about Trump, who seems, she says, as if he ※didn＊t even want to be president at all§ 每 unlike Clinton, who wanted it almost more than life itself. Yes, he now relives the election as obsessively as she does, and with similar misgivings. He thought it would be the prize handed out in the season finale of ; it didn＊t occur to him that four years 每 if we＊re unlucky 每 of tedious office work lay ahead. Maddened by the false position he finds himself in, the prisoner of a reality that is not at all like reality TV, he＊s therefore concentrating on finding a way to get himself fired. Despite Clinton＊s appeal for sympathy, it＊s Trump that her book made me feel momentarily sorry for.byHillary Rodham Clinton is published by Simon and Schuster (?20).

"∴∴∴∴Luis Su芍rez＊s unlikely PR revival is seemingly complete, as he fronts Konami＊s new partnership with FC Barcelona in the latest iteration of Pro Evolution Soccer. He has chosen a good platform, as ＊s player likenesses and crowd animations look sublime.While official licences remain to ＊s advantage,  has been focusing on gameplay. Close control, once the defining feature of early  games, makes another step forward with a silky first touch, attack-minded dribbling and off-the-ball movement. Another welcome change is the slower and more natural pace of play, while player jostling, deflections and goalie spills feel unpredictable and lifelike. Player attributes also feel accurate, including the oddly fun addition of a playable Usain Bolt character to rival Arsenal＊s speed demon, H谷ctor Bellerin.Konami has reintroduced popular features such as random selection match, auto-filling a team with players to trade with an opponent. These games feel well balanced and offer variety, in contrast to  where the temptation is to stay loyal to a club, while  now offers pre-season tournaments and a refined transfer system. Solid updates, then 每 certainly enough to give  diehards pause for thought. ∴∴∴∴Originally released for the Neo Geo arcade system in 1994,  is fully deserving of its cult status 每 it might remain a footnote in gaming＊s records but for the few who played it remains deeply beloved. For all its credibility among arcade aficionados, the game is in essence a spin on , albeit one festooned with mechanical and aesthetic trappings. Those extras, however, present a truly magnificent game, especially for multiplayer. And now it has been brought to PS4 and PS Vita, extending the multiplayer offering to online.Fundamentally, it is frisbee tennis, with two rivals on court launching a flying disc at one another while defending goals. There are special shots and curled throws to master, but it is the elegant simplicity that marks out  as exceptional. Run alongside the Neo Geo original, the port accuracy is superb. Some online matches fail to launch, a problem fixable with an update, and one that barely detracts from a near perfect arcade game. ∴∴∴In 2012,  was released on the 3DS and wowed audiences. It managed to pack a full console experience into a handheld, putting players into the shoes of secret agents aboard a stricken cruise ship, fending off mutants while unravelling a complex plot of intrigue and bio-terrorism.Now  returns to consoles (for a second time) and it＊s showing its age. A five-year-old game built to run on handheld hardware nearly 10 years old,  just doesn＊t measure up as a console game in 2017, especially in wake of the series sea-change that was . The environments now feel small and bland, with clunky gameplay that comes across as a throwback. What this remastering offers is a bundling of all the?original game＊s DLC, plus the action-packed raid mode that remixes levels and enemies, but little that is truly?new. Where  was a great 3DS game, on state-of-the-art consoles it is but passable at best. 																																											"
"e＊re not a bunch of bloody hippies,§ Mike Shepherd growls by way of introduction. Turns out the last time a journalist paid  a visit at its Cornish home, that was the verdict. The time before, the company wound up being compared to a cult, the rehearsal rooms a commune. Its artistic director has had enough.Kneehigh＊s headquarters are in Truro, but its heart is in Gorran Haven, a little village on Cornwall＊s south coast. Bunting hangs, house to house, over its winding streets, and kids in wetsuits trot home from the beach. Seagulls sit on every other antenna. The nearest rail station is half an hour away by car.Up the hill, a 10-minute climb, is a  where every Kneehigh show starts its life. Rehearsals begin with an intensive retreat: at least two weeks tucked away together, with creative sessions blurring into beach trips, campfire get-togethers and company meals. Its new show is an adaptation of The Tin Drum, , and the process is no different, even though this is the biggest show Kneehigh has ever made.The garden is dotted with pansies and pink geraniums; kissing benches are tucked between wooden sheds: one is a costume store, another a workshop. Writer  is staying in the third, which has a ※Welcome§ sign hung over the door.Round the back, an old milking parlour serves as a rehearsal room, but today, the actors spill outside onto a square lawn and play volleyball in the field next door. ※It＊s easy to get romantic about it on days like this,§ says Shepherd, ※but when I came here a few weeks ago, the place was in a right state. The garden was dead. Everything was mouldy.§Inside, the barns surround a large, homely kitchen with a long dining table running down the middle. A giant rota of responsibilities is written up on a whiteboard. Everyone 每 actors, stage managers, creatives 每 takes a turn on kitchen duties, and the whole company eats together every day: ※a quickfire way of creating an ensemble§, Shepherd says. Today, much to his dismay, two trays of Cornish pasties sit on the side. ※Oh, lord,§ he groans in his cockney-Cornish burr. ※It＊s usually quinoa and halloumi.§There＊s bric-a-brac on every surface 每 old props and puppets, bits of driftwood and string, shelves full of scripts, textbooks and trashy thrillers. It＊s a living Kneehigh museum, and on every wall hang framed production photos. The Unloved, from the recently revived , sit in red velvet stalls in their balaclavas and macs; a prim wartime nurse cycles across the poster for  at the National; and a couple mid shag in front of rusty neon hails from its RSC . Kneehigh＊s shows are known for their sense of life. Each is a mishmash of styles: knockabout comedy mixed with runaway romance; rough edges and raucous mischief. One rust red wall is stencilled with words such as wonder, irreverence, anarchy and joy. It＊s a  manifesto 每 the ingredients it works with. Critics sometimes sniff, particularly when the company intrudes on hallowed cultural spaces, but the shows are crowdpleasers to their very core. Shepherd wouldn＊t have it any other way. ※I bloody hate the stalls,§ he hisses conspiratorially. ※I＊d rip them all up.§If you＊ve seen a Kneehigh show, chances are you＊ve seen Shepherd on stage. It＊s where this born performer belongs. Ask him a question and he＊ll act out an anecdote. At 65, he has the energy of a much younger man. The dress sense too: black shorts and a grey-pink T-shirt festooned with skulls today. A tattoo of a bright blue lobster extends down his right calf. A little way from the barns, a sandy beach spans off to the right. To the left, a coastal path plunges through grass and thick gorse. This is where, every morning, the company comes to warm up. ※We run the cliff path,§ Shepherd says, which well explains his own wiry, rugged physique. ※We end up a bit weather-beaten, the opposite of your rarefied stage actor. There＊s a robustness and a power in our actors, vocally and physically, which make their way into the work as well.§Cornwall, in other words, gets into the shows. And yet the director has ※despaired of Cornwall recently 每 the fact it voted Ukip, then Brexit§. He moved back to London a few years ago.As a child, he came the other way after the war, returning in his late twenties, frustrated by life in London, ※waiting by the phone, going to auditions and never getting a job§. He took a teaching job in Cornwall in 1980 and set up his own theatre company shortly afterwards 每 ※not for theatre-goers, but for the community§. With him were a thrash guitarist, a farmer, an ex-dancer and a supermarket signwriter 每 and so Kneehigh was born. They were, Shepherd glints, ※a weird bunch of people§. Rehearsals happened at night after work. The shows were ※anarchic and crazy§.Indeed, Shepherd spent the first show being chased by police for performing without a licence. ※Every time I came off stage, they＊d go ＆Oi＊, and I＊d run round the other side. I managed to get to the end of the show, then my arms were behind my back and I was hoiked off to the station.§ Some started with stunts 每 cyclists somersaulting off harbour walls into the water. Others led audiences on wild walks through the woods. Kneehigh has evolved in the years since, but its signature style is best associated with Emma Rice. She joined the company as an actor in 2000, and soon took the helm. ※With Emma, every story became personal,§ says Shepherd, ※Find a connection and the story comes to you.§ Even two years after heading off to Shakespeare＊s Globe (albeit temporarily), Rice still crops up in conversation unprompted at Gorran Haven all the time. But Kneehigh has moved on, stylistically. , its spin on The Beggar＊s Opera, had an extra edge; a little less cute, a lot more angry. Less Rice, more Shepherd. The Tin Drum follows suit. ※It comes from a real desire to do stuff that＊s contemporary and political,§ Shepherd stresses.Grass＊s novel is a modern classic; an allegory for 20th-century horrors. Its three-year-old hero, Oskar, opts to stop growing 每 a rejection of adulthood in the face of fascism 每 and resists the Nazis by banging on his toy drum. ※It＊s like a forest of all sorts,§ says adaptor Grose. ※Biography, history, magical realism, folk tale.§ This ragbag suits Kneehigh well, and its politics seem increasingly pressing. What it does have, undoubtedly, is a sense of theatre. Oskar will be played by a puppet with deep black beads for eyes, and his drum will generate more than a biscuit-tin beat. Instead, composer  has turned to drum-pad technology. ※In the book, the drumming exists in your imagination,§ he says, ※You hear whole symphonies, breakbeat, sleazy ska, drum and bass 每 whatever you want.§In the rehearsal room, expansive beats burst out alongside the action. Actors try to keep up, singing along, as Shepherd pushes them to toy with the material. Try it like this, he suggests; show me that. ※Don＊t analyse. Don＊t ask why.§ Hazlewood reckons his philosophy is rare: ※So often in theatre, there＊s an atmosphere of faint coercion 每 damaged egos being territorial. What Mike promotes is an atmosphere where anything goes.§Shepherd doesn＊t buy the clean, concentrated vibe of most rehearsal rooms, particularly those with ※barricades of laptops§, nor the idea that creativity runs by the clock. ※It breeds fear,§ he says. Instead, he seeks inspiration in that clutter. Actors dash off to make costumes. They＊re sent to create small shrines to their characters with whatever they can lay their hands on. ※Day one, we＊re starting to use costume, props, mock-ups of the set,§ he explains, ※We＊re using dance, text, puppetry, music 每 all of it 每 like a big dressing-up kit.§ The clutter has an another purpose. It instils a sense of history and, with it, identity. Old shows feed into new ones, as costumes and props get recycled. Someone grabs something and, all of a sudden, it has a new lease of life in a whole other show. It＊s one of the reasons Kneehigh has such a distinctive style. It feeds off itself more than taking inspiration from others.Remoteness plays a part in that too 每 no distractions, no diversions. ※It＊s slightly unfortunate that the mobile phone signal＊s improved,§ says Hazlewood, ※It used to be dreadful. You had to go off to the top of the car park just to get one bar.§As evening falls and drinks come out, Shepherd sums it all up. ※Me and Emma always used to call Kneehigh The Church of the Lost Cause. I＊m not religious but, in a sense, I think theatre can replace the church. You just have to remind people that they love it. They love stories, they love playing, they love being entertained.§ Kneehigh＊s not a cult or a commune, but a congregation. ※It makes sense of the world, performing.§																																											"
"The subway invaded the art gallery in 1980s New York. , who died in 1988 aged 27, crystallised this moment, embodying a new youthful attitude that helped make today＊s art what it is. He left behind a legacy of scrawled and slashed paintings that punch themselves into your mind. His angry electric style seems even more relevant now than it did then. The Argentine artist presents 50 new sketches of buildings from the second half of the 20th century alongside rarely seen historical material to examine ※the long reign of pseudo-Georgian architecture§ as a force shaping the British vernacular. Almost every trend in 21st-century art can be traced back to things  did in the 1950s. American pop art can be dated from the moment he started painting a stars and stripes flag over collaged news stories in 1954. Minimalism starts there too, or maybe his monochrome 1955 version. As for body art, it was seeded by his strange casts of mouths and noses in 1955. It goes on. Like dreams, his creations can be endlessly interpreted without ever truly yielding up their secrets. A single work by Jasper Johns can hit you like a truck with its profundity, so this huge retrospective may be almost unbearable in its intellectual might and poetic power.Somehow the Turner prize survived the , and renews itself by finding new purpose. Its maturity is said loud and clear by the inclusion of two artists older than 50 on : Lubaina Himid was born in 1954; Hurvin Anderson in 1965. They＊ve crashed the barrier imposed back in the days of Young British Art: good for them. Also shortlisted are Andrea B邦ttner and Rosalind Nashashibi in what may prove a vintage year. Danish architect Bjarke Ingels＊ BIG practice has created a brick-shaped fun palace for the world＊s favourite toymaker, where visitors can get creative in blue, red, green and yellow ※experience zones§, see what master builders get up to in its gallery, then chill out with a Brickaccino coffee. The roots of opera go back to Renaissance Italy, where fantastic court spectacles designed by the likes of Leonardo da Vinci mixed with melancholy love songs to create a new art of myth and passion. In 1607, Monteverdi＊s L＊Orfeo gave opera dramatic and musical depth. This exhibition traces the history of an art form that has been uniquely interwtined with the politics of modern Europe, from Verdi＊s operas of power and liberation to the controversial impact of Wagner in Germany. Paintings by Degas, Manet and more feature alongside relics in a show that will surely be sumptuous.The visionary art of  has the power to lift you into a poetic paradise of shimmering lines in cosmic space. He is a true original, whose big, abstract drawings are as intricate as the structure of a leaf, as alive as water, as absorbing as a book. He lives and works in Lahore and this, his first solo show in a British gallery, is an unprecedented chance to explore his artistic magic in depth.The early 15th-century Flemish artist Jan van Eyck painted with such eye-fooling and intricate skill he was rumoured to be an alchemist. The Arnolfini Portrait, a painting of an Italian merchant couple standing with strange formality in their bedroom in Bruges while Van Eyck himself is reflected in a convex mirror at the back of the room, is arguably his strangest and most miraculous work of all. This exhibition explores the instant impact it made on British art when it was bought by the  in 1842.Free beer! Well, perhaps not this time, but one of the revolutionary projects created by this Danish art collective was an ※open source§ beer that subverted capitalism by extending the culture of the internet to the material world. Expect something similarly cheeky and radical when they take over the vast space of the . Superflex was founded by Danish artists Jakob Fenger, Bj?rnstjerne Christiansen and Rasmus Nielsen but works with a shifting army of specialists in projects called ※Tools§, because they are meant to be useful. Ideas will pour freely, even if the beer doesn＊t.This all-star exhibition in the spectacular brutalist architectural setting of the  is a 50th-anniversary celebration of one of London＊s leading commercial galleries. Founded in 1967 in the heyday of the conceptual art movement, the Lisson Gallery has maintained its thoughtful approach with surprising success into the age of pop conceptualism. Participants range from the unpredictable wit of  to video pioneer  and epic walker . Two artists who were obsessed with sex team up to create what will surely be autumn＊s kinkiest show.  (1887-1968) and  (1904-89) both gloried in perversity. Duchamp said eroticism was the heart of his work and proved it with his final installation,  (※Having been given§), which allows the visitor to look through a peephole at a pornographic sculpture. As for Dal赤, where to begin? His paintings include  (1929), whose title is self-explanatory, and his confessions of depravity even shocked his surrealist comrades. This is a marriage made in art heaven: the genius of Duchamp should shine a light on Dali＊s deconstructions of aesthetic beauty, while Dali＊s wickedness will free Duchamp from the academic theorists who hold him prisoner. In the age of Brexit, an exhibition of this sculptor who transcended Europe＊s borderlines is a timely reminder of how art can defy national boundaries. Arp (1886-1966) called himself either Hans or Jean depending on whether he was speaking German or French. He came from the disputed region of Alsace-Lorraine, so it was a moot point. In the first world war, he escaped to the neutral polyglot Swiss city of Zurich where he helped found dadaism. His endlessly playful abstract creations are as liberated as the man.The imaginative, sensual and hilarious sculpture of  is one of the joys of modern British art. It＊s amazing she has never won the Turner prize (she was shortlisted in 2006). Then again, perhaps an artist whose most celebrated work, Helmut Crumb, combines the styles of two of the most sexist artists going will always strike some people as lacking radical seriousness. Which is a shame because Warren has helped put sculpture 每 as opposed to readymade objects 每 back into the mainstream of contemporary art.Of all the exhibitions that have marked this year＊s , this is the most exciting. Ilya Kabakov is one of the greatest artists produced by the Soviet Union 每 and one of the most subversive. In the 1980s, he left the USSR and started working with his niece Emilia on installations as labyrinthine as a Russian Orthodox church and as rich in their storytelling as a Dostoevksy novel. What is it like to live in utopia? And what happens when it goes wrong? Find out in these poetic reveries on the strange history of the world＊s first communist state.Cha?m Soutine painted with savage expressionism in a Paris dominated by abstract art. Born near Minsk, he arrived in the French capital of modernism in 1913 but instead of embracing cubism or any other art fashions, he painted compassionate, almost childlike portraits of workers in the hotels and kitchens of the art deco age. Soutine went into hiding to escape being captured by the Nazis but became ill on the run and died in 1943. The paintings in this show prove him one of the most humane visionaries of modern art.For a long time, film director and photographer  took Polaroids as a day-to-day visual notebook and diary. Quick images of passing moments full of intense Polaroid colour, these pictures shot in the 1970s and 80s record what his world looked like in the years when he was working on films such as The American Friend (1977) and Wings of Desire (1987). It is a nostalgic trip into a lost visual world.Explorers stranded in the endless emptiness of outer space are the protagonists of the ＊s new work, which is based on Karl-Birger Blomdahl＊s 1959 science-fiction opera AniaraThe plight of these would-be colonists of Mars is heard on a 12-speaker installation by this artist with a rare ear for the melancholy emotional resonance and sculptural solidity of sound. The exhibition also includes homages to Bowie from her back catalogue and the socialist anthem the Internationale.This exhibition proves that C谷zanne is the true father of modern art. It is astonishing to see how early he was deconstructing the very idea of portraiture in paintings from the 1880s that ask who we really see when we look in the mirror. From early portraits of his friends and family with their tragicomic sense of the human condition to self-portraits unrivalled since those of Rembrandt, there is a staggering intellect and courage to C谷zanne＊s depictions of people. Black and white 每 a lot of artists have used it. This exhibition makes connections between the Renaissance and Baroque technique of , in which scenes were shown in shades of grey to make them look like sculptural reliefs, and modern monchrome art. The 1960s paintings of Bridget Riley, Olafur Eliasson＊s installation  and other cool modern things are juxtaposed with the likes of D邦rer and Rembrandt.Thank God, the nation＊s gallery of British art has found an excuse to show some French art instead. The artists who would first exhibit as impressionists in 1874 fled to London to escape the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. While in Britain, they painted views of the city and its suburbs whose vitality and freshness put homegrown Victorian art to shame. To look at  (1871) is to breathe a fresh air stuffy British art never let in. Monet would return in later years to stay at the Savoy and paint views from his hotel room that are simply the greatest visions of London in art.The most sensational  is Maija Tammi＊s disconcertingly soulful portrait of a female android, casting thoughtful shadows on its 每 her? 每 face so that we seem to encounter a conscious mind. The other shortlisted artists, C谷sar Dezfuli and Abbie Trayler-Smith, show powerful photojournalism. Dezfuli deserves first prize for his commandingly intense . A snapshot of the modern world.Where could this art of dreams and the unconscious make more sense than in Cairo, where the unreal pyramids loomed over a rich collision of cultures? This exhibition surveys the  and Liberty group, who explored the radical possibilities of surrealism there in the 1930s and 40s. A little-known chapter of surreal history.This autumn is the 50th anniversary of . They met on 25 September 1967 at St Martin＊s College and have been together ever since. They＊re celebrating their golden jubilee with exhibitions in London that include this big show of new work. Fashionable as ever, they＊ve caught up with the 21st century＊s love of beards. And as ever they aim to provoke with their latest ※fuckosophy§. Let＊s raise a glass to artists who never got bored because they were never being boring.Twelve nudes by this doomed romantic hero of modern art should make for a stupendously sensual show.  is much more curious figure than his myth might suggest. It＊s true that the naked paintings at the heart of this show got him into trouble with the Paris police in 1917. Yet his art is a beautiful blend of the cubist style he encountered in France and the much older Renaissance tradition of the nude he grew up with in his native Italy. That mix of modernity and tradition is what makes him so accessible. Add to that his short, intense life with sex and drugs aplenty, and you have an artist who will always be young. Now that age appears no bar to winning the Turner prize, 82-year-old  may well be on next year＊s shortlist. Meanwhile, this prestigious showcasing of her anything but pompous pictures is a milestone in a very long career. Wylie＊s paintings are dadaist free-for-alls of cartoonish daubing that look like she painted them in 10 seconds. Has she grown up now she＊s entered her 80s?

" metropolitan dystopia, post-computer, post-internet. It looks a bit like Camden market; at other times like the dark ages; or the 70s, a concrete jungle through which agents speed in Cortinas and Granadas. Today, it looks like Charlottesville; the people 每 normals 每 are marching, protesting against teeps; mutant telepaths who can access their thoughts (think CSA meets Google meets Minority Report＊s precogs). The teeps may be misusing their power and plotting to take over, but right now they are more like slaves (or immigrant workers perhaps). In these times of heightened tension and unrest, agents are utilising the Anti Immunity bill (think anti-terror legislation) and are using teeps to read the minds of the normals, who unsurprisingly aren＊t best pleased about having the sanctity of their thoughts invaded. Someone has developed a hood that prevents it happening. Like a firewall, but way lower tech 每 these hoods are made of waxed linen.This is the world of  (Channel 4, Sunday), the first of 10 parables based on  stories on the channel that has become the home of the dystopian future. Craftily and artfully adapted by Matthew Graham, The Hood Maker asks questions not just about state surveillance, prejudice, civil liberties and human rights, but also about technology, power and knowledge, trust, democracy, even evolution. It＊s a bleak, suffocating vision that left me not only worried, but craving light and air, simplicity, nature and the past. The lovely clear tree-lined trout stream perhaps, where Ross used to go as a boy with his father.Now agent Ross only fly fishes in dreams and flashbacks. He＊s director of an operation known as Clearance which aims to stifle and quash the unrest and protest. And working with him, not just watching the people, but reading them and their darkest secrets, too, is Honor the teep. Partners, then, though this is no buddy cop relationship, but one that is steeped in doubt and mistrust (even if they do cop off). I don＊t even know who to trust or like, or where my sympathies lie.Captivating performances, from Richard Madden from Game of Thrones, and from Holliday Grainger, who＊s actually clashing with herself over on BBC1, though she＊s hardly recognisable as Robin, the well-groomed, wholesome PA/wannabe PI in Strike. Here she looks more like someone you＊d bump into in the stranger fields on the fringes of Glastonbury.That＊s what＊s right with Electric Dreams, the first episode, at least. Are there any problems? Two, the seriousness of which I＊m not sure. First, it＊s not . To which you might say: so what, who says it＊s trying to be? But when you have two ambitious sci-fi anthology series about who we are and where we＊re going, comparison is inevitable, especially since the new one now occupies the old home of the other. It＊s like when you＊re going out with someone, and then they leave you (for someone with more money), and you get a new someone, and they＊re great, but you can＊t help thinking about the old one, missing them＃Actually, it＊s not really like that, unless you are Channel 4 I imagine. The rest of us can obviously just spend ?5.99 on Netflix to get the old one back. But if you could just have one, then you＊d obviously pick the old one. Because while ED may resonate, BM hits an actual nerve, and hurts. Not so much about an imagined future, it＊s about now, or no more than five minutes from now. It＊s sci-fi for the non-sci-fi fan. And it＊s more human, more moving, and wittier. Better, in short. And that brings us to the second 每 and I think more serious 每 issue with Electric Dreams. Which has to do with quality and consistency. The Hood Maker is terrific, thoughtful, thought-provoking and compelling. I＊ve seen a couple more episodes, though, and without going into detail or giving anything away, they＊re simply less engaging.Briefly to the Borgen slot then, and  (BBC4, Saturday) from Sweden. But if you were expecting Scandi noir 每 you know, mood, metaphor and morality, authenticity, characters you grow to feel you actually know 每 then you＊ll be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you＊re OK with a fright 每 a buildup of tension and things that go bump in the night, in an abandoned ski resort 每 then it is fabulous. Schlock horror, or a sm?rg?sbord of cheese and chill.																																											"
"Frustrated by what she sees as a lack of police progress, teacher Laura (Joanne Froggatt) makes a social media attack against the man she has accused of rape, surgeon Andrew (Ioan Gruffudd). But far from empowering Laura as she hopes, this only causes her life to spin further out of control, to the extent the cops think she is becoming her ※own worst enemy§. Meanwhile, stressed Andrew makes an error at work. A?taut, cleverly constructed drama. Second episode of the reverse-chronology crime drama, and given renegade DCI Gabriel＊s memento of the investigation, it is little surprise that he is too busy stomping on the rule book to go by it. The investigation now hinges on Isaac＊s stolen laptop, the content therein and uncovering why it means so much to the enigmatic Christine. That backwards narrative still feels tacked on, suggesting little faith in a storyline perfectly capable of retaining our attention. It took seven years for Cassini to travel to Saturn and, over the past 13 years, the spacecraft has been beaming back information to Earth. While there＊s plenty of science to get excited about in this doc, which marks the dramatic ending of Cassini＊s mission, what＊s really special are the extraordinary, poetic photographs taken from the probe. In one shot taken from beneath Saturn＊s rings, you can see a tiny twinkling planet in the distance: Earth. Gertrude Bell, born 1868, was a writer, adventurer and archeologist who followed her fascinating passions around the Middle East. As this BBC dramatisation makes clear, her life and legacy would have been remarkable for any woman or man, in the 19th century or the 21st. Archive footage is brought to life by actors playing the personalities of the time, speaking words from their private diaries and letters, with Tilda Swinton ideal as Bell. Brilliant. Exactly. The merciless spoof of the Beeb by the Beeb is back for a new series. It＊s the year of Charter renewal and the perfect excuse for a round of meetings in which the art of saying nothing at length is spun out with semantic ingenuity by the scriptwriters. Meanwhile, Siobhan＊s Perfect Curve group has been bought out by Dutch group Fun Media. Not entirely sure about the sub-plot about a footballing cross-dresser, however. A thinly veiled excuse to show buff comedian Joel Dommett with his top off, this new series finds him travelling the globe to pit himself against some of the most rugged folk there are. His friend Nish Kumar goes along, too, just to watch and quip. This week, they head to Mongolia where Dommett tries the archery, horsemanship and wrestling central to its nomadic population. He makes a royal tool of himself attempting the latter. This documentary recounts the investigation into the 2012 rape and murder of Jill Meagher in Australia. CCTV and the testimony of police officers is disturbing and compelling, but there is another side to this story. This was a high-profile case, mobilising the community on social media, and has had legal consequences around information-sharing and parole reform. Disturbingly, at the time of the offence, Meagher＊s killer was out on parole for previous sexual assaults.

"he American revolution was always a rhetorical as well as a political upheaval. The Founding Fathers transformed a mood of sullen opposition into a convulsion of revolutionary fury as much in print as on the field of battle. ＊s catalyst for the conflict in the declaration of independence was a masterpiece of English prose.If there was to be a storm, there first had to be a lightning strike. The necessary explosion was ignited by a little book, attributed to an anonymous ※Englishman§, and published by Robert Bell from a print shop on Third Street, Philadelphia, on 9 January 1776. The book was , the bestselling American pamphlet of the 18th century. In no time at all, there were more than 120,000 copies in circulation, some 25 editions in 1776 alone, and its ideas were the talk of the eastern seaboard. ※Who is the author of ?§ asked the . ※He deserves a statue in gold.§Thomas Paine, unmasked as the author of this sensational broadside, is a key figure in the making of the Anglo-American tradition, a man of fierce libertarian language and mercenary political instincts. He made his name by out-Englishing the English: exaggerating the most distinctive traits and selling it as a basis for revolt. A down-on-his-luck emigrant, landing in Philadelphia with few prospects, he had written  (the title belonged to another revolutionary, ) in a few hectic weeks.Rarely has a single volume achieved such an instantaneous effect, possibly because it was published on the same day that George III pledged in parliament to put ※a speedy end to these disorders§ in the 13 colonies. is a model of popular journalistic brio, written to be understood by all readers, high and low. With breath-taking chutzpah, Paine singled out George as ※the royal brute§ responsible for all the ills of America. His  in general is entertainingly severe:※England, since the conquest, hath known some few good monarchs, but groaned beneath a much larger number of bad ones; yet no man in his senses can say that their claim under William the Conqueror is a very honourable one. A French bastard landing with an armed banditti, and establishing himself king of England against the consent of the natives, is in plain terms a very paltry rascally original.§Nailing his colours, Paine then took the logical step of calling for war, and for independence. ※Why is it that we hesitate?§ he asked. ※The sun never shined on a cause of greater worth＃ For God＊s sake, let us come to a final separation＃ The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, ＊tis time to part＊＃ The birthday of a new world is at hand.§ In a few well-turned phrases, and with an eye for vivid expression, Paine transformed a previously leaden debate into pure gold:※I have heard it asserted by some, that as America hath flourished under her former connection with Great Britain, the same connection is necessary towards her future happiness, and will always have the same effect. Nothing can be more fallacious than this kind of argument. We may as well assert that because a child has thrived upon milk that it is never to have meat, or that the first 20 years of our lives is to become a precedent for the next 20... §Paine never let the facts get in the way of a passionate restatement of popular sentiment:※We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A situation, similar to the present, hath not happened since the days of Noah until now. The birthday of a new world is at hand, and a race of men, perhaps as numerous as all Europe contains, are to receive their portion of freedom from the event of a few months.§Having found his voice, Paine subsequently weighed in against slavery, in favour of the emancipation of women, and on behalf of many other progressive causes. In 1787, he returned to England, via revolutionary France, and proceeded to launch a fierce attack on Edmund Burke in , for some his masterpiece.Paine was part of a radical circle of free thinkers that included William Blake, William Godwin and  (No 76 in this series). Among conservative Britons, he was regarded with fear and hatred. His books and effigy were regularly burned in public, and he lived a precarious life one jump ahead of the authorities. In the American spirit, Paine was always a master of the provisional.Paine＊s influential writings became a textbook for English radicalism, and widely admired on the left. His connections with both the French and the American revolutions gave him a unique position as a champion of Enlightenment politics, and his prose 每 more demotic and colloquial than Burke, whose ※high-toned exclamation§ he despised 每 survives as a bracing and exemplary blast of libertarian polemic.※Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseriea by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer.§Edmund Burke:  (1790)Thomas Paine:  (1791)Thomas Paine:  (1793)																																											"
"hen I was 23, I went to my dad＊s second wedding, full of tightly repressed rage, given expression only by my wedding outfit. I wore a suit, because it was a wedding, but I also went for a bright red T-shirt with the word ※ANTI§ printed on it, a necklace with a silver gun pendant and a brooch that looked a bit like a swastika. ※OK, Dad, I＊ll come to your wedding, but only if I can come dressed as anger.§Two years earlier, telling my family I was gay caused a major crisis. My dad suggested some kind of therapy. He denies it was electroshock therapy, but he definitely gave me a flyer for something. I was summoned to my aunt and uncle＊s house, and taken into the living room, where my mum was waiting with my uncle. My aunt started crying and didn＊t stop for two hours.It was so overwhelming. They were very worried that I＊d be bullied and have a terrible life, and I was sat there thinking, ※This is the worst thing that＊s happened so far.§My uncle, an accountant, gave me a book, written by a client of his, called A Gay Man＊s Guide to Safer Sex.※Thank you, Graham.§Eventually I was allowed to leave as long as I agreed I wouldn＊t tell my grandparents because it would kill them. (It＊s genuinely believed in this family that when my parents got divorced when I was 13, which was quite a drama, it was the direct reason for my grandpa becoming diabetic.)I can＊t feel too annoyed with these people. They just happen to be from a particular generation, living in a particular place, and from their perspective, a hardcore sex book and electroshock therapy were generous gifts.My grandparents actually turned out to be much less traumatised than anyone. My grandpa was particularly sweet with a photography student I went out with. They discussed exposure rates at a family lunch and I almost cried.***When I was 25, my friend Kevin told me about something called , a three-day, life-transforming course. Around 150 people in a room in Euston were encouraged by the ※leader§ to phone people ※who you＊ve been blaming for everything in your lives§. I phoned my father and said, ※Hi, I think I＊ve been＃ I＊m sorry for blaming you for the divorce that happened. I think I understand now that you were a fallible human being, and not the evil monster I made you out to be at the time.§He said, ※I＊ve been waiting 10 years to hear that.§ It felt like a real moment of healing. And then he said, ※What else did you learn at this course? Did they tell you it＊s possible the divorce made you gay?§I said, ※Shush, we just sorted everything out!§I called my mum during the course, unsure what to say to her, but certain I should call to resolve something. I said, ※I don＊t blame you for the divorce§, and she said, ※Of course you don＊t. It was your father＊s fault.§She then told me that my dad wasn＊t very good during the pregnancy. A friend of hers called Marc took her to the zoo one day. He was apparently very sweet and kind to her. She thought about raising me with him instead. She said, ※I decided to stay with your father, but that＊s why your middle name is Marc.§I convinced my mum to come to the course, to see if she＊d sign up. She thought I＊d joined a cult. My dad had no interest in attending.Marc would have come.My dad didn＊t take up the invitation to see either of my last two standup shows. He told me it wasn＊t his sort of thing and that I didn＊t need his validation any more. I tried not to be hurt. I＊m not into darts, but if I had a son who played professional darts and was receiving wonderful reviews, I＊d watch him play darts, wouldn＊t I?Despite my father＊s lack of attendance, I used to see him in the audience, anyway. Every time I spotted a man who wasn＊t laughing, I＊d feel my father＊s indifference and say things like, ※Do you think you＊ll laugh at any point or carry on with this face?§ If a man ever left to go to the toilet, I＊d scream, ※Where are you going? How funny do I have to be, Daddy?§In the end, I thought, ※Do I really need my father＊s love? Can＊t I just love myself at this point and be grateful to the strangers who love me as long as I＊m funny?§I realised, eventually, that the problem was my expectation of this man as a ※father§. I thought, ※Let＊s stop thinking of him as my ＆father＊ and start thinking of him as ＆the man who ejaculated＊. He ejaculated and so I＊m alive 每 what more do I want? And often, when men have ejaculated, they are tired. You can＊t expect them to love you. I can＊t keep shouting for the rest of my life, ＆If you can＊t love a child, don＊t ejaculate in a wife, do it out the window!＊§If I＊m to focus on anything, it should be on thanking my mother for birthing me out of her own body. How can I ever thank her for that? The best I can do is occasionally introduce her to a celebrity. ※Thank you for your womb, here＊s .§I＊d let go of the idea of my father as my father, but then someone said, ※But he＊s your father§, and I felt something. So we met up and he told me he＊d just trained to be a hypnotherapist. In my head, I screamed, ※What? You can＊t be the healer, you＊re the trauma!§He then said he just needed some clients to get started. What he＊d love was for my ※crazy friends§ to come to him so he could be a ※hypnotherapist to the stars§. I said nothing. Because why tell someone how you feel at the time, when you could save it up for a book and invite them to a launch that won＊t be their sort of thing?Yet through this hypnotherapy training, my father seemed to have developed a language for expressing more emotions than I＊d witnessed in him before. We spoke about his childhood. He told me he had a very cold, distant mother, which must be worse than having a distant father. So it turned out he was the more vulnerable one and I had to love him. How did he turn it around? I realised I could no longer feel hostile to this sneaky little hypnotist.Yet I＊d also come to a place where there was a mild sadness and an acceptance of the fact that we didn＊t really have a relationship. I finally knew in my body that he wasn＊t going to become a different person. I forgave him, but didn＊t necessarily need to see him, which I think is a valid position to hold.And then my mum called me, very upset, because I hadn＊t been invited to his daughter＊s (my half-sister＊s) batmitzvah, on account of having a boyfriend who is a boy. In the Jewish religion, if you＊re a boy and you have a boyfriend, it＊s important that he＊s a girl.That line is straight out of the Torah.I said to my mum, ※Of course we haven＊t been invited. It＊s fine, he＊s not a monster; he just has a religion without which he can＊t cope. You can＊t be angry; he＊s a man with special needs.§Having said that out loud, I felt like I＊d finally shifted all the rage. I was over any need for my father＊s acceptance, validation or attention. I was at peace. And then, the next evening, I received an email inviting my boyfriend and me to the batmitzvah. I was furious. All that work to accept that he would never change and then he changed? I tried everything to make him be OK with me. How dare he decide the fight is over?I called him a few days after the email. Following some polite chit-chat, I cautiously said, ※So, you＊ve had a bit of a change of heart?§He said, ※Not really.§I said, ※Something happened, no?§He said, ※Listen, let＊s say you were in St John＊s Wood and you wanted me to drive you to Edgware§, which already made no sense.He continued, ※＃ and on the drive you fell asleep, then, when you woke up, you were exactly where you wanted to be, would it matter how we got there?§I thought about this. Does it matter how we＊ve got here? I said, ※Hang on, I haven＊t been asleep for 20 years!§ And then, because I was scared I wouldn＊t be able to stop shouting at him if I started, I said, ※You know, feelings have been felt.§He said, ※I understand.§ And I decided to hear, ※I＊m sorry§, because often it＊s best to make up the words you need to hear, like when he said, ※You don＊t need my validation any more§, I could have heard, ※I couldn＊t be more proud of you.§He also suggested this had all been good material for me, which was difficult to argue with.My boyfriend and I went to the batmitzvah. In contrast to the tension I felt at my father＊s wedding, I felt incredibly peaceful. As I walked in, I could see how vulnerable my dad was. It must have been quite scary for him, having us there. My father found religion when my parents divorced. One of the first people I saw at the wedding was a woman who, years before, had tried to convert me to Orthodox Judaism. When I told her I didn＊t think it was for me, she said, ※But are you happy?§ And I wasn＊t happy, so I thought, ※Oh, she＊s got me.§Seeing this woman again, I thought, ※I＊m happy now.§She said, ※It＊s been a long time. Are you married?§I gestured to my boyfriend and said, ※No, I＊ve been with this guy for five years.§She looked nervous and I could have left her hanging, but I filled the space by telling her how great he was. She said, ※OK, I guess that＊s OK.§I agreed that it was OK and then she walked away. I thought, ※Yes, I killed her with love.§Then a rabbi came over and I took a deep breath. I asked him what he gets up to when he＊s not hosting batmitzvahs. He said he also does weddings and suggested he could do my wedding. I was about to say, ※Oh, well, you won＊t because you won＊t.§ But instead I just smiled.He asked if I was married already and I pointed towards my boyfriend again. The rabbi didn＊t know what to say, so he hugged me. In the hug, I went from feeling alarmed to patronised to realising that he wasn＊t hugging me, I was hugging a child who had just heard something that had scared him.It feels like an unkind thing to do, to attack religious people. It just feels rude. If you＊re at a party and you get into a conversation with someone who says, ※Oh, I＊m a Christian§ or, ※I＊m a Muslim§ or, ※I＊m a Jew§, it＊s very rude to say, ※Oh, how ridiculous!§I feel at this point we have to treat people with kindness, love and respect in the same way you treat a child running around the party saying, ※I＊m a helicopter.§ Good for you, we＊re all having fun; I＊m a choo-choo train.***There is a calm now to my relationship with my father. We stopped wanting to fix each other. And I＊ve accepted that everything that happened could not have been any different. If it had been, I＊d be an entirely different person, so to want to alter the past would only be another form of self-hate.The key story I have for remembering that my father is just a fallible man is this one: when I was 10, my mum was pregnant for the fourth time. At the time, our two pet rabbits had just had five of their own babies. My mum was concerned that there would soon be a human baby crawling around the garden and didn＊t want there to be rabbit droppings everywhere. So she asked my dad to rehome the rabbits. How would he do this? My father took my seven-year-old brother and me to the local park and set the rabbits free. A dog came. We watched as the dog chased and mauled at least two of the smallest rabbits. My brother cried. I kept it all inside, where it stayed for 20 years. And when I think of the baby rabbits, I know that if they＊d been looking up at my father, desperately searching for an explanation or an apology, they would only have suffered more. Better for the baby rabbits to think, ※This is just a man who doesn＊t know what he＊s doing.§ This is an edited extract from Help, by Simon Amstell, published on 21 September by Square Peg at ?12.99.

"winkling like rows of cut-glass decanters in a well-stocked drinks cabinet, the faceted windows atop Cape Town＊s new contemporary art museum rise as a crystal beacon above a motley jumble of wharves, warehouses and shopping malls.The windows shine out from the crown of a majestic concrete grain silo that has stood here since the 1920s, once the tallest building in sub-Saharan , now reborn as the continent＊s answer to Tate Modern, which opens next week.※We could have so easily knocked it down and built a big shiny spaceship of a museum instead,§ says , the British designer of the R500m (?28m) , the first such institution of its kind in Africa. ※But the danger would have been that people would just come to take a selfie and not go inside. In a place that doesn＊t have a strong museum-going culture, our challenge was to make compelling innards, to lure people in to see the art.§The building＊s guts certainly have the jaw-dropping, selfie-friendly wow factor he was hoping for. In one of his most audacious party tricks to date, Heatherwick has excavated a gigantic ovoid atrium from the centre of the silos, revealing a thrilling space of concrete cylinders that plunge from the ceiling like carved stalactites, through which stairs spiral and glass elevators glide. It is a spectacular act of architectural mutilation that makes  penchant for cutting holes in houses look like mere tinkering.Such a gravity-defying feat wasn＊t easy 每 in fact, it wasn＊t initially possible. The rickety 1920s concrete tubes, at just 180mm thick, weren＊t capable of being chopped up so brutally, so a new 250mm sleeve of concrete had to be cast inside each of the cylinders. The building was essentially made anew before it could be sliced up in a Herculean ballet of jackhammers, diamond rope and double-bladed circular saws.The result, however artificial it may be, is nonetheless a powerful piece of constructed archaeology, the aggregate of the new cylinders contrasting with the old, their edges polished like nougat, while the atrium void plunges through the floor to reveal the basement where conveyor belts once shuttled the grain. How well it performs its role as a space for ※monumental interventions§, like the Tate＊s Turbine Hall, remains to be seen. For now,  dangling creature made of rubber inner-tubes and ribbons gets a bit lost in the soaring geometry.The next hurdle was how to make the galleries. As Heatherwick admits, ※tubes are quite rubbish spaces for showing art,§ so two-thirds of the silos have been swept away to make space for conventional white cube galleries, ※dropped in like shoeboxes§ either side of the dazzling atrium. The resulting spaces are indeed rather utilitarian affairs. The character of the industrial hulk has been banished in favour of white plasterboard walls and suspended grey resin floors, which bounce underfoot with an uneasy cheapness. Thankfully the basement level has been left as a raw, as-found space for installations, but more of the rugged spirit would have been welcome throughout.If it feels like an amazing atrium with an OK gallery attached, the project＊s unusual gestation explains why. What to do with the ageing silo had long vexed the , the company in charge of the 123 hectares of former docklands, which has been developed piecemeal since the 1990s as an odd mishmash of retail, office and seaside attractions.※The silo was our cathedral,§ says the company＊s development director Mark Noble, ※but we had no idea what to put in it.§ So they turned to Heatherwick 每 who had been enchanted by the abandoned pigeon poo-filled relic when he visited Cape Town in 2007 每 to come up with a plan. After considering everything from a mushroom farm to a car park, his studio hit on the idea of a museum. The usual big institutions such as the Guggenheim were approached, ※but they all wanted millions in licensing fees,§ says Noble. Happily, a connection was made, through Mark Coetzee, a Capetonian curator and now director of the museum, to Jochen Zeitz, a German businessman, who made his fortune from the Puma sportswear brand and whose substantial collection of contemporary African art the building now houses.The museum, it turns out, would be the value-adding cultural anchor for a much bigger commercial development, the V&A Waterfront＊s R3.5bn (?195m)  of offices, shops and apartments that are now cluttered around the elegant concrete tower in a discordant symphony of competing cladding systems.Masterminded by the , it is a dog＊s dinner of tiles, bricks and corrugated metal at wonky angles, housing the offices of PwC, a Radisson hotel and a Virgin Active health club. It is the usual formula of museum-led real estate development familiar to cities around the world, where developers flock to cash in on the cultural cach谷 that a new institution brings to an area, only here it has happened in reverse: the luxury apartments are sold before the museum has even opened, the whole thing planned by one landowner.The commercial leaning of the whole enterprise isn＊t confined to the surroundings. The glowing crystalline lanterns atop the museum are not, in fact, gallery spaces but the bedrooms of a luxury hotel that occupies the entire upper half of the complex. Managed by South Africa＊s exclusive  brand, its interior (not designed by Heatherwick, his team is keen to stress) is a , like a site-specific artwork of more money than taste. The bedrooms, which cost between R12,000 (?680) and R140,000 (?8,000) per night, groan with two-metre Egyptian chandeliers and lime-green ostrich skin. Looking out through the chunky steel frames of Heatherwick＊s quasi-gothic windows makes you feel a little like a caged songbird.The stunning poolside bar on the roof, where you can enjoy a R3,800 (?200) glass of cognac and views of Table Mountain, is, of course, accessible by reservation only. Compare this with other recent museums, like Tate Modern＊s  with its free public roof deck, and the difference is stark.※You can only take philanthropy so far,§ says Noble. In this case, just up to the sixth floor, where museum-goers can enjoy a small sculpture terrace overlooked by residents of the hotel＊s luxury suites.Both Heatherwick and Mocaa are reluctant to talk about the hotel, and it＊s not hard to see why. For an institution that is trying to be open and accessible to all, its upstairs neighbour is a painful reminder of the extreme inequality that still racks this city 每 a luxury playground for some, an  每 more than two decades after apartheid. Still, it might prove to be a useful tension, given that this entrenched status quo is exactly what the museum should be here to challenge.																																											"
"he day begins with the alarm at 8.30 and then commences the great struggle: wake up or go back to sleep. I am by nature a nocturnal person; the hours between midnight and 3am are when the world feels almost enchanted in its stillness, and writing comes most easily. Through my 20s, I wrote at night 每 10pm to 4am. If I were a different kind of person, one who could shut out both the world and myself, in order to work I would still be writing during those hours. But my life requires both solitude and sociability, and in the interest of the latter I have to reshape the ways in which I interact with the former. So, no more writing into the early hours of the morning. The alarm rings; I struggle with myself; I get out of bed. (How long this process takes is entirely dependent on how keen or not I am to get to my writing desk).Into the kitchen for a cup of coffee, and stop along the way to pick the Guardian off the doormat. Drink coffee; read paper. (How long this process takes is entirely dependent on how keen or not I am to get to my writing desk). Then?I change into something comfortable verging on unviewable by the outside world. I read what I＊ve written the day before, read it out loud to see if?the ear might pick up flaws and failures that the eye can＊t see. This is necessary, but that doesn＊t mean it isn＊t a form of procrastination.Then I write. But of course there's a significant omission in here: I haven＊t mentioned the internet and writers telling anyone about their writing day have to account for their relationship with the online world. So yes, at some point before I settle down to work I?look at email and Twitter and WhatsApp. (How long this process takes etc.) Some days I am driven to put my phone in another room and switch off the wifi on my laptop; on other days, once I＊ve started writing the emails ping in and I barely notice them. Whatever the circumstances, I＊m never so foolish as to have Twitter notifications switched on.And then I write. Or some days, I don＊t, because all this has taken me up to lunch and now I have to find or prepare something to eat (HLTPT etc). And after I＊ve eaten I＊m sleepy, so nothing＊s going to happen and perhaps I should just go for a walk. While I walk, I think about the novel. Sentences and scenes write themselves so much more easily when you aren＊t actually writing them. They aren＊t always the sentences and scenes that I＊m working on that day 每 sometimes it＊s scenes of what＊s yet to?come, which I hold at bay (I write chronologically, always). Other times I realise there＊s something missing earlier in the narrative that I need to put in.I return to my desk. I write. Some days it＊s like wading in treacle while being allergic to treacle. Other days, I＊m?in my element, and more deeply at home in myself than I can ever otherwise be. Yet other days, I＊m just one of the millions of people who are sitting at a desk, getting the day＊s work done.I don＊t have a set time for stopping, but one of the pleasures of not being a nocturnal writer any more is in knowing that there is a certain moment in the day when I can push my chair back from the desk and say, I＊m done until tomorrow. Some times, late in a novel, when everything has acquired an almost unbearable momentum and I need to write what happens next in order to know what happens next, I might return to those old ways and sit down for a writing session that continues until 2 or 3 or 4am 每 but those days are rare.Mostly, evenings are times to read and to see friends. I know I＊ve reached a certain point in a novel when my social world contracts and I only want to see the closest friends in whose company it＊s possible to emit a very low thrum of energy without feeling the need to give any more. Eventually, home again, and an episode of some TV show. And then commences the great struggle: go to sleep early enough to be well rested when the alarm rings, or stay awake enjoying the post-midnight stillness of the world.  is published by Bloomsbury.

"ou don＊t realise that you＊re impacting or influencing the culture,§ says Yvonne Orji, shaking her head in wonder. ※It＊s a TV show 每 we＊re just trying to entertain people.§ But the Los Angeles-set HBO comedy Insecure 每 in which Orji stars as Molly Carter, a corporate lawyer with a tongue as sharp as her tailored wardrobe 每 has done much more than that, including inspiring audience members to call out inequalities. In an episode shown earlier this summer, Molly discovers that a white male colleague of the same position is paid significantly more. With incredible timing, the show＊s second season began airing in the UK days after the BBC was forced to reveal the wages of its top stars, .※We got so many comments on Twitter, with people saying: ＆Yup, I＊ve been there＊ or, ＆I left my last job because of it＊,§ says 33-year-old Orji, when we speak via Skype from her Los Angeles home. ※After watching that episode, one viewer went in to ask for more money, came back and said that she got a raise. It wasn＊t as much as she asked for, but it was more than she was getting.§The series, which rounds off its second season this week, is anchored by the central relationship between Molly and her best friend, Issa Dee 每  每 two educated, young, professional black women, making their way, messily, in work and love. And while on-screen Issa＊s nerdy enthusiasm and misguided attempts at multi-dating (this season she introduced a ※hoetation§) are riveting in their excruciating awfulness, this season has belonged to Molly, whose misfires in her personal life are matched only by her frustrations in the workplace.It is also Molly, the only African-American employee at her law firm, who exemplifies the most extreme examples of code-switching (adapting her language and behaviour depending on her environment). ※I think Molly is just used to it, and does it unconsciously,§ shrugs Orji. ※It comes with the territory. If you＊re a woman of colour and you have any level of education, you have to adapt.§She recalls a Hollywood awards party in early 2016. ※I was looking around this room, this sea of industry folk. If I had have worn black-and-white, somebody would have asked me to get them a cocktail; the only other people of colour there were servers.§It was around the time of the #OscarsSoWhite debate, but Orji believes  is missing the point. ※That＊s just the manifestation of the problem,§ she argues. ※It＊s about access, it＊s about knowing a party like this, where the deals for the next movie are made, is even happening,§ she continues. ※I don＊t know how often white people look around and think: ＆Wow, there＊s really a lot of white people here; we should fix that.＊ But I know black people often look around and think: ＆Wow, I＊m the only one here 每 why?＊§But positive discrimination often places enormous pressure on those selected to be better than their white/male/both counterparts, just to prove their place. ※If a person of colour is able to fail and continue to work, that＊s actually real progress,§ notes Orji. ※Otherwise it becomes this pressure, like: ＆My God, if I fail then we＊ll never get another black movie made for 10 more years.＊§Molly has endured something of a personal earthquake this season, in discovering that her father was unfaithful, which shatters her long-held beliefs about her parents＊ ※perfect§ marriage and influences her own liaisons. ※Her parents＊ relationship was the gold standard for her and she was chasing that,§ says Orji. ※Then, everything she knew to be true and positive and beautiful about a relationship went out the window.§This season, she has rejected the seemingly perfect Lionel (), and, instead 每 spoiler alert 每 embarked on an affair with her longtime friend, Dro, who is married, but apparently in an open relationship. ※Dro presents to her this alternate love story, and she＊s like: ＆Am I the only one that still thought marriage was one-way? If everybody else is cool with adultery, and open marriages, then what do I know?＊§The moral ambiguity of the situation feels relevant for a modern audience, but could not be further from Orji＊s own experiences: as a devout Christian, who frequently invokes God in her everyday conversation. Orji doesn＊t drink, is a virgin, and is abstaining from sex until marriage.※I＊m 33 years old and I＊ve lived most of my life this way so it＊s not news to me,§ she says of the column inches the matter has enjoyed. ※It＊s not a big deal for me, but I know a lot of people are like: ＆How does that work in 2017? How are you functional and how are you normal?＊§For her part, she＊s baffled that it＊s such a hot topic. ※It doesn＊t affect my life in any major way ＃which makes me feel like other people out there must be having a lot of sex.§Born in Nigeria, where her father was a contractor for oil companies, and her mother a nurse, the family moved to Maryland in the US when Yvonne was six. The extreme drop in temperature, from sub-Saharan Africa to midwinter Maryland, was a shock but so was the attitude of her peers. ※I got bullied because I had an accent and I was different. I got made fun of by white people and by black people,§ she says, still shocked. ※They called me ＆African booty scratcher＊. I was like: ＆How are you going to talk about me? You look just like me.＊ I was so confused.§She took refuge in study and, spurred on by parents who encouraged traditional, respectable careers, aspired to become a doctor. ※And then I realised I actually do not like blood,§ she laughs. Nonetheless, she went off to George Washington University and studied health, with minors in biology and Spanish. ※You can＊t just tell your Nigerian parents, who are paying for your college education: ＆I don＊t want to do this thing that you came to this country for,＊§ she reasons. She even studied for a masters degree to avoid disappointing them. ※And after that, I was like: ＆Um, you know, I think I need to go to a war-torn country,＊ so I worked in Liberia for six months. That was also easier than crushing their dreams.§During her time at college, however, she＊d begun to entertain the idea that she might be funny. Somewhat incongruously, as part of a Miss Nigeria in America pageant, she wrote a five-minute set about ＆What＊s funny about being Nigerian in America?＊. People laughed and she entered another competition, back at her university. ※Then people started asking if I hosted weddings and baby showers and started paying me to do it. The first time I ever made $500 for a five-minute set, I was like, ＆I＊m never going to med school, because I don＊t know a doctor that＊s making $100 a minute.＊§ Still, it took until her return from Liberia in 2009 before she confessed to her family that she had other ambitions. ※When I got back, there was a recession. I thought: this is great,§ she recalls. ※Now I can move to New York and pursue my dreams, because if I do fail, I＊ll just be among the masses of Americans without jobs.§She began working the notoriously brutal US standup scene but the breaks didn＊t come quite as quickly as she＊d hoped, and by 2014 she ※hit the beginning stages of depression§. She found herself, one particularly bleak day, in Los Angeles, crying on Sunset Boulevard. She relates a conversation she had with the Holy Spirit, as if he were a member of her management team. Freshly inspired, she decided it was time to create her own web comedy, FirstGen, about being a first-generation Nigerian in the US. ※I knew I had one last shot before I had to go back to Laurel, Maryland, where dreams go to die.§ FirstGen brought her to Rae＊s attention and secured her the audition for Insecure.Her openness about the difficult times is also indicative of what Insecure is trying to achieve. Molly, who is initially resistant to therapy, is told by her therapist that black women can feel invisible at work, and as if they have to have the perfect relationship at home. ※There＊s this idea,§ says Orji, ※if you are a woman of colour, that you must never let them see you break down. That we＊ve got to show ourselves in the best light, always, as the ＆Strong Black Women＊, and bring that ＆black girl magic＊, all the time.§ She rolls her eyes and sighs. ※But that is why our show is so relatable. We are a mess, at best.§																																											"
"Pat Albeck, who has died aged 87, was a prolific, gifted designer of printed textiles whose genius for flat pattern also took her into design for ceramics, wallpapers and a whole range of merchandise for the National Trust.Her work looked effortless but this was deceptive. Informed by a prolonged art education, she had an unstoppable appetite for work and a remarkable graphic sensibility. From her bold Apples and Pears fabric pattern, made in 1952 while still a student at the Royal College of Art (RCA), to her 1960s Daisychain design for John Lewis, a bestseller for 15 years and reissued in 2014 for the store＊s 150th anniversary,  had enormous popular appeal, much of it entering our homes anonymously, as dress or furnishing fabric or as flat pattern adorning every kind of object.She was an inspiring mentor to younger designers who served informal apprenticeships 每 including  and , until recently professor of textiles at the RCA. In later years her work gained new audiences through commissions from the ceramics manufacturer Emma Bridgewater, her daughter-in-law.Born in Hull, Pat was the youngest of four daughters of Max and Sarah Albeck, both from Zarembi, a small village near Warsaw where Max＊s father had been a rabbi. The couple left Poland for London and by 1919 had moved to Hull, where Max set up business as a manufacturing furrier, privately espousing the anarchist cause, a regular subscriber to the .When Pat was three the family moved to a new house in the nearby village of Anlaby, commissioned by her father. Albeck recalled the exterior as ※stockbroker Tudor§, but the art deco interior (created by a local stage designer) included abstract murals and rugs, stained glass designed by art students, including a scene of Little Red Riding Hood in Pat＊s bedroom, and a garden with crescent moon flowerbeds and early lilac in the greenhouse.At Beverley high school for girls Pat had an excellent art teacher who focused on pattern-making and calligraphy. She spent four years at Hull College of Arts and Crafts at a time when ex-servicemen were flooding art schools, inspiring in their seriousness and determination and in 1950 won a scholarship to the RCA in London, to study printed textile design. From the start she found art materials inspiring, using all types of paper, often for cut-outs and collage, paints, fine inks applied by brush, and pens 每 including, by the 60s, felt-tips.Albeck soon emerged as one of the elite fledgling consultant designers produced by the RCA. In 1952 she was included in the show Art for the Factory at the , the first show put on by the college entirely devoted to industrial design, alongside silversmiths such as  and , and the furniture designers  and .While she was still a student, her  was bought as a dress length by , photographer and co-founder of the influential textile and , and Albeck sold a black stripe with a red rose design to Horrockses Fashion (a subsidiary of the textile firm Horrockses, Crewdson & Co).She proved a brilliant designer for Horrockses. The firm＊s charming full-skirted dresses, many using Albeck＊s textiles, are now collectors＊ items. Albeck worked for the company continuously after leaving college, producing a stream of knowing and sharply drawn variations of stripes and flora, with diversions into architecture, including her playful Venice Fish Market, inspired by a 1953 RCA travel scholarship, and her Fruit and Stripe design chosen by Sir Hugh Casson, then head of interior design at the RCA, for his office curtains. In 1954 she married her fellow student , borrowing the weaver ＊s Morris Minor for a brief honeymoon.In 1958 Albeck left Horrockses, embarking on a highly successful freelance career that included Plum, a wallpaper for Sanderson＊s centenaryin 1960, and exquisite patterns for tableware, which took her to Stoke-on-Trent and won her a Council of Industrial Design (now  Council) award in 1958. The 1960s saw inspirational visits to New York and to Australia, the latter on a Cotton Board scholarship, and the birth of her son, Matthew, in 1962. He was to inspire nursery textiles and wallpapers, and several children＊s books.Cavendish Textiles, the production company for John Lewis, became an important client. The popular , a response to John Lewis＊s request for a William Morris-inspired print, was produced in different colourways each year. She designed dress fabrics for Samuel Sherman＊s Dollyrockers range 每 on his advice she studied the film (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, 1964) for its remarkable colour values 每 and worked for Osman Textiles and Palladio Wallpaper. She also wrote the textbook Printed Textiles, for Oxford University Press (1969).In the 1970s she began her longstanding association with the National Trust, introduced by her Hammersmith neighbour the artist , whose cousin Robin Fedden was then the trust＊s director. Her , whose intricate narrative charm often led them to be framed by purchasers. By the 1980s she was creating whole ranges of co-ordinated products 每 from table mats to desk accessories 每 usually inspired by a detail in a specific trust property.Albeck took commissions from her son Matthew Rice＊s paper company, and on his marriage to  in 1987 continued to design for them both. She began a series of flower paintings in the 80s and 90s, moving on to remarkable cut paper pictures, a selection of which were exhibited at  in Pimlico, London, in May this year, to coincide with the Chelsea Flower Show. Watching her wield her scissors freehand, fluently cutting out flowers, leaves and fruit, was a remarkable experience. Her love of flowers was further celebrated in her illustrations for Anthony Footit＊s Gospel of Wild Flowers (2006). She was busy at her desk until a few days before she died.Albeck and her husband had , first in Hammersmith, after 2000 in Norfolk, and finally in Oxfordshire. After dinner the couple would invariably return to work, obeying the shared mantra ※back to the drawing board§, the title of a film and last year.Diminutive, sporting striking spectacles, bright-eyed and beautifully and colourfully dressed, Albeck always gave generously 每 serving on numerous design committees and as external examiner to many schools of art. Her archives are in the .Peter died in 2015. Albeck is survived by Matthew and by her grandchildren, Lil, Kitty, Margaret and Michael Judith Patricia Albeck, designer, born 17 March 1930; died 2 September 2017																																											"
"t the  a few days ago, BBC Films announced their film adaptation of Mikey Walsh＊s bestselling memoir Gypsy Boy. The wrenching story of a Romany Gypsy born into a tough family of bare-knuckle boxers 每 and moving away from that background with difficulty after realising he＊s gay 每 is being turned into a father-son drama. While the main character Mikey has not yet been cast, Variety announced that Walsh＊s father, Frank, will be played by .But casting Cumberbatch goes far beyond the realm of tone-deafness. With talk of whitewashing now rife in the film industry, there should be some kind of response to this decision. Cumberbatch is from the most privileged echelons of British society, playing one of the nation＊s most disadvantaged ethnic minorities. So far, the rest of the cast and crew of Gypsy Boy are also made up entirely of non-Travellers 每 a choice that would be outrageous for any other BME film production.Cumberbatch is undoubtedly a hugely talented actor and we can expect a nuanced performance from him. But the problem here is deeper, and the implication that any actor can throw on a different ethnic identity at a whim is troubling. From the outset, Gypsy Boy is exhibiting a degree of carelessness about the group of people it seeks to portray. The Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) community is among the most derided and rarely portrayed ethnic groups in British cinema. In more cloistered cinephile circles, film directors such as the Romany-born Tony Gatlif (, 1993) and Serbian arthouse favourite  (, 1988) have done pioneering work in their explorations of travelling life. In English-language cinema, the exemplary 2005 film  (directed by Perry Ogden) is an impressive, documentary-style drama featuring a family of real Irish Travellers. But overall, particularly when it comes to films released theatrically in the UK, GRT protagonists are scarce. The handful that average moviegoers can name either parrot racial epithets such as ※pikey§ (Guy Ritchie＊s ), borrow language and cultural elements from Travellers with little acknowledgement (Clio Barnard＊s ) or use their Traveller characters as token working-class tough guys.Last year did see one notable if lukewarm exception: , starring Michael Fassbender and Brendan Gleeson. The film, based on the real-life exploits of a Traveller crime family, did attempt to take a jab at casual racism in British life. But, populated as it is by conmen and thieves, it hardly defies negative stereotypes. And more pressingly, the director Adam Smith did not cast actors from a Romany background. Borrowing from GRT people＊s stories without including them in the creative process is hardly progressive.When we face the realities of Travellers＊ marginal existence 每 a group of people who have the school attainment rates and standards of living in the UK 每 it smacks of borderline insult for Cumberbatch to take on the mantle of oppression for a film role. This is a former public schoolboy who once said that his biggest experience of being ※ostracised§ was ※for being brought up in a world of privilege§.That＊s a painfully far cry from the regular mistrust and fear that Romany Gypsies are treated with in contemporary Britain. Last week, of a police eviction in the West Midlands. Although there were no charges for resisting arrest, and no other crimes were committed, a police dog attacked an unarmed Gypsy man. The man＊s leg was savaged for a minute and he later needed surgery. This shocking footage has not been widely shared in national news media, nor met with the type of online outrage typically reserved for police violence against racial minorities.While it may seem tangential, the response to that footage is the most extreme iteration of the same endemic issue. There＊s a gnawing silence on the subject of racism against GRT people, in the arts and film community and in the media more generally. If GRT people are denied minority status by this blindness, the results can be dangerous. Casting a posh white actor as a Romany Gypsy with little or no backlash is an extension of the same problem.Last month, a whitewashing scandal around the casting of Hellboy reached all the way to its Hollywood executives and stars. Another white Englishman, actor Ed Skrein, was cast in a role originally written and created for an Asian-American person. In response to criticism,  (ie, someone racially appropriate). It＊s not the first time Cumberbatch has found himself in hot water over a similar race-related controversy. In , he played Khan, a role intended for someone of Indian descent. Unlike Cumberbatch, Skrein chose to step down from the role and released a statement. ※It is clear,§ he wrote, ※that representing this character in a culturally accurate way holds significance for people, and that to neglect this responsibility would continue a worrying tendency to obscure ethnic minority stories and voices in the arts.§ Skrein＊s decision and accompanying statement was applauded on social media.This points to one conclusion: that film festival programmers, critics and film-makers have a troubling blindspot when it comes to the Gypsy and Traveller population. If a white person takes on a role playing a person of colour, the uproar is swift. Romany Gypsies＊ apparent ※whiteness§ does not erase their ethnic-minority status. Whether the film world＊s silence on the subject speaks of simple unfamiliarity or a deeper bigotry, it desperately needs to change.																																											"

Host Stephen Colbert set the tone with an opening monologue, that repeatedly made fun of the president＊s long-running annoyance over not winning an Emmy during his time hosting The Apprentice.※Unlike the presidency, Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote,§ goaded Colbert, who also  to confirm the audience watching the event was the biggest ever, a reference to the former press secretary＊s disastrous first press conference where he exaggerated the number of people in attendance at Trump＊s inauguration.Other political targets were Ted Cruz, who was embarrassed when an aide ※liked§ some soft porn on his official Twitter feed recently. ※These days everyone loves streaming video,§ said Colbert. ※Just ask Ted Cruz.§There were some surprises in the acting categories with Sterling K Brown taking home best actor in a drama series for his role in This Is Us. The outstanding lead actress in a drama went to Elisabeth Moss for her portrayal of Offred in The Handmaid＊s Tale, which , with Ann Dowd also winning supporting actress in a drama series. The show also had wins for guest actress in a drama series (Alexis Bledel) and writing (Bruce Miller) and directing (Reed Morano).Big Little Lies , and helped HBO fill the void left by Game of Thrones not being eligible this year. Laura Dern managed her first win at the  for outstanding supporting actress in a limited series or movie for her performance in Big Little Lies. The show had a strong showing with other winners coming in the form of Nicole Kidman in best actress in a limited series or movie, Jean-Marc Vallee, for directing, and Alexander Skarsg?rd, who won outstanding supporting actor in a limited series or movie.The absence of Game of Thrones in the best drama category ensured another show would take an award the HBO show has won for two years in a row, but in the best comedy award business continued as usual. Julia Louis-Dreyfus won lead actress in a comedy for the fifth year running, and  for the third successive year.Elsewhere in comedy,  converted its newfound popularity in the age of Trump into Emmy wins.

"Two new artworks by Banksy have appeared at the  centre in central London.The murals, inspired by the upcoming  at the centre, were confirmed as genuine on the artist＊s verified Instagram account.Announcing the new artworks in a series of posts on Instagram, Banksy said: ※Major new Basquiat show  每 a place that is normally very keen to clean any graffiti from its walls.§ The , which is possibly mocking the exhibition, as Basquiat was originally a graffiti artist, is of a ferris wheel with people queueing up at a ticket booth underneath. Crown motifs, common in some of Basquiat＊s art, replace the wheel＊s passenger cars. The  is captioned: ※Portrait of Basquiat being welcomed by the Metropolitan police 每 an (unofficial) collaboration with the new Basquiat show.§In the second mural, which is clearly inspired by Basquiat＊s Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump 每 one of his most famous artworks 每  has portrayed police officers searching and questioning the boy figure as the dog looks on.It is perhaps a comment how Basquiat, who was one of the first famous black American artists, would be treated if he was working today, given how black people are still much more likely to be  than white. The exhibition, which is the first large-scale UK show of Basquiat＊s pioneering neo-expressionism, opens on Thursday at the arts centre. It will feature more than 100 works alongside rare photography, film and archive material.It comes nearly 30 years after the artist, DJ, poet and musician, who was also Madonna＊s former boyfriend, died from a heroin overdose.Banksy, who often makes political points with his art, is also known to support causes he cares about. In May, a  showing a metalworker chipping away at a star on the EU flag appeared in Dover.Last week he donated the ?205,000 raised from the  to human rights charity Reprieve and Campaign Against Arms Trade.

"My friend Martin Clark, who has died aged 78, was a specialist in modern Italian history and politics, an interest first stimulated by his Cambridge supervisor . Martin＊s doctoral research under provided the basis for his first book, Antonio Gramsci and the Revolution that Failed (1977).Son of Alfred, a civil servant, and Muriel, a housewife, Martin was born in Worthing, West Sussex. During the second world war he was evacuated to Llandudno, where he attended Ysgol John Bright. After national service he gained a first in history at Peterhouse, Cambridge, followed by a PhD at Birkbeck, University of London. Martin was appointed an assistant lecturer in the recently formed politics department at Edinburgh University in 1965. He and Ruth Williams married that year and they lived in Edinburgh for the rest of Martin＊s life.His authoritative Longman history Modern  appeared in 1984, with a third edition in 1996. It earned him a readership. The Italian Risorgimento followed in 1998. Martin＊s scholarship and broad cultural interests were lightly worn. His books, sparkling with insight and wit, are extremely accessible to the non-specialist.He held fast to scholarly values while the university world changed around him. This did not always make for easy relationships with colleagues, but regard for his academic work transcended the policy differences. Martin was glad to take early retirement in 2001. His writing continued with Mussolini in 2005. There was talk of a fourth edition of the Longman history, a projected political history of Sardinia and, most tantalising of all, an idea for a book that would explore the political context of Vel芍zquez＊s great portrait of Pope Innocent X. This would have required digging through Italian and Spanish archives, a task Martin would have relished, but both he and Ruth suffered spells of poor health and the trips never materialised.Martin had a rare independence of mind and a sceptical attitude towards all political parties, though he was a member of the Scottish Green party in its early years. He and I went on Scottish hill walks with the Radical Ramblers and later ambled round Blackford Hill. He had a great passion for cricket and a love of all the arts, but above all of Verdi. He tried his hand at a play set in the last days of Mussolini. He was always entertaining company.He is survived by Ruth, by their sons Adam and Ivan, and by his four grandchildren.																																											"
"Dance teacher Vanessa Hooper puts it down to the city＊s history and geography while Royal Ballet boss Kevin O＊Hare talks of a ※can do, work hard§ determined spirit. Whatever the reason, .On Saturday they were part of an emotional  performance in Hull as part of the 2017 city of culture programme, reopening the city＊s New Theatre after its ?16m refurbishment.On stage was Elizabeth Harrod, a Royal Ballet soloist;  and his sister Demelza, a Royal Ballet ballerina; and English National Ballet＊s Joseph Caley.The show, titled Opening the New, was watched by a sell-out audience at the theatre and more than 3,000 people who braved a chilly night watching a live relay in nearby Queens Gardens.Many of Hull＊s dancers trained at the , set up by the late Vera Skelton and continued by her daughter Vanessa Hooper.But what made  such a breeding ground for so much classical ballet talent?O＊Hare, who remembers being on the New Theatre stage as a young peasant boy in a visiting production of Giselle, thinks it was a combination of the school＊s skill and Hull itself.There is a determination about the the city, he said 每 a ※can do, work hard§ attitude. ※People talk about it being the end of the line but it never felt like that. For me I never felt, ＆oh you can＊t do that＊ because you live in a place miles from anything ＃ I always felt every opportunity was available.§Hooper thinks people in Hull are good at committing themselves to things. In many cities there is more competition for children＊s attention and they are torn. ※Whereas the children here focus on what they do and they give it 100% and their parents are committed too.§People in Hull want something better, she said, ※because we＊ve always felt like a bit of a poor relation to all the other big cities. When the trawler industry and fishing trade died it had such a huge impact and we thought we＊ve got to try to get better, we＊ve got to beat it and that＊s exactly what we did.§The Royal  performance sold out very quickly which is why many of Elizabeth Harrod＊s relatives were watching from Queens Gardens.She performed a Frederick Ashton piece, The Two Pigeons, with her husband Steven McRae, and it was an immense occasion, she said.※It is a really incredibly special event to be part of, I think of all the other dancers from all over the world and all over the country, half of them will never get the chance to go back to where it all began.§The Skelton Hooper school was instrumental in giving her a successful career in ballet.It was not your average ballet school, she said. It was disciplined but not in a bad way. ※It was drilled into us from a young age that you can＊t talk now, you must do this, even just standing up straight. The variety of skills we learnt was just fantastic.§Harrod recalled being in Jack and the Beanstalk at the New Theatre as a 10-year-old and adoring it. ※I loved it.. I had no concept of pressure at that age.§That chimes in with Hooper＊s memories, calling Harrod ※tremendously athletic with this incredible fearless streak. You could give her anything and she would have a go at it and she could usually pull it off.§Parish has become one of the stars of the ballet world as the first British dancer to make a name for himself with a Russian company. On Saturday he was a star again. Hooper remembers a quiet boy with ※beautiful limbs but hadn＊t the first idea what to do with them.§Being back in Hull, Parish said, was a bit surreal. Harrod called it pure nostalgia. ※I just think about myself growing up here. I was walking from the hotel to the theatre and my husband said do you know the way and I said of course I do.

Soon I was back in the monstrosity 每 known as ※Welcome to Spyland Beside the Thames§ 每 being interviewed by Bunny and Laura, two fresh-faced ingenues from MI6. ※Do you have a mobile phone or an email address?§ asked Bunny. I didn＊t reply. Dead-letter drops and Remington typewriters were the only means of communication I really trusted. Bunny continued. There was a problem. Alec Leamas＊s son, Christoph, was threatening legal action against Six over his father＊s death. What could I tell them about Operation Windfall? Very little, I replied. Lying was still second nature.※You＊re going to have to do better than that,§ Laura said evenly. ※We know all about the Stables.§ I suddenly felt very tired 每 unsurprising for a man who must now be in his mid-80s. Don＊t ask for my exact age as it has been long forgotten. Call it Tradecraft.I took them round to the Stables. It was exactly as I had left it more than 50 years ago. Same shabby furniture, same narrow staircase, same spooks reading dusty reports. ※We have all the files,§ said Bunny. ※You may as well tell us the truth. Did you sleep with Doris, codename Tulip?§※No,§ I replied. Like so many things, it wasn＊t quite a lie. We hadn＊t slept together. We had made love on many occasions as she passed Soviet secrets to me. ※I＊d like to speak to George.§※I＊m afraid George isn＊t around. He is well over 100, after all.§I walked slowly home, careful to let Christoph tail me closely. I bent down to tie up my shoelaces and put my back out. ※Give me 1m and I＊ll drop the case,§ he said. ※I don＊t have that kind of money on me,§ I replied, surprised I could occasionally still tell the truth.The interrogation started again the following day and continued for several weeks. My mind went back to Camp 4, where Tulip had been brought for interrogation. ※She＊s dead. Hanged,§ George had told me. ※But don＊t tell anyone on Joint. This is strictly Covert only. We have a mole. Tulip was murdered by a Stasi double agent whom we＊re planning on turning into a triple agent.§Christoph appeared with a gun. I quickly disarmed him and threw the Walther into the Thames. ※Go home,§ I advised him. ※You＊re well out of your depth. Like the pistol.§ I slipped away to find George holed up in Switzerland. ※You＊re looking good for one of the oldest men alive,§ I observed.※You too,§ he replied evenly. He sighed. ※I suppose you want the truth. It＊s complicated, Peter.§ It always was. ※There was no triple agent. There was a quadruple agent instead.  is a dirty world. Yes, you＊d have thought that at least one of my books would have been recognised for a literary prize. But critics are worse than spooks. They lie to themselves and others. It＊s second nature. We can tell better stories and write better prose, but we＊ll never make a shortlist. It＊s the way of the world, Peter. Get used to it. I have.§ The Spy Who Went Back Into the Cold.																																											"
"In 1864, Abraham Lincoln was being besieged by a clown.Dan Rice, the most famous clown of the time 每 he was also an animal trainer and a strongman 每 was running for state senate in Pennsylvania. He had  on attacking Lincoln over his handling of the civil war.Rice lost the election and Lincoln＊s clown problem ended. Until Saturday, that is, when more than a thousand people, many wearing clown makeup, gathered at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial on Washington DC＊s national mall for the  Juggalo March.The Juggalos 每 the name given to fans of the band  每 were in Washington to demonstrate against the FBI labelling them a ※gang§, a designation they say has led to discrimination from police and in the workplace.Paint-clad protesters began to gather at around 1pm. Some Juggalos wore full face makeup in tribute to Insane Clown Posse duo Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J; others were wearing actual clown trousers and shoes; many more sported Juggalo T-shirts and sipped , a midwestern soda popularized by the band.Just like Lincoln, these clowns had a problem 每 in the form of a hastily arranged pro-Trump rally that was also taking place on the mall, less than a mile away.The Trump event, which organizers had dubbed the ※mother of all rallies§, had been called by supporters of the president, aiming to give him a shot in the arm after a turbulent introduction to the White House. The mother of all rallies could have overshadowed the Juggalo event. But among the Insane Clown Posse enthusiasts, it was clear they were not worried. Juggalos had travelled from across the country to attend the march, a rare opportunity to gather en masse, and they were determined to enjoy it.Chris Fabritz, with whom the Guardian spent the day, is known as ※mankini§ among certain Juggalos due to his penchant for wearing a bikini. He was hosting 14 Insane Clown Posse fans in his two-bedroom apartment over the weekend, which he said illustrated the bond between Juggalos.※We＊re a family. We welcome everybody with open arms,§ Fabritz said. ※We＊re people who genuinely believe in the human spirit.§Fabritz added that he and his fellow Juggalos would ※give you the shirt off our back if you needed it§. He was wearing a black bikini top and a pair of American flag underpants at the time.The clown paint and overtly masculine music of Insane Clown Posse 每 during the march Shaggy 2 Door described the band＊s output as ※the world＊s most hated music§ 每 has given the band and their adherents something of a comical air.But the FBI designation of Juggalos as a ※loosely-organized hybrid gang§, made in its , has had real consequences for fans of the group.※Many Juggalos subsets exhibit gang-like behavior and engage in criminal activity and violence,§ the  assessment said. ※Law enforcement officials in at least 21 states have identified criminal Juggalo subsets, according to [National Gang Intelligence Center] reporting.§Insane Clown Posse say that designation is unfair, claiming various people who commit crimes could often be said to be fans of certain musicians. A number of Juggalos, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan and Insane Clown Posse themselves, are . Until then, Juggalos are suffering.Todd Okan, 35, was among those on the mall. He said he was pulled over by police in Sacramento, California, because he had stickers of Insane Clown Posse＊s  mascot on his car.※They said these symbols are considered a gang symbol,§ Okan said. ※They were asking me, like: ＆Are you a leader of this gang?＊§ Okan, who is an accounting auditor, said he was not in a gang.※I was like: ＆This is the music I listen to.＊§Others had similar stories. Jessica Bonometti, from Manassas, Virginia, said she was fired as a probation officer in March 2016 as a result of her support for Insane Clown Posse. She had liked several photographs of the band on Facebook, she said, and was told by her boss that her affiliation was the reason she was fired. She said she had been unable to find a job since then, hampered by the firing and a lack of references.※My job was everything to me,§ she said. ※I＊m 34, I don＊t have kids, I don＊t have a husband, so my job was like my life. I didn＊t leave my house for a year after. I just couldn＊t deal with people. I felt like a misfit. Like I don＊t belong. So to say that the effects of it have been devastating would be a serious understatement.§The Juggalos began marching just after 5pm, after an expletive-laden speech from Shaggy 2 Dope 每 real name Joseph Utsler 每 and Violent J, AKA Joseph Bruce. The Juggalos pride themselves on a sense of community: chants of ※family, family§ echoed around the Reflecting Pool, as did the Juggalo identification cry of ※whoop, whoop§.In the late afternoon sunshine people waved signs 每 ※Is your band next§ was a popular one 每 as they strolled east along the mall and ringed the Washington Monument, passing around 500m from the Trump event.Ahead of the Juggalo event there had been concerns about the proximity between the two groups. In Charlottesville in August, a rightwing demonstration ended in  as white supremacists launched attacks on counter-protests.Organizers of the Trump rally had claimed thousands of people would attend. On Saturday, streets surrounding the mall were blocked by police cars. But instead, by mid-afternoon, the mother of all rallies had only attracted about 400 people. The crowd gathered in a space the size of a football field on the lush grass of the mall 每 which made for a lot of free grass 每 where they listened to hourly pledges of allegiance and numerous renditions of the Star Spangled Banner.The supporters milled around amiably in the fenced-off enclosure. Some picnicked on the grass, others held American flags aloft.Tahnee Gonzalez, 31, was carrying a cloth banner that depicted Trump holding an assault rifle, standing on top of a tank. There was also an eagle on it. She had travelled from Phoenix, Arizona, to attend the rally. She said she decided to come to ※show the fake news that there is support for our president§.※It＊s America first now. We can no longer support any other country until ours is completely united and strong again,§ she said. ※I want my fellow millennials to know they need to rise up before it＊s too late.§The only millennials rising up on the mall that day were on the other side of the Washington monument. The upbeat, open-minded nature of the Juggalo march, despite the reason for it taking place, provided a stark contrast to the Trump event, where people waved anti-communism flags and talked variously about Hillary Clinton＊s emails, the need to ※take our country back§, and craven politicians.The only palpable similarities between the events was that both took place on the national mall and both offered free face-painting 每 although the stars and stripes designs at the Trump rally differed in style from those of the Insane Clown Posse crowd.※When you step in we throw politics aside,§ Fabritz said as the Juggalo march wound its way back to Abraham Lincoln＊s statue. ※We＊re Juggalos, and we just love everyone.§																																											"

"I wrote the book primarily in 2016,§ Attica Locke says of her new , ※so the rise of Donald Trump and of people feeling free to speak their white supremacist beliefs§ had begun. The plot revolves around murders with a connection to the : ※Are you talking about the Klan?§ her hero, Darren Mathews, is asked. ※Worse,§ he replies: ※It＊s the Klan with money and semi-automatic weapons.§ The politics of race saturate the suspenseful tale, which is the first in a series set in the near present day. ※When Trump was elected,§ Locke tells me, ※I remember feeling: oh my God, overnight my book changed, and I didn＊t alter a word.§Mathews, a Texas Ranger beset by difficulties but proud to wear the lone-star badge, is determined to investigate ※homicides with a racial element 每 murders with a particularly ugly taint§. He reflects on the long history of racial prejudice his family has suffered and his recent hope that ※change might trickle down from the White House§. But ※in fact the opposite had proved to be true. In the wake of Obama, America had told on itself.§ Locke has been forthright in her analysis of the discomfort many Americans felt having a?black man as president: ※A large segment of white folks ＃ could not take that.§ Interviewed hours after Trump＊s election, she saw his victory ※through the lens of race§, as a ※backlash§ to Obama.We talk in the wake of the violent events in Charlottesville, and Locke, who is from the south 每 she was born in Houston 每 maintains ※there＊s nothing surprising to me in what＊s happening§. ※Everything about Trump has led to #Charlottesville,§ she tweeted. She notes the ubiquity of Confederate monuments 每 ※there was a Robert E Lee high school where I grew up§ 每 and to have these relics of the past unquestioned and all around us ＃ It＊s laced into a child＊s unconscious all the time, the region＊s racist past§. In other words, ※they are tools of white supremacy. They are there to fuck with your head.§※All of a sudden,§ Locke says,  is ※resonating in a way that I had not prepared myself for. I was just telling a story that I knew to be true about Texas, but I didn＊t know it would speak to something larger.§ For her, the most painful aspect of the Trump presidency is ＆realising that there＊s no  there with America anymore. What I mean is: if it＊s only a set of ideas, only an honour system in which we all follow laws and rules and codes of behaviour, and suddenly we just don＊t, where＊s the republic? ＃ I don＊t think I realised that nobody would come in to stop this absolute insanity, and get this person out. I didn＊t realise the extent to which Republicans would so covet power that they would be willing to let this play out, because we＊re in dangerous territory right now.§The novel is Locke＊s fourth, and arrives after a spell of her writing for the enormously successful , the hip-hop music industry saga dubbed the ※black §. ※I missed books, and I missed writing about Texas,§ she says. She has lived in Los Angeles for many years, but is a?great enthusiast for her home state, and owns a ※very big§ collection of cowboy boots. In the novel she has given Mathews a similar family history to her own: her people are ※from towns?along Highway 59, going back to slavery. We are the people who stayed.§Beginning in the second decade of the 20th century, ※there was a great migration of black people leaving the south§. But despite segregation and ※Klan terror§, ※we set down roots§, she?explains. ※Part of that was to do with class 每 we owned land ＃ we dared anyone to run us off.§  is, she has written, ※a thriller and a?character study, but it＊s also, at heart, a love letter to black Texans and a thank you to the ones who raised me§.Locke＊s family has an impressive history of public service going back generations, including the first black professor at the University of Texas, Austin, whose experience has helped form one character in the novel. Her mother＊s maternal grandmother, who ran a roadside cafe where she cooked food for black travellers, was the direct inspiration for Geneva Sweet, who in  serves up fried pies and has blues records in her cafe＊s ancient jukebox. Her tiny establishment is a kind of antipode to the white supremacist bar just down the highway, whose owner lives in a grand house built to resemble Thomas Jefferson＊s Monticello. Two bodies are dragged from the bayou, one a black man, one a local white woman, and gradually Mathews unfolds a complex history of race, sex and miscegenation.Although Locke swore she would ※never write a cop§ 每 her novels  and  both centre on a Houston lawyer, Jay Porter 每 she changed her mind for two reasons. First, she wanted her narrative to be set all along the highway 每 ※a Texas Ranger ranges§. Mathews has a degree from Princeton but knows what it means ※to?stand on the land where your forefathers had forged your future out of dirt§. (Locke shows me a photo of her father, complete with cowboy hat, on the family land where her grandparents were born.) In writing her black hero as a high-status Ranger, Locke wanted to turn ※the image of lone-star swagger on its head§.The other impetus came in the form of Jill Leovy＊s influential study  (2015), which tackled a ※plague of murders§ of?black men in south Los Angeles, focusing on how little was done to solve the crimes, ※It had a big impact on her ※because it flipped the?script of only considering the  of black life, and asked the reader to consider its . Mathews was created as someone who?could sit on the question: is the law something we can trust to protect us or?is it something we need protecting from?§Locke has said: ※I think I?get away with a lot of political stuff because of the presence of a?dead body. If you have familiar signposts along the way ＃ readers get comfortable, and then you can slide in all this other material.§ Her debut, the Orange prize-shortlisted  (which received plaudits from James Ellroy and Val McDermid among many others), was given an extra dimension thanks to the black activist background of her protagonist, the wary Porter. Both Locke＊s parents were themselves in the ※movement§ at the turn of the 1970s 每 her father was an associate of Stokely Carmichael and was put on trial. Attica, born in 1974, was named after the 1971 prison riot: ※The older I?get the more I have an appreciation for my name, it＊s almost a?mission statement. It has instilled in me a sense of a base level of humanity we＊re not supposed to go beneath.§Her parents divorced when she was young: their marriage, forged in ※the excitement and sensuousness and heady intellectual atmosphere of the movement§ petered out when the movement did. Her father became a?prominent lawyer, her mother a?successful businesswoman. ※Part of?why I wrote ,§ Locke says, ※is that I grew up with people who had a deep history, one that must have hurt because they didn＊t talk about it. I was trying to get under the surface, to explore what it must have felt like to have done all of this amazing stuff at 19.§Locke was the first black student at?an all-white elementary school, an ※overwhelming§ experience, and later would write stories on her father＊s law-practice stationery, even trying to sell them to her high-school friends. But she ※didn＊t get serious as a writer until I got rejected as a movie director§.A?fellow at the Sundance Institute, Locke aspired to be the next Spike Lee, but though she secured a movie deal, with a story similar to , the studio pulled the plug, on the?grounds that the film had a black lead but also white characters, and the ※world isn＊t interested in the rural black south§. ※I felt despair,§ she recalls. ※Back then there was no business model for who I was.§Her response was to become a Hollywood screenwriter, highly paid and sought after, though ※nothing ever got made. It was almost like the old studio system ＃ This was a time when sequels and superhero movies were starting to ramp up, and I was writing political thrillers and character-based stories. It was fake success, money success. I got disillusioned and walked away.§ The cash at least enabled her to?put her husband, a public defender, through law school. They met at university, when she was 17. ※At first sight, I couldn＊t stand him,§ she laughs. ※He was so weird. He was white. I was a sweet little girl, and he was this guy with long hair, leather jacket, earrings, and he reeked of cigarette smoke. He was so smug! But over time I started noticing things about him that made me question my initial judgment. When we had to make a documentary, he spent a night on the streets of Chicago with a homeless man.§There was no doubt about the kind of fiction Locke would write: she was always drawn to crime. ※I have always been fascinated by the question: why do they think they＊re going to get away?with it? And the woman in me wants to play these things out in order to feel some mastery and control over?a?world in which I＊m shorter than 50% of the population. I＊m scared of everything. But also I think that in essence every novel is a crime novel 每 crimes of the heart, moral crimes. It＊s all about how we deal with different types of scarcity: money, love ＃§When she finally decided on the subject matter of her first novel, she felt she had ※come home ＃ I had shown up as my true self, because when I was a screenwriter, I was frequently praised for being ＆of no colour＊; I did what I was asked to do; I?didn＊t have an identity. With  I vividly remember sitting on the floor of a hotel room and crying: I knew that I was about to announce to?the world that I＊m black. Which seems dumb, cos ＃ duh! But what I?was saying to the world?was: I＊m not  black. My worldview is black, it＊s who I am; there will no longer be any kind of apology for it.§Locke＊s second novel, , was set on a plantation with slavery in its past and immigrant exploitation in its present; was written in response to witnessing her father＊s campaign to become mayor of Houston 每 ※one of the most painful experiences of my life§, due to?dirty dealing on the part of his opponents and the local press. The subject-matter suited a return of Porter as the hero. When asked why three of her novels have had male protagonists, Locke has been adamant: ※When you＊re going through life as a black woman and some weird shit goes down, I don＊t go to gender first, I go right to race ＃ I am black before I＊m a woman.§Locke points out that one of the pleasures of being a writer on  was ※the lack of a ＆white gaze＊§. She was drawn to its theme ※of what happens to a family that is wealthy but has no training in generational wealth, which is a particular black thing. That＊s a Beyonc谷 story.§ She adds that ※everything I was trying to do in movies 20 years ago has moved to TV: it＊s where the complex characters are. I really can＊t quantify how much fun it was.§ Just when her writing contract could have been lucratively renewed, after three seasons, Locke has, however, taken the decision to withdraw from the show, which is far more ※soap-operatic§ than when it first began.More important, in writing for the show, she felt too far away from ※my actual voice§. Her novels give Locke ※a feeling of connectedness to who I fundamentally am§ 每 she is inseparably bound to Texas, with all its ※wild contradictions§. On a recent trip to research the second Darren Mathews novel, she stayed in a cabin near Caddo Lake, on the border with Louisiana. ※I was too chicken to stay by myself, with, frankly, a bunch of rednecks, so I asked my dad to come with me. And I asked him to bring a gun. I detest guns, and from my point of view, the question is: ＆What do you need guns for?＊ But for my dad and my grandmother, who is§, she chuckles, ※ also quite armed, they are thinking about the Klan.※With the exception of one town, where I felt an incredible tension, everybody was warm and engaging,§ she recalls. ※Yet I knew I was standing in Trump country and that these people had just voted to keep white supremacy in place. They didn＊t see a hypocrisy in that. It was bothersome. It was frightening 每 that this might go so much deeper and might be so much harder to extricate.§Locke＊s daughter, Clara, was visiting her grandparents in Houston when Hurricane Harvey struck, and the novelist pays tribute to the ※regular citizens who made all the difference: offering their boats, rescuing strangers, offering their homes, their stores for shelter.§ She also suggests that ※one day when the waters recede,  will have to contend with its love affair and addiction to industrial growth. It will be a hard look in the mirror.§The hurricane is the latest chapter in her family＊s long Texan story. Locke becomes visibly emotional when she re-emphasises how much of her own heritage has been folded into . The book 每 ※it＊s so personal, I can＊t really articulate it§ 每 is dedicated to her ancestors, ※men and women who said no§. The state depicted in the novel may feature huge images of Trump, a?cafe called Kay＊s Kountry Kitchen (the initials are a ※flagrant act of microaggression§) and ※white nationalism§ growing like fungus in the ※social media swamp§. But Ranger Mathews refuses to leave. ※They don＊t get to decide what this place is,§ he says. ※This is my home, too.§																																											"
"Having channelled the Weeknd on Pillowtalk,  on his debut album and Drake on this year＊s non-hit Still Got Time, Zayn＊s now set his doe-eyes on Sia＊s gusty-pop crown. In fact, the billowing Dusk Till Dawn features Sia herself on backing vocals, the pair＊s high-wire emoting catapulting the now-this-is-how-you-do-a-pop-chorus chorus skywards, leaving the rest of the song essentially cowering under the sheer weight of it all.Altogether now: ※I＊m fully charged, nipples are hard, ready to go.§ So runs the chorus to ＊s Disco Tits, a subtlety-free sex jamboree that could never hope to live up to its title but has a pretty good go anyway. Over supple beats Lo updates us on her current excitement levels (※I＊m wet through all my clothes§) before unleashing perhaps this year＊s biggest understatement: ※I know how to dial it back, not this time.§The last time we heard from U2 they＊d taken the unprecedented decision , a PR disaster of such magnitude that even Bono seemed humbled. After three years of wound-licking they＊re back with a song featuring all the things you expect from U2: a chiming guitar figure Coldplay have probably already ripped off, a stadium-ready breakdown and clunky lyrics about children being the real teachers.Pop is so confusing. One minute it＊s all ※love me harder§ 每 then, according to Clarkson, it＊s best to be soft, which if we＊re being crude seems to go against basic biology. Sadly, Love So Soft is a stinker; Clarkson＊s undeniable voice 每 which blows up a mansion in the video 每 struggling to mask the whiff of Meghan Trainor clinging to each plastic-sounding retro-fied horn blast.The cover art for Sam Smith＊s new single features a massive bunch of decaying flowers drooping on an artfully frayed tablecloth. The picture is in black and white to connote expensive, stage-managed sadness, which is basically what Too Good at Goodbyes is. The choir is lush, the production from former Mis-Teeq collaborators Stargate is slick, the voice quivers when it＊s supposed to, and yet the result is about as emotionally intoxicating as Jacob Rees-Mogg.

"nnouncing Rihanna as a keynote speaker at its prestigious fashion industry conference next month, Women＊s Wear Daily described her as a ※powerhouse multihyphenate§. This is perhaps the least clumsy way to describe what  does. As a singer, songwriter, actor, fashion designer, and 每 since the launch a week ago of Fenty Beauty 每 business mogul, the strings to Rihanna＊s bow have become unwieldy to list. Luckily, she is too famous to need a job title.Even by global megastar standards, Rihanna has had quite a week. As creative director of the sportswear company Puma, she staged an epic , complete with motocross stunts across pink glitter mountains that delighted her fans and charmed the critics. : ※Rihanna has figured out how to sprinkle just the right amount of her stardust on the sportswear brand without overshadowing the brand itself.The launch of her Fenty  range in the same week set a new standard for catering to all skin tones, with 40 shades of foundation. That the darker shades were sold out within days is a marker of Rihanna＊s power in the marketplace and the appetite for diversity in beauty that she taps into.Earlier this summer, while  was topping charts worldwide, Rihanna travelled to Paris to discuss global education with Emmanuel Macron and went from there to Barbados, where she partied in a diamant谷 headdress, fishnet tights and little else. She will not be pigeonholed, and her refusal to comply with the expectations of young black womanhood has made her a potent and unpredictable icon. In the early days of Instagram, Rihanna＊s penchant for posting selfies in which she was smoking marijuana caused frequent outrage. Eventually, as it became clear that Rihanna was either not listening to or was unmoved by the condemnation, the outrage ebbed. Rihanna＊s music is pop, but her spirit is punk. She told Essence magazine in 2015: ※Everyone＊s cool with a young black woman singing, dancing, partying and looking hot. But when it comes time to negotiate, to broker a deal, she is suddenly made aware of her blackness.§ Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born in St Michael, Barbados, on 20 February 1988. Her childhood was marred by her father＊s addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol, which contributed to her parents＊ divorce when she was in her early teens. Singing was a teenage hobby until the summer of 2003, when the girl group she had formed with two friends scored an audition with the music producer Evan Rogers, visiting the island on holiday with his Barbadian wife.Rogers later recalled: ※The minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn＊t exist. After hearing her Rihanna sing estiny＊s Child＊s Emotion and Mariah Carey＊s Hero, he set about arranging for her to make a demo tape. This made its way to Def Jam Records, where a newly appointed chief executive, a rapper called Jay-Z, heard it, and signed Rihanna to a six-album deal. In 2007, first Britney Spears and then Mary J Blige turned down a , and Rihanna＊s world changed as a result. That single turned her from a middle-tier, urban-pop artist into a megastar. The undisputed , it crashed iTunes the day downloads became available.Rihanna＊s next four studio albums all went platinum. Her songs Disturbia, Take a Bow, Only Girl (In the World), S&M, Diamonds, We Found Love and Stay have joined Umbrella in the ranks of the world＊s best-selling singles. She is the youngest solo artist to reach 14 No 1 hits and has done it faster than anyone else. Rihanna has won eight Grammy awards and has a net worth estimated at $230m (?169m). As Rihanna＊s profile grew towards the end of the previous decade, her image became increasingly arresting. With Umbrella and the album Good Girl Gone Bad came a fetish-shaded new look: leather, bra tops, bondage straps, thigh-high boots and a distinctive, provocatively sexual, heavy-lidded, head-thrown-back stance. Whips and riding crops became familiar on-stage props. The violence of the imagery was uncomfortable viewing, in the context of her , Chris Brown, in 2009. It reached its peak in the video for S&M, in 2011, in which Rihanna wore a dress with the slogans ※whore§ and ※slut§ while bound against a wall with layers of clingfilm. The video was banned in 11 countries. Rihanna told British Vogue that the look was ※not me. That＊s like a part I play. You know, like it＊s a piece of art, with all these toys and textures to play with.§ Rihanna＊s shift from sweatpant-and-sparkles popstrel to edgy, controversy-baiting sex symbol caught the attention of the fashion industry. Within six months of the S&M video, she had appeared on the covers of US and British Vogue. At that year＊s Grammys, she wore semi-transparent Jean Paul Gaultier haute couture. In Time magazine in 2012, Stella McCartney described Rihanna as ※one of the coolest, hottest, most talented, most liked, most listened to, most followed, most impressive artists at work today§. But even as her fashion connections grew to include an ambassadorship with Dior and a collaboration with Manolo Blahnik, Rihanna was pursuing yet another burgeoning career, as an actor. She starred this summer in the sci-fi film , and will appear alongside Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway and Mindy Kaling in the hotly anticipated female heist movie  next year. Tom Ford has described Rihanna＊s style as ※daring, fearless, and constantly evolving§. In the past five years, that style has evolved beyond the sledgehammer sexuality of S&M into an exuberant take on fashion that combines a willingness to experiment with a strong sense of self. Where other celebrities stick doggedly to the look a stylist has deemed right for their ※personal brand§, Rihanna has fun with her clothes.In 2014, she wore a Swarovski-crystal fishnet bodysuit with matching turban to the CFDA awards, accessorised with a nude thong and a white fur stole. The following year, her yolk-yellow Guo Pei dress for the Met Gala . (Fashion observers, however, noted that Rihanna was one of very few attendees to have honoured the Chinese theme of the exhibition by wearing a dress by a Chinese designer.) She has embraced the  with oversized puffa coats and high-necked, luridly floral dresses, and helped turn Princess Diana  by wearing her face on a T-shirt. The past year has marked Rihanna＊s transition from fashion plate to fashion leader. A year ago, she moved her Puma show to Paris, with a collection entitled ※Marie Antoinette Goes to the Gym§. This was followed, in March, by sending her models walking down the tabletops of the National Library of France in collegiate-themed streetwear. The late-night Paris fashion week event, which had the aura of the world＊s most glamorous after-school detention, garnered Rihanna＊s most favourable reviews to date. Meanwhile, her influence has been evident in how other designers have followed her lead in casting her favourite model, Slick Woods, who has appeared in every Fenty show and is the face of Fenty Beauty.At the launch party for Fenty Beauty Rihanna, dressed in a custom-made Oscar de la Renta ensemble in her now-signature shade of sunshine yellow, Rihanna emphasised the importance of inclusivity in the beauty industry. ※There needs to be something for a dark-skinned girl, there needs to be something for a really pale girl ＃ you want people to appreciate the product and not feel like: ＆Aw, that＊s cute, but it only looks good on her,＊§ she told editors. Alongside the strikingly buzz-cut, gap-toothed Woods, Rihanna has chosen the hijab-wearing model Halima Aden as a Fenty Beauty ambassador.

"his brave, intriguing concert ended with a collaboration between South Korean and English musicians who had started rehearsing together only the previous day, and developed into an almost surreal fusion experiment.On the far left of the stage was Black String＊s leader, Yoon Jeong Heo, a young exponent of the , a large, fretted zither plucked with a bamboo stick, that she said has existed for 2,000 years.

Asked in advance if she could see a connection between Northumbrian folk and Korea, Tickell said: ※There isn＊t one! But we are both female band leaders who play a traditional instrument.§ Heo said she likes to collaborate (five years ago she played here with saxophonist Tim Garland) and was surprised how easy it was to communicate. Maybe, but the two sets of musicians started off by demonstrating their differences. The concert opened with an elegant set from Tickell and Thatcher playing new and traditional tunes, ending with the poignant and then celebratory Stonehaugh, inspired by the history of a Northumberland village hall. Then on came the four members of Black String, performing by themselves, with an often frantic set that started with , a lengthy workout that started with twanging geomungo and wailing flute but developed into crashing waves of sound that built up and then subsided, with a guitar riff mixed in with the ancient influences. It was hard at first to see how Tickell would fit in, but remarkably the two sides found common ground. The collaboration began with the thoughtful and tuneful Our Kate, which was followed by a segue into Black String＊s Growth Ring, dominated by flutes and throbbing electronica. There was a return to English melody with a Korean edge for the percussive new treatment of Ettrick Reel before that extraordinary finale, Mask Dance. More rehearsal time would have been useful, but they deserved the standing ovation.   continues until 25 October.																																											"
"o one ever looked as good on a bicycle as Jacques Anquetil. The first man to win the Tour de France five times 每 in 1957 and from 1961 to 1964 每 seemed to have been manufactured in the same factory as the machines he rode, every ounce of superfluous weight pared away, streamlined to perfection and running on frictionless bearings. Frozen in motion by the still camera, he revealed an aesthetic perfection that would have brought a light to any sculptor＊s eye.On the first page of his slender memoir of devotion, Paul Fournel captures his subject＊s essence: ※Anquetil pedalled blond, with supple ankles; he pedalled on points, back bent, arms at right angles, head straining forwards ＃ He was made to be seen alone on the road, silhouetted against the blue sky; nothing about him suggested the peloton, the crowd and the strength of being united. He was cycling beauty out on its own.§He was also unloved by a large percentage of his own public. Grudgingly, they admired his pale, ultra-modern efficiency and contemporary sense of?style, but they gave their hearts to Raymond Poulidor, the representative of a more bucolic France, whose failure to conquer Anquetil year after year gave him a nickname 每 the Eternal Second 每 that would, in other circumstances, have seemed unenviable. Anquetil＊s nicknames were Ma?tre Jacques and Monsieur Chrono: the first?reflected his?seeming invincibility, the second his specific mastery of the time trial, the race in which the rider pedals alone and the enemy is the?stopwatch.The first great achievement of his career, when he was 22 and doing his year＊s military service in the army, was?to break ＊s longstanding record for the distance covered in one hour on the banked boards of a velodrome. He appeared bloodless and calculating.Fournel tells the story of a time trial in Switzerland that Anquetil won six times in a row. The organisers, fearing the stifling effect of a seventh victory, offered to pay him not to turn up. He accepted the deal. A few months later, thinking of their advance ticket sales, they thought better of it and offered him another fee, plus a third fee on top if he allowed someone else to win. He asked to be paid up front. Before the start of the race he approached the Italian champion Ercole Baldini, the best of his rivals, with a proposition: if you give me your fee, Anquetil said, I＊ll let you win. Baldini gratefully accepted the offer, and paid up. But the story was not over. ※As the weather was fine, the route beautiful and the prize money substantial,§ Fournel writes, ※he won anyway. And Baldini understood that perfectly, because he?knows how champions function.§Anquetil, the acknowledged patron of the peloton, exploited its unique protocols with expert subtlety. He gave his winning bonuses to his team mates, granting them the occasional victory in order to secure the loyalty of the men who would work for him on the most gruelling days of a three-week stage race. Fournel: ※When Anquetil gives, it?is because he has received, or he is counting on receiving, something in return.§ Anquetil: ※I told my team mates that  pays his orchestra and they play for him. My team mates are my musicians.§In an era when all the top professionals doped, Anquetil (below) believed it?would be?hypocritical to pretend otherwise. ※You can＊t ride the  on mineral water,§ he said. In 1966, towards the end of his career, when dope tests were just?being introduced, he was deprived of what would have?been his only victory in Li豕ge-Bastogne-Li豕ge, one of the great classics, when he refused to give the required urine sample 每 as did the riders who finished second and third. At the?time, it seemed like an?affront to their metier. ※We are men, not horses,§ he?said.He used his winnings to buy big American cars and a grand house in?his native Normandy. Sponsors proudly exploited his image in their advertisements. But, paradoxically, it was he who turned out to be the bucolic one. At the Ch?teau des Elfes he looked after his farm, raised cattle, tended crops, drove his beloved tractor. Nor, to say the least, was his life lacking in emotion. His wife, the glamorous blond Janine, brought a son and a daughter, Alain and Annie, from her previous marriage. Some years later, when she had proved unable to have further children, Anquetil fathered a daughter with the 18-year-old Annie, at her mother＊s suggestion and with her cheerful consent. Jacques would later have?another child, this time with?Alain＊s wife. Despite the occasional outbreak of jealousy, he remained the nexus of the family＊s affections.He retired in 1969. ※The bike isn＊t?and never has been my greatest concern,§ he had said. ※I?really think that I don＊t,?have never,?and will never love?the bike.§ Nevertheless he would leave his farm to manage the?French team and became a perceptive commentator on the Tour de France for television, radio and sports newspaper L＊?quipe before his death from stomach cancer in 1987, aged 53.Fournel is a student of , a leading light of the Oulipo literary workshop and a prize-winner in 1989 for . Unlike two previous English-language biographies 每 Richard?Yates＊s  (2001) and Paul Howard＊s excruciatingly titled? (2008) 每 the elegantly produced  makes no claim to a?detailed career analysis.

"omparisons have been drawn between ＊s latest novel, ＊s  and?＊s . All three are tales involving great wealth and a great downfall, and all three share a narrator who is not the protagonist, who is peripheral to the action, but yearns to be part of it. Rushdie＊s Ren谷 Unterlinden, the twentysomething son of Belgian academics, lives in the same New York garden square as Nero Golden and his three sons and watches their world with growing fascination. In a book replete with filmic references, this setting owes more than a nod to ＊s .At the centre of the novel is the story of Nero, whose often silent presence flows like a great river off which branch the stories of his three sons. The Goldens pitch up one day out of the blue, take up residence in a house maintained as an anonymous holding, and refuse to reveal anything of their origins. Ren谷, a would-be film-maker, decides they are the perfect subject for a film, a ※mockumentary§ as he puts it, in which he is free to imagine what is going on when he isn＊t there. It＊s an ingenious conceit, which gives Rushdie much greater scope as a writer than if he restricted himself (and us) to Ren谷＊s viewpoint. It also mirrors the way we all see our neighbours, with only partial access to their lives; what we cannot see, we amuse ourselves by imagining.The book begins with the election of Barack Obama and ends eight years later on the eve of an election in which the lead contender refers to himself as ※the Joker§. Nero＊s character contains echoes of Trump, too; he is a man of fabulous wealth, with a beautiful Russian wife, and a fortune thought to be in part built on real estate. The novel＊s transnational supporting cast includes an Australian hypnotist; a Burmese diplomat; Ivy Manuel, a night-club singer; a Somalian artist; and Nero＊s assistants, Fuss and Blather. As the election nears, America is deeply divided. ※It was a year of two bubbles,§ Ren谷 muses. ※In one of those bubbles, the Joker shrieked and the laugh-track crowd laughed right on queue.§ In that bubble, ※knowledge was ignorance, up?was down and the right person to hold the nuclear codes was the green-skinned red-slashed-mouthed giggler§. Thus, by the book＊s end, the bubble of New York is where reality perseveres.The Goldens arrive having fled an unknown city 每 later revealed to be Bombay/Mumbai 每 as well as an unknown threat, but seem unable to escape their destiny. At the centre of each character＊s predicament lies the question of identity. Here Rushdie puts his finger on the existential crisis of our times and presses down hard. The Goldens are immigrants, refugees of a?sort, who have abandoned their ties to their natal country and chosen new names for themselves, names that morph into newer forms in the months following their arrival. The eldest son, newly named Petronius, is known as Petya; Lucius Apuleis becomes Apu; and Dionysus is D. For himself the patriarch portentously takes the name Nero, ill-fated emperor of Rome.In New York they reinvent themselves, or try to. But with the arrival of the new wife, Vasilisa, the sons leave the family home one by one, only to become unmoored in the vastness of the city. D, the youngest, doesn＊t know whether he is a man or a?woman, or a?woman with a penis. Here Rushdie delves, with considerable courage, into?the ever-shifting sands of modern sexual identity, which obsess millennials and baffle older generations. D＊s girlfriend Riya works at the fictional Museum of Identity, and it is she who persuades him to seek a new sexual self. ※You can choose who you want to be,§ she tells him. ※Sexual identity is not a given. It＊s a choice.§Apu, Nero＊s middle son, a handsome, successful artist, suffers the hollow loss of the exile, and longs to return to the land of his birth 每 only to do so with devastating consequences. Petya develops agoraphobia, finding peace and safety behind the closed doors of his room and in the fabricated world of computer games. In this doomed family, Petya alone seems capable of finding salvation, when he finally breaks free of his self-imposed isolation. And there providing the commentary to the tragedy, witness to it all, is Ren谷, who insinuates himself first into the family and gradually into the centre of their unfolding drama. is not  or  每 it is too rich and too riotous. Rather it is a modern , New York seen from the inside and the outside, as only a writer of multiple selves such as Rushdie 每 Indian, British, now a New Yorker 每 could do. It is a novel about the many bubbles of the United States, written by somebody who has never had the luxury of living in one. His is a hard-won wisdom. ※To be plural, to be multiform, is a singular thing,§ says Riya in her resignation letter from the Museum of Identity. The notion of identity as overlapping and many-layered is something with which large sections of white America are grappling, in a?nationwide identity crisis: they thought they knew who they were, only to discover their sense of self has increasingly relied on telling others what they weren＊t.There is no escaping destiny, Rushdie seems to be saying, because character creates destiny. This is as true of an individual as it is of a country. Nero is smart, entrepreneurial, charming and quick-witted. He is also corrupt, greedy and ruthless, unable and unwilling to curb those tendencies: thus he is the architect of his own downfall.After reading a book so full of references to Greek mythology, Aesop＊s fable of the scorpion and the frog comes to mind. A?scorpion persuades the frog to carry it across the water. The frog asks: ※But how do I know you won＊t sting me?§ ※Because then we will both die,§ says the scorpion 每 but stings him anyway. ※Why?§ gasps the frog, as they both sink beneath the water. ※It＊s my nature,§ replies the scorpion.

"he traditional indie rock band is alive and well, certainly up north, where Manchester＊s Courteeners and Stockport＊s Blossoms play to football match-sized crowds. The fast-rising Sherlocks seem to be next in line.Their debut album, Live for the Moment, crashed into the charts at No 6 a fortnight ago despite being thoroughly ignored by mainstream media. The band have the sort of backstory that is often presumed extinct. Two sets of brothers from unfashionable Bolton upon Dearne, near Barnsley, formed on their estate and slogged their way upward via a thousand gigs. Appearances with the Libertines and Kings of Leon and on Sky＊s Soccer AM have generated an army of boisterous fans who are 每 as Liam Gallagher used to say 每 ※mad for it§.They sing along with songs over the PA, get particularly shouty to anything by Blossoms or Oasis and cause such a commotion to the Sherlocks＊ unlikely intro tape 每 Pigbag＊s 1982 avant funk stomper  每 that someone should rerelease it pronto. The Sherlocks themselves aren＊t bringing funky brass constructions to the dancefloor, but their chunkily anthemic indie rock certainly thrills this audience. Lyrics such as ※Where are you gonna go when you leave home?§ give their young fans something to relate to while the tunes and Josh Davidson＊s sparkling guitar lines make them raise pint glasses in the air.Songs such as Nobody Knows sound so much like the young Arctic Monkeys that telling them apart may require a DNA test, but 每 as the scattering of older fans might argue 每 the other South Yorkshiremen haven＊t sounded like themselves for a decade. There＊s plenty of the early Alex Turner about schoolboyish frontman Kiaran Crook, whose words have a similar grouchy, bittersweet, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning outlook.  he asks ruefully, which the crowd answer with a massed handclap and chant of ※＊ere we fucking go.§It＊s not always subtle, but the lovely Turn the Clock shows that they can be delicate and Motions puts a postmodern spin on skiffle. The crowd remove and twirl their tops and take up Live for the Moment＊s lyrics (※So please don＊t try and run before you can walk§) like a manifesto. The album has already exited the Top 100, but the Sherlocks are not going to go away.																																											"
"nother week, another pair of deaths of popular-culture figures 每 the actor  and the musician  每 and another wave of public grief for their loss. Once again my social media feeds have been filled with mourning and heartfelt testimonials to the effect these men had on the lives of so many, through films, TV shows, records, concerts.It＊s often suggested that the death of Diana, a shade over 20 years ago, is what triggered the public willingness to mourn complete strangers who had never been more than a presence on the screen in the corner of the living room. Perhaps, though, there＊s another reason for the grief: people are mourning something closer to home.Modern popular culture was an invention of the 1950s, refined in the 1960s, and expanded in every decade since. Rock＊n＊roll music and television exploded hand in hand in the 1950s. In January 1956, the first year for which figures are available, ; by January 1960 that figure had almost doubled, to 11m. By January 1970 16.9m out of 18.4m UK households owned a television. In the US, 9% of households owned a TV in 1950; by 1960 it had reached 87.1%.It didn＊t take long for television to become not just a presence in the household, but part of household life. As early as 1958, an  found children were watching an average of 11 to 13 hours of TV per week. And it turned out that TV and pop music were made for each other: by 1958 the US pop music show American Bandstand was drawing 40 million viewers a week, and was being serenaded in song: ※They＊ll be rockin＊ on Bandstand, in Philadelphia PA,§ sang .At the same time, the structure of the home was changing. In 1955, 45.9% of UK women of working age were in the workforce in one way or another, and 38.3% of US women. In 1965 those figures had risen to 51% and 44.4%. Another decade on and they were 55.1% and 53.2%. The parents weren＊t at home, but the kids were, and the TV and the radio and the record player were.In effect, those born in the 1950s and 1960s were the first generations to be co-parented by popular culture. They were the people, who as Bruce Springsteen put it in , ※learned more from a three-minute record, baby, than we ever learned in school§. They drew life lessons not from fireside chats with parents, but from David Bowie or Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell. They were entertained not by parlour games, but by . When they wanted to understand why they felt as they did during adolescence, they didn＊t speak to their families, they listened to , or whoever answered their particular need.They did so in homes in which, often, both parents were absent much of the time. Millions of kids spent more time with pop stars and film stars and TV stars than with their parents. (Not for nothing were the children＊s TV presenters of the 1960s and 1970s usually presented as surrogate parents, like  on Blue Peter, rather than the matey older siblings of the late 1980s and onwards) They were also the first generations for whom adulthood was deferred, by the expansion of education, by the postponement of marriage. There was no pressure on them to loosen their bonds with the people they had grown up listening to or watching.Maybe, then, when people seem unusually grief-stricken at the death of an entertainer, they are mourning not that star, but something closer. They are, perhaps, connecting that loss with the death of a parent, or subconsciously preparing for a death yet to come. They have lost part of their family. One friend said of her reaction to Bowie＊s death: ※I knew it was to do with him really being a strong father/godfather figure, a constant kind, creative voice in my head.§Another said of Prince: ※I felt a bit embarrassed at how Prince＊s passing touched me. I really felt that I＊d been on a journey with him from my early teens. It made me think of my mum a lot; she really couldn＊t stand him.§And one more: ※People of our generation were first to ＆know＊ TV celebrities. I grieved for  as much as I did my grandparents. Sad to report.§In a celebrity death, I think, what many of us see is not the end of a career, or even a life. We are seeing the impermanence of our own certainties, our own families. We are reminded how fragile is the edifice on which our life and identity are built. Michael Hann is a former music editor of the Guardian																																											"
"he good news about is that despite being a cliche of Americana, it＊s genuinely breathtaking. Spectacular, actually, especially against a bright blue sky with clouds as fluffy as George Washington＊s hair.The bad news is that you can＊t clamber all over the giant sculpture, getting up Teddy Roosevelt＊s nose or hiding in Abraham Lincoln＊s beard as if you＊re in Alfred Hitchcock＊s 1959 thriller North by Northwest. They just don＊t let tourists get that close.But the views from the approach roads and public paths are great nonetheless, and it＊s an obvious place to start a visit to .On first thought, South Dakota might appear too big and too obscure a state for a week＊s vacation. But that＊s where Hitchcock and Hollywood come in handy. Pick from decades of movies set in South Dakota and you＊ll find legendary towns, incredible wildlife and tumultuous history, all within easy driving range.Think of Dances With Wolves, Little Big Man, How the West Was Won, Calamity Jane, Hidalgo, Badlands, Thunderheart 每 all the anti-westerns, crime thrillers and murder mysteries. They make an excellent, if eccentric, unofficial travel guide.There is a notable exception. For reasons to be examined later, you can ignore The Revenant, despite Leonardo DiCaprio＊s Oscar-winning turn as a mountain man mauled by a bear in South Dakota, whose tale of human survival became a legend.So. Start in Rapid City, which is small and does not move rapidly, but where some good food and the performing and fine arts can be found. Check off Mount Rushmore and the nearby Crazy Horse Memorial of a figure on horseback being slowly carved into another mountain. Crazy Horse was one of the great Lakota Native American leaders who, along with the Nakota and the Dakota, comprise the First Nation the US came to call the Sioux.From the mountains, head for buffalo country.The buffalo, also known as bison, were almost extinct by 1900 but just about hung on, and can now be seen wandering in certain parts of South Dakota 每 if you know where to look.Driving south from Mount Rushmore is already a lovely experience of meandering country roads, meadows, forests and craggy hills with fantastic overlooks. And on the aptly named Wildlife Loop road I saw my first buffalo of the trip, staring at me placidly from the edge of the woods.Eager to see more, I ventured on a whim up a random dirt side road, not far from Wind Cave national park, and hit the bison jackpot. A mile or two along the track, I pulled over and saw dozens of buffalo lumbered over the brow of a tree-lined hill.Their aroma pungent and with dust falling from their thick coats, they tramped right by the car towards the setting sun, huffing and snorting as they went. It seems unexpected to find them in woodland, but it＊s a miracle they are here at all.To the east of Rapid City, the flat landscape that leads to the Badlands is dotted with old homesteads and ghost towns amid modern farms and ranches.Out of level terrain, a 50-mile wall of jagged rock suddenly rears up, dividing the prairie with a wide, high rocky barrier, where it＊s searing hot all summer and devoid of water and shade (hence the name). The area＊s a national park now and it makes for a weird hiking experience. In the past, it was a dreaded obstacle for wagon trains.This was also where the Lakota tried to escape from the advancing US army in 1890 but were pursued south to a barren place where their last hope of resisting the white man died in the massacre at Wounded Knee, where hundreds of Lakota men, women and children were shot in cold blood. The 1992 movie Thunderheart, with Val Kilmer and Graham Greene, is set in the Badlands, are both good for scenery and insight.As a visitor to the Badlands now, there＊s a bleak allure to the topography, especially when sunrise and sunset bring out the orange and red layers of the rocky pinnacles and bighorn sheep are silhouetted on the tops of little buttes.Hiking into the heart of the outcrop is just freaky. Hot as hell, dry as a bone and full of rattlesnakes. But somehow the remoteness and tranquility are calming.Or, I was calm, until a large snake in the tough grass beside the narrow trail reared up and shook its rattle at me angrily. I leapt into the air with a shriek. The warning signs posted at the trailheads aren＊t joking.Beside the road circling the park, it＊s easy to spot pronghorn antelope and thousands of prairie dogs. There are even small owls, which live in abandoned prairie dog burrows and sit next to the holes in broad daylight, staring unblinkingly at the passing motorists. You can experience both sides of the American coin in the Badlands. On the north side is the tiny, tourist trap town of Wall with its locally-famouslabyrinthine drug store full of trashy food and souvenirs. And just a few miles away at the Minuteman Missile site, now a national historic site with a visitor center, you can see where fingers were poised above nuclear triggers, ready to dispatch ICBMs from silos during the cold war.The south side is a sharp contrast 每 miles of inhospitable land where the routed Lakota were bundled on to reservations. There are few attractions there and the impoverished towns are dispiriting. But on a lonely rise near Pine Ridge and the Nebraska border is an evocative spot. Here stands a pathetic, ragtag little cemetery that＊s about the only memorial to the Wounded Knee massacre. Oddly, Johnny Depp  in 2013, around the time of his controversial outing as Tonto in the Lone Ranger, that he wanted to buy the Wounded Knee site and give it to the Lakota. But it＊s never happened.※Their land was lost to them, replaced by the wretchedness of the reservation, and the buffalo were all gone,§ reads a quote from the book Spirit of the Plains People, which is printed prominently on a display board in the Prairie Edge store in Rapid City, which sells excellent Native American arts and crafts from the region.The remote hilltop at Wounded Knee and the surrounding Pine Ridge Reservation are certainly a far cry from the lush Black Hills mountains further north, where the Lakota used to roam freely.※Take me back to the Black Hills, the Black Hills of Dakota, to the beautiful Indian country that I love,§ Doris Day sang sweetly in the title role of the 1953 classic Calamity Jane. Or was it ※that I stole§?When gold had been discovered in the Black Hills in the early 1870s, prospectors, gunslingers, soldiers, hucksters and bandits had driven the Lakota out ruthlessly.Your heart may bleed at the travesty even as you can＊t resist retracing the steps of Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok to the bars and casinos of the Black Hills canyon town of Deadwood, where they lived it up, died and are buried in a large, leafy cemetery on a hill above main street.If Doris Day＊s screen number is too dated and ridiculous to whet your appetite, think instead of HBO＊s dramatic series that simply took the title, Deadwood. The cult TV hit was brutally killed off a decade ago at the end of its third season. But legions of fans are still wistful for its raw depiction of a potty-mouthed, drunken Jane and her ilk in the poker dens of the feral town. Recent  of a big screen version  to die.Wild West tourist schlock notwithstanding, hiking in the vast area covered by the Black Hills is superb. There＊s even a sign down one tiny road near the town of Spearfish that declares that scenes from Dances With Wolves were shot there, even though most of the action in that movie takes place on the plain.And so to The Revenant. Here＊s the thing. The movie interprets the real life story of Hugh Glass, who was almost killed by a bear while on a trapping expedition near what is now Lemmon in northern South Dakota. He was abandoned by his fellows and defied death by crawling a hundred miles then rafting down a river towards safety. It＊s an extraordinary tale, graphically depicted on the silver screen amid sumptuous scenery. The problem is, all that gorgeous countryside was  in Canada and Argentina, not South Dakota. And a quick Google search showed me that the journey from Deadwood to Lemmon would be long, with nothing very interesting to see or do when I got there, and not worth the pilgrimage.What to do instead? No-brainer. I turned to a different page, figuratively, from my unofficial Hollywood handbook and drove a short way into eastern Wyoming, to Devils Tower. This huge rock formation has always been beloved but became world famous when depicted as the landing site for the alien spaceship at the climax of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.In the decades since that 1977 mega-hit, Devils Tower could easily have become Disneyfied and there are plenty of green-alien fridge magnets to buy around there. But the rock itself is protected as a national monument so it＊s relatively unadulterated 每 and out of this world. And it was such an easy, pleasant drive back to Rapid City.Even after a busy week I＊d barely seen a fraction of South Dakota, which covers a daunting 77,000-plus square miles.But with a population under a million and the vast majority of it flat as a pancake, I knew I＊d seen the most interesting fraction. The camera doesn＊t lie.																																											"
"hat is the basic unit of comedy performance? As comedy festivals spring up nationwide, as the Edinburgh fringe expands annually and spawns ever more touring comics, the hour-long solo show has started to feel like the art form＊s default setting. But it isn＊t. As any casual comedy watcher 每 the occasional visitor to their local club; the magpie  viewer 每 will tell you, standup is usually served in 20-minute chunks. The Greenwich comedy festival, now eight years old, celebrates this species of comedy. Over five days, in the grounds of the National Maritime Museum, the country＊s higher-end acts (, Alan Davies, ) rub shoulders in a tent. Much is made in comedy of the progression from club set to full show. Some acts take years honing the skills, or plucking up the courage, to make the leap. But what of the leap in the other direction? On Saturday in Greenwich, I watched three acts who I usually see in long-form mode. Of course, you＊d expect comics such as  and  to be excellent whatever the time slot. But what sacrifices do they make when they don＊t have time to develop an argument? What routes do they take to a faster, flightier kind of laugh? Christie＊s set concertinas her standup career, offering anecdotes from her years as a clownish character comic plus extracts from her Brexit show  and caustic domestic material to boot. Her leaving-the-EU material lambasts Cameron, Johnson and Gove for their responsibility, and frequently collapses into gibbering abuse. That＊s not a criticism. Christie＊s very funny shtick is her inability to keep a lid on the impotent fury. She creates neat little vessels for her anti-Brexit opinions (the horticultural metaphor; ※the Ladybird Book of Brexit§), but all of them collapse finally under the weight of her irrepressible dismay. Probably there＊s no safer ground than the Greenwich comedy festival for this distraught remainer material. But 每 unlike when audiences come to see her and her alone 每 Christie can＊t take that for granted. So her other 10 minutes move on to more relatable territory. Relatable but not agreeable. She opens by telling us how boring her children are; then there＊s a standout routine about her depressing marriage that blandly transcribes a conversation about what food to salvage from the fridge and have for tea. It＊s deliciously teasing stuff, a game of chicken with our expectations of motherly or wifely love. On the basis of this mixed bill alone, you won＊t go far wrong in club comedy if you harp on domestic disharmony. Opener , who has turned the social awkwardness and emotional damage borne of an Eton education into the stuff of a promising standup career, majors on a recent holiday he took with his mum and dad. It was all going well until they spotted him masturbating through the frosted glass walls of the bathroom. Headliner Dylan Moran dedicates much of his set to the undignified role he plays in his own family life 每 cowed and apologetic in his wife＊s company, a massive irrelevance to his kids. You may not want to watch a whole show of Moran playing the beleaguered husband and dad. Probably, across two hours plus, he wouldn＊t deliver one. (American fans can find out this week: he＊s off on .) But here, Moran elevates familiar material with his trademark rumpled lyricism and the sense that this elegiac midlife comedy derives from deep thinking about what actually matters in our lives. There is nothing glib about the Irishman＊s standup, which 每 for all the sozzled playing style 每 looks, clear-eyed, at the mores of modern existence in general and his own existence in particular. ※You look at your life, and it looks back and makes faces at you,§ he says, wondering with more amusement than alarm how he became so meek, so ※unknowably bland§. There＊s a lovely forensic routine about strategies for conciliation after 每 horror of horrors 每 he finds himself being inadvertently honest with his wife. Another joke marvels at the constant entertainment available to his kids, as opposed to his own youth, fondly remembered, when ※there was fuck-all, freely available to all§. These couldn＊t be more mainstream topics for standup, but Moran ensures they seldom feel secondhand. Meanwhile, the image of an ageing softie is intriguingly offset by his exchange with a woman filming the gig from the stalls, which is skilful and stinging in equal measure. It＊s a matter of taste whether you＊d choose this wham-bam club-comedy format, which foregrounds one-off gags over cumulative power, variety over depth of engagement 每 and, broadly speaking, consensuality over risk. With its bill of big-hitting acts, the Greenwich comedy festival provides several enjoyable occasions to go short form, and few can have been more enjoyable than this.

"orn Belinda Magnus in Romford, London, then renamed Pauline Vickers by her adoptive parents, chose her stage name when she co-founded 2-Tone ska band the Selecter in 1979. Soon the band had a hit with On My Radio, and Black earned the nickname Queen of Ska. The group split in 1982 after making two albums, but have re-formed a number of times. Black has acted in films, TV and theatre; her role as Billie Holiday in  won her the 1991 Time Out best actress award. In 2011 she released her memoir, . The Selecter＊s new album, is released on 6 October by DMF Records.This is based on unfinished manuscript, . Samuel Jackson＊s narration intercuts seamlessly with Baldwin speaking. The message to white folks in America is: ※I am not your Negro. If you call me that, that＊s your problem.§ Baldwin takes apart the whole notion of the N-word, and says that as a black person you can＊t live the American dream; what you＊re living is a nightmare. I had the privilege of meeting Baldwin in 1985 每 he was a lovely man, but one of those people that can see right through you 每 you＊d better come with your best game.I suppose it＊s a bit strange that I should like what is essentially a male fashion line, but somehow it＊s a non-gender thing 每 I really love that 60s slimline trouser look: suits, a hat, the accessories. Avec Ces Freres represent everything I like about fashion 每 edgy cool, hats. My favourite item I got from them is a jacket I wear on stage. Under the lapels it＊s embroidered and it says ※punk tailoring§; you can wear it with lapels up or down, so it＊s eminently adaptable. And their tailoring is just exquisite.I was slightly disappointed that for the first few rooms you heard Martin Luther King＊s ※I have a dream§ speech 每 I felt like you were going into a place that was full of struggle, sometimes armed struggle, and that speech appeals so much more to a white narrative of the civil rights movement. But overall  was stunning and I learned a lot. It＊s rare to see photography of black people by black people. White photographers invariably put me against a white background, but here black faces were against dark backgrounds, therefore the face emerged, like the moon coming out at night. It gave a completely different aesthetic.The Selecter and Blondie go way back 每 we shared a record company at one point, and we supported them at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1980. I met  again in France about four years ago, and we just sat in our dressing room like two older ladies of music, and sized each other up, which was quite an entertaining experience. I got an invite to their show in London a few months ago, and it was wonderful to see them after all these years: to see how the songs you knew way back when had developed, and how they＊re still writing new material and staying current. That was a particularly special thing for me this year.I kept seeing the poster and eventually sussed out it wasn＊t just the face of a young black man, but a composite of three stages of his life. I found that so intriguing, and decided I＊d watch the movie. It was entrancing from the first frame. It＊s a wonderful story of a young gay black man in America, and how he dealt with the unfortunate lifestyles of the people he was surrounded by. The scene where the two young men come together in the moonlight was so excellently played, so gentle, it was poetic. It thoroughly deserved the Oscar.Berkeley campus is one of those places that has loomed large in my consciousness ever since I heard about the student anti-war protests there in the 60s. The Selecter were out there supporting Rancid and the Dropkick Murphys last month and it was the first time I＊d been to Berkeley, so I took myself to all those places, like Telegraph Avenue. The campus is kind of strange, full of old sculptures and Greek pillars dotted about. We played at the Greek, which is a fantastic place 每 an amphitheatre, just carved into this rising grassy slope.I＊m not into apps, but my watch broke and someone said: ※Why don＊t you get an Apple Watch? There＊s an excellent exercise app on it.§ Well, I am 63 now and still getting up on stage and doing active things 每 you have to keep reasonably fit. Since I＊ve had this watch I＊ve been out walking, running, bike riding and goodness knows what. I can even do a gig and see exactly how many calories I＊ve burnt, what my heart rate was. It＊s the ultimate motivation to do some exercise, and cheaper than a gym.																																											"
"＊s ninth novel is a story in which nothing is ever quite as it seems: characters confound those closest to them with shocking secrets; supernatural hauntings morph into real-world horror; and the dead haunt the living in ways more disturbing than a ghost story.Set in London＊s theatreland in 1947, the wardrobe mistress of the title is newly widowed Joan Grice. Her husband, Charlie 每 ※Gricey§ 每 had been a famous actor, and their psychologically fragile daughter, Vera, is following in his footsteps.What begins as a novel about grief manifesting itself in paranormal fantasies takes on a more sinister edge when Joan uncovers Gricey＊s political past, leading the novel into explorations of fascism, antisemitism and how a fractured nation endeavours to rebuild itself from the rubble of war.McGrath has a  fiction and there are elements of that here too, not least Joan＊s terrifying experiences inside her husband＊s wardrobe, which, for a time, she believes holds Gricey＊s spirit: ※She heard a different noise now. The clothes on the rail were shaking as the hangers, all wooden, began clanking against each other, and she was aware too of the rustle of agitated fabric. She turned, bewildered.§Part of the skill in  comes from the omniscient narration in the form of a Greek chorus, at turns scathing and gossipy, confiding and judgmental: ※We saw her in the pub around this time. We thought we should take her out, cheer her up. There were a few of us she knew, old friends＃ We knew what she was thinking about, it was Gricey, of course, who all that time had had a secret, and herself practically the only one who didn＊t know it because nobody wanted to be the one to tell her. Well, why would we?§ McGrath＊s dexterity in maintaining the authenticity of the narrative voice allows a satisfying and intimate immersion in the novel.Joan is a marvellous creation, both haughty and vulnerable, proud and lonely. ※We＊ve heard Joan Grice called a beautiful woman. A striking-looking woman, certainly, and a formidable one. Her hair was black and without a thread of silver. She wore it pulled back with some severity from her face, the better, it was said, to come at the world like a scythe.§ Joan＊s grief prompts a reliance on ※Uncle Alcohol§, the bottle she keeps stashed on top of a kitchen cupboard that gradually finds a home closer to the kitchen table in scenes that exude a quiet poignancy. But it is not until the revelation of Gricey＊s secret halfway through the novel that McGrath pulls the reader＊s sympathies firmly in Joan＊s direction.McGrath writes with stylistic precision: ※They sat close together gazing at the flickering coals, while about them the dim bulb crackled in its stiff linen shade all veined in black, and hanging from a twisted cord, as the clock ticked.§ Descriptions of theatrical life are beautifully evoked; scenes of political and personal confrontation are visceral and affecting. is vivid and multi-layered: as a gothic story, it is replete with suspense and an unnerving sense of the macabre; as a study of the insidious nature of political ideologies it is chilling and apposite; and as a story about the effects of grief, it is perceptive, probing deeply into the human psyche to reveal it in all its serpentine complexity.by Patrick McGrath is published by Hutchinson (?14.99).

"Graham and Jo Atkins-Hughes started hiring out their home for photo and film shoots about 15 years ago when they sensed a new trend.※People started shooting what is now referred to as lifestyle photography 每 with less set-up, houses that looked real,§ he recalls. ※We were riding the beginning of that wave of change.§ He is a photographer and his wife was a stylist then, so ※we had inside knowledge of what kind of spaces the industry was looking for§.The couple bought a four-storey Victorian terraced house in Hackney, east London, as a family home but set it up as a shoot location from the start 每 which has become a growing trend. Several walls were taken out to make it easier for big film crews to move around. The interior was painted in dark colours 每 an aesthetic decision, he says, but ※it just happened that it worked as a shoot location§.Agencies say that film companies and magazines scouting for locations want a distinctive look 每 whether it＊s a council flat or a stately home. Unusual features such as a big mural, lovely fireplace or pink bathroom may catch their eye.People renting out their homes can expect to make ?300 to ?500 a day for a photo or documentary shoot (fashion shoots are often paid for by the photographer) and ?2,000 to ?5,000 a day for a feature film. There are about 45 agencies in the UK that typically take a 20% to 30% cut of the fees.Kell Gatherer, a director at Location Works, an agency with more than 4,000 properties that can be hired for shoots on its books, says: ※There is a lot of demand for locations that look ordinary. If it is an advert for a washing powder it might be a pretty ordinary home they are looking for.§He says one recent shoot arranged by the agency was at a house with a wishing well in the garden, while another for a charity featured a ※house that looked like it could belong to elderly people§.But even an ordinary home needs to have plenty of space and natural light 每 for example, an open-plan kitchen每living room so the crew can be in the living room while filming in the kitchen. Crew sizes vary between five to 10 for a photo shoot and from 20 to 40 for an advert or feature film.Daniel Garry, manager at the London agency Shootfactory, says: ※There is definitely demand for normal properties, but you need good access, good light, good size rooms.※A very small two-up, two-down terraced property is not of interest, but for the average family home there is demand. A cameraman would need to be able to pull back to shoot a living room.§While some homeowners warn that shoots can be very disruptive, there is the thrill of seeing their house featured in glossy magazines, TV ads or even movies 每 and perhaps meeting the odd celebrity.An episode of  was shot at the Atkins-Hughes house along with ads or commercials for Mulberry, Agent Provocateur, British Vogue and Marie Claire; and celebrities including Kylie Minogue, Penelope Cruz and Joan Collins have made an appearance over the years. Graham Atkins-Hughes is blas谷 about this. ※You don＊t really get to meet them. You might pass them on the stairs.§His two sons, aged 9 and 11, get frustrated sometimes because they cannot roam freely through the house during filming, but the couple have kept the top floor private.Jo Atkins-Hughes now manages the property as a shoot location. Shoots can be a nice little earner, but when they become more frequent, dealing with film or photographic crews becomes a full-time job, says Atkins-Hughes. ※Most people come to the house to look at the space first before booking it. If you have a film shoot sometimes they come to look at the house several times. These recces do take up a lot of time.§Josh Jones is the chief executive and co-founder of JJ Media, which has 2,000 homes on its books and collects about ?120,000 in fees a year for homeowners. He says: ※Shooting on location is more cost effective than ever before. Over the last few years we＊ve seen a huge spike in demand for normal homes.§ This is partly driven by the proliferation of TV cookery shows and online food channels.JJ Media has recently set up a new agency, JJ Connect, based on the Airbnb model. Homeowners pay an upfront fee of ?5 a month or ?50 a year to list their property, but there is no commission on bookings, as they deal with clients directly. The fee includes listing and guidance support and contract templates in a similar style to Airbnb.As well as people＊s homes, warehouses and industrial spaces are in demand as makeshift studios or event spaces. The UK film industry is booming, which means many studios are booked out. Lorna Gatherer-Ford, managing director of Location Works, says: ※Film companies want somewhere they can create a studio 每 a big hangar with high ceilings.§Dereliction is particularly popular, she says, but it is increasingly difficult to find big derelict spaces because they quickly get knocked down and rebuilt. Some people, she says, even try to create a distressed look in their homes by deliberately ageing the walls.Pick an agency and send them photos of your home (without people and pets). You can list with several agencies. Some offer a photography service. Many owners also promote their property on Instagram or their own website.What makes a good location? ※A building that looks a particular way, whether derelict or stylish. You want it to make a statement. Something that stands out: bright pink or dark curtains,§ says Lorna Gatherer-Ford at Location Works. Bright colours are popular, as are white and modern interiors. Be prepared for several visits from film crews before they commit to a shoot.Get a contract (through the agency) that sets out what the crew can and cannot do in your home and ensures that they will restore it to its original condition after the shoot. Any damage is paid for by the client＊s insurers.Ideally, someone should be there on filming day, though some owners leave in the morning and return in the evening. If you are there during the shoot, don＊t get in the way of the cameras.Check if there are regulations that may restrict hiring out your house for shoots, such as parking restrictions.Graham Atkins-Hughes says: ※You need to have a flexible personality, be easygoing and like having a tidy house.§																																											"
"This is a photo of my parents, Hansi and Bill Barrett, taken outside their home in Leeds. Our mother always waved goodbye to family and friends, whether they had just popped in or had been to stay. In about 1985, their good friend Val decided to record this ritual, including my father, who must have been cajoled into joining in.To Hansi, saying goodbye was as?important as saying hello. Her welcomes were warm and engaging and her farewells were an extension of that welcome, sending us off with love and support. Yet they were also tinged with a little sadness. My mother was born in Vienna and came to Britain as a?Jewish refugee in 1939, aged 17. By then she had already witnessed the disappearance of friends, who had either escaped over the border in secret or had been taken to prison. She never knew which. Her parents were not practising Jews and their nanny often took Hansi and her sister, Trude, to the?local Catholic church. That was irrelevant to the authorities. As antisemitism in Vienna grew throughout the 30s, they began to ask each morning, ※Shall we be together tonight? Or will one of us disappear?§Saying goodbye was even harder when they came to leave Austria. Cousins begged them for help to get out, but war was declared and for the rest of her life, my mother held a trace of guilt. Our family has photos of little girls who perished. Fortunately, Hansi, Trude and their mother all received sponsorship as servants in London.But my grandfather, with thousands of others, found himself in Shanghai, where he spent the war in a refugee camp, having been offered a job in northern China that fell through. He never saw my grandmother again because, despite my mother＊s efforts, he came to Britain too late to see her. She died of cancer in 1946.My mother was fortunate to be taken in as an au pair in a family of Quakers who helped set up a club for refugees at their local meeting house. There, she met, and later married, Bill Barrett who was a conscientious objector working as a farm labourer. Among Quakers, she found a circle of support and a way of being that transcended religious affiliation, where the silent worship and acceptance of all, was balm amid the confusion and fear of war. The essence of Quaker belief is that each person is precious and unique, and to deliberately kill anyone is absolute cruelty. She became a campaigner for peace and justice, read the Guardian almost every day till she died aged 90, often referring to it as ※my Guardian§.Recently, my sister and I went to Vienna to retrace some of her steps. We?discovered that the family leather business is a shoe shop and the cafe near their flat still serves delicious Viennese tarts and cakes. At the opera house, we heard , which is about love overcoming cruelty and, as we sat in the Gods, where she used to go, I wondered how people could hate one another and yet listen to this sublime music together.At the Quaker memorial meeting after Hansi＊s funeral, friends of all ages spoke, one after the other, about her capacity for deep and lasting friendship. With humility, kindness, humour and warmth, she saw our foibles and our gifts. One person summed up what everyone felt, when he said, ※Hansi would open the door and I would immediately feel special, just the person she wanted most to see at that moment. She remembered what we had been talking about last time, what we were doing and what might be on my mind now.§Through her life experience, she had learned to treasure each friendship. Her farewells were an extension of her welcomes, sending us off with a sense of continuing connection that we could carry with us till we met again.Grease a large casserole dish, then peel, core and slice the apples into the dish; the slices should be about the size of chunky thumbnails. Mix in the?two tablespoons of sugar and the cinnamon.To make the crumble, sieve the flour?into a mixing bowl and rub in the?margarine until you get a flaky consistency. Mix in the dark brown sugar and salt, and spoon the mixture evenly over the apples. Bake in a preheated oven at 190C/375F/gas mark?5 for an hour. Serve hot with custard, cream or ice-cream (or vegan equivalent). In the unlikely event of leftovers, these can be enjoyed cold the following day.Growing up in the 1960s, I don＊t remember Sunday lunch being a big deal in our house. My hard-working Communist parents were too busy with other activities, or ferrying us three kids around to music lessons and?other?weekend pursuits, and our grandparents were absent because of death or distance. But this favourite dessert, often served at the weekend, carries special memories.The original recipe came from The Olio Cookery Book that my mum got free with her new electric cooker on marrying my dad in 1952; the cooker lasted them for at least 30 years. The page with this recipe on was the most used, stained and torn, and covered in Mum＊s handwritten notes. She made so?many changes over the years to quantities and ingredients that this recipe is really her own (my only addition is the cinnamon). As a child, I?loved helping to peel and slice the sour Bramley cooking apples (bought in?the greengrocer in the high street),? and rubbing the margarine and flour between my fingers to make the crumble. The sweet smell of it baking would fill the house as we ate the boring main course, and when it was taken out and placed sizzling on the dining table, my brothers and I?would vie for the best bits: the sticky toffee formed by the dark brown sugar that melted around the edges. Dark, soft, moist muscovado sugar was definitely the secret of Mum＊s delicious crumble.Her version of the recipe has survived because, aged 11, I copied it into the special notebook in which I?recorded all my favourite recipes for sweets, cakes and puddings (including one from ). After Mum＊s death in 2001, I was pleased to find this notebook among her things, preserving her special apple crumble recipe. I＊m not much of a cook myself, but I love to make this for visiting friends and family. I recently made one with the help of my young niece, happily crumbling the flour and margarine in her messy fingers just like I used to. It always goes down well 每 especially the toffee bits.																																											"

"magine all the world＊s big rock bands adrift on a leaky raft. Supplies are low. Who＊s shark bait? It＊s a scenario sadly untestable in the field, but few rock fans would conceivably pick  over more divisive arena-fillers 每 Red Hot Chili Peppers, say, or U2.Born from the ashes of Nirvana, but transformed into a juggernaut thanks to Dave Grohl＊s grasp of melodics, the Foos are a reliable group who are hard?to hate: power with tunes, good times with gravitas. For their ninth album, the first after a broken leg temporarily hobbled the irrepressible Grohl (※I feel the metal in my bones,§ runs one wry lyric here), they have?enlisted pop merchant Greg Kurstin (Adele, Katy Perry, Lily Allen; more recently, Liam Gallagher, Beck) to produce.The science is simple enough: every lick gets its titanium sheen, the vocals are layered millefeuilles upon millefeuilles, and Grohl?is able to further indulge his inner singer-songwriter (as on the pretty love song Dirty Water) as well as?his anthemic thrasher (Run;  is awesome).Albums eight and seven were, in their own ways, conceptual;  is much more accessible. Such is Grohl＊s pulling power that he can rope in  on backing vocals, or call up his buddy Paul McCartney to play drums on Sunday Rain. You would never accuse Grohl of being a smug star, the kind who would countenance semi-retirement running a trout farm. There＊s still a lot of roiling going on under the affable exterior. But ninth albums from famous dudes with Beatles as jam-mates aren＊t known for grabbing you by the gizzards and turning you inside out.As it is here. No reinventions, no crises of faith, and 每 given it＊s 2017 每 no overt state-of-the-nation addresses 每 unless you are counting the oblique opening track, , which Grohl has said was written in reaction to the political mood (you can＊t really tell). La Dee Da, meanwhile, is littered with references to obscure rightwing bands. In a recent interview, Grohl was at pains to explain that the song reconnects with both his own alienated?teen self and other alienated young males he knew. You get the feeling it＊s loosely about the embittered?testosterone fuelling current US politics.The rest ranges far and wide: love songs, storytelling, questioning. There are chant-along tunes that start raw and become saturated, such as , whose heaviosity is leavened by angelic backing sighs. McCartney is here in spirit as well in body. Sunday Rain is highly Beatley; so is Happy Ever After (Zero Hour). Both have a dark bent. ※Where is your Shangri-la now?§ muses Grohl on the latter. ※Happy ever after/ Counting down to zero hour/ There ain＊t no superheroes now.§Grohl and co are on point, the tracklist has girth and depth. What lacks, perhaps, is actual concrete: fresh, modern, risky architecture, rather than Beatles tributes.																																											"
"ark Strong is one of the UK＊s most successful cinema character actors, with almost 60 film credits in 25 years, including ,   and the  series. On stage, he won the 2015 Olivier award for best actor for his role in . An only child, Strong was born in London and brought up by his Austrian mother, who worked as an au pair. His Italian father left when he was baby. He lives in north London with his wife, the producer Liza Marshall, and two sons.I had fantasies of being a European lawyer, but I quickly realised I probably just had fantasies of wearing a raincoat and carrying a briefcase and driving a BMW. I thought that would be cool. But the study of law is so dry, especially constitutional law in German. I came across a class in Munich 每 only Germans could have a course called , which means theatre science 每 and it was way more interesting than what was going on in the lecture halls. I just managed to get in on that somehow, and that opened up the whole world of theatre, acting, performance.Totally. At the beginning I didn＊t know what fame was or how it could affect your life, so I was probably eager to be noticed and try to become well known, because I believed then, like most young actors, that it would lead to more work. What actually happens is that good work leads to more work. Over the years I＊ve been doing it I＊ve seen people I know very well become extremely famous and there is nothing about it that I would recommend. I can＊t imagine anything worse than being in a position that you＊re not allowed to live your life privately.The reason it seems like so many is because I＊m a character actor. I can be in a film and only do a couple of weeks＊ work. And the glorious thing about film is that you only need four or five good scenes and you＊re in it. I definitely have that working-class thing of you＊ve got to keep working. You can＊t turn down work. You＊ve got to keep occupied and make sure there＊s food on the table. I do get antsy if I haven＊t got lines to learn, a character to play. But yes, I do take holidays.I knew I was outside the regular family system that most of my friends came from. That didn＊t bother me at all. All it made me do was fall back on my own resources to decide what kind of person I wanted to be. I＊d look at one person and see how they＊d come bounding up to you and everyone would think, ※Wow, what a great guy.§ So I thought, ※I want to put that out into the world and have people feel relaxed in my company§, but then you don＊t want to be taken advantage of, so you＊d need to develop some steel 每 and I＊d observed that in people who were very good at getting what they wanted. I just literally put together behaviours because I didn＊t inherit [any] from a father and my mum wasn＊t around because I was at boarding school.Yes, you do look at other actors and performances, because that＊s your business. I＊m not sitting at work ticking off whether I think the actors I＊m working with are any good, but instinctively you watch people＊s choices and wonder whether you would have made the same one. And that hopefully makes you a better actor because you need to get in touch with what you do best. But we＊re also in a business where perhaps if you＊re handsome or beautiful you might find yourself getting roles that you＊re not deserving of in terms of your talent, because there are a ton of actors I know who are really good and not working, and many who aren＊t that good who are.Depends who the other actors are. Generally I like to shoot the breeze. When else do you get to have 20 minutes＊ downtime with Halle Berry while they＊re setting up a camera? Most of the actors I＊ve worked with and respect, I want to have a conversation with them and find out what they＊re really like. I＊m like anyone; I make a lot of my assumptions about actors I don＊t know from what I read about them. And then I＊ll find those judgments are often completely confounded when I meet them in real life.Absolutely not. I enjoyed being in punk bands for the performance. They were school bands. I was house electronics captain which meant I was in charge of the amp and the speakers. That was the time of punk and here＊s three chords, go and form a band. We literally did that and played very loud bad music that we loved.

"weet Country is Old Testament cinema, with an almost biblical starkness in its cruelty and mysterious beauty, set in a burning plain where it looks as if the sun-bleached jawbone of an ass could at any moment be picked up and used as a murder weapon.The director  in 2009 and now raises his game still further with this brutally powerful outback western, written by Steven McGregor and David Tranter and set in the 1920s Northern Territory. It＊s a place where white men are traumatised by the heat, hardship and memories of serving the motherland in the first world war, and where Indigenous Australians are treated with casual racism as virtual plantation field-hands, in a colonial situation nearer slavery than Jim Crow. These are the ※blackfellas§ whose serfdom to the ※whitefellas§ creates a society of paranoia and violence.It＊s a stark, shocking movie, superbly shot by Thornton who is both cinematographer and director: a film which feels at one level like a provocative exploitation picture such as Straw Dogs or , and at another level like a classic studio western, with something of The Searchers or Red River. It is a world where the sheer heat reduces humanity to some implacable essence, as if it has been boiled dry, down to a toxic dust. And yet even here, there are traces of humanity and kindness. The title derives from one character＊s sense of awe at the vast, unenclosed beauty of the landscape, but also from another＊s final, despairing wail: what is to become of this country?The Indigenous actor Hamilton Morris plays Sam, who works as a farmhand at the cattle station run by Fred Smith (Sam Neill), a Christian pioneer who makes a point of treating the blackfellas on his property with respect. But Smith makes a fatal mistake in allowing, against his better judgement, a boorish and drunken newcomer Harry March (Ewen Leslie) to borrow Sam, along with his wife and niece, to do some work at his own station, a day＊s ride away, and this drunken and self-pitying March believes that raping Indigenous womenfolk is his prerogative. Later, March will effectively make another blackfella borrowing from another farmstead, and his sheer arrogance results in murderous violence, which itself arises indirectly from everyone＊s unspoken suspicion of what he has done. Sam goes on the run into the outback, disappearing into the thrumming, brain-frazzling heat, and a posse of tribally loyal white men is gathered to go after him, led by a local police sergeant, played with sharp-faced anger by the veteran Australian actor Bryan Brown.This is fiercely powerful storytelling, simple and muscular in one way, but also conveying nuance and sophistication in its depiction of character; it gives us a plot which meanders like a creek-bed, taking odd turns and looping back on itself, interspersed with unsettling flashbacks to violent episodes of the past and almost subliminal flashforward-premonitions and glimpses of the violence which is yet to come. But it never loses its grip on the audience, and its culminating outdoor courtroom scenes 每 summary justice being arrived at to the accompanying noise of sawing and hammering as the scaffold is being erected 每 never feel like an enervation or an anti-climax the way they might in another movie. This trial scene feels like the exegesis or elaboration of a communal bad dream, an attempt to impose order on the hallucinatory chaos and delirium that is being kept under control, and in fact it is a kind of justice which is executed with a fair attempt at rational decency.Sweet Country achieves an eerie illusion-effect in showing a rope bisecting the screen; at one moment this means the creation of the hanging platform and the noose, and at another moment the raising of a church, by Smith: the hoisting of the wooden frame of its outer wall. This is the erection of power by the white man: the building of norms, and social structure: the law and the church. Slowly, but surely, the Anglo-Saxon order is being put in place in the Northern Territory, at a terrible cost for the people who were there first, and indeed for the people doing the displacing themselves. Sweet Country is about a brutal and tragic violence. 																																											"

"Judges for the  national short story award have announced a shortlist for 2017 that is ※enduring, bold, humane and moving§, with work from five acclaimed writers now in line for the ?15,000 award.Will Eaves＊s ※quiet and horrifying§ Murmur, about a gay academic who is convicted for gross indecency, was inspired by the real-life tragedy of Alan Turing. Eaves, a novelist, poet and former arts editor of the Times Literary Supplement, is one of the finalists for the prize, which has been won in the past by authors including Sarah Hall, Julian Gough and David Constantine. More than 600 stories were submitted, with judges unaware of the authors＊ names until they made their selection.Chaired by the novelist Joanna Trollope, three of the judging panel＊s choices had made Granta＊s list of the 20 most promising writers under 40 in 2013. Jenni Fagan was picked for The Waken, set on a small Scottish island where a girl is attending her hated father＊s funeral, Benjamin Markovits for The Collector, about an eccentric man mourning his wife on the Canadian border, and Helen Oyeyemi for If a Book Is Locked There＊s Probably a Good Reason for That, Don＊t You Think?, in which her protagonist arrives for work in an office with a mysterious locked diary.※Applying for a prize like this is like putting a message in a bottle 每 you don＊t expect it to come back. And then it does, and it turns out someone has read it ＃ and more people will get a chance to read it now. It feels like a bit of very good luck,§ said Markovits of his shortlisting.Trollope described Eaves＊s story, which was inspired by the life of Alan Turing, as ※quiet and horrifying ＃ deliberately restrained in the writing, which only emphasises the dreadfulness of the narrative§. A reader ※becomes utterly absorbed in this visceral world of legend§ in The Waken, according to Trollope, while The Collector is ※beautifully written [and] atmospheric§, and Oyeyemi＊s contender is simply ※brilliant§.The shortlist, which was announced on BBC Radio 4＊s Front Row on Friday, is completed with Cynan Jones＊s The Edge of the Shoal, in which a canoeist who sets out to scatter his father＊s ashes finds himself struggling to survive. Trollope called Jones＊s story a ※lyrically, poetically written account, lit with poignancy§.Trollope＊s fellow judge, the Baileys award-winning novelist Eimear McBride, said the shortlist presents ※a veritable festival of ideas about identity, the innate and the capacity of both for transformation ＃ or not§. ※These are stories about what is hidden, what is revealed, what can be lost and what will remain. While they inhabit very different imaginative, linguistic, political and artistic landscapes, these are the ideas that bind them together and have made each one such a pleasurable discovery for me,§ said McBride.BBC Radio books editor Di Speirs said that the award had received more entries than ever before this year, and that ※writers of all persuasions 每 novelists, poets, short-story specialists 每 are seeing the value of short fiction and experimenting with it more boldly§.※All five of our shortlisted writers have embraced the freedom that short fiction offers and all their stories sing out, enduring, bold, humane and moving. However different in style and shape, they prove just how exciting and current the short story is in the UK just now.§In an introduction to an anthology of all the shortlisted short stories, to be published by Comma Press, Trollope wrote that ※short stories are fiendishly difficult to get right§.※At its best, a short story starts a process of thinking and imagining for a reader, a trigger, if you like, for all kinds of future thoughts and wonderings,§ she wrote. ※I＊m proud to say that this year＊s shortlist has achieved precisely that 每 characters, places and ideas that will linger with you long after you have finished reading.§The winner will be announced on 3 October.

"pen Mike Eagle appears in his new music video as a masked hero named Iron Hood. His arch-nemesis is a white-collar figure swinging a baseball bat at three model buildings. These represent Chicago＊s Robert Taylor Homes, the largest US public housing development before it was demolished with the false promise of 2,388 mixed-income units to replace it. ※There＊s a photo of the Robert Taylor Homes where the buildings are lined up in the back, and in the front and there＊s a playground,§ Mike says. ※I kept looking at that picture. Then it popped into my head: I wanted to see that building with a head and arms.§Mike, a South Side native, remembers how imposing that complex was when he was younger: how chain-link fences enclosed the balconies, how he used to hear gunshots. But this was also where he and his parents would walk a mile to see his great-aunt and his first cousins; there was a human side to these buildings that＊s rarely discussed.Brick Body Kids Still Daydream is an archaeological dig turned concept album about what Robert Taylor used to be 每 a home. It is as smart and empathetic as any release Open Mike Eagle has put out over the past few years, mostly material about combating the existential dread of being a black man in 2017. Mike relocated to Los Angeles and, with his 2010 debut, established what he called ※art rap§. That term began a protest against how rock is treated with more critical nuance than hip-hop; today, it is its own subgenre.What separates Brick Body Kids from his past work is the lyrical territory, but also his tone. ※When I was writing these songs, I didn＊t feel like I had the space to laugh,§ he says.This album exists because of a flight Mike had over a year ago. He was on this airplane, wondering what happened to the Robert Taylor Homes. ※I just assumed that it was turned into something 每 was it condos?§ he says. He used the airline wifi to watch several documentaries, learning that, apart from a few hundred units to replace the 4,300 demolished ones, the site is nothing but an overgrown field. Pop culture (the documentary Hoop Dreams, the book turned film There Are No Children Here, ) has been kinder than public policy about recognizing the tens of thousands of people who live in public housing. Brick Body Kids Still Daydream is yet another example. The opening track, Legendary Iron Hood, comes from the perspective of a child playing pretend as a Marvel-inspired super-villain, and features guitar by Dan Miller of They Might Be Giants. Yet undergoing his transformation, this kid can＊t help but notice the roaches running rampant at home 每 his reality. This approach to storytelling, where there isn＊t any outright explanation, was inspired by the video game director Hidetaka Miyazaki＊s approach to , the notoriously difficult fantasy role-playing game that Mike has played frequently over the past two years. ※You have to use your imagination to connect the dots,§ he says.Like his 2016 album Hella Personal Film Festival, Brick Body Kids Still Daydream is a combination of fictional storytelling, hypothetical scenarios and personal experience. Legendary Iron Hood isn＊t at all autobiographical, as listeners have been inclined to believe of most hip-hop songs, though it is rooted in emotional truth. By comparison, Brick Body Complex is Mike addressing us directly, both when he raps: ※Don＊t call me nigga or rapper / My motherfucking name is Michael Eagle, I＊m sovereign§ and when he repeats ※My body is a building, a building, a building, a building§ 每 as illustrated on the album art.Mike says: ※Part of the statement for the album is about when we talk about humanizing trauma, and the hardening and horror that takes place. These buildings go up. They come down. And a lot of people don＊t think about the quality of suffering that might happen to people who were in that situation. There＊s a correlation there to what happens to black bodies, when black people are murdered by police. There＊s a lot of people who have no empathy to that.§Mike swears up and down that any reaction to Brick Body Kids, even apathy, is valid. ※That＊s the risk I run by wanting to express my true range of emotions on these matters and the time we live in,§ he says. The album ends with My Auntie＊s Building, its most visceral and autobiographical song 每 one last plea to understand why this policy failure feels so personal. To static, he mutters that the demolition of Robert Taylor Homes is ※the sound of them tearing my body down to the ground§. It is our hero meeting crushing defeat.																																											"
"iberia has never enjoyed a good press. We headline it as emptiness, a place of frigid exile, inhospitable both to the body and to the imagination. One of several wonderful things about this  exhibition is that it gives the lie to that void. Siberia comes to life in dramatic, sometimes breathtaking ways: in fabulous gold and soft fur, in the insistent humanity of sticks of crafted furniture and clothes and food. That this life 每 leathery and intimate and horse-obsessed 每 is preserved from two and a half thousand years ago makes it all the more magical.For most of that time the only real record of the culture of the Scythian people, nomadic tribes who herded cattle and goats on the grassy corridor of the steppe, came in the writings of Herodotus, who pitched up in his travels on the north shore of the Black Sea some time around 440BC. He observed and wrote about the rituals and habits of a rugged and resourceful people who dominated a vast area for 500 years and who would continue to do so for a century or more to come.It was not until the time of Peter the Great that those observations of Herodotus began to be verified by archaeological discovery. This exhibition, which wears its considerable scholarship lightly, begins by capturing the excitement when those first discoveries were brought to the Winter Palace in St Petersburg from southern Siberia. At first, when confronted with the solid gold belt plaques exquisitely rendered with scenes of battles between mythical and realistic animals 每 a dragon tearing into the flank of a horse, a jewelled vulture devouring a yak 每 the enlightened scholars of Peter＊s court had no idea where these things came from or how old they were. The Russians considered Siberia to have been a barbarous place, and these objects overturned that idea. When they were determined to be Scythian objects, a debate opened as to whether they were products of an oriental or a Slavic 每 Russian 每 civilisation. The more pressing question for anyone looking at these pieces of gold now 每 bold bracelets and delicate earrings and necklaces as well as the symbolic bling of belt buckles 每 is who were these cattle herders who left no written record of nearly a millennia of civilisation, but who could create such ornament?Some very good answers to that question are provided by this show, which is the British Museum at its best 每 gathering the evidence from a mostly unknown time and place in antiquity and making it news. That task had a major stroke of historical fortune. When the graves in the Pazyryk valley in the Altai mountains were first robbed, water entered the underground burial chambers and remained permanently frozen, insulated by the mound of earth above. Wood, felt, silk, leather, human bodies and other organic matter buried in the fourth and fifth centuries BC remained intact until Russian archaeologists excavated the sites in the first half of the last century. More finds are still being made, an effort given greater urgency because of rising temperatures melting permafrost.You get graphic evidence of this fact when you meet the shellacked gaze of a Scythian warlord, his head with skin and teeth intact, dug from a 2,400-year-old grave. The man survived some wounds 每 his forehead bears the traces of silk sutures 每 but was killed with three blows from a Scythian battle axe, an example of which is cruelly preserved opposite. Also on display are sections of the man＊s crumpled skin with very contemporary looking sleeves of tattoos, the animalistic myths inked with soot.The most extraordinary insight into of the lives of people like this man is then established in an array of objects defrosted from tombs. There are patterned felt textiles, including stockings in a shade of light tan, lovingly designed squirrel fur coats, appliqued with felt, a sable fur pouch and leather purse softened with use. In most displays of this antiquity you are restricted to the hard edges of bronze and pottery. These fabrics lend a more human touch, none more so than the strange false beard of real hair designed to be hooked over the ears, and the saddle bags containing a meal to take a Scythian chief through to eternity: coriander seeds, a sheep＊s bone that once was a lump of mutton, and a small cloth bag containing lumps of Scythian cheese (best before 350BC).Some of these objects, mostly borrowed from the State Hermitage Museum, were made with a sense of fierce display 每 an eagle-topped headdress, for example, carved from wood, decorated with leather and designed to rise a foot or more above the wearer＊s head. More often they exhibit a keen utility 每 pots and stools and sticks of furniture are made for portability, iron age picnic sets for a community always on the move. Some of this travelling was also in the mind. Herodotus described some handy apparatus, made of a small wigwam of three sticks covered in felt inside which hemp seeds were burned on red hot stones, and the smoke inhaled causing the Scythians to ※howl with delight§. An example of this mini stoner＊s paradise was also found among one chief＊s essential grave artefacts.The Scythians were an unrooted people and they borrowed and traded from their sedentary neighbouring cultures: there are Chinese silks, sleeves of Indian cotton, wine cups with a Greek cast. What this exhibition makes clear, however, is that they also had a sophisticated and mysterious culture of their own 每 grave decorations of men on horseback display not only a warlike tendency, but also a sense of humour and playfulness. You might, as I did, go into this exhibition thinking of ancient Siberian history as a fairly blank canvas; you will come out with a sense of it having been coloured in.

"ntering the theatre, it looks as if there has been an explosion: chairs hang in mid-air, a wardrobe tilts in empty space and a ladder to nowhere is suspended above the stage. Designer Oliver Townsend has borrowed to clever effect from Cornelia Parker＊s 1991 installation  to create the setting for Harold Pinter＊s Godot-influenced 1960 play about what happens when damaged Aston invites a homeless man, Davies, back to his room in a house owned by his bully boy brother, Mick. It might be read as a play about how a good deed does not go unpunished; it could be seen as a warning that blood will always be thicker than water; and it is often like watching a chess game in which one player thinks he has a winning move only to discover that he has been tactically outplayed. Director Christopher Haydon plays it as , a migration story in which Patrice Naiambana＊s wheedling, blustering Davies is trying desperately to get his foot in the door and find a place where he can be safe. That might sound reductive but Townsend＊s design lifts it from the literal and into an enclosed dream space, one rumbling with distant thunderstorms, which crackles with electricity recalling the electro-convulsive therapy that Jonathan Livingstone＊s Aston has been forced to undergo. This room is a place of shadows where potential dangers lurk: the first few moments are brilliantly handled, as David Judge＊s Mick unexpectedly makes his presence felt. Haydon gives this timeless play a little shove out of the 1960s and into the 21st century, although inevitably there are references in the script that jar. But he and Naiambana treat Davies with real compassion. We＊ve seen  versions of Davies. This one shows us his vulnerability 每 and how poverty, homelessness and constant uncertainty make you duck and dive, creating paranoia about those who might be getting ahead of you in the brutal game of survival. It makes this Davies＊s racism all the more believable. It＊s an evening that, like Davies, is in danger of outstaying its welcome. Judge doesn＊t always manage the disconcerting changes of mood that should make Mick such a terrifying adversary. But Livingstone provides fine support as the burned-out Aston, a quiet husk of a man incapable of building the shed he dreams of constructing. At  until 30 September.

"Nikon has a serious optics problem.The Japanese camera giant chose  across Asia and Africa to test-drive and promote its new camera, the D850. Of the 32 photographers chosen, Nikon managed to pick zero women.What is so obvious to me 每 a professional photographer 每 as well as colleagues, photography bloggers and social media users, was not obvious to Nikon. Instead, it seemed to have worked on the campaign, from the concept stage through to development, marketing and public relations, without a thought for its female clients.A photograph 每 as Nikon should know 每 speaks a thousand words. The image Nikon used to promote its new camera shows that companies still don＊t value women in photography, and that professional photography remains a boys＊ club. As one photography blog snarked: was the camera made specifically for men?Based on its research, is Nikon saying only men are buying cameras? Or that the market for women is so insignificant Nikon has chosen to overlook them?If that＊s the case, the problem is even greater than Nikon＊s omission.  is a reflection of our society 每 and if one group of people controls the narrative, millions of stories will go untold.Female photographers in Asia or Africa, for example, are uniquely positioned to shine a light on women who have no voice or power. When I＊ve worked on important and sensitive stories , I＊ve only been able to gain access because I＊m a woman. Here＊s just one example from an assignment in Pakistan:Paula Bronstein＊s entire body of work 每 including her portraits of  每 or Smita Sharma＊s  perfectly illustrate this argument. I could name dozens more.In response to the backlash, Nikon responded, weakly: ※Unfortunately, the female photographers we had invited for this meet were unable to attend, and we acknowledge we have not put enough of a focus in this area.§ Women  of Nikon＊s workforce this year.Nikon, perhaps I can help. As vice-president of the Women Photojournalists of Washington, a non-profit created to promote the role of women in photojournalism, foster their professional success, and mentor emerging photographers, our mission is, sadly, critical.You know this already: you give us generous funds to support our mission. With over 400 members in the DC area, our members include renowned war photographers, Pulitzer prize winners, political photographers, and video journalists covering the biggest news stories around the globe. Yet we continue to see women being sidelined.I＊d be thrilled to give your camera a go on my next assignment, as would thousands of other professional female photographers.If you want names, .

"lastair Campbell＊s latest volume of diaries brings to mind the sign that used to be a ubiquitous feature of the 1980s workplace: ※You don＊t have to be mad to work here ... But it helps!§ To my knowledge, no Westminster wag has ever hung one in No 10. From Campbell＊s account of government during the transition from Tony Blair to , however, it would not have been out of place.As a mental health campaigner, Campbell has always been open about his ongoing episodes of depression. But the mental health issues his new diaries reveal go well beyond the occasional black dog, reaching a torrid climax in 2006 during a walk with his partner, Fiona Millar, across Hampstead Heath. The couple were in total crisis, constantly rowing, confronting what looked like the end of their 27-year-relationship. When another argument erupted as they walked, Campbell lost it and began punching himself in the face.※This is driving me fucking crazy!§ he screamed, landing a volley of blows as Millar turned white. ※You asked me to leave [my job in Downing Street]. And I had left.§※And now you＊re virtually back, and it is making you ill!§ she shouted back.※I am not ill!§ he yelled, collapsing against a tree as his left eye began to swell. But, as he writes in his diary, ※I knew I was.§The scene is quite hard to reconcile with the sleepy domestic calm I find in their north London home on a Saturday morning. Millar pads around the kitchen in gym gear; their adult daughter Grace appears at the garden door with a dog; Campbell teases her older brother, Calum, for wearing a hat indoors. The former spin doctor used to be fanatical about controlling the message, but there is a kind of compulsive candour about his manner now, and within minutes we are discussing intimate detail of sessions with his psychiatrist, from whom he sought help after Philip Gould told him bluntly: ※You＊re just not coping.§Being nosy, I am of course riveted by the marital dramas. In 2003, Millar begged Campbell to quit his job, but after resigning he never really left, and remained by Blair＊s side at the heart of government 每 hopelessly torn between loyalties to home and No 10. His psychiatrist took the view that working for Blair was a lot like having an affair 每 or at least that that was how it felt to Millar. By the end, she resented the  leader so much she couldn＊t bear to be in the same room as him.Is it fair to say that Blair functioned as Campbell＊s mistress? ※Oh piss off!§ He throws up an arm indignantly. ※No, piss off! Honestly. I＊m not having that.§ But the parallels are unarguable, aren＊t they? Blair was the Other Woman he tried but failed to give up. ※But it was my !§ Yes 每 but one he had supposedly left. ※Well, yes OK,§ he concedes. ※It＊s just that when you put it like that 每  每 it makes me feel queasy.§Revisiting the psychodramas of Blair and Brown＊s rivalry 每 what Campbell calls the TB-GBies 每 it seems incredible now that their squabbles felt worth risking his sanity and family for. What gripped him, he reflects, was the buzz of being needed; he was addicted to his own indispensability. But he adds quickly, ※It  matter, though. We were doing important stuff that changed the country.§I wonder if the publication of his diaries 每 we＊re up to the sixth volume now, the latest covering 2005-2007 每 is his way of keeping those heady years alive? But he says no, he just likes to see history recorded properly. We need to know who said what to whom and when, because there are important lessons to learn. ※I honestly feel this: if we had held together, if we had always been as we were, as a team, all the time, I think we＊d still be there.§Seriously? ※Well, OK, maybe not after 20 years. But I think we＊d have lasted a lot, lot longer.§For such a famously ruthless strategist to indulge this improbable fantasy could lend weight to the lovestruck theory of his devotion to Blair. According to Campbell, what really made walking away from politics so hard was the terrible certainty that nothing else he did would ever come close to the thrill of government. ※Nothing else measures up. It just doesn＊t. And that＊s what I struggle with now.§ On paper, his post-politics career might look enviably exciting 每 he is editor-at-large of weekly newspaper, , writes novels and books, campaigns for charities, , advises foreign governments 每 but all of it, he says, looking suddenly bleak, feels like second best.I＊m not sure he would get his old narcotic hit from working in Downing Street today, though. By comparison with his time, does Theresa May＊s government strike him as disappointingly psychologically mundane? ※Ye-es. That intensity of passion, it doesn＊t feel like they have it to me.§ Politics, he agrees, has become dominated by two apparently contradictory types; the maverick loose cannon personified by Donald Trump, and the charisma-free middle manager we see in May. I ask which one poses a greater danger to democracy 每 madness or mediocrity? ※Well,§ he smiles. ※That depends upon how you define madness.§He doesn＊t buy the idea that you need to be mad to be a great leader, and gets huffy when I say Blair and Brown both looked increasingly unhinged in office. ※That＊s just not true.§ He does, however, advise any employer choosing between two equally qualified candidates to hire the one with a gap in their CV caused by a breakdown or spell in rehab. ※I always say, ＆Go for that one, because they＊ll have more to them.＊ That＊s an indication of another dimension to that person that makes them interesting, and you＊re drawn to them.§Does he mind the fact that he is psychologically flawed? He considers the question carefully. ※No. I don＊t actually, I don＊t.§A preference for madness over mediocrity can＊t reconcile Campbell to Trump＊s presidency, though. ※I can＊t even watch him on television any more,§ he shudders. ※He makes my flesh crawl.§ Psychiatrists in the US are forbidden to comment on the mental health of anyone they have not personally examined, but Campbell is following with close interest the debate about whether they might, in fact, have a duty to share their diagnoses of Trump with the American public. Does the president look to him like a man in sound mental health? ※No. He＊s a narcissist. I mean, it＊s just pathetic. It＊s pathetic. It goes beyond anything any of us have ever seen.§Campbell isn＊t exactly without ego, of course, but he doesn＊t seem to mind being teased about it. We laugh about him reporting in his diaries, without irony, that his psychiatrist praised an essay he had asked him to write 每 ※a fine piece§ 每 on, of all things, humility. He is also happy to record his GP＊s bizarre jealousy towards his shrink, who apparently complained that the psychiatrist ※did not know me as well as he did§. The image of Campbell caught up in yet another testosterone love triangle is starting to sound vaguely homoerotic, but when I say so he gets cross again 每 ※Oh God, what is it with you?§ 每 as if his sexuality were being questioned, which it isn＊t. If there can be such a thing as purely platonic homoeroticism, however, it perhaps figured in some of his relationships with men.His ardent blind spot surfaces again when I ask if he thinks his old boss has enough credibility or political capital to persuade the British public to reconsider Brexit. ※Yes, I think he can. What I say to Tony is, I think he should keep going.§ But even Blair knows he＊s toxic 每 ※Oh, for sure, for sure§ 每 so what＊s the point of urging him to keep campaigning? ※It＊s very difficult, very difficult, but I still think that if you really believe that it＊s a complete catastrophe for the country, you have to do what you can to stop it.§If Campbell were in charge of the Labour party today, what would he be doing about Brexit? He stiffens. ※Now, Corbyn, fair enough, I＊m not saying austerity is not a big issue, I＊m not saying the pay gap＊s not a big issue, but to come back from the summer that the Tories have had, the utter chaos of these negotiations, and the first prime minister＊s questions the word Brexit doesn＊t even cross his lips? It＊s not a priority for him, so I think there＊s a danger they＊re going to be let off the hook.§He admits he massively under?estimated Jeremy Corbyn＊s electoral appeal. ※Yes, he did better than people thought he would. I certainly thought he couldn＊t win the election,§ but adds pointedly, ※and we didn＊t.§ Would Corbyn make a good prime minister? ※I haven＊t bought the Kool Aid.§ Is that a no? He twists uncomfortably. ※I don＊t want to slag him off. He comes across as a perfectly nice chap.§ Given the choice, would he be rather see Ken Clarke in No 10 than Corbyn? ※I＊d rather have a Labour prime minister than a Tory prime minister.§ Yes, but Clarke vs Corbyn?※Look,§ he sighs. ※I＊m not going to pretend I＊ve become a great Corbyn fan. I＊m trying to tell you the truth without slagging him off. I think we should stop behaving like we won the election, because we didn＊t, and also I think it＊s great that he＊s motivated a lot of young people to get involved, but if there＊s one thing those young people in my view need and deserve, it＊s an opposition that＊s fighting against the madness of the Brexit policy that this government＊s pursuing.

"Late-night hosts on Thursday addressed Donald Trump＊s meeting with Democratic leaders  and Chuck Schumer, in which Trump reportedly agreed to a deal to preserve the Daca program he abruptly cancelled just weeks ago.※After repeatedly failing through the first eight months of his presidency to pass any major legislation, Trump has been making a renewed push to court Democrats to support his domestic agenda,§ Seth Meyers began. ※On Tuesday, he hosted a group of Democratic senators at the White House for dinner.§Meyers said: ※The meeting with Democratic senators comes after Trump stunned Republicans by striking a deal with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to keep the government open for three months and provide aid to hurricane victims. And last night, Trump met yet again with Schumer and Pelosi about the Daca program. Trump ended the program but hoped to use it as leverage to get funding for his border wall. And after their meeting last night, Schumer and Pelosi issued a statement basically claiming total victory.§Meyers then explained Pelosi and Schumer＊s statement after the meeting, which claimed the pair had convinced Trump not to end Daca in exchange for added border security measures, not including the president＊s proposed border wall.Meyers continued: ※So Trump initially promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, then he said Congress would pay for the wall, then he said he would trade Daca to pay for the wall, and now he＊s trading Daca and no one＊s paying for the wall. He might be the worst negotiator since Daffy Duck.※One of the joys of this whole episode has been watching the president＊s staunchest supporters, people who defended him through all of his most egregious transgressions, freak out about his reversal on Daca. Take Iowa congressman Steve King, who tweeted last night when the AP first reported the deal.§King＊s tweet read: ※If AP is correct, Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible.§※I＊m sorry,§ Meyers responded. ※You＊re just figuring out that Trump＊s promises aren＊t credible now?§Meyers went on: ※You might be thinking, didn＊t Trump specifically accuse President Obama of giving undocumented immigrants amnesty when he signed Daca? But technically, he never used the word amnesty. In fact, Trump didn＊t use a real word at all.§Meyers then showed footage from a 2016 campaign rally in which Trump promises not to give undocumented immigrants ※amnity§ rather than ※amnesty.§※That＊s right, amnity. He probably still doesn＊t know what amnesty is,§ Meyers quipped, before launching into an impression of the president. ※I＊ll make a deal, but I promised no amnity during the campaign. ? Deal.§ of Comedy Central also weighed in on president Trump＊s dealings with the Democrats.※You may remember that last week President Trump made a deal with the Democrats to fund Harvey relief, raise the debt ceiling, and keep the government up and running,§ Noah began. ※Things that should be automatic anyway but in this presidency count as major accomplishments. And Trump got a lot of praise in the press for being bipartisan, which his press secretary made sure to talk up.§Noah then showed Sarah Huckabee Sanders claiming that ※this president＊s done more for bipartisanship in the last eight days than Obama did in eight years§.※Wow. One deal, now he＊s Mr Bipartisan,§ Noah responded. ※You can＊t call someone a philanthropist just because they toss a quarter at a homeless person.§Noah continued: ※Trump was so turned on by all the positive press the deal got him that last night he went out and did it again. All it took was a dinner and Trump folded to the democrats on Daca and the wall? Does anyone still think Trump is a master negotiator? Because Democrats are like: do everything we want and we＊ll let you watch Wheel of Fortune. And he＊s like, OK, I like when they spin the wheel.§※In fact, Trump didn＊t just give in to the Democrats,§ Noah said. ※He came out sounding like they converted him.§The host then read Trump＊s tweet from Thursday morning, in which he asked if ※anyone really wants to throw out the Dreamers§.※Yeah, !,§ Noah said incredulously. ※You, you gas-lighting shrimp tempura, ! You literally spent two years campaigning on kicking everybody out, now all of a sudden you＊re like, ＆What kind of psycho would kick everyone out?＊§※So,  and the Democrats made a deal,§ the host went on. ※Dreamers stay in the country and no funding for the wall in return. Everyone＊s happy, well, except for all the people who voted for him.§Noah then showed numerous tweets from the Trump faithful rebuking the president＊s deal, including Ann Coulter, who just last year wrote a book called In Trump We Trust. In her tweet, Coulter asked, ※At this point, who DOESN＊T want Trump impeached?§※Wow, even Ann Coulter wants Trump impeached,§ Noah concluded. ※Can you imagine what the new anti-Trump protests are going to look like? You＊re going to have Ann Coulter next to a liberal, Dreamers next to Nazis, and the Nazis are gonna be like: ＆Hey man, you want to use my tiki torch?＊§																																											"
"The pope＊s body is a spiralling heap of sausages wrapped in white and pink robes. Go closer, and even stranger physical images arise: brown smears over his fleshy hands look disturbingly faecal. You could almost believe it, if this were not a ?60m 每 or more 每 masterpiece soon to go on sale in the opulent setting of Christie＊s London auction house. Francis Bacon＊s Study of Red Pope 1962. 2nd Version 1971 is as close to a new painting by the great Soho  who died in 1992 as we are ever likely to see. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1971, six months after Bacon finished it, and was shown in D邦sseldorf the following year. Since then it has been locked away by a private collector, who never lent it or showed it. The gold-framed explosion of velvety red and rose on raw beige canvas has been hidden away for 45 years, said Jussi Pylkk?nen, the president of Christie＊s. Pylkk?nen will be auctioning this choice cut of raw artistic beef in person early next month, when the world＊s art collectors converge on London for the . Bacon painted Study of Red Pope 1962. 2nd Version 1971 每 probably not his best title 每 at the most intense moment of his life. It was the best of times and the worst of times for the Irish-born artist. He was about to put on a massive one-man exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris. As a francophile who was friends with Paris intellectuals including the surrealist Michel Leiris, he cared deeply about how he would be received there. Yet, Pylkk?nen said, Bacon faced a problem. He wanted to include his renowned 1962 painting Study for Innocent X but its owner refused to lend it. With just six months to go before the most important exhibition of his life, Bacon shut himself in his cramped studio at  to create a new version of a masterpiece. He was facing a personal as well as artistic crisis. As Bacon painted, , the small-time East End criminal who was the love of his life, was getting ever more futile. Dyer had descended into an alcoholic malaise, unable to live as Bacon did in a giddily creative permanent champagne high. He was vanishing from Bacon＊s life, but invades this painting.  As the pope squirms like a giant silk-clad turd, sitting not on a papal throne but a 1970s swivel chair, the glass booth that encloses him morphs into a mirror in which he sees the figure of George Dyer. This is not the decaying man Dyer had become by 1971. It looks more like the handsome, well-dressed young thug he was when Bacon first met him in a pub in 1963. Wearing a smart suit and tie, his hand elegantly clenched in a proud fist, Dyer is upright, strong and a bit cocky. Is the slumping pope whose formless body is capped by a drunk＊s red nose in fact a portrait of Dyer drunk, looking at a last vision of his former self?  Pylkk?nen thinks Bacon was working at an artistic and emotional peak when he painted this furious bloody mary cocktail of artistic ambition and private sorrow. ※There＊s something about it that tells me 每 ＆I＊m going to paint a great picture for this show, the last of my popes, with my muse George Dyer in it,＊§ he says. Bacon succeeded, at least artistically. The exhibition at the Grand Palais would be the greatest triumph of Bacon＊s career, raising his reputation to the sublime level it has held ever since. Yet as Bacon got ready for the opening, Dyer killed himself with a drug overdose in their hotel room. Notoriously, there was a conspiracy of silence for two days so the death wouldn＊t spoil Bacon＊s vernissage. ※We＊re talking about ?60m,§ says Pylkk?nen. That＊s actually quite a bit less than Bacon＊s record of ?89.3m for , so the estimate may be exceeded if bidders get excited enough by the painting＊s intense combination of aesthetic and human drama.  ※It＊s got all the elements that collectors are looking for,§ says Pylkk?nen. The president of Christie＊s is by definition a good salesman 每 but his excitement is justified. This modern Baroque marvel proves Bacon was the  of the 20th century. 																																											"

"he purpose of a house, to state the obvious, starts with protection against the worst of the climate, which depending where you are in the world might be heat, cold, wet or wind. It will also be built, in times and places with no industrial materials, with whatever is near to hand, which is in turn a reflection?of its environment: turf, mud, straw, reeds, paper, stone, brick, timber, animal hides, tree bark, snow. So a house, whose basic idea is much the same everywhere, becomes in the infinite varieties of its construction an index of climate and geology.The idea of , a hefty, handsome tome edited by Sandra Piesik, is that, as environmental issues get more pressing, we should learn from the ways in which builders all over the world ※create architecture without jeopardising the equilibrium of the world＊s ecosystems§. ※If we are to navigate successfully our changing relationship with our planet in?the present age§, the book says, then we ※must fully take into account the entire multifaceted treasury of traditional wisdom§.It＊s a lofty aim, expressed with pages and pages of compelling images of mostly everyday dwellings, supported by informative text and impressively complicated maps and diagrams. The book organises the world not by continents but five types of climate 每 tropical, dry, temperate, continental, polar 每 which makes for unexpected juxtapositions of distant but climatically similar places, such as eastern Russia and Tasmania. The book professes a desire not to romanticise the indigenous and anonymous people whose houses it describes, although its base assumption is that they know what they＊re doing better than any externally imposed technology. It scrupulously avoids hierarchies of north and south and east and west: cob building in Devon (a mixture of mud and straw) is shown as the equal, no more and no less, of or bamboo houses in .The outcome is a catalogue of beautiful and unexpected structures created by addressing necessity with grace, with flourishes of ornament breaking out amid basically practical choices. There are, for example, the ※beehive§ houses of South Sudan and Rwanda, soft woven domes sometimes perched high on knobbly tree branches. Or the amazing tulou of coastal southern China, circular adobe enclosures that provide shelter from monsoons for large extended families. Or the turf-covered houses of Iceland. You can marvel at the ways in which Swedes make joints in wood, or the people of Papua New Guinea built houses in the tops of trees, or the Japanese different types of thatch.It helps the book that it has a cause, which keeps it from being a  romp through the exotic, but it is less convincing when it tries too hard to make its points. There are appendices on such things as the modern updating of vernacular techniques that feel as if they should be separate books. The scope is also too vast to allow a structured argument. It works best as evidence and inspiration, as the laying out of the amazingly multifarious forms that human dwelling can take, from which it might still be possible to learn.

"tate Of The Art was a Channel 4 series I?made, as a writer, with producer John Wyver and director Geoff Dunlop 每 the man crouching down on the far right.

I remember us sitting in a cafe late one night, waiting for him to come home 每 I＊m pretty sure we weren＊t the only media people in there. By 1985, Basquiat had shot to fame. He was still regarded as an artist connected to the Lower East Side music and  scene, yet was being exhibited in galleries. It happened really quickly: I?first saw his work in  in 1980, when he was considered part of a new generation of talent, along with  and . His work was striking: it had a graphic quality and a strangeness, full of words, symbols and colour. As a man, he was charming, but enigmatic and a little guarded. By the time we interviewed him, he was already swirling in myth.This photograph was taken by  shortly after that meeting, at the , which was staging a show of  and Basquiat 每 behind us is one of their collaborations. It was a?surreal day: the pair were being shot and filmed for the Japanese magazine Brutus, and we were filming it all. We wanted to capture the buzz around them, to convey their fame. Basquiat turned up on a bike 45 minutes late, and Warhol an hour late. This picture was taken between takes: Geoff was chatting to Basquiat, and I was talking to Warhol. He was exactly as you＊d expect 每 calm, clipped, polite and very controlled. Basquiat looks a bit sullen, but it was a relaxed morning, and they were joking around.For me, this photograph captures two of the world＊s most outstanding artists at that time, who had become?close. Warhol was more of a?legendary figure, using emblems and signs in his works, but with Basquiat, you could feel the immediacy of his hands in his art.State Of The Art was broadcast in early 1987. Television critics hated it: with no presenter, and its thematic structure, it was too postmodern for them. Warhol died in February that year, and Basquiat in August 1988, from a heroin overdose. When an artist dies so young 每 he was 27 每 they leave only so much work, so he has always been collectible. The majority of his art is still in private hands; a few of the collectors who discovered and supported him in the early 80s have hung on to his pieces. When they do come up for auction, they can fetch extraordinary sums: this May, a 1982 painting of his , a?record for an American artist.I was flicking through the book of the series recently, and in my introduction to the second edition of 1990, I noted how much had changed.

"t may not have the glamour and sense of occasion of Cannes, the romance of Venice or the boutique cliquishness of Telluride, but for sheer volume and scope, the Toronto international film festival (or Tiff, to give it its perkily approachable abbreviation) is hard to beat. Even having cut its programme by 20% this year (about 60 films fewer than previous instalments), Toronto is a monster of an event.This means several things. The first, and least welcome, of these is queues. Miles of them, snaking around the streets of the city for blocks and managed by systems that border on the Kafkaesque. Punters join them automatically, sometimes without knowing what they are waiting for. But the queues are there for a reason, which brings us to the second point: the sheer number of buzz titles. The timing of Toronto and its size means that it is an ideal platform on which to test whether a prestige title has the legs to make it a contender in the awards race.Early indications suggest that it＊s going to be another hard-fought battle in the best actress category, with a wealth of meaty, female-driven stories. And the crowd-pleasing , the latest from the  directing duo of Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton, is top of the list. Starring Emma Stone as tennis player Billie Jean King, the film tells the story of the much-publicised  between King and ex-champion, and self-proclaimed male-chauvinist pig, Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell, all tragicomic bluster and condescension). But more than that it＊s a love story, in which King, hopelessly smitten with hairdresser Marilyn (Andrea Riseborough), comes to terms with her own sexuality. Stone is terrific, giving King a steely sweetness and a disarming vulnerability. And while some of the overt antediluvian sexism from the commentators drew audible gasps from the audience, the themes 每 equal pay and equal opportunities for women, LGBT acceptance in sport 每 remain depressingly timely.Another powerhouse female lead comes from Jessica Chastain, playing the eponymous central role in Aaron Sorkin＊s directorial debut, . This is pretty much the archetypal Sorkin project 每 a slick firework display of showy dialogue and jostling ideas and a main character with a wit that Chastain wields like a flick knife. Based on a real-life character, Molly is a former Olympic-standard skier turned hostess of unlicensed, high-stakes poker games, who finds herself at the centre of an FBI investigation. While Sorkin indulges in a few too many self-congratulatory segues and flourishes, as long as Chastain is on screen 每 and she＊s rarely off 每 the film has a crackling energy and propulsive drive.The world of sport was a recurring theme at this year＊s festival, which opened with more tennis feuding courtesy of the entertaining . Perhaps more of a long shot in the awards stakes, but one of the hottest tickets of the festival,  stars Margot Robbie as disgraced American figure skater Tonya Harding. The latest film from Craig Gillespie (), this is a deftly handled juggling act of a movie that balances the conflicting accounts 每 and the barefaced lies 每 from the key suspects in the attack on rival skater Nancy Kerrigan. Armed with a bad perm and a gift for profanity, Tonya is a gift of a role for Robbie, who attacks the character with the same forceful, fearless, take-no-prisoners attitude that Tonya brought to her triple axel. Gillespie, meanwhile, pulls off a tricky combination of mining the material for comedy 每 and it is very funny 每 without shying away from the darker elements of Harding＊s story: the abuse, the discrimination and the toxic mother (a magnificently venomous Allison Janney).Another peach of a performance comes from one of several strong British films that showed at the festival. In , Annette Bening plays Oscar-winning Hollywood star Gloria Grahame at the end of her life when she embarked on a relationship with a young actor from Liverpool (an impressive, and unexpectedly buff, Jamie Bell). Bening faces competition on screen from production design that goes all out to capture the true horror of British provincial interior design of the 1970s, but even wallpaper that screams tortured florals is no match for her. She brilliantly captures the allure of a star whose most enduring and consuming role is herself.Of the other British awards contenders, a standout must be Joe Wright＊s take on the events surrounding the Dunkirk evacuations of 1940.  stars Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, newly appointed as prime minister and grappling with the decision of whether to negotiate terms with the Germans or whether to stand firm and possibly suffer catastrophic losses among the troops massed on the beaches in France. This is a film in which words, rather than guns, are the weapons of choice and Oldman, while not an exact match for the jowly physicality of Churchill, captures his slurred but stirring style of oration brilliantly.Oldman＊s blustering, booze-sodden performance, together with Wright＊s visually playful direction, means that even without a single shot of troops on the beaches the film packs in just as much breathless drama as . It also has the bonus of a strand of irreverent humour; essential, given how many scenes involve pompous privileged men in suits holding forth in stuffy, wood-panelled rooms.The extensive showcase of British cinema premiering at the festival also includes Armando Iannucci＊s abrasively hilarious ; Clio Barnard＊s savage rural family drama  and the striking feature debut from Michael Pearce, Iannucci＊s picture is a typically acerbic and cynical look at the jostling power play of the inner circles of government. In this case, however, the government is that of the USSR, thrown into disarray by the death of Stalin. There are many reasons to watch this, but the main one is Simon Russell Beale in the role of Lavrentiy Beria. I can＊t think of a performance more saturated with gleeful malice, nor one I have enjoyed more this festival. is a picture that deals with the legacy of abuse, with Barnard＊s trademark emotional intelligence and sensitivity, to devastating effect. And  channels an earthy, sexy danger into a  premise, set against the conservative backdrop of Jersey. It also showcases a formidable talent, in the shape of compelling star Jessie Buckley.But of all the films in this year＊s festival, my favourite is another directing debut, from actor Greta Gerwig. , starring Saoirse Ronan as a young woman coming of age in northern California, is a joy. A dexterous, agile comedy and a wholly persuasive, fleshed-out character study, this picture announces Gerwig as a significant talent behind the camera as well as in front. Christine, aka Lady Bird (Ronan), is a complex, maddeningly pretentious, utterly endearing character. Like almost everyone else in Toronto, I fell completely in love with her.																																											"

"erhaps the most essential film to premiere on Netflix 每 or indeed any other home entertainment platform 每 in the past week is not one of their much-hyped ※exclusives§. It took a stray heads-up on my Twitter timeline for me to even notice it had landed on the streaming service, after a year of waiting in vain for a UK cinema distributor to pick it up. But Bertrand Bonello＊s , a blackly transfixing daze of a terrorist thriller, is there now and demands your on-edge attention. Told from the side, if not the perspective, of the terrorists, it examines process and consequence with a clear, calm gaze that exacts punishment without judgment, sympathy without pity.Quite what the initially swaggering gang of Parisian youths at its centre are after, as they execute a series of bombings and shootings across the city, isn＊t set in stone, but the vagueness is theirs, not the film＊s. Between them they allude airily to Pinochet＊s Chile and swap revolutionary rhetoric, though their politics are as inchoate as their attacks are meticulous. ＊s first hour mesmerisingly tracks their best-laid worst plans with minimal dialogue and patient Steadicam fascination, a cat＊s cradle built from tension wire.It＊s in the second half, as they shelter overnight from the fallout in a deserted department store, that the gang＊s strategy unravels at a practical and philosophical level. Their semi-ironic capitalist revelling in luxury goods chips away at their righteousness, as the authorities inevitably circle. Bonello shoots it like a dream, an immaculate soundtrack surging at the least expected points: Willow Smith＊s Whip My Hair has never sounded so alien. Shot before the terrorist attacks on Paris of November 2015, it dares us to dismiss it as designer anarchy. Rather, it＊s a diamond-bright inquiry into activism as branding.Two of Netflix＊s self-stamped exclusives landed on Friday. I have yet to see Angelina Jolie＊s much-vaunted Khmer Rouge survival story, , but Yance Ford＊s documentary,  is worthy of?a solo spotlight. A shattering requiem, it laments and probes the 1992 murder of the film-maker＊s brother 每 an unarmed African American killed by a white man in a business argument, with inadequate legal consequences 每 with poetry and biting fury in equal measure. In the course of the film, its focus expands from one devastated family to a countrywide community still stymied by unequal justice.There is truly no elegant segue from this to  (Fox, 15), but ＊s banging, crashing, walloping re-electrocution of the nearly 40-year-old space-chase franchise doesn＊t trade in elegance. Gone is the murky self-mythologising of . It＊s in with trashy, face-hugging, chest-smashing thrills, as a new astronaut crew is terrorised by a familiar strain of beast, and Scott conducts the slithery tension like the old pro he is. It＊s left to  to mix up affairs a bit as deceptively identical androids. He brings a game eroticism and slender streak of camp to proceedings that no one else has thought to add. It＊s by embracing the upgraded B-horror roots of the series, however, that this improbably winds up as its liveliest entry since James Cameron＊s .Of the remaining releases, fans of Jessica Chastain in imperiously stilettoed, get-shit-done mode should make a beeline for  (eOne, 15), though John Madden＊s by-the-book Washington drama, starring the ever-watchable actor as a fierce lobbyist taking on the gun brigade, hasn＊t her conviction. Conventional arthouse pleasures, meanwhile, are on offer in  (Spirit, PG), a milkily handsome biopic of exiled Russian fencing master turned tutor Endel Nelis. Subtitles and Estonian-Finnish provenance notwithstanding, this follows inspirational teacher formula to comforting effect.Rather more special is Swiss animator Claude Barras＊s inspired  (Thunderbird, PG), in which the adorability of its stop-motion figurines barely masks the bittersweet directness of its engagement with childhood trauma. Tenderly following an abused orphan as he finds a place in an institutional community of other young outcasts, it＊s a family film that trusts child viewers with sometimes painful reality, as well as the mollifying powers of empathy. The great Celine Sciamma (, ) had a hand in the script, and?the frank human insight and all-ages maturity of her perspective are felt throughout.																																											"
"The dream of every Antiques Roadshow fan is to be that lucky person who dusts off an object from the attic that turns out to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds 每 or more. However, these moments of TV gold are likely to become even rarer, according to one of the show＊s veteran experts.David Battie, a ceramics specialist who appeared on the first episode of the show in 1978, admitted it was getting more difficult to unearth treasures, given how long the show had been running. ※There are definitely fewer really stonkingly good objects on the Roadshow, which is inevitable, given we＊ve been going for 40 years, sucking them in like a vacuum cleaner,§ he told . Over the years there have been some memorable moments such as the vase a woman bought at a car boot sale for ?1 that turned out to be worth ?30,000 and a vase used as a goalpost that ended up selling for ?668,000.A forthcoming episode in the new series will feature one of the most significant finds in the show＊s history. During filming in June, jewellery expert Geoffrey Munn valued an intricate Faberg谷 ornament at about ?1m. Despite being on the show since the beginning, it was not until 2010 that Battie made a big discovery when a man brought in a large Chinese bronze vase. He dated it to the Yuan dynasty. At more than 700 years old, it was the oldest bronze to be featured on the Antiques Roadshow.He said while extremely rare objects such as that were getting more difficult to unearth, they were still out there. ※We＊re lucky in that in this country that we have more antiques per square foot than anywhere in the world, so I think we have a way to go yet,§ he said.Asked about other memorable moments from his near 40 years on the show, he said a woman once left him a coffee can and saucer from her full service that was dated from about 1800.※She＊d left it to me in her will, saying that because I was so kind and enthusiastic, she＊d like me to have a piece when she died. It sits on a shelf in my bedroom and is one of my very favourite things,§ Battie said.In the interview, he also discussed his admiration for the show＊s presenter,  newsreader Fiona Bruce.※I think Fiona is wonderful,§ Battie said. ※Early in her tenure I wrote her a doggerel love poem in the style of the poets I liked, from Edward Lear to Dylan Thomas. She was probably horrified.§ Battie trained as a graphic designer at art school before working for Reader＊s Digest magazine for three years. He joined Sotheby＊s auction house in 1965 and was later appointed a director of the company. He retired in 1999 and as well as appearing on the Antiques Roadshow he lectures and writes. 																																											"

"One side effect of telling a serial killer story backwards is that it can seem like things are getting better, at least in terms of crime statistics. In Rellik＊s , disfigured detective Gabriel () and his partner Shepard (Jodi Balfour) had seven bodies piled up. Episode two kicks off a whole 16 days earlier, so now 每 or, more accurately, then 每 there are only five horrific murders outstanding.That 16 days might seem rather a large leap, but it does land on another notably tumultuous 24-hour period for poor Gabriel as he crashes around chasing rickety leads while his personal life implodes. Shepard tries a different approach, pulling a sickie to smoke joints, listen to the Style Council and deal with some cryptic family business. Who wore it best? Let＊s piece it together.Nightfall on an anonymous London highway, and Christine (Rosalind Eleazar) 每 the scarred suspect who last time seemed to enjoy telling Gabriel she had been diagnosed as a narcissist with ※unfulfilled psychopathic ideation§ 每 staggers along in thin clothes and bare feet. The juxtaposition of  with visuals that could come from a post-apocalyptic zombie movie seems like a brisk way to reacclimatise viewers to Rellik＊s warped, funhouse-mirror worldview.After a frustrating time at work, Gabriel is surveilling his own house, where wife Lisa (Lark Winther) waits up. Rather than going home, he decides to call on Shepard, who is wearing a spectacular red dress that seems rather unsuited for slobbing round the house. After a brief heart-to-heart, the lovers tentatively reconnect.That＊s when we reset to three hours and 45 minutes earlier. Gabriel barges into Christine＊s housing estate flat and aggressively bundles her into his car. Is this really an arrest? As they drive around, Christine seems uniquely capable of pushing Gabriel＊s buttons, taunting ※waffle face§ about his injuries until he purposefully veers into oncoming traffic for a frighteningly long time.Gabriel wants to know what was on psychiatrist Isaac Taylor＊s laptop and, seemingly chastened, Christine opens up about her abusive father, how her mother decisively dealt with him and how Taylor had recorded all these revelations in their therapy sessions. It is a raw and upsetting performance from Eleazar 每 the sort of intense, extended scene you might expect near the climax of an episode rather than served up early, another side effect of Rellik＊s unmoored timeline. If Gabriel is touched by Christine＊s story, he hides it well, kicking her out to walk home in the twilight.Rewind almost eight hours earlier and Shepard, in that striking red outfit, is the only person at a cremation. Then she sells a gorgeous classic E-Type Jaguar to a baffled geezer for five grand. Elsewhere, Gabriel and the rest of the team pay a rather more official visit to Christine, recovering what seems to be Taylor＊s laptop. Back at the station, Gabriel questions her about the theft but is constantly deflected by Christine, who implies he is persecuting her because of their shared scarring. With the interrogation a bust, Gabriel is summoned by Lisa for a discreet meeting where she shows him her morning post: blurry, black-and-white snaps of Gabriel and Shepard having sex in a park. ※You can see your scorpion tattoo,§ notes Lisa dryly. Is it blackmail? Intimidation? A prank?If you have a scorpion tattoo perhaps you＊re always braced for a sting in the tail but when Gabriel returns to the station, there are fire engines outside. The camera tails him as he stomps up stairs and back to his desk through smoke and coughing co-workers to find that the evidence room 每 and Taylor＊s laptop 每 has been barbecued. As the camera zooms in on keyboard letters shrivelling up under the intense heat we rewind to ＃＃ six-and-a-half hours earlier. Gabriel is talking to a therapist: under duress, it seems, although he does talk about how since he was attacked with acid he feels uncomfortable in his own skin. It is the most vulnerable we have seen the growly sleuth to date, and Dormer sells it to the hilt despite the prosthetics. Then we cut to Shepard, who has apparently called in sick but is just lounging on her bed smoking a joint with a friend. Her father, with whom she had a difficult relationship, has died and she seems to be looking forward to selling his beloved Jag for buttons. She also toys with her friend＊s lighter just a little too long. Could she be a secret firebug?Spool back 11 hours and it＊s the middle of the night, around 1.30am. Gabriel, in bed with Lisa, wakes up from a muddled nightmare and slips off to see Shepard. We learn their relationship has been on hold since he was attacked. ※We can＊t start this again, not after Hannah,§ says Gabriel, ominously mentioning his teenage daughter, who we haven＊t seen all episode.After Gabriel scurries away, Shepard calmly flips through those fateful al fresco sex pics and slides them into an envelope pre-addressed to Lisa. She obviously wants to destabilise Gabriel＊s marriage, but is there a motive beyond reigniting their relationship? Meanwhile, Christine brazenly breaks into Taylor＊s office and lifts his laptop while the alarm blares. Reviewing their sessions, she stops on one of her juicier segments: ※I killed them, I burned them, their families will have to live with that uncertainty for the rest of the lives.§ It seems like an explosive confession, although a final closeup on Christine＊s unreadable face suggests there must be more to it than that.So how does that all look forwards? Gabriel visits Shepard in the dead of night to end their affair, while Christine breaks into Taylor＊s office to steal a laptop. The next day, Shepard pulls a sickie to bury her dad while Gabriel, on a CCTV tip-off, latches on to Christine as a suspect in the laptop theft and perhaps more. The cops recover the laptop, but then someone torches the evidence room. Gabriel, reeling from an intense therapy session and enraged by what seem like blackmail photos sent to his wife, essentially abducts Christine to try and force her to confess. She successfully misdirects him and, angry and drained, he seeks out Shepard for solace. This week＊s cop shop B-plot was an office romance between detective Jenny and receptionist Alex that 每 played forwards 每 began with him preparing to break it off and her revealing she was pregnant and somehow ended up with them being engaged. Are these asides welcome palate cleansers, or just a distraction? So far Rellik has seemed relatively blooper-free, although a sharp-eyed commentator did point out that after seeing the cops enthusiastically bash in the door of last week＊s head red herring Steven Mills his poor wife still seemed to have to unlock it when she returned later that night. Any glaring continuity clangers in episode two?  Christine doesn＊t want to go back to the police station because ※it smells of budget cuts§. Eleazar＊s taunting performance is one of the most delicious in the show. Who even gets a scorpion tattoo?																																											"

"It is hazardous to stand in my garden. Thwack. Thud. Every five minutes, the tree above slings a conker to the ground as if by catapult.Some open their spiny cases on impact. Others can be gently crushed to reveal their gleaming treasure: cool to touch, encased in cream memory foam, and decorated with whorls that resemble a chestnut map of the world.Conkers are not an endangered species but they are disappearing from children＊s vocabulary 每 controversially  a few seasons ago. It＊s an old chestnut that children no longer play conkers, but this autumn＊s bumper crop has two new champions: the writer  and the artist .Their gorgeous new book, , celebrates 20 natural things, from adders to wrens, that have been culled from the dictionary. Macfarlane writes acrostic poems, which he hopes are spells to be read aloud, to conjure up each thing.When Macfarlane and others first objected to the dictionary＊s cull of the likes of kingfisher and newt, lexicographers gave a teacherly retort that it isn＊t a dictionary＊s job to be didactic (true) and these words are no longer common currency, among children, curriculums or literature (false).My young children may not rap knuckles with their 25-ers (each conker＊s number of victories was always an implausible boast in my primary school), but they relish the thrill of discovering what＊s inside each case: sometimes unexpectedly small, sometimes twins, always shining. Like most beautiful pleasures, this is ephemeral: each conker quickly dulls, and collections are discarded.Perhaps if lexicographers are clunked on the head by a falling conker they will realise that many simple wonders they＊ve decided are no longer part of busy urban lives 每 ,  每 are actually thriving, even in cities, and are more numerous than they have been for decades.I hope The Lost Words restores some of these natural treasures back where they belong: in our dictionaries, as well as hearts and minds.It＊s impossible to escape another culled creature in this autumn＊s news.

"William John Bankes, a charming, adventurous aesthete, continued to commission and collect art for the Dorset house he inherited, even long after his forced departure from Kingston Lacy. Now the home, which is owned by the National Trust, is putting on the show as part of  that decriminalised private homosexual acts between men over the age 21 in England and Wales. As part of the exhibition, 51 ropes hang in the entrance hall of the home, representing men hanged for same-sex acts during the lifetime of the house＊s owner 每 their names read out in a recording made by National Trust volunteers and staff.It is a moving, unsettling and powerful installation, and fitting because the house itself is a memorial to Bankes.The Kingston Lacy project may still prove too bold a step for some. The trust faced a hostile backlash after it told the gay story of the owner of Felbrigg Hall in Norfolk, Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer, and then it hit headlines as it emerged it had asked volunteers to describe, or not describe, their own sexual orientation.It was all too much for the journalist Max Hastings, who, writing in the Daily Mail, said he and his wife had John Orna-Ornstein, the trust＊s director of curation and experience, said the Bankes story deserved to be known more widely. ※It was his lack of belonging which makes Kingston Lacy what it is today. We feel it is a really strong, appropriate history to be telling in this place today,§ he said.※There are going to be some people who come here and don＊t like it but that＊s the case with any programming. Anything that is bold and interesting, some people are going to love it and some are going to find it really challenging. I would be more worried if people came to our houses and didn＊t respond.§Prof Richard Sandall, from the University of Leicester, was involved with both projects, and admits he had been bruised by some of the vitriol around Felbrigg, some of which he put down to plain, old-fashioned homophobia.He maintains the squire of Felbrigg Hall was not outed by the project because you cannot out somebody when their sexuality is a matter of public record.A lot of thought went in to it on why it was ※good to be open and truthful about a fact which everybody knows there. It was not a big surprise, we didn＊t out him§, said Sandall.※When you read that it was besmirching his name, you have to stand back and ask why. It is only if you bring a lens which says that is something shameful. It was shameful in his lifetime, it is not now.§He said the negativity had girded him and his team to do the Kingston Lacy project as well as they could. ※We＊ve tried to do it an a way that is creative and emotional, to give more memorable and powerful experiences,§ he said.The fascinating story of Bankes＊ exile is threaded throughout the house and finishes with an LGBTQ timeline and short film interview with the chief executive of Stonewall, Ruth Hunt. There is also a facsimile copy of the 1533 ※Act for the punishment of the vice of buggery§ alongside the 1967 Act and the 2004 Civil Partnership Act.In the house＊s Spanish room, there is a contemporary film telling the stories of people displaced today because of their sexuality.The In Memoriam installation, with the ropes, is particularly effective, listing men aged between 17 and 71 who were hanged for same-sex acts during Bankes＊ lifetime. The last two ropes hang next to each other representing two labourers, John Smith and John Pratt, who were caught together and executed together.It is likely Bankes, described by his friend Lord Byron as ※the father all mischief§, would have suffered the same fate because it was the second time he had been caught with a man. His wealth allowed him to leave and live in France and later Italy, where he continued his mission to transform the house into a Venetian Renaissance palazzo.The Exile project is part of the trust＊s wider  at properties that have LGBTQ stories that are often not known or not highlighted.Orna-Ornstein said he did not want to see anyone leave the trust as members but he made no apologies for telling the stories. ※What we are doing here is telling a history that is integral to the house. The surprising thing would be if we didn＊t engage with it.§Exile will run from from 18 September, the day Bankes went in to exile, until 12 November, with a rainbow flag flown from the property for the duration.

"t＊s one of the defining 每 and in hindsight humiliating 每 images of the 20th century: Neville Chamberlain stepping off the plane from Munich in September 1938 clutching a paper signed by Hitler and, later that day, declaring ※peace for our time§.The Munich agreement came against a backdrop of ultimatums from power-hungry leaders, devious negotiations and 每 unknown at the time 每 a conspiracy to overthrow Hitler with a plot straight from a spy drama. The perfect setting, then, for another thrilling historical novel from .Harris is on sure and familiar ground in  每 he quickly settles into the mid-20th century setting that made  and so compelling, and the claustrophobic feel of the conference carries on from last year＊s exploration of Vatican politics, . Indeed, when Harris was political editor of the in the late 1980s, he made a television documentary to mark the 50th anniversary of Munich: its title, , says everything about how the much-maligned British prime minister is portrayed in his new novel.History has not tended to treat Chamberlain kindly. But Harris is more sympathetic, making an intelligent case for a man who desperately believed he could 每 and should 每 avoid war, but put enough back-up plans in place for Britain to be able to fight one should the worst happen. In , he＊s a more shrewd operator than most historians would allow, undone by events and devious personalities rather than his own decisions.But this is a novel, and against the intriguing backdrop of political machinations and brinkmanship is a thriller plot bursting to get out 每 though it doesn＊t properly kick in until halfway through. A German diplomat, Paul Hartmann, and one of Chamberlain＊s private secretaries, Hugh Legat, turn out to be long-lost university friends. Hartmann, uneasy at the seemingly obvious future direction of Hitler＊s Germany, spies his chance in Munich to let Chamberlain know exactly what the Fuhrer has in mind for Europe. And it doesn＊t include much diplomacy.As Legat works out what Hartmann is trying to do 每 prevent Britain signing or, perhaps more importantly, believing in any kind of Munich accord 每 there are documents secreted in newspapers, guns hidden in toilets, escapes from shadowy Gestapo agents and late-night rendezvous. There＊s a lot of smoking and sweating as they cheerfully admit that they＊re rubbish spies.It＊s almost as if their bafflement at what they＊re caught up in is shared by Harris 每 their escapades don＊t quite work as a thriller in the context of a novel with such a determined fidelity to the facts. It＊s true that some of their set-up mirrors the real-life Oster conspiracy in Germany to kill Hitler, but it＊s not exactly edge-of-the-seat stuff, given the huge plot spoiler called the second world war, which rather restricts the opportunities for tension.Still, Legat and Hartmann do have a higher purpose. It＊s through their eyes that the narrative is structured, allowing Harris to contrast high-level politicking with the consequences of war for the people who will fight it. So Legat is immediately on the phone to his wife when he understands the severity of Hitler＊s threats, telling her to take the children and leave London for the country. Hartmann is horrified by the rumble of a motorised division roaring through Berlin, and has first-hand experience of how the Nuremberg laws are affecting his friends.Effectively, they are well-meaning men 每 with a few demons 每 caught up in a situation they don＊t have the power to change. Harris is brilliant at depicting their world; prewar London, with its anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons and searchlight batteries, is vivid, cinematic. Munich, too, is horrifyingly imperial, huge swastika banners on every building.Most impressively, Harris rarely falls for lazily foreshadowing what is to come for the world; he concentrates on Munich in 1938, and its seismic convergence of corrupt and naive power. But he allows himself one memorable final comment on a man who valued peace. As Chamberlain steps off the plane waving his prized document, Harris imagines a ※jagged black figure at the centre of a great bright light, his arm stretched out, like a man who had thrown himself on to an electrified fence§.

"ike Tommy, the aimless barfly he plays in , the melancholic 1996 indie film he also wrote and directed,  found himself in a spiral of hopelessness after leaving school, jumping from one part-time job to another: cinema usher, ice-cream seller, petrol station attendant. There were many long nights in bars. ※I really had difficulty there [on Long Island] in my last couple of years because I felt like I didn＊t know what I was doing,§ he says. ※I felt my life was going nowhere.§ His father had pushed all four of his sons to take a civil service exam, in Buscemi＊s case as an avenue to a career with the fire service, where he would work for four years.Although he knew he wanted to be an actor, he had only a dim notion of how to realise his dream. It was also his father who suggested he apply for drama school, ostensibly as an interlude until the fire department came calling. At his interview for the  in New York, Buscemi was asked why he wanted to be an actor. He casually parroted his dad＊s well-meaning advice that acting classes would stand him in good stead for whatever path he chose in life. ※I remember her telling me: ＆Well, we really want people who want to be actors,＊§ he recalls. ※In that moment, I felt I really blew it.§ He didn＊t, as it happens, but it taught him not to be so cavalier about the thing he was most passionate about.Buscemi told the story of his Lee Strasberg interview as we sat in a quiet neighbourhood bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn, not far from the brownstone he shares with the artist and filmmaker , his wife of 30 years. The couple have a 27-year-old son, Lucian, who played for the indie band, Fiasco. Buscemi was seated in a wooden booth when I arrived, baseball cap pulled down over his head, a pint of beer at his hand. Like the bar itself, his demeanour was low-key, and unassuming. He talked quietly, the way someone might talk if they were nursing a hangover, but grew more animated as he spoke about his early days as one half of comedy duo Steve & Mark, with  (best known for his role in the outlaw cycle gang drama .) Their shtick was a kind of stream-of-consciousness situation comedy that introduced them to New York＊s then-vibrant performance art scene. Often, they could be found at rinky-dink East Side clubs such as Darinka, where They Might Be Giants was the de facto house band, and no one much cared about fire codes.Downtown legend , famously the first person to enter Sid Vicious＊s room at the Chelsea Hotel after the murder of Nancy Spungen, took the young Buscemi under his wing, helping secure gigs and introducing him to the scene. That version of New York disappeared in the 1990s, vanquished by rising rents,  and the devastation of Aids.His breakout role in 1986 was as a musician dying of Aids in  每 a bold choice for an actor launching his career. ※When I played that character I only knew one person who maybe had Aids,§ he recalls. ※This was right smack in the middle of all that fear and anxiety: ＆Could you get it from somebody by just being in the same room?＊ Of course, later, so many of my friends died of Aids. We lost so many good people in their prime.§ He talks poignantly of , a drag performance artist who dominated the 1980s scene before being diagnosed with HIV and taking his life in 1990. Most of those people have faded from public consciousness, but they hang on in Buscemi＊s memory as the mentors and guides of his career.You feel their animating spirit in his own projects, populated as they are by oddballs and outsiders. He summons a quote by  to the effect that every character in his Christmas classic, , is worthy of his or her own film. ※I tried to keep that in mind as I wrote ,§ he said. ※I thought I was being careful not to romanticise the life of someone who hangs out in a bar all the time, and yet I do find these characters romantic, and I still find bars really alluring.§ He was touched when the owner of the bar they were set to film in changed his mind at the last minute. ※He said: ＆I don＊t think I can close my bar for a week and let you guys film here,＊ and we said, ＆Why?＊ and he said: ＆Where are my regulars going to go? What are they going to do?＊§ That bond with people who depend on each other resonates with Buscemi. On 12 September 2001 he reunited with his old fire unit, Engine Company 55, working 10 hours a day for five days in the rubble of the World Trade Center. It was a way to be useful at a time when being an actor felt like a grotesque whimsy. It was only afterwards that the magnitude and desolation hit him.In 2005, Buscemi went back to his old high school in Valley Stream, a predominantly Irish-Italian neighbourhood, to receive an award. Talking to students he recalled his anxious youth. ※I still get scared,§ he told them. ※I try to live with it, and you keep going.§In , Buscemi＊s charming, little-watched web-only talk show, a telling moment comes during a conversation with the ＊s GZA. The rapper recalls his childhood inspirations, including Don McLean and Neil Sedaka, prompting an elated Buscemi to offer a formative experience of his own. ※I went to the mall and bought some 45s. I ran into a bunch of girls from my school and they reached into my bag and pulled out Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,§ he says. ※I could tell they were embarrassed for me, and I thought: ＆I don＊t care, I like this song.＊§ Something about his response to being shamed for his dubious musical tastes 每 ※I don＊t care§ 每 captures the animating spirit of an actor. Buscemi is among the least pretentious actors you will find, as comfortable working with as with the Coen Brothers. When he describes Sandler as an ※auteur§ he is not doing it to be funny or contrary; he means it. ※We just really hit it off when we did ,§ he says, referring to their first film together, pithily reviewed by  in 1994 as a movie ※about airheads, and for them, too§. Bad reviews, the few there are, glide off Buscemi like water off a duck＊s back. As a rule, it＊s not Sandler＊s movies that fans think of when they picture Buscemi. That honour is more likely to go to his Atlantic City kingpin, ※Nucky§ Thompson, in HBO＊s mafia origins epic , or to his memorable date with a wood chipper in the Coen Brothers＊ snowbound masterpiece, . His tip-kvetching Mr Pink in Quentin Tarantino＊s  transformed both the director and his ensemble cast into touchstones of a new era in independent filmmaking. That film, made for just $1m, defined a 1990s cinematic ※cool§ that would have impressed those girls in the mall 每 if Buscemi cared about such things. It＊s partly because he doesn＊t care, you suspect, that he manages the tightrope walk along the tremulous line of popular and hip, equally at ease in bubblegum fare like  as in cult films like . Buscemi is one of the industry＊s busiest actors, with more than 125 films to his name, and an equally impressive resum谷 in television, from  and  to cameos in  (as himself),  (as a private detective-turned-lesbian drama teacher), and the new Channel 4 series, 每 in which he falls in love with a self-advertising robot in a dystopian vision of marketing gone rogue. There can＊t be many days when he is not working. The director , who has cast Buscemi in several of his films, once joked in the  that Hollywood had a ※Steve Buscemi tax§ to explain the actor＊s ubiquity from the mid-1990s onwards: ※It was like, ＆You want to make a film? You must have Steve.＊§No one could have been more surprised by his catapulting fame than Buscemi himself. Although his passion for acting was cemented early 每 he recalls clambering adorably on to tables at family weddings to crack jokes 每 he spent much of his teens and early adulthood feeling thwarted by circumstances. He got an early taste of rejection when he failed to get cast as the dwarf he had set his heart on in his Catholic school＊s production of . He was seven at the time. ※I was a little crushed,§ he recalls. ※I asked our nun if I could have that part, and she said: ＆Oh no, I＊m giving the part to another kid.＊ She was sweet about it, but I just remember being really disappointed: ＆Oh, this is what life is.＊§ Years later he had a similar epiphany when he started auditioning for movies. ※I remember going in to read for one part and asking the casting director if I could read for the lead, and she looked at me, and said: ＆Oh no, they＊re going to get a name for that part,＊§ he recalls. ※I thought, ＆What is she talking about?＊ And then I realised: ＆Oh, you＊re going to get a name 每 you＊re going to get an actor whose name people know.＊§ Buscemi laughs at his naivety now, but at the time it was another flash of illumination. ※I was like: ＆OK, I have to get a name now, it＊s not enough to be a working actor.＊§ Years of being left on the cutting-room floor 每 in Woody Allen＊s , Stephen Frears＊s , and Gus Van Sant＊s  每 taught him a similar lesson: audition for roles that are too big to be cut.Buscemi has been a name for more than 20 years at this point, yet through a combination of humble origins and insecurity he exhibits almost no ego. When I marvel at his direction of the ※Pine Barrens§ episode of  每 in which the show＊s acute combination of menace and burlesque is on full display 每 he shrugs off the compliment, insisting that any director would have done the same. He tips his hat instead to the writers. This is typical of the way Buscemi views his craft, in which his emphasis is almost always on collaboration, rather than individual genius.※He＊s the opposite of an asshole,§ says , who cast Buscemi in his satirical new movie, . ※On set he＊s very generous and he＊s not taking up anyone＊s time. He＊s almost apologetic when he comes up with a thought.§In that movie, which also stars Simon Russell Beale, Jason Isaacs, Andrea Riseborough and Michael Palin, Buscemi plays Nikita Khrushchev, stealthily coming from behind to take over the sudden vacancy created by Stalin. Iannucci recalls how, during rehearsals, Buscemi would observe and watch but rarely chip in. ※He＊ll only ask little questions, but you can see him going away and just thinking through each moment, and knowing when to turn it up a tiny notch, and then another tiny notch, and then another tiny notch, so you don＊t notice the shift at any one point,§ he says. ※It＊s just when you stand back to look at the whole thing you can see how delicately and cleverly he＊d gradated that transformation.§Riseborough, who has just wrapped a second movie with Buscemi, , concurs. ※He＊s the most humble, down-to-earth, funny, easygoing genius. The sweetest man that I＊ve ever worked with,§ she says. ※He has an enormous amount of gratitude for his work.§The gratitude is genuine. For all his professed angst, Buscemi never doubted his talent. What he fretted over was finding the right opportunity. A few years after the  fiasco, he auditioned for the part of the Cowardly Lion in . ※I knew it was between me and this other kid, and really wanting to do this part so badly, and thinking: ＆It probably won＊t happen, but what will I do when I don＊t get it?＊§Buscemi got the role, and a standing ovation for his efforts, but it did little to quell his fear of being rejected by an indifferent world. ※I don＊t know if it was my dad＊s worldview, or something, but it was about not expecting much,§ he says. ※I＊ve never really analysed it that deeply, but it＊s something that I know is still in me. It hasn＊t stopped me altogether.§ He pauses. ※It did stop the character I play in , but what I find saddest about that character was that he didn＊t seem to have an awareness that there could be a way out.§Shortly before he died three years ago, Buscemi＊s father, the man who set him on the path to acting, had a cameo in the first episode of . Seeing him among the cadre of friends and family that lend the series its distinctive Brooklyn tenor was moving in the way that glimpsing the departed affects all of us. As we drank in the neighbourhood bar, Buscemi 每 who tries to practise meditation every day 每 talked fondly about his father＊s belief in reincarnation and the afterlife. As a child, he would come home to find visiting psychics communing with the dead. One year Buscemi sought out a psychic for a private session, and confided his hopes of being an actor. ※He said: ＆I don＊t really see acting so much as writing 每 writing is what I see for you,＊§ Buscemi recalls, his brow furrowing. ※So, in some ways I feel that I haven＊t fulfilled my true potential.§Electric DreamsThe Death of Stalin																																											"
"rlando Weeks is describing the revelatory moment his father looked at the main character of The Gritterman, Weeks＊s first illustrated children＊s book, and saw his own dead father looking back at him. Although unaware of the resemblance until that very moment, suddenly, Weeks 每 who has spent the last 14 years as the frontman of indie rock band the Maccabees 每 could see it too. ※I wasn＊t consciously basing the Gritterman on my grandad. But there＊s something in the way he looks that you can tell ...§ He trails off, struggling to pinpoint the exact similarities between his character, who spends the winter gritting the roads and the summer selling ice cream, and his grandad Bill, who repaired traction engines and heavy farming machinery in Devon and Cornwall, and who died in his late 80s when Weeks was a young teenager. ※When I knew my grandfather, I felt that he had been a big strong man and now was less of a big strong man. Age had taken some of that broadness out of his shoulders. And there＊s something about the way the Gritterman looks ... there＊s a shadow of a bigger, stronger version of himself, in the past.§The book 每 a touching Raymond Briggs-like story about an old man from a rural, working class neighbourhood, who is being forced by the council to retire from his job 每 might seem a surprising career move. But the public-school educated son of a public affairs consultant studied illustration at Brighton University, and was previously unable to figure out a way to combine his love of drawing and painting with his music career: ※It＊s something I＊m annoyed I didn＊t think of doing sooner.§After the Maccabees  a year ago, Weeks decided to work on a self-contained project to occupy his time before . The Gritterman was the result. It is accompanied by a soundtrack of original piano music and songs, which are written, played and sung by Weeks, and a reading of the book by the comedian Paul Whitehouse, who takes on the character of the Gritterman.Weeks says the project was partly inspired by the similarity between his own circumstances and his father＊s retirement. ※I didn＊t see my dad retire and think: right, I＊m going to write an illustrated book. But I think it definitely played a part, along with beginning to question my own purpose and where my passions lie; thinking about how I fill my time, and seeing how he does. It＊s very difficult, if you＊ve invested in what you do, to allow yourself the freedom of not doing it any more, of not working all the hours that God sends.§ The plot follows the Gritterman on Christmas Eve, as he goes out alone to clear the snow one last time, before he must retire from the job he loves. ※My dad was a lobbyist and worked in the arts. No night shifts,§ he laughs. But when it comes to his grandfather＊s physical, labour-intensive job, he acknowledges the similarities, and the Gritterman＊s passion for gritting, in his trusty old van, seems to reflect Bill＊s passion for repairing traction engines.※Grandad would make his own bolts because no one else made them big enough. There were constantly these enormous greasy cogs on the kitchen table, even though he had a workshop in his shed. It was chaos in there, and it was incredibly cool. I remember it smelt like an engine, of grease. Everything you touched never came off you.§ He recalls how, on his sixth birthday, he was permitted by his grandad to sound the whistle on a traction engine, a type of steam engine once used to move heavy loads on roads and to plough fields. ※At the time, I wasn＊t aware it was such a sweet gesture on grandad＊s part, to let me pull that whistle. But I was the first person to do it, on an engine he had been restoring for longer than I＊d been alive.§ Although he is very close to his parents, he says, he struggled to get close to Bill. ※He was pretty stand-offish. He didn＊t talk much. I don＊t even think I heard him say that many words. He was a gentle presence, and a very quiet man.§ Weeks deliberately made the Gritterman laconic, too. ※The more economical I was with his narration and his monologue, the more licence I had to be expressive and flowery with the songs. I felt I could get away with that because the Gritterman is so closed and bareboned in the way he communicates.§ He also allows his main character to be romantic about snow and winter 每 and then illustrates their isolating effects on a lone individual in an English landscape. ※Hi-vis is not romantic. I don＊t think those spinning lights on vans play into a picture postcard idea of English winter. I liked that. I liked that it wasn＊t obvious.§In his own lifetime, Bill＊s work became obsolete, rather like the Gritterman＊s job in the story. ※Got a letter from the council: Dear Sir... your services are no longer required,§ the Gritterman recounts, adding: ※I read somewhere that there＊s a tarmac now that can de-ice itself. I＊m not sure I want to live in a world where the B2116 doesn＊t need gritting.§On the Maccabees＊ first album, Weeks wrote a song, , about his grandfather＊s death. Listening to it now, the chorus line, ※The engine won＊t start without him§, seems to take on a new significance. Weeks explains the inspiration for the song: ※My grandad left one of his traction engines to a steam museum in Cornwall. In his final years, he＊d go and visit it and help with the upkeep, that sort of thing. On the day he died, my grandmother got a phone call. It was the museum. For the first time, the engine he＊d donated wouldn＊t start.§So what would his grandad think of the book? ※I expect he would ask me: where is the manual where you learned to do this? He would find it odd that you just kind of do it, with your fingers crossed. But I know he would have respected how I feel about my work. And I think he would have been proud of me, and hoped that I was happy. He was a very kind man.§																																											"
"or its autumn season,  is reverting to a format first used in 2004 with a programme of ※§ 每 six short works that each last around an hour, some more familiar than others, each engrossing in its own way. For the opening run in Leeds, they have been given standalone performances that can be booked individually, with two, three or four works being performed on each day; you could see all six in one weekend towards the end of October. For the subsequent tour, they are ticketed as double bills, although you will be able to catch Ravel＊s  on its own at a series of matinees.The programming feels more cautious than 13 years ago, when there were eight operas and a higher proportion of little-known works, including Bizet＊s Djamileh and . This season, Bernstein＊s Trouble in Tahiti is the only genuine rarity, although Jan芍?ek＊s Osud has not received a major new UK production since  staged it in 2002, and performances of Gilbert and Sullivan＊s Trial By Jury have been relatively infrequent in recent years. Ravel＊s exquisite phantasmagoria is familiar enough, as is that best-known of operatic pairings, Mascagni＊s Cavalleria Rusticana and Leoncavallo＊s Pagliacci. (When they are given side by side here, however, the traditional order is reversed, with Pagliacci placed first.)The structure of the 2004 season was dictated by its directors, David Pountney and Christopher Alden, who staged four operas each. The unifying factor this time around is , who has designed all six sets. He also directs Pagliacci, which shared the first evening with ＊s staging of L＊Enfant. Edwards＊ front cloth, used for both operas, shows the singers for the season assembled together. This is very much an ensemble project, with Opera North having drawn its casts from company members and regular guest artists.※You＊ll see a company rehearsing an opera,§ Richard Burkhard＊s Tonio tells us in the  prologue, which is sung in English before the opera is given in Italian. The front cloth rises on a modern-day rehearsal studio, where Peter Auty＊s singer-director Canio is taking a model showing. Edwards＊ designs for the remaining five operas are pinned to the studio walls; the grandfather clock from L＊Enfant can be seen among assorted bits of furniture. Staging the opera as a series of rehearsals is ingenious, but strains against the narrative in places. Silvio (Phillip Rhodes) has become the company＊s conductor, drilling the chorus in their numbers and accompanying ＊s Nedda as she tries out Stridono Lass迄 with a score.The conceit leaves Tonio＊s role unclear at times. The programme designates him ※Canio＊s designer§, yet he also appears in the opera-within-the-opera that we see on stage. Despite such moments of confusion, though, it is utterly compelling. At its best, the staging has the kind of furious, naturalistic power that one associates with Zola. Auty gives a great performance, singing with subtlety yet formidably conveying Canio＊s psychological disintegration, while Pritchard captures superbly the cruelty that lurks beneath Nedda＊s sensuality. It is wonderfully conducted by Tobias Ringborg, too.Arden＊s modern-dress L＊Enfant, its costumes beautifully designed by Hannah Clark, takes a broadly psychoanalytic view, which has its roots in ＊s 1929 study of the work, an extract from which is printed in the programme. We first see ＊s Child in a silent prologue, repeatedly ruining a family selfie, then playing with his iPad instead of doing his maths homework. The objects in his room that turn against him after a tantrum are linked subsequently to the family we saw at the start, so the Fire (Fflur Wyn) that now refuses to warm him looks like his slatternly, chain-smoking elder sister, while Arithmetic (John Graham-Hall), bombarding him with sums, is irritatingly avuncular.This is less heavyweight than it sounds, thanks to Arden＊s impeccable judgment of the work＊s tone, which starts as comedy and darkens as the piece progresses. The foxtrot for the Teapot (Graham-Hall again) and Chinese Cup (Ann Taylor) had the first-night audience in fits, while Quirijn de Lang and Katie Bray make a stunning pair of cats. However, Arden glances throughout at the Child＊s confused half-awareness of adult sexuality. When we leave his room for the garden, the magic turns increasingly troubling as he confronts John Savournin＊s horribly wounded Tree and Rachel J Mosley＊s Dragonfly, sorrowing for the mate the Child has killed. The singing is consistently fine. Giunta gives a deeply touching central performance and conductor Martin Andr谷 brings the score beautifully to life.How the season will develop remains to be seen. But these are exciting, provocative productions that augur well.																																											"
"n what must be a micro evolution for female action heroes, Kim Ok-bin＊s deadly assassin in The Villainess hacks her way through South Korea＊s criminal underworld while remaining fully-clothed and wearing a low heel appropriate for bringing down a wardrobe-sized goon.Like the protagonist of Luc Besson＊s , Sook-hee (Ok-bin) is a street-tough young killer recruited by a government agency with an offer she can＊t refuse: death or gainful employment as an assassin. After a spell at a finishing school for contract killers, she＊s issued with a false identity and released as a sleeper cell. With a body count in triple digits before the opening credits finish, the bloodily inventive fight sequences work better than the emotional scenes here 每 and sensible shoes aside, director Jung Byung-gil doesn＊t bring much new to the genre.

"od芍ly＊s Missa Brevis had its premiere in the cloakroom of the opera house in war-torn Budapest in 1945, with gunshots sounding in the streets outside. Poulenc＊s Mass in G was written in 1937, when the composer was rediscovering his heavily scented religious faith: ※I like an austerity that smells of orange blossom or jasmine,§ he said, which could be a description of this work. These two contrasting masses and Jan芍cek＊s Lord＊s Prayer (Ot?e n芍?) are sung with characteristic ※European§ ripeness of tone and precision by the choir of St John＊s College, Cambridge, with Joseph Wicks and Glen Dempsey (organ) and Anne Denholm (harp). Excellent notes, too, from Richard Bratby and director Andrew Nethsingha.  from this top collegiate choir.																																											"
"he sad clown is a trope as old as drama; think of Shakespeare＊s melancholy fools, with their discarded pearls of wisdom, or the likes of Tony Hancock and Robin Williams, spreading laughter on stage or screen while private pain corroded their lives until it became unbearable. In recent years it＊s been fashionable in standup comedy to use that pain as material, often with the intention of encouraging audiences to talk about difficult issues with an acknowledgment of the black humour they entail.Since Simon Amstell started performing long-form standup 10 years ago, he＊s made a virtue of  with an honesty that many performers shy away from, so it＊s perhaps inevitable that a book should follow. Yet it＊s hard to escape the sense that this particular book doesn＊t quite know what it wants to be. He nods to this in the introduction, explaining that the original suggestion was to publish transcripts of his major standup shows. ※And who for? For people who don＊t like hearing standup out loud?§He＊s right to be sceptical; few things are less funny than a standup routine set down on the page, stripped of every crucial pause, cadence, facial expression and nuance of audience interaction, and Amstell＊s deadpan style is a vital ingredient of his comedy. ※The only way I could think to get out of this situation was to write something new and so horrifically personal that no one could think of it as anything other than an heroic act of self-annihilation.§The result is a sort-of coming-of-age tale that takes the reader through his unhappy childhood and awkward adolescence up to the present, intercut with excerpts from his four previous live shows to illustrate various points. These sections can feel repetitive, especially since the standup often sounds flat on the page and distant compared with the livelier, more confiding narrative voice of the book. But Amstell is a likable, self-deprecating guide to his own flaws, and has spent enough time in therapy to dissect his own navel-gazing with a nicely dry self-awareness.Even when  seems to solve his problems with alienation and depression, he finds reason to worry: ※A wound that needed status to avoid intimacy has been healed. I was healthy, I was in a relationship with someone who had a happy childhood 每 how would I now find the motivation to earn attention from strangers?＊Even in the epilogue, he＊s anxious about whether the book will serve its purpose. ※I wonder what I＊ve left out, if I＊ve gone as deep as I could have with a little more time or distance.§ But  is ultimately a book about the desire to connect; Amstell offers only his own comic, often painful, journey, not as a template but as a kind of therapy: ※It feels good to have all these stories out of my head and in a book where they can＊t confuse me any more. I got them out of me.§Russell Brand is no stranger to making his mistakes in the public eye, but he emphatically does want to teach others the lessons he has learned.  is unashamedly a ※self-help§ book based on the  used by Alcoholics Anonymous and related groups, rewritten in Brand＊s characteristically rococo style to be applied to every kind of addictive behaviour from social media to consumerism, to which we are all hostage to some degree, in Brand＊s view: ※If you＊re like me, you＊ll begin to see that you have learned to live with dissatisfaction, always vaguely aggrieved, believing there is nothing better out there for you. There is.§Those of us who remember Brand＊s last attempt to ※help§ the problem of engagement in politics by  might well approach this latest attempt at intervention with wariness. But one of his endearing traits is that there is no criticism you can level at him that he has not already aimed at himself; he talks of the failure of his ※quest§ as a political campaigner because ※the egoic and venomous energy that＊s in me§ got in the way. When he writes with evangelical zeal about turning around his own addictions, it comes across as well intentioned and heartfelt, but at the same time part of a performance. Brand has always been his own shrewdest observer; his 2013 show was titled  and there＊s a sense that this aspect of his character persists, though it＊s now channelled into a desire to sort out other people＊s problems. ※Me, with my proclivity for grandiosity, I will always favour sweeping change and grand revolutions, wild and wordy statements of intent, martyrdom and?marvels.§So it＊s disarming to find that, behind all the verbosity and therapy-speak, there are glimmers of good sense in here. While the insights are not original, the experience of them is unique, and it＊s Brand＊s own story that gives the book its energy. Whether he really will change the world by example only time will tell; in the meantime, for anyone with an abiding interest in , it offers an entertaining glimpse into the latest stage in his transfiguration. is published by Square Peg (?12.99) and  by Macmillan (?20).

" (BBC1) |  (ITV) |  (BBC2) |  (BBC1)  (BBC2) |  (BBC2) | Those Williams brothers, Harry and Jack, just can＊t seem to catch the breaks. Granted, they were always going to be globally thwarted as ※most successful siblings with the surname Williams§, but it＊s got to be a further cruel blow that two of their exquisitely plotted dramas, surely long in the chin-stroking ponder and either one of which deserves to garner success, were scheduled (with borderline-criminal stupidity, or ditto cynicism) against each other at the very same time on Monday night, chasing precisely the same ratings., the BBC＊s, possibly deserves to succeed the most, but won＊t. Chiefly because the overarching conceit behind the premise, a crime solved in reverse, is, with its fancy-footwork timeshifts and slo-mo reverse photography 每 bullets zipping back out of bodies, fags unsmoking themselves and the like 每 rather hard work for a Monday night. As someone who has spent long flights trying to work out why I＊m so stupid at trying to work out the international date line and where the lost hours go/suddenly appear from, this was a ＃ challenge.

The prosthetic guys deserve a gong. An awful lot will pivot (will have pivoted? Will turn out to have pivoted/been going to pivot? As Douglas Adams pointed out, the major problem with time travel is simply one of grammar) on the sim card found in the cemetery.

They bond nevertheless, in new-found daughterdom and in wry grief.Siobhann Finneran as one of the mums displays an unexpected and gleeful surefootedness for comedy, but the breakout find is  (Beatrice in ) who, as Cathy, dominates every scene with her subtly tremendous mix of unspoken class-horror, and kindness, and just-naughty-enoughness. I＊m already a little in love. Expect 每 hope for, fervently 每 that commission, and an (equally deserved) run on the back-catalogue of Supertramp.In quite savage contrast,  is about a chap called Rob who moves back in with his parents, except 每 they＊ve moved house, and downsized to a caravan park! In Margate! The caravan is small, and he keeps bumping into the furniture! Cos the caravan＊s small!

Only the existence of a locked safe containing compromising evidence could possibly explain why Alison Steadman and Phil Davis lent their undoubted talents to this. Compromising evidence of black-mass sex with long-dead jackals.Gordon Buchanan deserves a statue. On Mull: a glorious marble statue, with big brass balls.

Last night BBC2 tried, yet somehow failed, to pay tribute to 25 years of his show with , but at least reminded us how crucial the series has been, not least for musicians, who tend to raise their game in that fat circular studio and the presence of other musicians. Amy Winehouse, Adele, Gregory Porter, Coldplay, even ubiquitous spud-faced strumster Ed bloody Sheeran, all have Jools to thank, and there were thrilling yet too-short duets with Jamie Cullum, , Hugh Laurie. I could have watched it for about 14 hours. He was also, incidentally, a highlight of the just-gone Proms,  a blitheringly good night in a Prom season not exactly short of them. Are you black or white? Are you male or female? Are you Harry?or Jack? Never mind: just shut up and dance.																																											"
"hat on earth brought on ＊s intense interest in the Queen＊s late sister, ? At the start of his naughty new book about her, he attributes it to Margaret＊s -style appearance 每 ubiquitous, if not exactly chameleon-like 每 in just about every other memoir, biography and diary written in the second half of the 20th century. It is, he writes, like playing Where＊s Wally? or a super snobby form of I-spy: everyone seems to have met this prickly and parenthetical figure at least once, from Kenneth Williams to Evelyn Waugh, Ken Tynan to Elizabeth Taylor 每 a fact all the weirder when you know that the same people were often frequently desperate to avoid her.But perhaps Brown＊s obsession has another, more 每 how to put this? 每 Freudian source. He dishes up a Margaret-related encounter of his own. At school, he tells us, he had a friend called Michael, the second son of a lord and a nice, diffident chap to whose family houses 每 among them a castle in Yorkshire and a stately home in Norfolk 每 he was often invited to stay. It was in the hallway of their grandest place that the incident occurred. Asked to sign the visitors＊ book, Brown leafed nosily through it, at which point he discovered a photograph of Margaret, posing in the same hallway in which he stood, resplendent in a blue frock and fixed smile. Beside her was Michael＊s older brother, William, looking unremarkable save for one thing. The ※downward trajectory§ of the fabric of his trousers was, his pal couldn＊t help but notice, being ※sent askew by a bluff diagonal§. It seemed that at the moment the camera＊s shutter clicked, poor William had been struggling to contain a teenage erection.When people write of how this or that book made them laugh out loud, I＊m suspicious; even in the presence of Pooter or  and his madrigals, my hoots tend to be inward. But as I read Brown＊s riff on the unfathomable appearance of this image in a toff family＊s social record 每 ※did she [William＊s mother] notice that something was awry, but decide to go ahead and paste the whole photograph in regardless 每 lock, stock and, as it were, barrel?§ 每 I honked so loudly the man sitting next to me on the train dropped his sandwich.Partly, this was simply because it was funny: never before has a bulge in a pair of chinos been on the receiving end of so searching an analysis. (Brown＊s disquisition ranges from the natural reticence of the English upper classes to their stubborn pragmatism in the matter of wasting precious pages in visitors＊ books: ※They had left a large space＃ for a photograph of William and , and they had no alternative detumescent photograph up their sleeves to put in its place.§)But mostly it was because is fascinating. In its tiara-ed grip, I was unbound, released; total absorption left me as wanton and unselfconscious as Tony Armstrong-Jones 每 AKA , HRH＊s preening, spiteful husband 每 after too many martinis. Which was probably just as well, given my head was stuck, for all to see, inside an improbably huge book about Princess Margaret.Brown has done something amazing with : in my wilder moments, I wonder if he hasn＊t reinvented the biographical form. Subtitled , it is described by his publisher (which, infuriatingly, hasn＊t given him an index) as ※kaleidoscopic§. But this doesn＊t do it justice. It is a cubist book, a collection of acute angles through which you see its subject and her world (and, to an extent, our world) anew.As Brown notes, Margaret wore her rudeness as Tommy Cooper did his fez: it was her trademark 每 the bitchier of her showbusiness friends actively longed for her to parade it at their parties so that they could roll their eyes afterwards. (※I hear you＊ve completely ruined my mother＊s old home,§ she once said to an architect who＊d been working on Glamis Castle. Of the same man, disabled since childhood, she also asked: ※Have you ever looked at yourself in the mirror and seen the way you walk?§) But if she is ghastly, her court is worse. The groupies, the servants, the lovers. What a bunch of creeps.Brown＊s 99 glimpses comprise essays, lists, catalogues, diaries, palace announcements, newspaper cuttings and interviews, as well as parodies (one is a pastiche of ; another echoes ; yet another, in which Brown imagines how things might have gone had Margaret married her admirer Picasso, is written in the style of the artist＊s biographer, ).His reading has been prodigious: not only the diaries of everyone from to , but dozens of gruesome royal biographies and memoirs, up to and including  by her former footman, the slithering David John Payne. Oh, how the sinister Payne loathes the arrival in Ma＊am＊s life of the slugabed snapper Armstrong-Jones 每 a character whom Brown introduces, incidentally, with a list of the contents of his Rotherhithe bachelor pad (golden cage containing three lovebirds; miniature brass catafalque; stand in the shape of a Nubian boy).Together, these things conjure Margaret in all her dubious glory.  likened her to a ※hedgehog covered in primroses§, but the reader will come to feel this is unfair to hedgehogs. The relationship with Group Captain Townsend is deliciously done: Brown doesn＊t buy the schmaltz, lining himself up instead with Prince Philip, who said sarcastically, when the Queen Mother worried about where a future Mrs Townsend might live, that it was ※still possible, even nowadays, to buy a house§.So, too, is the peculiar union with Roddy Llewellyn 每 ※[like] the put upon hero of a picaresque novel§, he writes, Margaret＊s hapless young lover having, in quick succession, joined a commune, recorded an album and pranged his Ford Transit. But best of all is his portrait of Snowdon, hair and all, whose baiting of Margaret comes close to gaslighting at times.What a cast this book has. I cannot say whether I was more fascinated by Jeremy Thorpe＊s conviction that he would marry Margaret, or the notion that, in the Mustique years, she frolicked with a criminal, , who was said to have been able to either 每 take your pick 每 balance a small sherry schooner on or dangle five half-pint glasses off his erect penis.However peculiar, though, none of these things comes close to the eerie penumbra cast by Margaret herself. How to explain the utter rottenness of her character? In the end, one feels it must go back to her , the stench of which brings to mind scent left too long in the bottle. As Hugo Vickers, that most smoothly diligent of royal biographers, noted, the Queen Mother＊s ※demonic§ appearance at Margaret＊s funeral in 2002 suggested a just hint of triumphalism. Even after she＊d decided to cling to her royal privilege, her daughter always had more in common with the Duke of Windsor than ever she realised. by Craig Brown is published by Fourth Estate (?16.99.

The facts are still unknown as authorities continue to investigate what happened,§ its statement said. The Narcos series is about the rise and fall of Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. Its fourth season will reportedly focus on the Ju芍rez drug cartel in Mexico.Mu?oz had worked on films such as Man on Fire, Mel Gibson＊s Apocalypto and the fourth film of the Fast and Furious franchise.There are fears in the Mexican film and television industry that planned productions could now be moved from the country after the killing of Mu?oz.A friend of Mu?oz said that on Monday he drove to the location to take some photographs for Netflix. The circumstances that lead to his death are still unknown, but Mu?oz＊s body was found hours later in his compact car, having been shot several times.His car was found on an unnamed dirt road in the community of San Bartolom谷 Actopan, in the municipality of Temascalapa.

"When Phoebe Bridgers was growing up, her taste in music went ※completely backwards§. The 22-year-old singer-songwriter, who grew up in Pasadena, Los Angeles, was seriously into classic rock and folk as a kid. The first concert she really remembers was , when she was 11. ※But when I hit high school, and emo was already basically over, I was like: ＆Wait! I can＊t believe I missed this, this is awesome,＊§ she laughs. She made herself a  T-shirt and dyed her hair several shades of bright, before finally shaving it and then returning to the bleached blond she is today.There are hints of both Young and her emo past in the music she＊s making now, an intricate tapestry of rock, folk and intensely personal storytelling that calls to mind early Bright Eyes. Funeral tells of singing at the funeral of a boy she knew who had died of a heroin overdose, while last year＊s Killer is a testament to the morbid anxiety of obsessive love. ※Once in a blue moon I＊ll have some sort of concept song or it will be about a bunch of different things, but yeah, it＊s all from experiences,§ she says.After a couple of years of writing and performing around LA 每 including one gig in a pizza parlour near her house, to which her family and friends would show up every week 每 Bridgers was at the cinema watching , when , who had heard of her through a mutual friend, texted to invite her to his studio. ※We hung out all night and he was like: ＆Come back tomorrow at 4pm.＊§ She was sceptical that it would happen, but Adams was true to his word. ※We get there the next day and Ryan＊s there already. We recorded in half an hour, got food, then went to the record store.§ The subsequent seven-inch was Killer, which came out on Adams＊s label Pax Am in April 2015.At around the same time, Bridgers supported  at a secret show at LA＊s Bootleg Theater. The two became email friends, sending each other new songs, and there was a further connection through Bright Eyes＊ Mike Mogis, who mixed her debut album in Omaha. The two are now firm friends, and she＊ll be on tour with him again this month when that debut album comes out on Dead Oceans. Stranger in the Alps shows off Bridgers＊s talent for combining haunting melodies with oddly unsettling lyrical conceits; she is, she says, only getting more literal in her storytelling. ※It＊s getting like: ＆Oh my God, I＊m just saying what＊s happening.＊§ There＊s some emo left in her yet, then? She smiles: ※I mean, I＊m still an angsty teenager.§																																											"

Narrated by Christopher Eccleston, this film reflects on the attack and the response that followed. Relax, they＊ve not ruined it.

"The most celebrated history book in the English language has its own famous founding myth:Edward Gibbon almost certainly contrived this fanciful recollection, but the scholarship that went into his  still stands, like a timeless Roman ruin: majestic, elegant and even sublime. An object of awe, Gibbon＊s history unfolds its narrative from the height of the Roman empire to the fall of Byzantium. The six volumes (published between 1776 and 1788) fall into three parts: from the age of Trajan to ※the subversion of the western empire§ in 395 AD; from the reign of Justinian in the east to the second, Germanic empire, under Charlemagne, in the west; and from the revival of this western empire to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. In so doing, Gibbon traces the intimate and profound connection of the ancient world to his own, more modern time, linking more or less explicitly the age of the Enlightenment to the age of Rome.Gibbon may have been an amateur historian (his life was otherwise devoted to nurturing his family＊s considerable wealth, and to serving in the militia), but his erudition is staggering. It was commonplace in Augustan England of the 18th century to refer to Virgil, Ovid, or Plutarch. Gibbon alludes to passages in Strabo, Sallust, Seneca, Macrobius and Longinus, among many others.Next to his learning, there＊s his style, whose later devotees include both Winston Churchill, ( in this series), and Evelyn Waugh. ※It has always been my practice,§ wrote Gibbon, ※to cast a long paragraph in a single mould, to try it by my ear, to deposit it in my memory; but to suspend the action of the pen till I had given the last polish to my work.§is a cathedral of words and opinions: sonorous, awe-inspiring and shadowy, with odd and unexpected corners of wit and irony, concealed in well-judged footnotes. For example, in chapter VII on Gordian, he writes:His footnote provides a witty coda: ※By each of his concubines, the younger Gordian left three or four children. His literary productions were by no means contemptible.§He was also happy to disavow any consequence to this immense undertaking: ※History is, indeed, little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortune of mankind.§ Gibbon also liked to season his narrative with pithy asides. For example: ※Conversation enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school of genius.§ And again, in chapter VIII: ※All taxes must, at last, fall upon agriculture.§ Sometimes, Gibbon is almost the equal of Tacitus in his brutal summaries of the historical process: ※Corruption, the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty.§And then there＊s his intellectual background, as a scholar steeped in the age of reason. Gibbon famously blamed Christianity for the disintegration of the Roman empire:However, here and there, as in his account of Constantine＊s conversion, he grudgingly allows for the benefits of religion, too:After several rewrites, with Gibbon ※often tempted to throw away the labours of seven years§, the first volume of his  was published on 17 February 1776, less than six months before the US declaration of independence, a famous climax to the revolution in the American colonies, and a more than passing coincidence. Two months after the first publication of the first volume of this colossal classic, Gibbon boasted to his stepmother about his work＊s reception: ※It has been very well received, by men of letters, men of the world, and even by fine feathered ladies.§It is, in other words, a work of universal interest, and timeless influence, unquestionably a magnificent classic of our literature. Gibbon＊s own farewell to his masterpiece is almost more affecting than his celebrated account of its genesis:Edward Gibbon, (1796)Winston Churchill,  (1956-58)David Womerseley, (1988)  by Edward Gibbon is available from Penguin Classics in three volumes, along with an  (?12.99).

"?It has brewed for three decades. The seeds were planted in 1986 when I first went to Yugoslavia, as a Four Corners reporter, looking for evidence of Nazi war criminals who＊d concealed their dark history and come to live in Australia. Had they remained underground and kept their secrets they might not have been detected but some of them chose to cause trouble here. One such character was a Melbourne man called Srecko Rover. A wartime officer in the murderous Ustasha, Rover founded the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood in Australia. That highly secretive brotherhood organised terrorist activities in Australia, including bombings, intimidation, extortion and the training of foreign fighters for armed incursions behind the iron curtain. In archives in Zagreb and Sarajevo we found documented proof of his war crimes in 1941. Back then, the Nazi-backed Ustasha regime was run by the self-styled Poglavik, a Croatian f邦hrer, called Ante Pavelic. The Pavelic regime was so pathologically brutal in its campaigns of ethic cleansing and religious persecution that even their SS military advisors were appalled. Rover had commanded a so-called mobile court martial, which roamed the Bosnian countryside murdering opponents. The Ustasha in Sarajevo, Rover＊s hometown, were active participants in the Holocaust, working with the German Nazis to round up and exterminate that city＊s long-established and thriving Jewish community.  It struck me as extraordinary that such a person could have been allowed to settle here and then create an Ustasha-style brotherhood. I thought a great deal about the young men he had indoctrinated, some of whom were sent to their deaths in the 60s and 70s on missions to stage armed rebellions deep inside Yugoslavia, against Tito＊s communist regime. I thought that, getting inside the heads of these men would best be accomplished in a novel. So, these were the seeds of The Twentieth Man. They would take root five years later when I went as a correspondent to cover the collapse of Yugoslavia and the brutal wars that resulted. Not so tricky really. History tells us that in June of 1972, 19 heavily armed men hiked over the Austrian Alps and crossed the iron curtain into Yugoslavia. Eleven of them were Australian citizens or residents, trained in this country for their mission to stage an uprising against Tito＊s communist regime. They were detected by the Yugoslav military and eventually trapped on a mountain called Radusa, in southern Bosnia. After a series of running battles they were all either killed or captured. The survivors were tried in Sarajevo and executed. It was rumoured at the time that there was a 20th man who escaped that fate. This imagined figure is the subject of my title.?I became a London-based foreign correspondent soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and spent much of the next three years reporting the collapse of communism in eastern Europe. The longed-for freedom had unforeseen consequences, especially in the former Yugoslavia where nationalist aspirations and old religious animosities fired up conflicts on Europe＊s border more brutal than anything since world war two. I was plunged into it as a journalist just five years after travelling there for Four Corners and I watched as young men flooded in, drawn to this conflict from the Yugoslav diaspora in Australia, Canada, Britain and the United States. Some were incredibly brave and noble in their aspirations but others, including both Serb and Croat Australians, would commit terrible war crimes. Mark Twain once said that history doesn＊t repeat itself but it rhymes. I saw, or rather heard, those rhymes during that terrible conflict and the idea of writing this novel, and its sequel, really began then to form in my head.I can＊t speak for those others except to say that I imagine, like me, they have been reading novels all their lives and love them. I make no claim here to any literary comparison (obviously) but one of the greatest novelists of all time, Leo Tolstoy, began his writing career as a war correspondent, setting out his terrible experiences in the Crimean war in a slim volume called The Sevastopol Sketches (it makes a fleeting appearance in my novel when the protagonist Marin Katich pulls it out of his backpack). I understand why Tolstoy was inspired to shift from journalistic reporting to fiction. Fiction frees you from the constraints of journalism, it allows you to enter the minds of your characters and gives you an unlimited canvas on which they can live and act.Yes, but if you put her on the scales she probably outweighs all of the male characters put together. I once joked that I was tempted to call my book ※The Girl With the Hammer and Sickle Tattoo§, although in truth, despite her admiration for her communist father, Anna would have scoured that emblem off her flesh after the Soviet tanks rolled into Prague in 1968. She is a young, Jewish, radical thinker, an early adopter feminist, a leader in the anti-Vietnam war movement and an accomplished student newspaper editor. When recruited into the ABC she is forced to confront misogyny in the boy＊s clubs that the news and current affairs divisions were in the 1970s. Ask any of women who worked there at the time and I＊m sure they will confirm that they confronted a male-dominated world and an often hostile one. Some of the terrible indignities suffered by Anna are based on the reminiscences of my female colleagues. We are not like that anymore, thank God, as you can see from the ranks of our on-air presenters and senior editorial staff in today＊s ABC, but back in the dark ages of steam-radio, well, the past is a different country.Since 1986 I＊ve been back and forth to what was once Yugoslavia many times. During and after the conflict in the 90s I travelled to many regions as a reporter. I lived for some time in 1996, with my wife Sarah and our two-year-old son, in a town called Rovinj, on the Croatian coast and it was there that I began to write and research this novel and its sequel. The war was not over then and that beautiful fishing port was a place of rehabilitation for Croatian soldiers, damaged both physically and psychologically. I went back there again recently, and while I＊m not surprised by it, I felt that the redolence of violent conflict still clings to the place, despite its incessant summer partying. It seemed to me there was a kind of desperation to prove that the past is forgotten and all is well with the present.No, I won＊t be appearing as a writers＊ festival panellist, we have far more accomplished people to choose from. As to being on the other side of the microphone and answering the questions of smart readers, I felt rather exposed. As the book tour progresses, I＊m getting more used to it but I＊m far more comfortable asking questions than answering them.Ah, Lionel Murphy! Now there＊s a character you＊d be unlikely to see in modern politics. As attorney general Murphy was a radical reformer who changed the country in fundamental ways 每 no-fault divorce, the Trade Practices Act, freedom of information legislation, the Senate committee system 每 these were just some of the changes he inspired. But he was also responsible for the most reckless act in the early days of the Whitlam government, one that gave his conservative opponents much-needed momentum after their demoralising defeat. Murphy＊s fabled ※Asio raid§ in March of 73 is a key part of my narrative. We go with Murphy, and his confederates, commonwealth police and staff, on the wild ride that ends up at the St Kilda Road headquarters of Asio. It was an act that resonated all the way to Langley, Virginia where the CIA＊s counter-intelligence chief James Jesus Angleton became convinced that the Australian Labor government were a bunch of socialist renegades, prepared to put at risk ※the crown jewels§ of western intelligence. History has largely forgotten that Murphy was trying to foil an assassination plot and believed that his security service was concealing vital information from him. That assassination plot is what drives my novel to its conclusion.There is, as I＊ve forecast, a sequel to The Twentieth Man so if you are engaged by Marin and Anna, and their most unlikely romance, you＊ll find that their history is far from over. Hopefully, that＊s also true of my long history with the ABC. Anna Rosen spent almost an hour on the phone tracking down contacts while monitoring the radio coverage of the bombing. Then she rang McHugh at the office.※Hi, Peter, I＊ve made some calls 每 .§ McHugh interrupted. ※What are you hearing?§He sounded jittery and Anna registered something else in his voice. She knew that journalists were not the most admirable of creatures. Their first reaction when broken bodies and severed limbs were strewn through the city was not revulsion; it was excitement. She heard it in Peter＊s voice now and was surprised to find that she felt the same impulse.※It＊s hard to get on to people because of the panic,§ she explained. ※But I＊ve spoken to a few close to the Croats. Most are too scared to say much, but no one＊s in any doubt who did it. I got through to Marjan Jurjevic and he straightaway blamed the Ustasha.§※Jurjevic?§ McHugh said, scrolling back through a long list of Balkan names in his head. ※The whistleblower?§ ※That＊s right, he＊s in Melbourne. Marjan Jurjevic. He＊s not a neutral commentator. A left-wing Croat who hates the Ustasha; he＊s the one they keep trying to kill. They＊ve branded him a traitor.＊＊※I remember now-brave bastard.＊＊※Yes, he is. Anyway, Marjan told me something very interesting. He got information last night, obviously before anyone had a clue what was about to happen in Sydney, that Ustasha terrorists had just hijacked a Scandinavian airliner in Stockholm. They＊re demanding the release of the six Croats held in Swedish jails.＊＊※What, the same fellows you＊ve been looking into?＊＊※The same ones. The men they want the Swedes to set free areall members of the cell that assassinated the Yugoslavian ambassador in Stockholm earlier this year. Now, remember what my commonwealth police source told me?＊＊※That there＊s an Australian connection?＊＊※Exactly. The Swedes contacted our police months ago to pass on intelligence that the embassy killers have links to the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood in Sydney.＊※OK,§ said McHugh, considering the implications. ※So are you saying the Sydney bombs and this Swedish hijacking are connected?＊＊※Not me; Marjan Jurjevic is. He＊s convinced of it because of the timing. And listen to this. First thing this morning he rang Special Branch in Melbourne to warn them to keep watch up here because something could happen. Then the bombs went off in Sydney.§She could hear McHugh breathing heavily as he contemplated the new information.※Have you spoken again to your police source?§ he asked. ※No, I only have his office phone and it just rings out. It＊s Saturday of course, but I＊ll bet he＊s on his way to Sydney.§McHugh had heard enough. ※OK, Anna, this is what we＊re going to do. I＊m going to bring your program forward to Monday night. That gives you 48 hours. We＊ll open a slot at 9pm. We can＊t sit on this material. Too many other journalists will be crawling all over this story and right now you＊re ahead of them.§Anna bit her thumbnail. This was what McHugh was famously good at: backing his judgment, setting the agenda and trusting his people to do the job.※So, what do you think?§ McHugh pressed. ※Can you do it?＊＊※I can, Peter, but I＊ll need to go down to Melbourne as soon as possible. The attorney general has agreed to do a fresh interview with me tomorrow morning and I want to get Jurjevic on tape while I＊m down there.§McHugh paused. He realised she had anticipated his decision. ※You＊ve spoken to Greenwood＊s people already then, have you?＊＊※Yeah, I figured you＊d want me to do that.＊＊※You＊re right, well done. Let＊s get you on a plane tonight. We＊ll organise flights and a hotel for tonight, and book you a Comcar for tomorrow.＊＊Sure: she tried not to sound overwhelmed. ※I can＊t just do the government, though.＊＊※Right, we＊ll need the opposition.

"On Valentine＊s Day 1994, hitman Lindsey Rose murdered Kerrie Pang and Fatma Ozanal in a Sydney massage parlour. Five years later he pleaded guilty to five murders in total.Campbell McConachie was just a teenager when he first met Rose six years earlier, at a pub in Sydney＊s inner west. He only knew snippets of his drinking buddy＊s various and past lives, which comprised brothel owner, drug dealer, ambulance officer, private investigator, car thief, hijacker, volunteer fire fighter 每 and arsonist 每 and mercenary. As McConachie recalls in his new book, The Fatalist: ※When I first drank beer with Lindsey he＊d already killed three people. Oh, we had no idea. He＊d walk into the front bar of the Burwood Hotel and he＊d scan the room. To the eyes he met and knew he＊d nod a hello, or perhaps he＊d bellow it if it was late-night noisy, and if I＊d looked up from the form guide or the pool table I＊d look away and hope it was me he came to talk to. He was ebullient and he would give you his full attention.§During the course of 25 visits to Goulburn＊s High Risk Management Unit 每 better known as Supermax 每 McConachie interviewed Rose about his life and crimes. Of their first meeting there, he describes a man who ※zips his lips a couple of times when about to mention people or actions that could incriminate others. He＊s perfectly comfortable with who he is and what he has done and he tells me a myriad of stories, often punctuated with his infectious, wheezing laugh, his chin drawn down into his throat. But some of his stories involve the misfortune of others 每 his victims 每 and I stop myself from joining him in laughter.§The Fatalist is McConachie＊s first book. Here, he describes the logistics and ethical quandaries of not only profiling a murderer, but giving him a microphone by printing his letters. Campbell McConachie: Yes 每 a concern for the victims＊ surviving family members. I really can＊t imagine the enduring grief from losing a loved one to violent murder. A homicide victims＊ support organisation told me that most people would prefer to be left alone and not reminded of their grief. They contacted one survivor on my behalf and, quite understandably, that person declined to be interviewed. So here I am giving Lindsey a voice 每 a voice he uses to set out the shortcomings of two of those victims who he believes ＆deserved it＊ 每 when those murdered people have none. Halfway through the writing it struck me, as Janet Malcolm put it [in her book about ethics in reporting, ], that perhaps what I was doing was morally indefensible. To carry on, I convinced myself that my intentions at least were good 每 that some helpful insight may arise from understanding how someone can turn into a violent murderer.He was gregarious, energetic and exuded self-confidence. I was still a teenager when I first met him so in my eyes he was like the popular boy in school.I did a lot of reading on criminal psychology and psychopathy, including Robert Hare＊s book Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us 每 and his psychopathy checklist. I know what you mean about the charm and charisma 每 the other seminal work on psychopathy is called The Mask of Sanity for that very reason. The outward persona exuding confidence and charisma can be a mask hiding the damaged person behind. That＊s not to say that Lindsey is necessarily a psychopath though, and in the book I explore this uncertainty a little further.As a layperson I was only prepared to 每 and able to 每 go so far. Lindsey was a paramedic so he has some clinical foundation, and he is quite self-aware. He wrote letters to me with quite startling insights into the transformation of his attitude to the world, and I＊ve included some of those letters in the book.I sent him a few chapters to review along the way 每 mostly the stories about his upbringing and time in the ambulance service. There were certain logistical sensitivities with a lot of the other material 每 so much of the book he still hasn＊t read.Well, that＊s certainly part of his internal narrative: that he stood up to bullies, thought he was making the world a better place. I can see how he came to that world view, but I wouldn＊t say I empathise with it. I＊ve been careful not to editorialise 每 the reader is left to make up their own mind about what to feel about him.He isn＊t the narrator in the book 每 but I know what you mean. It＊s a good question because it was important to me to have that doubt 每 that perhaps all is not quite as he has said 每 so I＊ve left hints in the narrative so the reader can make up their own mind what to believe. Having said that, I think he was generally truthful, but there＊s that whole thing about the limitations of human memory and unconscious bias ＃ I think we have a tendency to parse our memories through our established self-narratives rather than the other way around.His stated reason is: ※The cops, the judiciary and the media all got it wrong. I thought if anyone could tell it right it would be you.§ Part of the context here is that he believes he was portrayed as a hitman, whereas the reality is more complicated than that. One imagines he has other motivations.We are still on good terms. I visited him recently and we discussed the pending book launch. ※I＊ve included your point of view,§ I told him, ※but I have to warn you, it does not reflect well on you.§ ※Fair enough,§ he shrugged, ※I did kill five people.§																																											"
": A headless torso floated down a river in a Mumbai slum. Had Deepak Parrikar, whose smouldering good looks meant he was often referred to as ※the Indian Vince Cable§ in the newspapers, looked down from the penthouse office of his arms technology factory with a pair of binoculars, he might have seen the body. But he didn＊t. So there we are. Inspector Mankad shrugged. It was immediately obvious the victim had links to terrorism and was involved in a global plot to take over the Parrikar factory at a time when relations between  were at their most tense for decades, but because he was only a minor character whom readers would soon forget, he didn＊t see any point in mentioning his suspicions to anyone.: Kate Thompson was one of the most beautiful and able workers in the safe Conservative seat of Surrey Heights. Yet she had a dark secret. No one knew that she was really a Lib Dem voter who had got fed up with her party＊s stance on Brexit. On a warm summer＊s afternoon, a member of Conservative central office approached her. ※We＊d like you to be the new MP for this constituency,§ the man said. ※The PM is going to call a general election very soon before the Brexit negotiations get too difficult and we think you＊d be a perfect candidate.§※What about the general election in ?§ she replied.※I think you＊ll find that never happened.§A month later, Kate took her seat in the Commons. She wasn＊t happy that the general election had brought in so many more hardline Brexit Conservative MPs and she still rather wished she was a Lib Dem, but she would do her duty.: Calum McKenzie was a free-thinking Lib Dem who was boss of his own aircraft technology company. That morning he had received a visit from a government fixer telling him he was to form a partnership with Parrikar Avionics. Calum had his suspicions that all was not as it seemed but the deal sounded good for the workforce. Calum＊s financial controller, Shaida, was worried that her brother Mo was being radicalised at the local mosque and asked Steve, the union rep and Labour party activist, to have a chat with him. Steve, who was also a Lib Dem at heart, was happy to because he was deeply attracted to Shaida though he understood the difficulties a modern Muslim woman could face going out with someone who wasn＊t of her faith.: The PM had been forced to resign for reasons that weren＊t quite specified, but which Kate suspected had something to do with some hasty rewrites after the snap election of 2017 that had both happened and not happened. The new PM wanted to fast-track Kate as a trade minister. ※We need you to go to India to smooth out a trade deal between Parrikar and the British firm,§ said her boss who wasn＊t nearly as capable a business secretary as .The visit was a huge success and Kate and Deepak had made deep and passionate love as they talked over the Lib Dem manifesto. ※You really are the Indian Vince Cable,§ she had moaned, feeling as if a dam had burst within her.: On her return to England, Kate had been caught in a protest by some arms protesters outside the British factory. ※Damn,§ said Calum. ※That means the deal is probably blown. I should always have suspected Justin, my head of security, was leaking information when I discovered he voted Brexit and was a paedophile.§ Kate went back to London where she made vigorous, enthralling love to Deepak who had flown to England for the night. Unbeknownst to her, the paparazzi were watching her movements. ※I＊m afraid you＊re going to have to resign,§ said the PM.: Over the next 180 pages, events became even more confusing as minor characters would drop in and out of the story to no real purpose. ※The reason it＊s confusing,§ said the Red Admiral, ※is because I＊m a double agent.§※Well, I＊m a double-double agent,§ said Liam, who voted Lib Dem.※I＊m a double-double-double agent,§ said the sheikh, who then died.※No one knows who I am,§ said Desai, ※not even me.§※I＊ve just been kidnapped,§ said Deepak.※That＊s awful,§ sobbed Kate.※It＊s OK, I＊m free now,§ Deepak murmured from intensive care.: Kate was told she was to be a minister again. ※Don＊t worry about the aircraft deal any more,§ said the business secretary. ※Both companies have now been taken over by a shadowy American company called Global. What we now want you to do is sell an aircraft carrier to India.§※I＊m sorry,§ Kate said on her return. ※I＊ve failed.§※Never mind,§ replied the minister. ※We never expected you to succeed.§: Shaida was desolate. She and Steve had been unable to stop her brother becoming a terrorist and he had been shot dead in a failed attack on an arms convention that Kate had been attending.※This is all a bit of a mess,§ Kate concluded as the Indian Vince Cable pushed her to yet another orgasm.※Too right,§ said Deepak. ※But at least we can be secret Lib Dems together.§ Vince＊s balmy army.

"he constricting cloak of time has hung heavy upon our shoulders these last few weeks.  for repairs, bringing a bemused gathering of mourners to Parliament Square to capture its last chime on their phones. The  reminded us of a broader timescale, and how we once used to set our daily clocks before Big Ben, and before the factory and the train. And then there were the usual shenanigans from the travel and sporting desks: a four-hour delay on the M6; Shahid Afridi hitting the year＊s  for Hampshire; Manchester City snatching victory over Bournemouth seven minutes into injury time.I thought about temporal things as I took the four-and-a-half-hour train to the Edinburgh international book festival. One of the things I considered was: am I wasting my time attending it? I could have been watching the multiple time-slips of  at the cinema again; I could have been reading in the garden; I could have tidied the shed (obviously I was never really going to tidy the shed). But there I was, telling time stories against the clock. I read a passage from my book, :※We crave punctuality but we loathe deadlines. We count down precisely on New Year＊s Eve so we may obliterate the hours that follow. We pay for Speedy Boarding so that we may sit on a plane and wait for everyone else to board, and then when we land we pay to get fast-tracked. We used to have time to think, but now instant communication barely gives us time to react. Paradise is a beach and the eternal waves and a good book, but then there＊s email. Why not save time with Apple Pay? Why not experience ultrafast speed up to 200Mbps with Vivid 200 fibre broadband? An online search for ＆time management＊ produces ＆about＊ 59,000,000 results in 0.48 seconds.§As I spoke in the tent I wondered whether we have already come too far to reform the way we think about time. Can we possibly convince ourselves, Aesop-like, that faster isn＊t always better or more productive? Are we somehow single-minded enough to believe that the new broadband offer won＊t tempt us with faster download speeds? Can we resist the new phone app that promises to ※shave§ minutes, perhaps hours, off our workloads? How do we comfort ourselves with the fact that we live in a perpetually dissatisfying twilight world where we know that, because things will always get faster and faster, nothing can possibly be fast enough now? Scarily enough, when I first tried that Google search for?※time management§ two years ago, I only got about 38 million results compared with about 59 million today: either the search engine has become more efficient or our obsession has become more extreme.Of course I knew why I was speaking in Edinburgh: sounds corny, but one goes for the audience. They came loaded with the sort of questions we should all be asking, the questions for the reformation. There was a shared feeling that we needed to reset our clocks in some way, back from a widening abyss. Someone asked, with noble optimism, whether we couldn＊t just go back to living by the rising and setting of the sun. Another was a geologist, an occupation that tries hard not to snigger at our modern speeding manias.One person asked whether we wouldn＊t do well to measure and judge passing time by dynasties, Chinese style, not by the atomic signals we glance at every few moments on our phones (but of course industrial China is now leading our charge towards the abyss, and not just because much of the iPhone is sourced and assembled there). I was asked about the Clock of the Long Now, that estimable/bonkers project planned for a mountain in western Texas (it will tick once a year, and chime once a century). Its inventor  hopes it may aid our ※thinking past the mental barrier of an ever-shortening future.§. The clock is part-funded by Amazon＊s , a cute touch from the man whose company may soon deliver all our commonplace needs within the hour.At the end I was asked whether I＊d been able to recalibrate my own life to?a slower pace since I＊d first begun writing about acceleration. I admitted defeat, but I welcomed old-time progress (or regression) wherever it presented itself. I note that there will be another total solar eclipse (over Argentina and Chile) in less than two years.

Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture has sold more than 1m?copies in the UK alone, surpassed 30m copies worldwide and risen to No 1 in 20 countries.You know you know it. Cast your mind . First come the uilleann pipes: that＊s Eric Rigler, an American player who previously worked with  and has a band called 每 horrifyingly 每 Bad Haggis. His grace notes communicate directly with the album-buying soul of the US＊s Celtic diaspora. Then comes the breathy vocals of Sissel Kyrkjeb?, the bass lines lurking like icebergs in the deep, and Horner＊s intriguing ability to make the instruments of the London Symphony Orchestra sound like?Midi files. pops up all over the place. It is relentlessly rousing, but it doesn＊t feel right without the full force of her larynx. (Eventually, we get Dion herself, after an agonising hour.)Apparently, the film＊s director, , wanted  to collaborate on the score, but she turned him down, so Horner selflessly replicated her knack for ear-gougingly fey Celtic wisp. The formula did the trick. Following the wild success of the first album, Horner made another suite, which he released in 1998 under the name .Of the many disturbing aspects to this story, several concern categorisation. If commercial classical radio stations devise their playlists based on algorithms and perceived popularity ratings (which they do), then?the music that shouts loudest will drown out the rest (which it does). Classical crossover is a mega industry complete with its own phenomenally lucrative stars (Il Divo, , ) and its own glossy production aesthetics, which can make a set of uilleann pipes sound interchangeable with an oboe, a panpipe or a synth. Horner＊s score was lauded for its diverse influences, but in truth it is ersatz everything: ersatz traditional Irish, ersatz classical strings. It is like Botox on an eyebrow 每 with this degree of gloss, forget about grit, about risk, about surprise, nuance or?authenticity.So, if you were one of the millions who purchased Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture, where do you go from here?You could watch Ludovico Einaudi  每 or?you could escape the?crossover vortex. For decent Irish music, try?Planxty or Lankum. For decent film music, try , a creator of some powerful modern movie scores, or wind backwards through greats such as Mikl車s R車zsa, Dimitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman and Bernard Herrmann (Hitchcock＊s favourites) to Erich Korngold, who arguably invented the Hollywood sound.

"urn down an alley leading off a busy shopping street. Climb a bubblegum-pink concrete staircase. Walk past two huge, black lions lying surrounded by heaps of tyres (※Please respect the sculpture§, a sign requests). Through a rooftop rock garden, down a series of concrete ramps and then, suddenly, you＊re in classical music＊s most famous car park. Peckham＊s  venue is home to the  and this summer, for the , it＊s also host to one of the BBC＊s ※Proms at＃§ concerts. We＊re a long way from South Kensington, and that＊s the point.Actually it＊s not the whole point. The orchestra established in 2011 by conductor Christopher Stark and composer Kate Whitley is no gimmick, and the car park offers more than a temporary repackaging of an art form with an access problem. The  is a musical force to be reckoned with, peopled by young professionals and conducted by Stark with a sort of intense, manically controlled energy. The ensemble＊s quality was clear from the first notes of Bach＊s chorale Wachtet Auf 每 performed in Granville Bantock＊s lush 1930s orchestration 每 which were a shock of sonorous warmth after the pre-concert clatter of conversation and passing trains. But while the sound was hyper-Romantic, Stark＊s phrasing and direction were restrained, putting Bantock＊s Bach subtly in dialogue with 21st-century ideals of ※period performance§.There is nonetheless a reason why most concerts (of any kind) don＊t take place in multi-storey car parks: the acoustic properties of a low-ceilinged, open-sided space made of concrete can be challenging. The last and longest piece on the programme, John Adams＊s hypnotically vibrant , was served up with rhythmic details firing on all cylinders, thrillingly nasty lower-brass intrusions and majestic, euphoric climaxes. But at times the performance was simply too loud in such a hard acoustic: for those sat at close quarters, Adams＊s instrumental kaleidoscope was in danger of blurring to brown.What the venue does undoubtedly provide, though, is a genuine sense of connection with the local community. This Prom saw the debut of the Multi-Story Youth Choir 每 a 100-strong chorus of schoolchildren 每 in Whitley＊s 2016 , an environmental protest piece written for and with them. Alongside stylish adult contributions from soprano Ruby Hughes and bass-baritone Michael Sumuel, these young performers summoned a musical maturity all their own 每 their focus unfaltering in the work＊s made-to-measure minimalism, their eyes alight 每 and an audience full of their supporters.

"achel Baynton and Gillian Lees are wearing black clothes and red balaclavas. They stand before us with a slight air of menace. But this smartly intelligent hour-long whizz through the world of surveillance, and the way governments legitimise spying on their citizens, makes you question what we mean by a terrorist and where the real threat lies. If you are reading this online, the state may be watching. You may well yawn, and say that you have seen plenty of ＊s films and you know all about the  that passed through parliament with such ease in 2016, and you think there is nothing to fear from being caught on CCTV 70 times a day because you have nothing to hide. But as whistleblower  has observed: ※Arguing that you don＊t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying that you don＊t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.§ Governments have plenty to hide, and Andrew Westerside＊s script exposes some of those secrets as it takes as on a whistle-stop tour of the history of government surveillance from 1943 wartime London to the present day via the . If you feel less safe than you did 20 years ago that may have more to do with rolling news and the fact that governments know that citizens are more compliant when tensions are higher and . In 2015,  in acts of terror, compared with 33,636 in gun violence. The tone is lightly ironic as Baynton and Lees exchange information and gobble secret edible messages, and wrap each other in cling film. But while they may be the only human performers, Adam York Gregory＊s dense video design offers a constant barrage of images that sometimes reinforce text and often wittily undermine it. This is coolly reasoned theatre, produced by  with stylish aplomb. If by the end it＊s wry, knowing tone becomes a little distancing and draining, it nonetheless lands its points with bullet-like precision. We can shrug and say that that if the UK government can read our complete browser history the loss of personal privacy is worth it to keep us safe, or we can decide that it＊s time to take action because Big Brother is already watching, and there seems to be no limit to what he wants to see.

"At 23, Ally McLean already has what many would consider an enviable career.Currently the project lead at Sydney independent game development studio Robot House, McLean got her start as a professional cosplayer 每 designing and wearing elaborate gaming and pop-culture character costumes at comic book and gaming conventions.She spent years working directly with companies like Microsoft and Hi-Rez, before moving to community and marketing roles on video games  and Warhammer 40,000: Regicide. But as for so many other young women trying to break into a male-dominated industry, it took her a long time to stop feeling like an outsider. ※I lost count of the number of male executives or established developers who behaved excruciatingly sexist either towards me or in my presence,§ she says. ※I had to fight every instinct to keep pushing and working until I was taken seriously.§It was the support of other women in the industry who＊d been through it all before that kept her going 每 women like Meagan Marie, the senior community manager at Crystal Dynamics (the studio behind Tomb Raider), who mentored McLean.※When you＊re not represented in the leaders, innovators and creators being celebrated in an industry, it＊s easy to feel like you don＊t belong,§ McLean says. ※It took me a while to find role models I could see myself in.§McLean is now trying to pass on the same encouragement and support. Earlier this year she partnered with the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association (Igea), the industry body that represents video game publishers and developers in Australia and New Zealand, to create . Set to launch later this year, the program aims to empower entry-level women in the industry through workshops and networking events run by a rotating team of mentors who will provide advice, contacts and support. The program will run annually and will take between 10 and 20 mentees from applications.A secondary goal of the program is to get more women working in the local industry. According to Igea, women only account for 19% of the game development sector workforce in Australia. ※If we can equip each group of women to gain employment, it would only take 10 classes to get the gender ratio of people employed in the Australian industry close to 50%,§ McLean says. The Working Lunch is part of an already robust push in the Australian gaming industry to right the gender imbalance. While the worldwide industry continues to be plagued by rampant sexism and online abuse, Australia has been quietly leading the charge in developing a growing number of programs and initiatives aimed at women that target both education and career development. Take , an initiative working to increase the number of women working in tech through programs and communities like She Makes Games, Ladies Who Linux and Miss Makes Codes, as well as events, workshops and hackathons. These are intensive group competitions usually spread out over a few days in which programmers, designers and software engineers come together to create a new game or app from scratch. One of the founding members is Lisy Kane, a 30-year-old producer at Melbourne independent studio League of Geeks. ※The biggest challenge for me was understanding that the video game industry is a place that I can work,§ Kane says. ※When you grow up in Australia, especially as a young woman, having a career goal of ＆game producer＊ isn＊t something that was on my radar. High school didn＊t offer IT studies greater than Excel spreadsheets and basic computer studies.§Kane got her start in the industry the old-fashioned way: contacting as many people as she could and asking them for coffee and advice. ※The most amazing thing happened: most of the folks I reached out to were kind, open and willing to help. I barely expected anyone to reply, let alone help a complete stranger.§This welcoming attitude may have something to do with the relatively small size of the Australian game industry compared with the US and UK industries. Here, the culture has been largely dominated by smaller, independent studios that allow for more creative freedom, a less rigid management structure and more progressive work environments that are not dictated by male executive boards and institutionalised gender biases. Clara Reeves, the 36-year-old president of , says the collaborative spirit is conducive to positive change. Like McLean, Reeves spent the majority of her early career suffering from impostor syndrome. Only about 5% of the students in her programming course at university were women and when she landed her first job with publisher Atari, she was the only woman out of some 100 or so development staff.※I spent quite a bit of my energy just proving that I fit in,§ she says. With that in mind, Reeves has been mindful of building a company that pays attention to diversity: Hipster Whale now has a 50-50 male-to-female gender split. More women working in games means more meaningful content for female gamers 每 or, at the very least, content that doesn＊t alienate them. Kim Allom, 27, from Brisbane, is a co-founder of , a group of video game developers who aim to promote, host events and rapidly prototype games that meaningfully explore love, sex and romance 每 topics that most games either steer clear of or get woefully wrong. A quick peek at their landing page says it all: this isn＊t aimed at the gaze of the straight male that most of the industry revolves around.※We＊re basically a bunch of mates with similar views on the current state [or lack thereof] of how games address love, sex and romance, and where we＊d like games to go in the future,§ Allom says. This goes beyond empowering female gamers 每 as Allom puts it, ※it flips the bird to stigmas surrounding love and sexuality§ in games.Looking ahead, both McLean and Reeves stress the importance of more women in leadership roles in the local industry.※We need to train a more diverse pool of people for leadership roles, give them the skills, opportunities and confidence to move into those roles, and then also keep them around long enough to be ready for those roles,§ Reeves says.McLean says: ※A lot of the people in power are male and it＊s hard for them to see exactly how underrepresented we are. They haven＊t experienced what most women in the industry have 每 being the only girl in your computer class, the only woman in the boardroom.§ One way to ensure this happens is to place more emphasis on engaging young women with the games industry at an educational level. For example, McLean receives a lot of intern applications from local games educational institutions 每 and the gender split is alarmingly poor. ※We need to work with high schools and tertiary education teams to make studying games and entering the industry a real option for young women,§ she said. ※The more women making games, the better representation will be both industry-wise and in the content we＊re producing: more games with relatable and complex female protagonists, games that tell women＊s stories, that provide role models, and that can excite and inspire them to create their own.§																																											"

"Your report (, 24 August) describes the attack on traditional church music by the recent decision to exclude musicians from St Sepulchre＊s, where my own father is commemorated. We have a similar local example in St Albans. Here the evangelical congregation has persuaded the vicar of St Paul＊s church to apply to remove the church organ completely, on the grounds they need more space and it is ※not tuned to concert pitch§. Apart from his very ill-informed stance, surely ripping the heart out of one＊s parish church goes completely against the incumbent＊s duty to preserve the fabric of both building and worship? It is all very well these Holy Trinity Brompton evangelicals enjoying their current popularity, but such attacks on church music and musicians deprive the rest of the community permanently of any chance to enjoy more traditional forms of both worship and music-making. Removing an organ just when choral evensong is enjoying a well deserved resurgence in popularity is amazingly shortsighted and deplorable.HTB and others getting on this particular bandwagon should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. I hope many more musicians will oppose such action.  Why do so many religiously correct people, who want to ban everything from their churches that is secular and therefore ※non-religious§, seem so spiritually inept and lacking in emotional intelligence? They remind me of the scribes and Pharisees with whom Jesus got exasperated as they insisted on correct religious practice but lacked all sense of humanity and compassion. They?were very religious, but not in any way spiritual.Music is a gateway to the divine. It can take one into a deeply spiritual experience, opening the soul to a broader, all-encompassing experience of God/the divine than the narrow beliefs on which so much religiosity is founded. This must be very threatening to the members of Holy Trinity Brompton, whose fundamentalist belief system cannot encompass a view of the divine that is ※broader than the measures of man＊s mind§. It＊s strange how evangelical Anglican practices are noted as ※leaving many traditional Anglicans feeling excluded§, whereas it is seldom commented that traditional and ※high§ church practices (very common in the Diocese of  in particular) leave less traditional Anglicans feeling the same way. The Church of England would be in dire financial straits without its successful evangelical congregations, and many buildings such as St Sepulchre might well be closed anyway.

"ames Hamilton＊s  ※brings one of the very greatest [artists] vividly to life§, said the Literary Review＊s , who particularly relished the ※naughty bits§. ※In his shrewd and entertaining biography, [Hamilton] even finds unsuspected double entendres in the pictures,§ he wrote, enjoying ※a fresh study of the paintings, an examination of the documents and a shrewd reading of sources§. There is a gap in Hamilton＊s source material, since much of Gainsborough＊s smutty correspondence has been destroyed. ※In the artist＊s later years more people seem to have preserved his letters, making you realise that there is no substitute for the subject＊s own testimony and turn of phrase,§ wrote the Daily Telegraph＊s , who nonetheless thought the book ※highly readable and brilliantly reconstructed§. ※Hamilton is a first-rate historian,§ agreed  in the Spectator, and very good on ※the human side§. ※Gainsborough is one of the most lovable of great artists, and his personality shines through an enjoyable biography by a writer who understands him.§ In the Sunday Times,  found it ※gorgeously illustrated and compulsively readable 每 the pages seem to turn themselves.

In a book that ※refuses to opt for easy tales of moral uplift, Wills concentrates on the untidy, everyday reality.

"As people swing and sway at this weekend＊s Notting Hill carnival in London, it＊s worth thinking about the critical failures of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) to adhere to even the most basic principles of health and safety in relation to the fire. Questions arise as to whether that same culture of cost-cutting, incompetence and flagrant disdain for the safety of the poor has had any impact on the levels of public safety standards at Britain＊s most popular cultural event.Let just remind ourselves of what carnival now represents. There can be no doubt that it has helped  achieve its world city status. It stands alongside other global festivals such as the New Orleans Mardi Gras, Brazil＊s Rio carnival, Toronto＊s International Carnival and New York＊s Labour Day parade. It has helped define our capital city as open, inclusive and progressive. Carnival helped the UK win the 2012 Olympic games, for instance.What about the soul of carnival? For me it＊s important to remember its roots as a celebration of black freedom, an event whose origins go back to the one-day annual ※holiday§ enslaved Africans were given off from working on massa＊s slave plantation.After emancipation, the carnival became an essential component of the African diaspora＊s cultural repertoire. In the UK, it was the west London Trinidadian community, led by local activist Claudia Jones who, responding to the racist murder of Kelso Cochrane,  in bringing the unifying power of carnival on to the streets of Britain. Since 1959 we＊ve seen it become the most successful, popular and contentious cultural event in Europe.Once I became policing director for London in 2000, I immediately embarked on a mission to tackle the gross overcrowding and underfunding of carnival. As chair of the London mayor＊s carnival review, I consulted with carnivalists and local stakeholders on how best to improve public safety and reduce dangerous levels of crowd density.In June 2004, after three years of consultation and detailed work, we published Notting Hill Carnival: A Strategic Review, the most detailed report on the event ever. It was our legal counsel＊s view that ultimately, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the , whatever their protestations, bore the statutory responsibility for public safety, not the carnival organising committee.The project also found that the route (still in use today) was unable to provide the level of flexibility required to safely accommodate the carnival＊s future growth. The average attendance growth of carnival year on year was about 5%.Given that visitor numbers cannot be controlled at a free and open event such as the , the review group found that the critical weakness of the decision-making and planning process lay in its failure to plan for growth. That was true in 2004 and remains true today.I＊ve often wondered, in the years since our report was published, who in the event of a catastrophic crushing at carnival (the most likely high-risk scenario), would be held legally responsible for public safety? In my mind there is no doubt that the major responsibilities will lie with RBKC, the Met police and the London mayor＊s office. In the light of the Grenfell and Hillsborough tragedies, the issue of public safety has risen up the public and political agenda. The fact that over the last decade these three institutions have consistently fudged the question of carnival public safety has very likely put Londoners＊ lives at risk. Cramming people into a tightly confined space and making the experience as unpleasant as possible, with few toilet facilities, no recycling, no adequate transport facilities 每 presumably in the forlorn hope they don＊t come back 每 is simply not acceptable.In November 2016 Met commander Dave Musker told the London assembly police and crime committee: ※Each year ＃ we come exceptionally close to a major catastrophic failure of public safety where members of the public will suffer serious injury.§ A  published in January echoed the concerns we expressed about public safety some 13 years earlier.No one wants take the responsibility, but the law is clear in my view. Either you ensure that public safety issues are addressed, or if you sanction a public event knowing the organisers cannot meet their licensing and public safety requirements, that responsibility by default falls to you, the licensing authorities. In effect RBKC and the Met are rolling the dice every year by sanctioning a public event that they know to be unsafe.Reading the latest London assembly carnival report is in many ways a similar experience to reading the prescient warnings of Grenfell Action Group when they complained they were not being listened to in relation to fire safety, tragically predicting that only a catastrophic fire would force people to take notice.Historically, the Met has tended to detest the carnival, despising the event, having little regard for the organisers. It sometimes seems they would do anything to remove themselves from having to police it in such large numbers. As a result they often police it with a bad attitude. As with Grenfell Tower, RBKC＊s approach to public safety at carnival bears all the hallmarks of their routine and malicious disregard for pubic safety, particularly when those in need of protection are black and poor.

"ard work pays off,§ says Jme as he introduces Work, one of the final tracks of the evening, to a sellout stadium crowd at the O2. He＊s not wrong. It wasn＊t long ago that Jamie Adenuga was making beats in his bedroom using the forgotten  game Mario Paint, doing a degree in digital design and driving around cardboard boxes of self-released CDs to give to independent record shops. In grime＊s pirate radio days in the mid-00s, once it was clear no one beyond ,  and  were about to be signed, there wasn＊t much choice beyond giving up or DIY independence. Adenuga defiantly made a virtue of the latter, with phenomenal 每 if not immediate 每 success.Twelve years after the crew was founded, built around Jme and his Mercury-winning older brother , have ascended to the state of pop cultural grace that allows for a day-long takeover of the O2 complex: not just the 20,000-capacity main arena, but its many side-rooms, alcoves and cubby holes too. Everything but the All Bar One.  really is at its US-rap-in-1992 crossover moment now. Even a couple of years ago, it was inconceivable that you might have seen eight-year-old children in baggy Wiley T-shirts, accompanied by their parents, turning up for a bank holiday outing to a grime festival 每 with the opportunity for on-site dinner at a Harvester beforehand. The entirety of the North Greenwich peninsula seems to have been swamped by excitable teenage boys wearing man-bags and using slang they picked up on YouTube.It＊s effectively a one-day festival, offering much more than just live PAs from grime＊s better-known names. Among other things there is the tantalising offer of afternoon rollerskating to legendary American garage DJ Todd ※the God§ Edwards, in the Tropical Roller Disco. Only 25 people or so are in there, but it＊s a surreal treat nonetheless. Elsewhere there＊s the unique opportunity to play Jme at Call of Duty in the gaming room and a five-a-side football tournament going on in the late-summer sunshine, while Big Zuu and Logan Sama host the next generation of grime MCs at an outdoor stage next to the pitch. It is all a bit silly. But if you＊re going to relocate a genre rooted in low-ceilinged clubs with dim lighting and juddering sub-bass to the massive suburban shopping mall that is the O2, you may as well do it warts and all, with a sense of fun.In the main arena  is the between-acts DJ, and if few of the teenagers know who he is, they do recognise his crowdpleasing selection of recent American rap anthems. Rising French afro trap rapper  is sensational, effervescent and funky, but the language barrier sadly seems too much of an obstacle, giving rise to the weird dynamic of Westwood＊s between-sets bangers du jour being more popular than the live acts either side of them.With A$AP Rocky cancelling at the last minute, the final support act J Hus immediately has the crowd captivated; the young rapper＊s beguiling blend of Afrobeats and grime, singing and MCing quickly has the crowd moshing to Clartin, and attempting a skank on the garage-tinged Plotting. His hype man announces this is J Hus＊s first ever London show, which sounds like it must be a mistake 每 he was born barely a couple of miles away from this venue and has been getting plaudits on the underground scene for a couple of years at least; but like  before him, a de facto (though unofficial) Met police blacklisting has stifled his live career so far. It＊s a bizarrely overdue London debut for a Mercury-nominated artist, but all the more triumphant for it.As the headline crew, Boy Better Know aren＊t about to take any risks: this isn＊t their first festival-sized show, and they＊ve learned to tailor their set to chant-along anthems, following Skepta＊s focused, clear-voiced path in particular. So the godfather Wiley shows up and is a consummate professional, delivering  and  with his usual energy but none of his erratic behaviour of the past. There are a flurry of Skepta tunes: the three key anthems from Konnichiwa 每 ,  and That＊s Not Me 每 as well as new track , and Lethal Bizzle turns up to perform  with him.Jme brings out Giggs for  每 perhaps the tune of the night 每 and Giggs then ups the ante and brings out Drake for KMT. The Canadian megastar is wisely restricted to one tune rather than being allowed to overshadow his hosts, and the show is notably lacking in ridiculous pyrotechnics, visuals or stagecraft. This is an ensemble show, and a homecoming show, and if BBK have really become the first grime super-brand, then it＊s hard not to be impressed that they＊ve done so by thoroughly rejecting the music industry and 每 tropical roller disco and five-a-side football tournament notwithstanding 每 sticking to grime＊s original pirate radio formula. One DJ, a few MCs passing the mic 每 and the musicians themselves in full control.																																											"

She also expressed her surprise at the sheer scale of the programme＊s production. ※It seems ridiculous now but neither Noel nor I had quite prepared ourselves for how involved we would get,§ she said. ※We make one episode a week, so end up spending two and a half months with some of the contestants. That is long enough to feel a real sense of kinship. We laugh and cry in equal measure.§Toksvig, who also hosts the BBC quiz show QI and Channel 4＊s Fifteen to One, wrote in Good Housekeeping magazine that she had never experienced a show as big as Bake Off. ※I knew there would be cameras; I had no idea there would be so many,§ she said.※I knew there would be producers; again, it was the numbers that bowled me over.

"Several years ago my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer＊s disease. My mother called to tell me. I don＊t think I really understood what it meant at the time.  is everywhere at the moment 每 in films like Still Alice, in books like Goodbye, Vitamin or The Night Guest, even an old episode of Criminal Minds I happened to flick on the other night. We are drawn to investigating it in the arts, I think, because it＊s the absolute unknowable. What is it like to feel your brain give out beneath you? Where＊s the final edge between the present and the past?Currently, dementia is the second-leading cause of death in Australia. Each day, 244 people are newly diagnosed and about half of all dementia patients are cared for by a loved one. These numbers are high enough to assume that all of us will know or know of someone who has the disease. My mother says the real tragedy of the illness is that a person is stripped of all the details they know about themselves and left a shell on to whichwe project our own memories of them. They are suddenly only what other people think they are. My grandmother was a woman interested in people. She was active in her local Presbyterian church, did detailed embroidery, and had that 60s notion of keeping a beautiful house and supporting your husband＊s endeavours. She also had a job at a time and in a place where it was considered unusual for a married woman. As she moved further into her disease, my grandfather was forced to take on her domestic duties and her personal care. Her personality changed: my once-submissive grandmother became aggressive, belligerent, and critical of her husband. My mother told me these things over the phone: ※She really said that to him!§ We speculated that this suppressed rage had always existed inside her and now her lack of inhibitions meant it was erupting out. We learnt later that changes of behaviour are a common symptom. She told my mother: ※You know I＊ll always be here for you, except sometimes when I＊m not.§ Later, she began to call my mother by her younger sister＊s name, Brenda. Even if you know it＊s going to happen you can＊t shake the question: how can you not know who I am?When researching Rain Birds, I uncovered countless stories of dementia. A former dancer in the US 每 unresponsive for weeks 每 recognised herself in footage from 1930 and began to laugh hysterically. A woman put her husband into care whereupon he promptly embarked on a romance with another resident because he no longer remembered his wife. A daughter created a fake medical degree certificate and mailed it to her father who had been waiting for it by the mailbox every day for months. Dementia is death by a thousand tiny deaths. It systematically dismantles a person, one memory at a time. Maybe that＊s why we＊re so afraid of the disease 每 it exposes the fragility of our selves. My mother thinks it makes us question what＊s real and who we are. Do we exist without our memories? Are we still living? After my grandmother got sick, my mother threw out all her pots and then threw all mine out as well because some studies had showed a link between ingesting aluminium and Alzheimer＊s. She bought a cookbook titled Healthy Eating to Reduce the Risk of Dementia and told me that some people thought the disease skipped a generation so I better start taking it seriously. We all said, ※If that ever happens to me, I＊ll top myself first.§ I later read a story about a woman who＊d assisted her close friend suffering from early-onset dementia to take her own life. This woman then also took her own life, leaving a note behind that explained how she was unprepared to go through the legal ramifications of assisting her friend to make the decision to find some dignity in her illness. I thought about how we would all sit around the table and contemplate what we would do if it happened to us. How stupid to think it would be as easy as just picking a time to end. That＊s what this disease does to you 每 it strips away all potential for answers or clearly defined edges and makes us grasp them even more. With Rain Birds, I hoped to show something that my mother once said 每 that her mother died years before she actually died. ※I＊ll always be here for you, except for sometimes when I＊m not.§The truth is that I was absent for almost all of my grandmother＊s disease. I was young and living in another state. When things grew really bad, my mother told me, ※Hang on to the memories you have of her when she was well.§ I think I always carried a lot of fear of seeing what Nan had become. In that way, this book was about me processing her disease 每 living through it when I hadn＊t done so in real life. My mother sent me photos of my grandmother in her last days. I could only look at them with sideways eyes, not quite straight on. She was unrecognisable. The Nan I remember was strong and solid 每 I get my height from her. In the end, she weighed 40kg. Unimaginable. Her eyes were often shut but when they opened there was nothing but pain and confusion. I sang Amazing Graceat her funeral. It was the same church my grandparents and my parents had been married in. My siblings and I carried her coffin out to the hearse.   																																											"
"ecently, British director Ben Rivers made a deeply strange Morocco-set movie, inspired by a Paul Bowles story, entitled . It featured a director making a film with non-professionals on location 每 and for these shots Rivers used a real director and (as it were) real non-professionals making a real film: this film, in fact, from 35-year-old French-born director Oliver Laxe.Mimosas is a challengingly static, dreamily mysterious and beautifully shot film about two disreputable Moroccan men who, as part of a caravan of travellers, accept the task of carrying the dead body of a holy man, the ※Sheikh§, across the Atlas mountains to be buried in his home village. They receive help from a stranger who is as enigmatic as everything and everyone else in the film. It has been compared to Werner Herzog＊s , but where that has a very real sense of hubris and fear, this is too opaque and unreal to have quite that effect. It is more like a parable. Certain scenes look as if they have been improvised on location and there is something exasperatingly non-committal and provisional about it. But it certainly looks wonderful.																																											"
"ysing Arts Centre is located deep in , a landscape of science parks and tech incubators, a place where microprocessors and bluetooth sets issue from isolated country barns. But for 12 hours on Saturday, this corner of the fen was sending out high-tech emissions of a very different kind, as Wysing Arts Centre became a satellite of NON,  turned global collective of artists.Last year＊s Wysing music festival enforced one rule: no electricity. This year, however, everything is electric. From the throbbing digital scree that opened London-based producer ＊s set to the woozy north African vocal samples used by Milan＊s Petit Singe, no sound came unmediated, unamplified or unprocessed.More arabesques flowed through Sami Baha＊s set, with its mix of influences from the sinuous melodies of vintage Turkish pop to the stuttered machine drums of Atlanta trap. Slamming white-noise synths against heavy bass drops, the Istanbul-born producer＊s set was the first of the day to really get the dancefloor going.Lolina (also known as Inga Copeland), by contrast, didn＊t inspire so many steps 每 in spite of her squelchy acid bass lines and detuned house piano vamps. But maybe that isn＊t the point. Copeland, like many acts at the festival, takes the tropes of club music and spins them around, firing them off into thrilling new sonic worlds, in which concrete sounds of footsteps and sleigh bells tussle with brittle digital artefacts and dense clouds of dub echo.The lineup this year was curated by Nkisi, of . Her set certainly provoked its share of fancy footwork, but there was more to it than only beats instrumentalised to bodily movement. Apart from anything else, the sound was too spooky, evoking 1970s Italian horror films more than .Opaque Poetics is probably the first music festival I＊ve been to that has featured more women on stage than men, more performers of colour than white artists. If NON＊s goal is to create an inclusive space for artists 每 and audiences 每 of all backgrounds, a space where high-tech can meet lo-fi and the aims of art and hedonism collide, then Nkisi and Wysing have clearly succeeded.

" grew up in a ※godless home§ in T?nsberg, Norway, which makes him an unlikely candidate to photograph the messiah, let alone six of them. But this is what he has spent the past three years doing: chronicling the lives of men 每 and they are all men 每 who claim to be Jesus returned to Earth, from Siberia to the Philippines, Japan to Devon.A member of the , 39-year-old Bendiksen describes himself as ardently scientific: ※Faith has always been very hard for me to conceptualise,§ he says. He thinks it might be this lack of preconceptions that has allowed him ※to go and touch divinity itself§. He has no interest in mocking or defrocking his Jesus claimants: ※My mission was to say, ＆OK, if one were to accept the prophecy of Jesus＊s return, why  it be this guy?＊§But there were a lot to choose from. First, he drew up criteria. A messiah, Bendiksen decided, needed to be in the public sphere, to have lived their revelation (as a Christ) for many years and to have published scripture. These being modern messiahs, Bendiksen found them on Google. After that, some were easier to track down than others. , for instance, the former MI5 whistleblower turned Jesus claimant, is what Bendiksen calls ※a digital messiah§, and responded quickly on Twitter. His email sign-off (and his signature in church visiting books) reads ※David Shayler, the Christ§.Shayler, and his alter ego Dolores, cuts a lonely figure in Bendiksen＊s photographs. The revelation that he was Jesus came to him in 2007, he told Bendiksen, which makes him one of the newer messiahs. Others, such as , have thousands of followers; even on , Shayler has fewer than 350. ※You ask him about it and he says, ＆That＊s not a problem＊,§ Bendiksen explains. ※He says, ＆If you follow me, you＊ll only end up at my house. Follow the .＊ He＊s more of a lone operator.§One of Bendiksen＊s portraits shows Shayler on a hill outside Middlesbrough, arms open, his solitary companion＊s orange jumper lit by sunset. Another shows him alone in a cafe sipping coffee; his tiny cup does not overfloweth, his expression is distinctly woebegone. Is this really what Jesus looks like?When Bendiksen first met Shayler, the photographer says, he was barefoot and wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with a quote from  (※All that I know most surely about morality and obligations, I owe to football§). He was staying at a friend＊s house in Devon, and cats wandered through the room while they talked. A hen idled by. Shayler＊s jeans were full of holes, his laptop keyboard strewn with tobacco. None of this, Bendiksen points out, is very far from the gospels＊ version of Jesus 每 ※that idea of someone on the outside of society, critiquing it§.Other messiahs fit the familiar iconography of Christianity more closely. The disciples of Vissarion, a 56-year-old former traffic policeman in the Siberian town of Minusinsk, for instance, are photographed side by side at a long, laden table, in an obvious allusion to ＊s . Vissarion himself, who founded his Church of the Last Testament in the early 90s, wears white and has shoulder-length hair and a beard, like an older, more earthbound version of the Jesus in . His off-grid, utopian villages in the Siberian woods ※have attracted a very creative crowd§, Bendiksen says, ※all these beautiful rituals with choral music and processions amid these harsh conditions§.Not every messiah Bendiksen approached was happy to meet him, however;  of Japan declined his request. But Moses Hlongwane of South Africa was very welcoming, even offering Bendiksen the left side of his double bed, because the other two rooms in his small concrete house in Eshowe, near Durban, were occupied by disciples. ※It was an invitation to really get to know the messiah,§ Bendiksen says. ※Each night we had a nice chat in bed.§ They lay side by side, Bendiksen reading from a King James Bible, Hlongwane ※frantically thumbing away on his phone§.While Vissarion was aloof, agreeing to meet the photographer only on his third visit to Siberia, Bendiksen＊s images of Hlongwane＊s headquarters are suffused with domestic warmth. There are bedspreads and blankets, patchwork floors and louvre doors; a woman prays next to a domestic steam iron. Hlongwane, who used to work as a jewellery salesman, says he has been fighting the devil since God first told him in a dream, in 1992, that he was the messiah. His recent marriage, he preaches, signals the beginning of ※the End of Days§. It＊s a homely, improvised kind of messiahship. His plain white cap is embellished with silver studs that spell out ※Jesus§ and ※King of Kings§. Hlongwane＊s disciples, Bendiksen recalls, ※were full of faith. Full of hope. They saw meaning everywhere.§ He thinks his own godlessness gave him an open mind and a reluctance to judge; the images remain staunchly faithful to their subjects.※People ask me, ＆Did you feel the divine when in the presence of the messiahs?＊§ Bendiken says. And did he? ※With Moses, all I can say is I felt a lot of some things. But what is the divine? I don＊t know.§ Did he feel anything physically, if not spiritually? He thinks. ※The disciples were always breaking into gospel song. In that setting, with all that energy flowing towards Moses, yes, I could feel it physically.§ He likens it to experiencing ※a great piece of music§.But it was his time in Siberia that he found the most personally confronting. ※Ask my wife,§ he says. ※Every time I got back from Vissarion＊s land, I was disturbed 每 and I mean disturbed in a positive sense. It was very seductive.§ The community builds its own houses, grows its own food. ※I really liked that place. I＊m convinced I could live there and have a very happy life. Can man create that on his own, or do you need divine intervention? If it takes faith and belief to create that sort of community, does it matter if it＊s true or not?§Maybe faith, these pictures seem to say, creates its own kind of truth.

"The BBC is banking on ＊s magic touch in a Sunday night ratings battle between the sumptuous ITV costume drama Victoria and its own thriller, Strike, adapted from crime novels by the Harry Potter author. Victoria, starring Jenna Coleman and Tom Hughes as Victoria and Albert, is back for a second series after a 500,000 ratings triumph over the BBC＊s Cornish period drama Poldark last year. ITV is hoping for repeat success over Strike, adapted from the novels Rowling published , and starring Tom Burke as the damaged war veteran turned detective Cormoran Strike and Holliday Grainger as his sleuthing partner Robin Ellacott.The two contenders＊ settings could not contrast more. Victoria, which picks up in 1840 after the birth of the Queen＊s first baby, has been described by one TV critic as ※the most sumptuous and visually rich show§ on television. There is opulence and magnificence throughout in its palace settings, glittering jewels and shimmering gold brocade.Strike＊s edginess is played out against a darker, often insalubrious, backdrop as the Afghanistan war veteran, with a prosthetic leg and psychological scars to match his physical wounds, lives his chaotic life operating out of a dingy, cramped Soho office. His unique insight, and his background as a military police special investigator, prove crucial in tackling three complex cases that have eluded the police.Rowling has said Burke is ※extremely convincing§ as the investigator. Producers have said, given the nature of the cases, they have been careful to ensure any depiction of violence against women is ※sensitively filmed§.The Cuckoo＊s Calling has been adapted into three episodes for the  starting on Sunday, and is followed by two parts of The Silkworm. Career of Evil, a third instalment, will come to the screen in 2018. Rowling, an executive producer of the new drama, has hinted at more Strike books in the future, saying they could eventually outnumber her Harry Potter titles.Ben Richard, who adapted The Cuckoo＊s Calling, told Radio Times magazine: ※One of the things I loved about Strike was that, although he＊s grumpy and he＊s got problems, he＊s not tortured. He＊s hard-working, not self-pitying, and kind.§Over on ITV, rumours that Coleman, 31, has become engaged to on-screen husband and off-screen boyfriend Hughes, also 31, sparked when she wore a glittering stone on her ring finger at this week＊s screen preview, will only augment interest. This season develops the couple＊s famously passionate marital relationship against the historical backdrop of European and global events, and sees the arrival, too, of Dame Diana Rigg as the Duchess of Buccleuch.Asked what it was like depicting Victoria and Albert＊s often volatile relationship on screen, Coleman said at the screen preview: ※I think argument scenes are really, really hard. It＊s probably one of the most challenging things because, especially something that＊s so fiery, it needs to be spontaneous, so you need to shoot really quickly.§ During one scene, she threw her hairbrush so hard at her co-star it broke, she revealed.Hughes said: ※When you have that volatility, it gives it a real energy. Particularly in period dramas, some of it can be quite reserved at times so to have that different rhythm is helpful for the story and you just kind of dive in 每 and if it means you get a hairbrush thrown at you, then that＊s what happens.§The Victoria creator Daisy Goodwin said both actors were ※astonishing§. ※You totally believe in Albert＊s internal struggles and in Victoria＊s impulsiveness ＃ she＊s very stubborn and Albert＊s very self-controlled so when he does break, he really breaks.§																																											"
"The Metropolitan police have arrested 656 people suspected of planning to cause trouble at , the commander in charge of policing the event has said.Dave Musker, the Met＊s gold commander for the bank holiday weekend, said: ※I don＊t really care what we arrest them for, I＊ll be [as] lawfully audacious as I can to get them off the streets.※So whether they＊ve got heroin or they＊ve got other class A drugs, [are] drug dealing, [or] serious violence takes place at carnival, we will try to target them and get them off the streets.§Pre-charge bail restrictions have been used to prevent some people from coming and force some people from the north Kensington area to stay away from their homes during the event, the Guardian understands.Musker＊s comments came after the Met drew ridicule and accusations of racism by publishing a tweet linking a heroin bust in south London to the carnival. The grime artist : ※How many drugs did you lot seize in the run-up to Glastonbury or we only doing tweets like this for black events?§Musker said concrete blocks and steel barriers would surround the event area to ensure it remains safe at a time of heightened concern about the risk of vehicles being . Officers will check members of the public for knives and corrosive substances as they arrive.However, he said there was no intelligence to suggest the carnival was at risk of a terrorist attack, nor that the  had raised the risk of public disorder. While extra officers will be stationed around Grenfell Tower in a ※ring of care§, overall police numbers will stay the same as last year, with about 15,000 shifts worked over the two days. This works out as about 6,000 to 7,000 officers on duty each day.The Met has also faced criticism for plans to trial facial recognition technology at the carnival for the second year running. Civil rights defenders last week , which they said has no clear legal basis and threatened a ※significant interference with the right to private life§.Musker said he was ※not blind to the fact that this is a controversial tactic§, adding that the Met had consulted with privacy groups such as Big Brother Watch ※to ensure that what we are doing is proportionate, legal and effective§.※It＊s not loaded, it＊s loaded with people who we know are involved with criminality, who are wanted,§ he said. ※It＊s not a speculative search tool.§However, Big Brother Watch denied having meaningful consultation with the Met, having only met with the force once in 2016 to discuss the trial at that year＊s carnival. ※We did not provide assurances of proportionality, legality or effectiveness of the technology,§ Renate Samson, Big Brother Watch＊s chief executive, said. ※These are assurances which can only be made by legislation or regulation by parliament, not by a conversation with a campaigning organisation.§One Ladbroke Grove resident caught up in the pre-carnival operations said police had arrested him after finding him in possession of frankincense.The resident, who preferred to not be named, was told he could not attend the carnival and must report to a police station in Clapham, south , between 6pm and 9pm on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.

"While most awards shows try to keep things prim and proper, MTV＊s Video Music Awards errs on the side of controversy. This century alone, the ceremony, which honors the best music videos of the year, has gifted us with several nuggets of pop-cultural infamy, such as Britney, Christina and Madonna＊s three-way kiss in 2003;  and Robin Thicke＊s twerk-heavy performance in 2013; and, most famously, Kanye West＊s 2009 interruption of Taylor Swift＊s acceptance speech.This year＊s host, , fresh off the release of her underperforming album Witness, will be using the show as an opportunity for audiences to see a different side of her before she joins the American Idol reboot later this year. The week has seen rumors that Swift, involved in an ongoing feud with Perry, would be making an appearance but the reports of an on-stage duet have been debunked. ※Listen, I＊d love for the beef to end. I＊d love to take it off the BBQ,§ Perry told the host of SiriusXM＊s The Morning Mash-Up. ※I＊m down, but I haven＊t heard anything of it.§Instead Swift revealed that she will use the ceremony to premiere the video of her new single Look What You Made Me Do, . ※It＊s ridiculous in a lot of ways, high-school gossip amplified to feed the public＊s hunger for drama,§ . Perry, for her part, will perform a space-themed medley of her hits both old and new 每 and, according to  might make her entrance descending from the ceiling, following on from Lady Gaga at the Super Bowl. ※There＊s going to be a lot of costume changes and a lot of movement,§ VMA producer Garrett English hinted.Leading the pack of nominees is Kendrick Lamar, up for eight awards including artist and video of the year, plus best cinematography, art direction and visual effects. His album Damn, the bestselling record of 2017, helped to make hip-hop, for the first time ever (at least by Nielsen standards), the industry＊s dominant genre, supplanting rock ＊n＊ roll in terms of overall consumption. ※I＊m happy to see my fans and I＆m happy to bring a great aesthetic to the stage when it plays back for these viewers,§ Lamar told  of his performance on Sunday.Close behind Lamar is Perry and The Weeknd, both up for five awards. The latter will perform on the night, which will also see Miley Cyrus, Ed Sheeran, Demi Lovato, Lorde and Pink, who is this year＊s recipient of the Michael Jackson video vanguard award. The singer joins an esteemed group of winners that includes Kanye, Justin Timberlake, Madonna, Rihanna, Janet Jackson, David Bowie, Britney Spears, Beyonc谷 and Tom Petty.This year＊s ceremony also marks the first time the VMAs have done away with gendered categories, following in the footsteps of MTV＊s Movie & TV Awards. Earlier this year, . ※The first acting award in history that doesn＊t separate nominees based on their sex says something about how we perceive the human experience,§ Watson said during her speech. ※Acting is about the ability to put yourself into someone else＊s shoes 每 and that doesn＊t have to be separated into two different categories.§The VMAs have followed suit by combining the nominees for what was formerly best male and female music video into one awards: video of the year. The videos up for the night＊s highest honor include Lamar＊s Humble, Bruno Mars＊ 24K Magic, Alessia Cara＊s Scars To Your Beautiful, DJ Khaled, Rihanna, and Bryson Tiller＊s Wild Thoughts, and The Weeknd＊s Reminder. MTV has also added a new category this year 每 best fight against the system 每 for videos advocating for social justice. The competition for that category includes Logic＊s Black SpiderMan, Immigrants (We Get the Job Done) from the Hamilton Mixtape, Big Sean＊s Light, Alessia Cara＊s Scars To Your Beautiful, Taboo and Shailene Woodley＊s Stand Up/Stand N Rock #NoDAPL, and John Legend＊s Surefire.  has also invited active-duty transgender servicemen and women to the ceremony in the wake of president Trump＊s decision to ban trans troops for the military.※DoD confirms that MTV has invited Service members in their personal capacity to this year＊s VMAs,§ said Pentagon spokesman Lt Col Paul Haverstick . ※At the request of the Services, DoD is reviewing the parameters of the individual invitations.§The VMAs will take place at the Forum in Inglewood, California, on 27 August.

"The boss of Amazon＊s television production arm has hinted that the company is planning significant expansion into sports broadcasting.Roy Price, the head of  Studios, said at the Edinburgh international television festival that sport was a good opportunity for Amazon＊s video streaming service.The comments suggest Amazon could compete to win rights to show  matches when the next auction launches next year.. These rights are currently held by Sky and allow it to show the end-of-year ATP World Tour finals, won by Andy Murray last year at the O2 arena in London.※People love sports 每 it＊s big, it＊s engaging, it really motivates people, so I think that＊s a good opportunity,§ Price said. ※I think it＊s definitely an opportunity we＊ll explore.§annually to retain the lion＊s share of Premier League matches because of potential competition from Google, Apple, Facebook and Netflix as well as Amazon. The rights are split between Sky and BT at present, with Sky paying almost ?4.2bn for the majority of matches in the last three-year deal.Price refused to provide more details about what Amazon may bid for or its expansion plans in sport.The Amazon boss also praised the success of the Grand Tour, the motoring show featuring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May. ※I would take four more of those [type of shows] any day,§ he said.Price suggested Amazon could eventually sell the rights to the Grand Tour to broadcasters around the world to show as a repeat, raising the prospect of Clarkson returning to terrestrial television in Britain.Amazon underlined its ambitions in TV by announcing significant new shows at Edinburgh. These include Carnival Row, a fantasy noir starring Orlando Bloom as a police inspector investigating the murder of a faerie showgirl. The series will feature eight episodes and will be released in 2019.Price said Amazon was keen for more big shows and that Game of Thrones, HBO＊s fantasy epic, had changed the TV industry.※Game of Thronesto me is to television what Jaws was to movies after the 70s,§ he said. ※Jaws and Star Warscame out and set an example. I think one thing that＊s an example of is thinking out of the box and making it bigger and more cinematic and having bigger budgets. Bigger world, bigger budgets 每 that＊s something I would anticipate throughout the marketplace.※I think everybody wants to have one of the top 10 shows, one of the top five shows. That＊s really what matters most. I think [Game of Thrones] set a good example and has really gone above and beyond in terms of delivering a big world with high stakes and everybody gets behind it.※I think as people focus on getting in the top five and the top 10 some of the constraints will fall away 每 in terms of cast, who participates and how much you spend.§Price, who was speaking to Channel 4＊s chief creative officer, Jay Hunt, also denied that the rise of Amazon, Netflix and other services meant there was too much TV.※I think there＊s a lot of great TV,§ he said. ※I don＊t find the world is running out of ideas, so I＊m not sure I relate to that, or maybe I don＊t understand it. But I＊ve heard it many times 每 we can＊t make any more peak TV.§																																											"

When he talks to different audiences, even within just a few days, he doesn＊t just tweak his style, he changes his message.§Noah then discussed his ultimate theory about Trump and how this week has proved him right. ※Trump＊s swings are only surprising if you expect Trump to actually be president. But Donald Trump isn＊t a president, he＊s just playing one on TV,§ he said. ※Trump is simply exploiting something we＊ve all known about politics: half of it is performance.§He continued: ※It＊s acting.

"A young adult novel has been removed from the No 1 position on the  bestseller lists, after detective work worthy of Nancy Drew by YA writers on Twitter uncovered a trail of strategic preorders being placed in particular US bookshops.Lani Sarem＊s Handbook for Mortals is about ※a free-spirited young woman, from a long dynasty of tarot-card readers, fortunetellers, and practitioners of magick [who] travels to Las Vegas and uses supernatural powers to become part of a premiere magic show§. It took the top spot on the New York Times young adult bestseller list this week, ahead of Angie Thomas＊s novel . Industry monitor Nielsen Bookscan recorded 18,597 sales of Handbook for Mortals in one weekend.But author Phil Stamper began to ask questions, pointing out that the book＊s publisher  and that the novel was . ※A book that no one has heard of except for the two niche blogs that covered the GN press release. Sells ~5,000 in the first week? Ok,§ Stamper wrote on Twitter on Thursday. ※You shouldn＊t be able to buy your way on to the  list. But here we are.§Stamper and other YA writers, including Jeremy West, began to investigate. Stamper shared messages he had received from bookshop staff who said they had been contacted to see if their store was an NYT-reporting shop 每 the paper＊s lists are collated from information supplied by  每 before a bulk order was placed. Another bookshop shared similar information with West, while Publishers Weekly reported that a shop outside Las Vegas had  after learning it was an NYT-reporting shop. Entertainment website , which first reported on the controversy, speculated that ※someone, whoever they may be, hopes to use the ＆#1 New York Times bestselling novel＊ moniker as a launching pad to a studio deal§. An IMDb page for an adaption of the novel lists the author, Sarem (who is also an actor and music act manager), as lined up to play the lead character.West told Publishers Weekly: ※As soon as I saw the list yesterday, it didn＊t make sense to me. The lack of social media buzz [for the book], the fact that no one in the young adult community was talking about it or had even heard of it ＃ it all sounded fishy.§ West said he had spoken to five bookshops about the novel. ※They all said the same thing: someone called and placed a large order or asked about placing a large bulk order ＆for an upcoming event＊.§Shortly afterwards, the NYT changed its list, removing Sarem＊s title and putting Thomas＊s novel 每 in which a teenager＊s unarmed best friend is shot by a police officer 每 back into the top spot. The paper said: ※After investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we＊ve decided that the sales for Handbook for Mortals do not meet our criteria for inclusion. We＊ll be issuing an updated Young Adult Hardcover list for September 3 which will not include that title.§Sarem, speaking to Publishers Weekly, said: ※It＊s silly to say ＆I didn＊t know about this book, so how can it be doing well?＊ We should all be supportive of each other.§ She added that she had been promoting the book at Wizard World Comic Con events, and that there had been a lot of buzz around it. Thomas thanked those who had investigated the situation. ※Omg . Thanks to everyone who investigated, spoke out, and supported.

"hen James Cameron and Patty Jenkins engaged in  last week over Jenkins＊s Wonder Woman, the ground-breaking film-makers were engaging in a time-honored tradition: the director feud. Sure, their spat had higher stakes. Instead of quibbling over artistic, financial or personal differences, theirs was a political disagreement over who gets to define feminism. Spoiler alert: the man lost, at least on social media.Still, feuds between directors are nothing new, and it＊s easy to see why. Film-making is a highly competitive business engaged in by artists who are accustomed to having total control over their final products. Some sniping between artists is inevitable, but in some cases, the early warning shots can escalate into all-out war.The feud between Smith and Burton started when Smith noticed that an image at the end of Burton＊s 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes 每 a statue of Abraham Lincoln but with the head of an ape 每 looked like it was ripped from a comic book written by Smith. The Clerks director made a public statement that he was contemplating legal action. He claims he was joking, but Burton was not in a laughing mood, responding: ※Anyone who knows me knows I would never read a comic book.§ Smith retorted, ※Which explains ＆Batman＊.§ Despite the swift escalation, the feud did no lasting damage. Burton has become Disney＊s go-to guy for live-action blockbusters, with Alice in Wonderland and the upcoming Dumbo, while Smith has been dining out on the story for years, telling it first on an episode of IFC＊s Dinner for Five and then regularly on his speaking tours.The seminal French New Wave filmmakers were once close friends 每 they were critics at the influential Cahiers du Cinema together before they started making movies 每 but as their careers progressed, their paths diverged. In the 1970s, Godard＊s films became more political, while Truffaut explored commercialism. After his Oscar-winning film Day for Night, in which Truffaut essentially plays himself making a film within the film, was released in 1973, tensions finally boiled over. Godard sent Truffaut a letter, chastising him for misrepresenting the film-making process. Truffaut wrote back to tell Godard that he had been ※acting like a shit§ for years. The two never reconciled, but after Truffaut＊s death in 1984, Godard wrote candidly about their feud: ※If we tore each other apart little by little, it was for fear of being the first to be eaten alive.§Director/internet meme  is no stranger to feuds. His friendship with actor and frequent collaborator Klaus Kinski devolved into murderous rage, with Herzog once literally trying to burn the actor＊s house down while he slept. His feud with director Abel Ferrara is prosaic by comparison. When Ferrara learned that Herzog was making a sequel to his 1992 film Bad Lieutenant, and, most importantly, that Herzog would be taking home a heftier paycheck than he did, Ferrara became enraged. In an interview with Filmmaker Magazine, he said of Herzog and the film＊s producers, ※They can die in hell.§ Typically, Herzog replied with bizarro elegance: ※I have no idea who Abel Ferrara is. But let him fight the windmills, like Don Quixote.§ While Herzog and Kinski never reconciled, he and Ferrara crossed paths at the 2013 Locarno Film Festival and patched things up within earshot of several reporters.One of the benefits of a director feud is that it can result in extra publicity for both parties. Rian Johnson, director of this year＊s Star Wars sequel The Last Jedi, had a little fun with this idea back in 2011, when he announced on Twitter he was looking to start a feud in ※a calculated effort to simultaneously increase my brand awareness and avoid writing§. He settled on Juno and Up in the Air director , whose qualifications, according to Johnson, were that he was a nice guy and more talented than him. Johnson unleashed his fury in the form of some lame dad jokes 每 ※Reitman? More like WRONG man,§ read one 每 and Reitman reciprocated with a link to the Notorious BIG song, Warning. Days later, Johnson announced that they had reconciled their differences over a long, alcohol-fueled adventure in Mexico. It wouldn＊t make a bad movie.The two Danish directors have known each other since Refn was a child 每 his father edited several of von Trier＊s films. In recent years, their friendship has had to overcome some significant hurdles. It was during a Cannes press conference in 2011 that von Trier noted that his recent discovery that he was related to Nazis ※gave [him] some pleasure§ and joked that his next film would be ※The Final Solution.§ Refn, along with a chorus of others, publicly criticized him, causing von Trier to reply, ※Fuck him!§ and later complain that Refn should have come to his defense. Still, that wasn＊t enough to quash their friendship. The two remained cordial until last year, when Refn revealed that the ※over the hill§ director tried to sleep with his wife, which apparently, is worse than being a Nazi.In recent years, Hollywood＊s structural racism has been heavily scrutinized, and it＊s long overdue. Spike Lee was always ahead of the curve, using his filmmaking acumen to skew Hollywood in Bamboozled and his public platform to call out other film-makers for their racial transgressions. He has famously criticized  for his perceived obsession with black culture and, more specifically, frequent use of the N-word in his films. As Django Unchained was about to hit theaters, he announced he would be skipping the movie, and followed up with a tweet explaining why: ※American Slavery Was Not a Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western.§ He has similarly taken issue with Clint Eastwood, complaining that Flags of Our Fathers omitted the contributions of black soldiers, and Tyler Perry, whose Madea films he has called out for being the equivalent of modern-day minstrels. Lee certainly knows how to get under their skin. In response, Tarantino called him a ※son of a bitch,§ Eastwood told him to ※shut his face,§ and Perry, taking a page from Abel Ferrara＊s playbook, reportedly stated, ※Spike Lee can go straight to hell.§ If that＊s where the perpetrators of director feuds go, at least he will have a lot of company.

"Late-night hosts on Monday addressed the solar eclipse, the now infamous photo of  looking at the sun without protective glasses, and a new report that protection at Trump Tower and for the president＊s entire family has depleted the Secret Service＊s funds.※People all over America gathered today to watch the first total solar eclipse in 38 years,§ , back from a hiatus of several weeks, began. ※I went out, I had a great time. Everyone in the building enjoyed it. But I think it is safe to say that nobody in America enjoyed it more than Fox News＊s Shep Smith.§Noah then showed footage of the anchor＊s coverage of the rare event, which rendered him more excitable than usual.※That there is the joy of of a news anchor who finally gets to cover a story that doesn＊t involve Donald Trump,§ Noah joked. ※Today really felt like a special day in America. I don＊t know if you felt it, but everyone came together, we were all just doing the same thing. People in the street, kids came out of school.※They were even watching at the White House,§ the host explained. ※Donald Trump and Melania were watching together, which surprised me because, two minutes of total darkness, that should have been her chance to escape.※And apparently the president＊s aides were really worried about him so they told him not to look directly into the sun, and Donald Trump was like, ＆Don＊t worry about me, that＊s my policy. Don＊t look at the son. Don＊t talk to the son. And definitely don＊t celebrate the son＊s birthday,＊§ Noah said, showing a photo of Eric Trump.The host detailed his vacation to South Africa and the country＊s history of apartheid before addressing the violence in Charlottesville that occurred while The Daily Show was off the air.※Turns out I left the third world and landed in the Third Reich,§ Noah said. He went on: ※I know that this happened a week ago, but I＊m still processing everything. First of all, a racist neo-Nazi kills a peacefully protesting woman with his car. Then the president of the United States defended the neo-Nazis who that dude was marching with. Not once, but twice.※This was clearly not what presidents do. After tragic national events, even a mediocre leader says the things to unite the country, to calm the tensions, not inflame them,§ the host said. ※Seven months into his term 每 41 months to go, by the way 每 and the president of the United States has officially legitimized white supremacists, basically saying we need to see things from the Nazi point of view.§Noah then showed recent polling data about the president＊s response to Charlottesville, in which 67% of Republicans supported his response to the tragedy.※If so many of Trump＊s supporters are willing to give Nazis the benefit of the doubt, then clearly anything goes,§ he concluded. ※There＊s no line that they won＊t cross and clearly no cross that they won＊t burn.§Conan O＊Brien of TBS also addressed the day＊s news and the latest regarding Trump.※After being advised specifically not to look at the sun without protective glasses, President Trump stared at the eclipse today without protective glasses,§ O＊Brien began. ※So afterwards everyone started advising him, ＆Whatever you do, don＊t resign. Don＊t do that.＊§ O＊Brien also weighed in briefly on a report claiming that the Secret Service is struggling with its budget given that 42 people in Trump＊s orbit are given Secret Service protection.※A new report came out that it costs so much to protect President Trump＊s entire family, that the Secret Service is going bankrupt,§ O＊Brien said. ※In fact, today the Secret Service asked Trump if they could just skip Eric. And experts are saying that president Trump is already preparing for the 2020 election.※Some people think that＊s overly optimistic, but others are saying, no, he＊ll probably be paroled by then,§ O＊Brien quipped.

"t＊s always tempting to mythologise the dead, especially those who die young and beautiful. And if the dead person is also astonishingly gifted, then the myth becomes inevitable.  was just 27 when he died, in 1988, a strikingly gorgeous young man whose stunning, genre-wrecking work had already brought him to international attention; who had in the space of just a few years morphed from an underground graffiti artist into a painter who commanded many thousands of dollars for his canvases.So perhaps I shouldn＊t be surprised that everyone I talk to who knew Basquiat when he was alive, from girlfriends to collectors, musicians to painters, speaks about him as special. Still, it＊s noticeable that they all do. Basquiat 每 even before he was acknowledged as an artist 每 was seen by his friends as exceptional.※I knew when I met him that he was beyond the normal,§ says musician and film-maker Michael Holman, who founded the noise band Gray with Basquiat. ※Jean-Michel had his faults, he was mischievous, he had certain things about him that could be called amoral, but setting that aside, he had something that I＊m sure he had from the moment he was born. It was like he was born fully realised, a realised being.§※He was a beautiful person and an amazing artist,§ says Alexis Adler, a former girlfriend. ※I recognised that from the get-go. I knew he was brilliant. The only person around that time I felt the same thing about was Madonna. I totally, 100% knew they were going to be big.§Basquiat the man and Basquiat the painter are hard to untangle. He lived hard and died harder (from an unintentional heroin overdose), and had more of the rock-star persona than the art aesthete about him, a cool celebrity sparkle that didn＊t always work in his favour. Some art connoisseurs find his work hard to take seriously; others, though, have an immediate, almost visceral response. To me, a non-art critic, his work is fantastic: it feels contemporary, with a chaotic, musical sensibility. It＊s beautiful and hectic, young and old, graphic, arresting, packed with ambiguous codes; there＊s a questioning of identity, especially race, and a sampling of life＊s stimuli that takes in music, cartoons, commerce and institutions, as well as celebrities and art greats. (Not sex, though: though he had lots of partners, his paintings are rarely erotic.). You could stand in front of a Basquiat painting and be fascinated for hours.Since he died, Basquiat has had a mixed reputation. There was a time in the 1990s when he was dismissed as a lightweight. Museums rejected him as a jumped-up wall-sprayer. But over the past few years, his star has been on the rise and even those who are snooty about his art can＊t argue with his cultural influence. A few years ago a Christie＊s spokesperson described him, pointedly, as ※the most collected artist of sportsmen, actors, musicians and entrepreneurs§. As one of the few black American painters to break through into international consciousness, he is referenced a lot in hip-hop: Kanye West, Jay-Z, Swizz Beatz, Nas and others cite Basquiat in their lyrics; Jay-Z, in Most Kingz, uses the ※most kings get their head cut off§ phrase from Basquiat＊s painting . Jay-Z and Swizz Beatz own his works, as do Johnny Depp, John McEnroe and Leonardo DiCaprio. Debbie Harry was the first person ever to pay for a Basquiat piece; Madonna owns his art and they dated for a couple of months in the mid-80s.A household name in the US, Basquiat is less well known in the UK, though the , the highest amount ever for an American artist at auction, made headlines. Now, Boom for Real, a vast exhibition at the Barbican 每 the first Basquiat show in the UK for more than 20 years 每 aims to open our eyes. Researched and curated for four years, it follows his career from street to gallery, acknowledges the exceptional times he was working in, and expands its references from straightforwardly visual art to music, literature, TV and movies, all areas in which Basquiat experimented. It tries to see things from Basquiat＊s point of view.Eleanor Nairne, co-curator of the show, explains why there hasn＊t been a full retrospective until now. Although Basquiat was immensely prolific during his short life, institutions were slow to recognise his talent. ※The time between his first solo show and his death was six years,§ she says. ※Institutions do not move that quickly. During his lifetime he only had two shows in a public space [as opposed to a commercial gallery]. There＊s not a single work in a public collection in the UK.§ There are not many in the US, either: the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York has a couple, but when the city＊s Museum of Modern  (MoMA) was offered his work when he was alive, it said no, and it still doesn＊t own any of his paintings (it has some on loan). The head curator, Ann Temkin, later admitted that Basquiat＊s work was too advanced for her when she was offered it. ※I didn＊t recognise it as great, it didn＊t look like anything I knew.§Basquiat was born to a middle-class family in Brooklyn. His father was Haitian 每 quite a strict figure 每 and his mother, whose parents were Puerto Rican, was born in Brooklyn. His parents split up when he was seven and he and his sisters lived with his father, including a move, for a while, to Puerto Rico. His mother, to whom he was close, was committed to a mental hospital when he was 11. Basquiat was rebellious, angry, and moved from school to school. His education ended in New York when, for a dare, he emptied a box of shaving cream over the principal＊s head during a graduation ceremony. By 15, he was leaving home on and off. He once slept in Washington Square Park for a week.New York City in the late 1970s was utterly unlike it is now: un-glitzy, rough, with many buildings burnt out and abandoned. ※The city was crumbling,§ says Alexis Adler, ※but it was a very free time. We were able to do whatever we wanted because nobody cared.§ Rents were cheap (or people squatted) and downtown New York was a grubby, exhilarating mecca for the artistic dispossessed. The punk scene, centred on the venue CBGB, was giving way to something more experimental, involving art, film and what would become hip-hop. Everyone went out every night, everyone was creative, everyone was going to make it big.※We were all these young kids in New York to carry out our Warhol fantasy,§ says Michael Holman, ※but instead of being a ringleader as Warhol was, we were in the band ourselves, making art ourselves, we were acting in films, making films, we were all one-man shows, with a lot of collaborations. That was the norm, to be a polymath. Whether you were a painter, an actor, a poet＃ you also had to be in a band, in order to really be cool.§Basquiat was, of course, in a band, with Holman and others including Vincent Gallo; they were called Gray. They formed in 1979, but before that, Basquiat made his presence felt through his graffiti. Working with his school friend Al Diaz, from 1978 he was spraying the buildings of downtown NYC with their shared SAMO tag. SAMO?, originally a cartoon character Basquiat had drawn for a school magazine, was derived from the phrase ※same old shit§. It was meant, in part, to be a satire on corporations and the tag was straightforward, not decorative. Instead of pictures, SAMO? asked odd questions, or made enigmatic, poetic declarations: ※ [sic]§ or ※PAY FOR SOUP, BUILD A FORT, SET THAT ON FIRE§. The SAMO? tag was everywhere. Before anyone knew Jean-Michel Basquiat, they knew SAMO?.Basquiat left home permanently at 16 and slept on the sofas and floors of friends＊ places, including UK artist Stan Peskett＊s Canal Street loft. There he made friends with graffiti artists including Fred Brathwaite (better known as Fab 5 Freddy) and Lee Qui?ones of graffiti group the Fabulous 5, and made postcards and collages. (Once Basquiat spotted  in a restaurant, popped in and sold him a couple of those postcards.) Brathwaite and Holman put on a party at the loft on 29 April 1979, as a way of bringing uptown hip-hop to the downtown art crowd. Before the party started, Holman remembers, this kid turned up, and said he wanted to be in the show. Holman didn＊t know him, but ※people with that kind of energy, you never stand in their way, you just say, Yes, go!§ They set up a large piece of photo paper and Basquiat started spraying it with a can of red paint. He wrote: ※Which of the following is omniprznt [sic]? a) Lee Harvey Oswald b) Coca Cola logo c) General Melonry or d) SAMO.§ ※And we all went, Oh my God, this is SAMO!§ says Holman. Later at the party, Basquiat asked Holman, who had been in the art-rock band the Tubes, if he too wanted to be in a band. Gray was formed there and then.The members of Gray, which settled into the line-up of Holman, Basquiat, Wayne Clifford and Nick Taylor, deliberately used painting or sculpture as references, as opposed to music. Their highest expression of praise was ※ignorant§, used in the same way as bad (meaning good). Holman recalls playing a gig with a long loop of tape passing through a reel-to-reel machine and then around the whole band. Brathwaite was at Gray＊s first gig, at the Mudd Club in New York, and said later: ※David Byrne [of Talking Heads] was there. Debbie Harry. It was a real who＊s who. Everyone was there because of Jean＃SAMO＊s in a band! They came out and played for just 10 minutes. Somebody was playing in a box.§Gray ended when Basquiat＊s painting took off. He was always painting and drawing, initially in the style of Peter Max (think ), but quickly found his own aesthetic, which used writing, and had elements of  and . Because he had no money for canvases, he painted on the detritus he dragged in from the street 每 doors, briefcases, tyres 每 as well as the more permanent elements in his flat: the fridge, the TV, the wall, the floor. About the same time that Gray began, Basquiat started dating Adler, then a budding embryologist (he stepped in to protect her when she innocently provoked a street fight). Adler found a flat 每 at 527 East 12th Street 每 where she still lives today, and they both moved in. There, Basquiat painted on everything, including Adler＊s clothes. (When, in 2013, Adler revealed that she had kept a lot of his work, she sold an actual wall of her flat via a Christies auction: it had a Basquiat painting of Olive Oyl on it. ※They were careful about taking it out,§ she tells me. ※And now we have glass bricks there instead!§)Although she and Basquiat were sleeping together, it wasn＊t a straightforward boyfriend-girlfriend thing, says Adler. ※It was before Aids, a wild time, you could have whatever relationship you wanted.§ They had separate rooms, and had sex with other people. Adler bought a camera to take pictures of Basquiat＊s art, and of him mucking about: he played with putty on his nose, was interested in film and TV (his phrase ※boom for real§, used when he was impressed, came from a TV programme), and shaved the front half of his head, so he would ※look as though he was coming and going at the same time§.They went out every night to the newly opened Mudd Club, in the Tribeca district. Friends came over until all hours (hard for Adler, who worked in a laboratory by day). PiL＊s  was on rotation, along with Bowie＊s and records by Ornette Colman, Miles Davis. Adler loved and nailed the cover up on the wall. When Basquiat saw it, he was full of disdain. He took the album down and nailed up William Burroughs＊s in its place. ※He found it offensive that I would put it up,§ says Adler. It wasn＊t good enough to be art in his eyes.Basquiat lasted at Adler＊s flat until the spring of 1980. During that year, his work featured in a couple of group shows and he played the lead role in the film  (eventually released in 2000 as ; the  show will play it in full). In the film, Basquiat is the star, but it＊s fun to play spot-the-famous-person: there are cameos by Debbie Harry, Fab 5 Freddy, Lee Qui?ones; the band DNA and even Kid Creole and the Coconuts make an appearance. The plot is of the day-in-the-life type: Basquiat plays an artist who wanders the street trying to sell a painting so he can get enough money to move back into his apartment. He sells it, but is paid by cheque, so he club-hops, trying to find a girl he can go home with. You can＊t imagine the role was much of a stretch.When he wasn＊t clubbing, Basquiat worked hard 每 Brook Bartlett, an artist he mentored in the early 1980s, recalls him painting incessantly 每 and his shift from being penniless to rich happened between 1981 and 1982. He was by then living with Suzanne Mallouk, who had moved from Canada to become an artist. They＊d met when she was bartending at Night Bird. Basquiat would come in, stand at the back of the room and stare at her. Initially, she thought he was a hobo 每 he had shaved hair at the front of his head, bleached baby dreads at the back, and wore a coat five sizes too big. ※He wouldn＊t come to the bar because he had no money for drinks,§ she recalls. ※But then, after two weeks, he came in, put a load of change down and bought the most expensive drink in the place: R谷my Martin. $7!§. Mallouk was intrigued. They were the same age and had a lot in common. Basquiat moved into her tiny walk-up flat.Within eight months, there was money everywhere. Mallouk: ※I watched him sell his first painting to Deborah Harry for $200, and then a few months later he was selling paintings for $20,000 each, selling them faster than he could paint them. I watched him make his first million. We went from stealing bread on the way home from the Mudd Club and eating pasta to buying groceries at Dean & DeLuca; the fridge was full of pastries and caviar, we were drinking Cristal champagne. We were 21 years old.§ Basquiat would leave piles of cash around the apartment, buy Armani suits by the dozen, throw parties with ※hills of cocaine§. His rise coincided with a shift in the city: financiers were looking to invest in art, and they were cruising around art shows, snapping up new work.The first public showing of Basquiat＊s paintings was in 1981: New York/New Wave, at PS1 in Long Island, brought together by Mudd Club co-founder and curator Diego Cortez. It was a group show that included pieces by William Burroughs, David Byrne, Keith Haring, Nan Goldin, and Andy Warhol, but Basquiat was given a whole wall, which he filled with 20 paintings. (The Barbican show recreates this, with 16 of the original 20 on display.) His work caused a sensation.Basquiat gained a dealer: Annina Nosei. She gave him the basement under her gallery to work in (Fred Brathwaite didn＊t approve: ※A black kid, painting in the basement, it＊s not good, man§, he said later), which was where Herb and Lenore Schorr, benign and interested art collectors, met him. The Schorrs spent some time in the gallery choosing a piece of work, without knowing that Basquiat was working beneath them. Once they＊d decided, he came up, and, though other collectors found Basquiat threatening or obtuse, they liked him immediately. He didn＊t explain his work 每 ※he always said: ※If you can＊t figure it out, it＊s your problem,§ says Lenore; to Bartlett, he said: ※I paint ghosts§ 每 but he pointed out parts that he thought he＊d done particularly well, such as a snake.Things were on the up. In early 1982, Nosei arranged for Basquiat and Mallouk to move from their small flat to the much fancier 151 Crosby Street in Soho, and she hosted his first ever solo show at her gallery: a huge success. Through another dealer, Bruno Bischofberger (his most consistent representative), Basquiat was formally introduced to Andy Warhol; afterwards, Basquiat immediately made a painting of the two of them, and had it delivered to Warhol, still wet, two hours after they＊d parted. They formed the beginning of a friendship. Basquiat was then asked to do a show in LA, at the Gagosian gallery.Film-maker Tamra Davis, who made the Basquiat documentary  (2009), met him in Los Angeles. She was an assistant at another gallery and a friend brought Basquiat over. ※Jean-Michel came and he didn＊t have a car and he didn＊t know where to go and we showed him around,§ she says. ※That was our assignment. It was the funnest thing ever. I was going to film school, and he really loved films, so we would go to the movies together, talk about them. He was the new thing in town, everyone wanted to get to know him. He was so charming, but it was also like hanging out with the Tasmanian devil. Everywhere he went, chaos would occur. You didn＊t know what was going to happen next. It was invigorating, but it was also really tiring.§Basquiat, though, was never tired. He had unending energy, partly drug-fuelled: he needed it in LA, as he brought no paintings with him. He rarely did, for his shows: instead he＊d arrive early at whichever city the show was in and make the paintings there. ※He could make 20 paintings in three weeks,§ says Davis. In 1986, she filmed him working: he would have source books open, the TV on, music playing and worked on several canvases at once. For this first LA show, he created works including  and , the picture that just cost Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa $110.5m (in 1984, it went for $19,000). Every single one sold.Once back in New York, Basquiat left Nosei and joined another dealer, Mary Boone. His reputation was rocketing. The opening for his solo show at Patti Astor＊s Fun Gallery was packed with celebrities, recall the Schorrs, who consider that particular show to be his finest, and all the work sold on the first night.Reviews, however, were scarce. Basquiat＊s push-me-pull-you relationship with the art establishment was becoming evident: the dealer he wanted, Leo Castelli, rejected him as too troublesome; there was prejudice against him for his youth, for having first worked as a graffiti artist, for being untrained, and for being black. His work was represented as instinctive, as opposed to intellectual, though he was well versed in art history; some held the patronising idea that he didn＊t know what he was doing.Racism also had an everyday impact: he would leave successful opening parties and find it impossible to get a cab. Herb Schorr would give him lifts to make his life easier (they would joke that he should wear a peaked cap and be Basquiat＊s driver). George Condo, an artist on the rise at the same time, recalls going to a restaurant with him in LA and not being allowed in. ※I said: ＆Do you know who this is? This is Jean-Michel Basquiat, the most important painter of our time.＊ The guy said, ＆He＊s not coming in. We don＊t allow his kind in here.＊§ Brook Bartlett remembers a trip to Europe in 1982 during which a rich Zurich socialite intimated that she, an 18-year-old white woman, would be a civilising influence on Basquiat, who was four years older and already established. No wonder race became more prominent in his work: in his second LA Gagosian show, in 1983, Basquiat showed paintings such as , , and , featuring black musicians, actors and sportsmen.Drugs, too, were around more and more. ※Everyone in the East Village and in the arts world in the 80s did drugs. Wall Street did drugs, everyone did drugs,§ says Mallouk. But after Mallouk and Basquiat split up in 1983, Basquiat got increasingly into heroin. ※He was sniffing it, smoking it and injecting it,§ says Mallouk. ※There were some models that he was hanging out with that were doing it and that＊s how he got into it.§ He became unreliable, travelling to Japan on a whim, instead of going to Italy, where he had a show. But then, his focus was constantly diverted. Everyone wanted him. He was moving into a different world: his old friends still saw him, but intermittently.During 1984 and 1985, Basquiat＊s star shot higher and higher. There was a lot of travel, a lot of attention. He was featured on the front cover of the  in a suit with his feet bare. The Warhol estate rented him an even bigger place, a loft on Great Jones Street large enough for him to use as a studio as well as a flat, and in 1985 Basquiat and Warhol had a show of paintings that they＊d produced jointly. Though the  has subsequently been constantly reworked and sampled (even Iggy Azalea used it on the of her 2011 mixtape ), at the time, the show was not a success. One critic called Basquiat Warhol＊s ※mascot§. Tamra Davis says this was hard for Basquiat.※He really thought he was finally going to be appreciated,§ she says. ※And instead they tore the show apart and said these horrible things about him and Andy and their relationship. He got really sad, and from then on it was hard to see a comeback. Anybody that you talked to that saw him around that time, he got more and more paranoid, his dread went deeper and deeper.§And gradually, gradually his heroin use was catching up with him. Alhough he was greatly inspired by a trip to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and though he had shows all over the world 每 Tokyo, New York, Atlanta, Hanover, Paris 每 it became known among his friends that he was struggling. Mallouk would go over to his Great Jones loft. ※I would beg him to get help and he just couldn＊t do it,§ she says. ※He threw the TV at me. People would stop me on the street, saying Jean-Michel is in a really bad way, he has spots all over his face, he looks really out of it, you need to go and help him＃ It was pretty common knowledge that he was not well.§In February 1987, Andy Warhol died at the age of 58. Basquiat became increasingly reclusive, though he still created work for shows, and made plans, in early 1988, to revisit Ivory Coast to go to a Senufo village. He began to talk about doing something other than art: writing perhaps, or music, or setting up a tequila business in Hawaii. In 1988, he went to Hawaii to get clean: Davis saw him in LA afterwards. ※He was sober, he was gonna do better, it was like LA had a bit of Shangri-La about it for him.§ But his visit was strange: he brought random people to dinner, people he＊d just met at the airport, and he was unnaturally upbeat, too happy. It made her afraid.In 1988, Anthony Haden-Guest  that describes in detail Basquiat＊s last night: 12 August 1988. In New York, he did drugs during the day, and was dragged out to a Bryan Ferry aftershow party at bank-turned-club MK by his girlfriend, Kelly Inman, and another friend. He left quickly, with his pal Kevin Bray. They went back to the Great Jones loft, but Basquiat was nodding. Bray wrote him a note. ※I DON＊T WANT TO SIT HERE AND WATCH YOU DIE,§ it said. Bray read it out to Basquiat, and left.The next day, Inman went to the apartment at 5.30pm. Jean-Michel Basquiat was dead.It was a sad end to a rocket-flight life. And the subsequent fight between Basquiat＊s estate and various dealers over pieces of his work was not pretty. Collectors sued for paintings bought but never received. Dealers claimed they owned works; the estate said they＊d stolen them. There were too many Basquiat pieces knocking around on the market (500-600 canvasses, according to one expert): the estate would only confirm the provenance of a few. Then the taxman came knocking: Basquiat hadn＊t paid taxes for three years before his death.But the years have softened or resolved the arguments, and the work has had a life of its own. Though most of his most important art is owned by collectors, who keep it hidden away, it keeps seeping out, as if drawn to its public. And we want his work, it appears. Not only are institutions finally coming around to his genius, but his work can be seen on T-shirts, on sneakers (Reebok did a Basquiat range), on the arms of hip-hop artists. Just samples, short clips taken out of context, snippets and hints of the full, mind-whirling Basquiat experience. ※He questions things and he references things he wants you to pay attention to,§ says Davis. ※His paintings were meant to be seen by as many people as possible. They＊re like movies or music, not just for one person alone.§His art is irrevocably intertwined with his life: his charisma and drive, his race, his talent and sad demise. But it is bigger than that. Like the best art, it needs the world and the world needs it. And if you stand in front of a Basquiat and look, it sings its own song, just to you.Basquiat was born fully realised. And if anything, that is the kiss of death: you＊re gonna burn brightly and burn fast. If you impressed him, if he complimented you, you just felt you＊d been blessed by a saint, it was a very emotionally and spiritually profound experience. That＊s one of the ways to calibrate his otherworldliness. Because he would never compliment you if he didn＊t believe it to his core.We all went out [almost] every night, till 4 in the morning. It was so important. Not only did we go out and blow off steam, and meet people, have sex in the bathroom, get high, all that stuff that you do in clubs. But within the clubs the scene also creatively happened ＃ all kinds of happenings, performances, art shows ＃ Club 57 and Mudd Club, they fed us and they directed us and guided us, brought us together with crucial people, in a way that going to openings or concerts just didn＊t do. It created a community that supported each other. It was a special time. With [our band] Gray, I taped a microphone to the head of a snare drum, face down, and attached masking tape to the drum, then pulled the masking tape off and allowed that to be a sound. Jean would loosen the strings on an electric guitar, then run a metal file across the strings. In 1982, two years after Jean left Gray, I＊d become an avant garde film-maker. I had this cable TV show, and I asked him to do an interview. He made it clear to me, without saying anything, that I wouldn＊t be able to do this interview if I didn＊t get high with him. He was doing base, like a high-end form of crack. I＊d never done it before and, boy, I＊ve never done it since. I could barely keep my focus. I could barely stop shaking, but it barely affected him. He had such a high tolerance.He was a sensationalist. He pushed the boundaries of any kind of sensation, anything that would set off his endorphins, his nerve endings, his brain cells. He was after the sensation of something special and brilliant and different and electric and massive. Would he have been good at middle age? Well, part of middle age is the struggle of coming to this place in which you know you＊ve plateaued in some ways. When we pass that hump and start going down the other way, we are living and dying at the same time. I don＊t think he wanted to go there.: We were very excited by the first painting we saw by him. This is not a common reaction, we＊ve found, even now! He＊s a very difficult artist for many, many people. But we just felt he was a wonderful, brilliant artist, very, very early.: The artists understood him 每 some of them. They were there first, along with a few professionals. Basically, he had his collector base, but they weren＊t knocking down the doors for them as they are today. There was not this hysteria. Really, nothing changes. We＊re just finishing reading a book called  by Cynthia Saltzman, which is about a Van Gogh painting, and a lot of it is the same story as Basquiat. It takes 20 years after his death before a Van Gogh enters a museum. Anything which breaks new ground takes a while for people to catch up to.: Jean was very smart and he knew his art history. Modernism, Picasso, right up to the present and Jean knew it all. So we really had a nice rapport. I could see it in his work, Picasso, Rauschenberg, they were all important influences, he had absorbed their work. It was beautifully rendered, remade in his language, with his message, with New York at the time, his personal feelings.: We didn＊t see him in a drugged state, well maybe once, he seemed a little angry, he wasn＊t the same person. He would call and maybe he needed more money. Once, he called us up early in the morning and we lived in the suburbs, you know, and he said, ※I need money, I have a painting for you.§ But he didn＊t turn up by the end of the day ＃: It＊s so sad, he tried to get off it. Andy Warhol tried hard with him, they would exercise together.: We have good memories of him. One time he said he wanted to come up and have a white man＊s barbecue.: We expected him around three and he shows up at eight, with friends. It was quite a party, there was skinny-dipping 每 not me! 每 I had the kids here and there was a little pot being smoked, I could smell it, and we were like, We＊re gonna be busted! It was a great, fun evening.We immediately had this feeling of kindred spirits. We were the same age, I left home at 15, so did he. We were both first generation from immigrant families 每 my father was Palestinian, his father was Haitian. Both of us didn＊t fit into any racial or ethnic group. Both of us suffered racism. We both had old-world fathers who used corporal punishment. My mother is English, from Bolton. His stepmother was English. It was very interesting, the common histories we had. Authoritarian fathers that saw European women as a prize. And I think it really shaped Jean-Michel＊s experience. He was intelligent enough to resent that European women were somehow valued more, he saw the racism in that, yet most of his girlfriends were white. He was conflicted about it; he discussed it with me.I hated that I had a job and he didn＊t. I was an artist, too 每 how dare he make me work as a waitress and live off me! Often I would come home and he would take money out of my purse to buy drugs. We would have terrible fights. He would say, ※I promise I＊ll look after you when I＊m famous, please just let me do my art, I＊m going to be famous very soon.§ But I didn＊t keep anything, so I didn＊t get anything. He didn＊t like me keeping things, he would almost be jealous of his own artwork. He would say, ※Why do you want to keep something of mine when you have me?§ Eventually, he gave me the message that really I could no longer be an artist. He was the only artist in the family and I had to look after him. It was kind of misogynist.It wasn＊t that he only saw Andy [Warhol] as a father figure, he also really had a flirtation with him. Often when I was with the two of them together, it didn＊t feel like I was there with Jean; it felt like I was there with two homosexual lovers. He once joked with me that he had had sex with Andy, but I don＊t know if it was a joke. Jean had a history of being bisexual, but Warhol was asexual, so I don＊t know. People misunderstand the relationship if they just think Andy was helping Jean. Jean was already he was highly established, he was already famous or Andy would not have been interested in him. I think Andy needed new life breathed into his career; I think the two of them needed each other.Two weeks before his death, I was living with a new boyfriend in my little East Village hovel. Jean rang the buzzer in the middle of the night and we both got up, and said ※Who is it?§ ※Jean-Michel, Jean-Michel, is Suzanne there?§ I buzzed him in but he never came up. I ran down the stairs to look for him, but he＊d gone, and two weeks later he was dead. My heart was broken when I ran down the stairs and he was gone. Because I never stopped loving him. I still feel love for him and he＊s been dead for over 30 years.You＊re going to think I＊m mad, but I have dreams, and in the dreams Jean-Michel is ageing. It＊s as though he＊s living in a parallel universe. And often he＊s annoyed that I＊m there, he＊s like, ※Don＊t tell anyone I＊m here Suzanne. Don＊t tell anyone I faked my death, and especially don＊t tell the !§ He＊s just living a really simple life, in the swamplands of Florida and he sells crocodile eggs. He has this hippy wife and about eight little dreadlocked children. I like it.Jean-Michel was the first person I had ever met from New York City. We were both in art punk bands 每 he was in Gray and I was in Girls. Our first gig was at Tier 3, a club in Tribeca, in 1979, and they were opening for us. So I saw Jean at the soundcheck, and we started talking about electronic music from the late 50s. I had no idea he was an artist, nor did he know I was, we just were mutual admirers of Davidovsky and Cage.Later on the same evening at the Mudd Club, we both started talking about art and he told me he was in a show, so I went to the opening and was blown away by the paintings. In a way he persuaded me to move to New York. At that moment, I knew it was time to leave Boston for good.So at the end of December I left. I can remember vividly thinking, ※It＊s day one of the 80s, how great, and I＊m in New York. This is where I live now.§The scene in New York was turbulent, but wild and exciting, dangerous and demanding. It seemed like you had to become a famous artist by the time you were 24 "

"r you were finished. The pressure was extremely intense. Music was an enormous influence on both of us. Rap had come in and replaced the jazz scene to a degree; artists were using words to execute lines and phrases that normally would have been shouted out by people like Miles Davis or Eric Dolphy with their instruments. Each of us had a number of friends who were rappers and originators of the new movement that led to hip-hop. But he came to see me in Paris in 85 and I showed him this VHS of Miles playing So What with his original quintet and that immediately set him off to do an amazing drawing with trumpets and the words ※whole tone and hole tone§ all over it. But someone stole it.I was heartbroken when he died. I could see it coming	 in his work and in his life	 but I hoped it was just another insane way of him pushing the envelope to the extreme. The last time I saw him was at [the restaurant] Indochine; he told me	 ※I＊m all washed up in this town ＃ nobody will show my work ＃ nobody.§ It was a few weeks before he died.	 Only Bruno Bischofberger	 his long-time gallerist	 was still behind him. The pranks	 the excessive junk habit	 the sultry indifference had turned everyone off. He said the only guy left willing to show him was Vrej Baghoomian. I said	 ※Wait a minute 每 that＊s the guy who＊s showing me! Even when I tried to tell him not to.§ We both cracked up and ended up walking up to Times Square just lamenting and singing out our blues in the streets. I walked him all over town thinking I would see him again soon. But I never did.Whenever I ran into him	 he was always like	 ※Are you working?§ He was like a mom or something	 ※What are you doing with your life?§ I was making music at the time and we would fight about that a lot. He would say	 ※I did my thing with music 每 you＊re basically a slave	 especially as a black man	 there＊s no respect. If I get into the music industry	 I＊m just gonna be another nigger	 that＊s how it＊s gonna be. But as a painter	 my colleagues are Picasso	 Rauschenberg.§ He was very proud to be black and very sensitive about it.What happened to us was [all about] money and race. He said	 ※I have to go to St Moritz to see my dealer	 he＊s kind of a shark but he＊s a good shark. Come with me	 it＊s your 18th birthday	 I hate leaving New York	 I＊ve never been to Europe.§So we met Bruno [Bischofberger	 Basquiat＊s Swiss dealer]. We took a private jet over the Alps	 went to this dinner of Count so-and-so. It was the Iran hostage crisis at the time	 [there was] a blockade. And these people had decided to smuggle caviar out of Iran. There were salad bowls filled with Iranian caviar and people put ? litre-sized amounts of caviar on their baked potatoes while doing coke.We ended up in a conversation with one of the guys doing the coke and [he] looked at me	 just turning 18 that day	 a girl who had never shown any demonstrably great work	 and said	 ※You will be important for his work	 you must show him the way	 you will be instrumental＃§ basically talking as though I should be taming this savage. And I was just like	 this party is revolting	 I wanna go home.On the way back on the plane	 he was nervous	 he drank a lot and he was held up for about two hours in customs. When he got out he just said that they questioned that he could fly in first class as a black man with dreadlocks. We kept walking and this black janitor	 pushing a broom	 like from a movie	 says to him	 ※What they get you for	 brother?§ And [Basquiat] turned round and said to him	"" ※I＊m not your fucking brother.§ And kept walking. This was the guy who would give $100 bills to any Bowery bum; any brother that talked to him he wanted to talk to them. That broke my heart."""""""

"CD Soundsystem had rarely put a foot wrong before they announced a huge farewell in 2011 每 and then reformed, with what many felt was indecent haste, in 2015. But LCD main man James Murphy had a good excuse for bringing back the band: his idol, David Bowie, . (If you took Bowie＊s passing badly, just imagine how Murphy must have felt, with his three albums riddled with Bowie tributes, and a dream-come-true?)On this evidence, Bowie was not wrong.  每 released ahead of the album 每 is as succulent an iteration of LCD＊s core squelch as fans could wish for. Accompanied by guitarist Al Doyle (Hot Chip), Murphy sets up a motorik disco groove mighty enough to carry the weight of Murphy＊s pin-sharp musings on death and music.Pop stares down the abyss, Murphy seems to be saying, so carpe diem 每 except, this being , it＊s more about seizing the night, where three minutes can unfurl into for ever. ※And we＊re frankly thankful for the market psychology you＊re hipping us to,§ he offers, notably less sarcastic than of old.It takes five tracks to get to this sweet, propulsive midpoint. The journey there 每 through the late 1970s and early 80s 每 is slow, but well worth it. Few of these latest LCD songs land perfectly on the first listen; seismically, there are 10 of them on , one more than usual. What＊s Murphy doing, crooning a simple love song, Oh Baby, the album opener? Why the oblique post-punk of Change Yr Mind, when we could be dancing? But each song accrues heft the further in you go.Play Other Voices three times, it starts to sound like a classic. Nancy Whang, a sorely underused LCD asset, contributes vocal sass here while some Middle Eastern synth countermelodies weave majestically in and out, Doppler-like and disorienting, as Murphy builds himself up into another tizzy.＊s title feels political, but little here really addresses the wider state of the nation 每 unless you count the bewildering rise of ※the bullying children of the fabulous, raffling off limited edition shoes§. Ever since LCD＊s debut single, , Murphy has been writing music about music, and fretting about change and age;  finds him, at 47, not so much worried about cutting it with the younger set but with an ever more acute sense of time slipping away (※that shit＊s a dictator§), of the passing of ※the Leonards and the Lous§, the friendships lost. How Do You Sleep? is uncharacteristically direct and vicious, a take-down of a one-time friend.It＊s instructional to note that one of?the reasons Murphy broke up LCD?in the first place was to avoid . The dirgey 12-minute closer, Black Screen, is part of an insurance policy. But Black Screen is, in all likelihood, about Murphy＊s friendship with Bowie, and?all the more intriguing?for it. Quite?how Murphy manages to turn all this sombreness into a great LCD album defies logic, but he has landed on his feet, yet again.																																											"

"Perhaps it was  who offered the definitive comment on Tobe Hooper＊s macabre masterpiece from 1974, . Craven called it ※Mansonite§ and in a spirit of dark humour he applied the adjective as much to the film＊s creator as the thing itself. The director had invaded our minds with this diabolically horrible film and very much moved the furniture around in our skulls.This was the nightmarish story of a man called Leatherface who wears a gruesome mask and kills people with a variety of implements including a chainsaw. Like  before, and  afterwards, the grisly, skin-crawling, skin-flaying Leatherface had been taken from the real-life story of , the 50s serial killer who made trophies out of human remains. But it is not merely that Leatherface is an implacable, irrational and essentially motiveless killer: he is part of a secret family or cult within whose enclosed society these horrendous acts have become normalised as part of an evolved ritual. The point is that the ※family§, so readily evoked as the benchmark of wholesome American normality, can be anything but. Families are private; families keep their own secrets; families mind their own business. In the wilderness, where outsiders are rare, where neighbours are 30 minutes＊ drive away, and the uniformed forces of law and order further still, this can mean a great many things.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre became a locus classicus of the censorship and screen violence debates here when it was refused a certificate by the British Board of Film Classification upon its first release, and then in the 1980s, as the era of VCR and video rental dawned, had its brief video release cancelled along with many other ultraviolent provocations such as Hooper＊s next film Eaten Alive (1977), Ruggero Deodato＊s  (1980), Wes Craven＊s Last House On The Left (1972) 〞 notably  〞 and Meir Zarchi＊s I Spit On Your Grave (1980). These became the much-feared, much-gloated-over ※video nasties§ and were refused certificates for two decades after this. But then, inevitably, the rules were relaxed and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre progressed to being a cult classic, a movie revered by new generations of directors. The masked figure became a staple of horror and of course  featured that strangely persistent trope: the final girl, the young woman who achieves a queasy, Pyrrhic victory of survival, balanced against the monster＊s own survival, an undiminished threat which, quite unlike any other movie genre, flavours the closing credits with that sense of non-ending, and open-ended fear and possible sequel.Tobe Hooper learned 〞 or rather taught 〞 a lesson which had been imbibed by other film-makers like  and belatedly by  himself. Pure low-budget horror can be a liberating challenge, and for a technically gifted director it offers the chance to unleash electrifyingly powerful forces within an audience. Another kind of film might hope, with a cleverly composed series of shots, to make its audience sigh, or laugh, or cheer or choke up with tears. A horror director, with approximately the same skillset, can get a colossally bigger payoff: a scream of horror, a yelp of fear that you will remember for the rest of your life. And a brilliant low-budget horror picture can turn huge profits, despite or because of the restrictions on distribution. The economics of horror, particularly in that era, created masterminds of genre cinema 〞 like Tobe Hooper.As for censorship and violent movies, it has been many years since this was a hot-button issue, long since replaced by cyberbullying and grooming on social media. The most strident newspapers in the UK prefer now to pursue winnable campaigns and it has dawned us that these films are now readily available and civilisation as we know it has not come to an end. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, for all its guignol gore, actually showed less explicit horror than people imagined.Many people have ineradicable memories of first having seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as teenagers. I in fact saw it much later, as a student, so had maybe become a bit hardened 〞 or liked to think so. The Tobe Hooper films which really did cause the evacuation of my living daylights were  (1981) and  (1982). Poltergeist is a brilliant, but atypical Tobe Hooper film about the ghosts in a brand new house belonging to a real estate developer. But the auteur-ist bragging rights arguably belong to Steven Spielberg who wrote and produced, and was himself in touch with the forces of B-movie darkness. The authentic slash of Hooper nastiness belongs to The Funhouse which I saw on video, and creeped me out most royally. Four attractive teens get trapped in a carnival, pursued by a horribly deformed killer. The scene in the ghost train in which one of them takes an axe to what they think is their pursuer is one of the most purely horrible, perhaps even evil things I have ever seen in a film. My callous friends all laughed heartily at it. I pretended to do the same. Perhaps I was not a natural audience for Hooper＊s genius. But it has only just occurred to me that my friends were pretending too.Tobe Hooper was an inheritor of that potent streak of madness that has been with us since Titus Andronicus and then the Jacobean nightmares of the English stage; he was a horror director of pure dark inspiration.

"The hit TV comedy Fleabag is to return after its creator, , dreamed up a new idea on a bus.But the second series of the Bafta-winning show will not air until 2019.Waller-Bridge, who was  before , said it had taken a while to work out how to bring the show back.※I really struggled thinking about how to come back, because I didn＊t want to stretch the story even further than I already stretched it, and I felt like the relationship with the audience had evolved by the end,§ the 32-year-old told the Edinburgh international television festival.※So that＊s what has been taking us so long, and me so long, to decide whether or not we＊re going to do it again. And then I was on a bus and had an idea! So we＊re really, really excited.§Waller-Bridge added in a statement: ※I asked myself if Fleabag has more to say and, frankly, she hasn＊t shut up since ＃ Series two will be a whole new adventure and I＊m beyond thrilled to be coming back.§Shane Allen, the BBC＊s controller of comedy, said: ※Fleabag signalled the arrival of a hugely distinctive writer with the mesmerising performing talent to match.※Phoebe＊s career has shot up like a firework display in the last year and the show has been rightly hailed as a modern classic. It＊ll be thrilling to see where she takes the character in the next series.§The producer of the programme, Lydia Hampson, said: ※It＊s quite a long wait, but it＊s happening.§Waller-Bridge wrote and starred in the comedy about a cash-strapped young woman trying to come to terms with a recent tragedy.Producers said the new BBC3 series would ※follow Fleabag through many more outrageous exploits§.

"t was Sarah Smith＊s ※political expertise and pedigree§ that convinced BBC bosses the broadcaster＊s  was the perfect There is her professional pedigree as a hugely experienced and respected journalist with a string of high profile posts at Channel 4 and the BBC under her belt. Then there is her family pedigree, as daughter of . It is always the latter seized on by critics keen to prove left-leaning BBC bias. It has happened before, and it is happening again.Smith, 48, is accustomed to such claims. So-called ※cybernats§ trolled her aggressively when she moved back to her native Scotland from London to present the late-night current affairs show  2014 before the independence referendum. Questioning her impartiality 每 her father thought of devolution as ※the settled will§ of the Scottish people 每 they saw her as London-based ※talent§ exported over the border to buoy BBC anti-independence bias. ※Inevitable§, she has said of such online abuse. Then gets on with her job.Being the eldest daughter of the man who, before his untimely death aged 55 of a heart attack in 1994, was widely tipped to become Labour＊s first prime minister in 18 years has afforded Smith enviable political credentials and contacts. Had he attained his lifetime＊s ambition, however, she might not now be taking over a high-profile slot in the hotly contested Sunday morning broadcast round.It would have meant self-imposed exile. ※Get the hell out of here, was the clear plan. I had no intention of staying. My life would have been impossible. I＊ve never used any kind of nepotism, but I would absolutely shamelessly have phoned ABC or CNN and said: ＆I have a small problem. My father appears to have become British prime minister. Could you help me with a job in New York?＊,§ she has said.Smith was in California on holiday when her father died. He is buried on the Scottish island of Iona in Argyll where, in 2007, she walked up the aisle unaccompanied to marry Simon Conway, a successful novelist who has worked for landmine-clearing charities.Raised in Edinburgh＊s upmarket Morningside with two younger sisters, she attended a comprehensive school, and then Glasgow University, clearly making the most of her student days. On her graduation, her father dragged her into a lecture theatre to ※make sure I＊d seen the inside of one before I left for good§, she has joked.Smith began her career in 1989 as a graduate trainee at BBC Scotland and in Northern Ireland. One of her many strengths, say those who have watched her in action, is that she has extensive experience behind the scenes as well as on screen. ※Pushy§ is how Jeremy Paxman is said to have described her when, as a judge on a debating contest in Edinburgh, he found himself pestered by an undergraduate Smith on how to get into the .She was a researcher and producer at the corporation on programmes such as Newsnight and Public Eye, and by 1997, an onscreen reporter on 5 News, where she was described by one editor as ※extremely lively with a first-class brain§. She spent 15 years with Channel 4 News, during which her frontline roles included Scotland correspondent and Washington correspondent. Her assignments included the first election victory for Barack Obama and the Haiti earthquake.When BBC Scotland beckoned, offering her the chance to anchor Scotland 2014, , she did not hesitate, even though it meant temporarily moving back into her childhood home with her mother, Elizabeth, Lady Smith of Gilmorehill. ※There was a wee bit of ＆Is this a step backwards?＊ but it was a passing thought.§ The offer was too good to decline. Those who have worked with her describe her as very capable, extremely ambitious, and a proven presenter who knows what she is doing. She does not, they say, shy away from a challenge. She launched More4 News, which was a digital success, and taking on Scotland 2014 was considered a pretty tough task.She is seen as part of Scotland＊s political royalty. Family friends have included Donald Dewar, the inaugural first minister of Scotland, the former Labour prime minster Gordon Brown, and the former defence secretary John Reid. The father of the former Scottish Labour leader Wendy Alexander and her brother Douglas, then international development secretary, officiated at her Iona wedding. Her sister Jane is married to Malcolm Robertson, a founding partner of the powerful strategic communications agency Charlotte Street Partners, and the son of Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, the former secretary general of Nato and defence secretary.Being the daughter of a high-profile politician has had some downsides. She has told of attending one Scots night at a Labour party conference with her sister Jane after their father became leader. The two sat diligently beside the Kinnocks, avoiding alcohol and listening to speeches for two hours. ※We thought all the photographers had gone, but the moment we poured a drink and lit a cigarette, there was an explosion of flash bulbs. The picture was in almost every paper the next day,§ she once told the Sunday Times.Described as self-contained and focused at work, she is said to be convivial and a good laugh socially. One journalist in 1999 described a young Smith as ※perky, smokes like a hardened hackette and knows how to drink§.Her rich political history, one source observed, has seen Smith operate at a higher level than anybody else at the BBC in Scotland. It has also meant some stories have been closer to home, though she has never shied away from reporting them. The death of Gordon Brown＊s daughter, Jennifer, was one. Another was Robin Cook＊s death, like her father from a heart attack. ※If anything,§ she has said, ※I probably worked too hard to disassociate myself emotionally on that occasion.§Neither is she afraid to take on her bosses. She was one of several female presenters to publicly criticise the BBC over the recent , and at Channel 4 was one of the signatories to a letter complaining of staff shortages and a ※them and us§ two-tier newsroom.No one appears to doubt her ability to make a success of Sunday Politics. James Harding, director of BBC News, is said to be a big fan. Smith is thought to have thrown her hat in the ring for political editor, which . The thinking is that Smith did not expect to get it but wanted to put a marker down. If true, it seems to have worked.※Everything that has ever happened to me has been a complete accident,§ she said in 2007. ※People think you must have a career plan, but I could never have planned a single thing.§																																											"
"Rather than Catchphrase, ITV viewers will see  in the women＊s rugby World Cup final on Saturday night, underlining the sport＊s soaring popularity.It is the first time the final, being played in Belfast＊s Kingspan stadium, has won a primetime slot on Britain＊s most popular commercial channel and caps a triumphant summer for England＊s female rugby players.It rounds off a bumper summer for women＊s sport, with  in a thrilling final at Lord＊s, and  in a match shown live on Channel 4.  since 1978, while  at the World Para Athletic Championships.The rising popularity of the Red Roses is an illustration of the shifting culture of rugby, which is transforming from a macho sport to one played by tens of thousands of women and girls across the country. ※The women playing at the level of the World Cup are very much the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority of players are all in amateur community clubs,§ said Alex Boutell, club captain for the ladies＊ section of Hampstead rugby club, the largest in central London.According to the Rugby Football Union (RFU), there are about 27,600 female rugby players in England, with more than 550 women＊s and girls＊ teams in 300 clubs.On a warm evening in August, Boutell and fellow members of the Hampstead ladies, who range in age from their early 20s to late 30s, perform technical drills as the sun sets over Parliament Hill fields.※Women＊s rugby is definitely becoming popular, and over the past few years we＊ve seen an uptick in women joining the club,§ said Boutell, 38, a lawyer. ※We＊ve also got a very strong juniors＊ section, and we＊re seeing girls turn up to play in that from the age of six and seven.※The community is consistently growing, both at the grassroots level and senior international level, and both are helping each other. The England ladies are fantastic in the way they represent the sport. They＊re very passionate, not just at their own level but about the development of the sport generally. ※We＊ve had players come down to run a training session or join in. They＊re so friendly and encouraging to people who are playing at or considering playing at lower levels, and that sort of thing really inspires younger players.§The women who join the club do so for many reasons: some want a new challenge, some have ambitions of playing internationally, and some just want to do more exercise. Hannah Witcheard, a 26-year-old nurse, joined a month ago, having never played rugby before. ※I went to my friend＊s engagement party and all her friends were in this team,§ she said. ※They were such a lovely bunch of girls and I missed team sports so I thought: ＆Why not give it a go?＊ You see all these girls playing at a top level, and you think actually it＊s stuff like this where it starts.§About 1.1 million viewers tuned in for England＊s 20-3 semi-final win over France on Tuesday night, and many more are expected to watch Saturday＊s final. Across the channel, France 2 drew a record audience for a women＊s rugby match, with 3.4 million watching that game.The international team has been working hard for years to raise the sport＊s profile, and Saturday＊s final follows a series of successes. England  won the Rugby World Cup in 2014 after a record-breaking seventh consecutive Six Nations win in 2012. They also became the first team in Six Nations history not to concede a try and won the team of the year award at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2014 每 a first for a women＊s team., a 2014 World Cup winner and one of the most prominent faces of international women＊s rugby, said the success of a team always generated more interest. ※People want to know more about it, and coverage in the papers and across the board grows,§ she said. ※If you can see it, then you can be it.§Sports considered to be male-dominated such as rugby, cricket and football, Alphonsi said, were now producing top-class female athletes. ※That＊s changing the culture at the grassroots level. You see more girls and their parents going: ＆It＊s OK, I can get my daughter into sport, because look how successful the top athletes are.＊§Lois Forsell, who works with the Leeds Rhinos Foundation to build the profile of girls＊ rugby league in schools, said the triumphs of the Red Roses, as well as the England women＊s cricket and the football teams, were improving the image of women＊s sport. ※It＊s being seen as less inferior and people are starting to take notice of how much dedication and time women put into their sport,§ said Forsell, who will be representing England in the rugby league World Cup in November.Role models, she added, were changing. ※Rugby is something that girls want to do. It＊s seen as cool. When I was at school I played rugby outside of school with the lads. No one wanted to do it in PE ＃ a lot of the girls that we get playing rugby league now will say: ＆I＊ll come to training but I＊ve got dance afterwards.＊ That crossover wouldn＊t have happened six or seven years ago. It＊s no longer seen as a sport for a certain kind of girl or woman. It＊s open to all,§ Forsell said.All of those in the sport agree that ITV＊s decision to broadcast the final has been highly significant, because it will introduce new groups of people to the sport. In July, the cover of Rugby World magazine was dominated by women＊s rugby for the first time in the publication＊s 57-year history 每 an indication of how far women＊s rugby has come.※There are so many interesting stories in the women＊s game because they have come from so many various backgrounds,§ said the deputy editor, Sarah Mockford. ※Most of these women have had careers and fit their training around that. For example, one New Zealand player who has been playing for three years was also a firefighter.§Mockford said she was more excited about Saturday＊s final than any men＊s finals. ※It＊s great spectacle. The semi-final was a great game of rugby, not a great game of women＊s rugby.§Meanwhile, about 20 of the Hampstead women are travelling to Belfast to watch the game live. ※It＊ll be nice watching it and going: ＆That＊s what we did last weekend.＊§ said Witcheard, before rejoining her own match to run head first at an opponent and tackle her with a thud to the floor. England＊s captain and No 8 began playing rugby league in north-east England before switching to union in her teens. Hunter, who works for the RFU, is a Wigan Warriors fan but might struggle to catch them lining up in the Challenge Cup final on Saturday afternoon.The 20-year-old scored the try that put the Red Roses into the final. The youngest member of England＊s World Cup squad, who has to carry the team mascot, Rory the Lion, throughout the tournament, is a tight-head prop known affectionately as ※Box on legs§ by the rest of the side.England＊s star player scored the match-winning try in the 2014 World Cup final. The centre marked her new-found celebrity by heading back to the family farm in Leicestershire where she grew up helping pick potatoes. Appropriately enough, Scarratt used to teach PE at King Edwards＊ school in Birmingham.The 27-year-old flanker has filled the sizeable boots of the Red Rose＊s most recognised player, Maggie Alphonsi, with aplomb.

Her father, Kawhena, and her uncle Fred Woodman are both former All Blacks, and her aunt Te Aroha Keenan was a New Zealand netballer.																																											"
"Channel 4＊s hopes that  will recoup the ?25m a year it needs to break even have risen after several mouth-watering reviews ahead of its return to TV next week, but a deteriorating advertising market threatens to leave it with a soggy bottom.The broadcaster has looked to cash in on Bake Off＊s status as the biggest show on British TV 每 more than half the viewing public watched the final of the last series on the BBC 每 pushing premium-priced ad slots to recover the ?75m it paid to air the show for the next three years. has been demanding a steep ?150,000-?200,000 for a 30-second slot, compared with a typical peaktime price much closer to ?100,000. Advertisers have been asked to commit to prices comparable to hotly demanded TV events 每 such as an England football match in a World Cup or the Euros, or a slot in an X Factor final when the show was in its prime 每 which can command as much as ?250,000 apiece.With firms＊ advertising budgets being cut and cautiously committed as the economy worsens, many have balked at stumping up such eye-watering sums, particularly given that the popularity of the new-look Bake Off has yet to be tested with fans.※There has been a lot of genuine excitement and hype in the ad community when Channel 4 first got Bake Off but then the reality set in about the cost,§ said one senior executive at a media agency. ※A lot of advertisers are playing a waiting game, they aren＊t breaking down the doors unless it is a bang-on strategic fit and you need to be in it.§Channel 4＊s mission has hardly been helped by new judge Pru Leith ※comforting§ Bake Off fans used to the ad-free BBC by telling them they can always record the show and fast-forward through the almost 17 minutes of ads and sponsors＊ messages.While the launch show is an advertising sellout, there are still plenty of slots available for the remainder of the 10-part series. However, the broadcaster said it was not panicking.※September is selling really well, there are still opportunities 每 which we would completely expect in a show like this,§ said Damon Lafford, the head of agency client sales at Channel 4. ※It is our biggest show and some [slots] get sold now, some get held back for later, that is how you maximise value. It is selling as we would expect it to. Advertisers know it is high value. That will be realised when the show comes back next Tuesday.§However, there have already been setbacks. Channel 4＊s , which would have put it in the big league of Britain＊s Got Talent and The X Factor, failed to ignite a bidding war. The broadcaster ended up settling for a ?4m deal, with one insider admitting it had ※misjudged§ the market.Then, last week a string of extremely positive reviews previewing the new show helped to dispel concerns that, with only one of the original faces still on board, Paul Hollywood, Channel 4 had only acquired what rival ITV uncharitably termed ※baking powder and a tent§.Assuming Bake Off fans switch on in their droves, advertisers who have been sitting on the sidelines will be picking up the phone when TV audience figures are revealed on Wednesday.The show will make headlines if it fails to match the heady heights of the BBC version 每 the final of the last series drew 14 million viewers 每 even though the broadcaster, and advertisers, do not expect it to.To make money the show needs only to average 3 million viewers and Jay Hunt, Channel 4＊s outgoing creative boss, said she would be ※absolutely delighted§ if it hit the 5-6 million expected to tune in to the first episode.Bake Off is set to easily be the channel＊s biggest show of the year, and probably its biggest since the 8.3 million who tuned in to the Paralympics opening ceremony in 2012. And Channel 4 needs a hit.The broadcaster has struggled in recent years to find shows that can bring in big returning audiences. Only two programmes this year 每 the documentary Diana: In Her Own Words and an episode of Gogglebox 每 attracted more than 3 million viewers on the night they aired.As a result,  4% this year, with advertiser favourites, the 16- to 34-year-old crowd, down 7%, and the broadcaster＊s ad revenue is forecast to be down more than the predicted 4% to 5% fall for the total TV ad market. ※Bake Off is the crown jewels and they are pinning their hopes to it,§ said a second top executive at a media agency. ※They are never going to get back the ?75m in straight ad revenue, but they know that. It is about what it can do as an overall franchise to stop the decline at Channel 4.§With up to 40 hours of Bake Off programming a year to cash in on, including the Jo Brand-fronted main spin-off Extra Slice and Paul Hollywood＊s A Baker＊s Life, Channel 4 is setting the foundation for it to be the most lucrativefranchise since it axed Big Brother in 2009.The launch comes as the channel＊s chief executive, David Abraham, is set to follow Hunt out of the door, , who could do with inheriting a well-oiled hit so she can .※I don＊t think Bake Off will turn around Channel 4＊s year but they are not going to get egg on their face either,§ said the first senior media agency executive. ※The industry wants Bake Off and Channel 4 to do well, to give ITV a run for its money, and advertisers are genuinely interested and want it to do well. It all depends on the ratings now.§ 																																											"
"n 1999, Alec Soth set out on the first of a series of road trips along the Mississippi, travelling from his hometown of Minneapolis, which lies close to its headwaters, to Louisiana in the deep south. Eschewing the detached approach favoured by many of his contemporaries, Soth made evocative portraits of the often isolated individuals he encountered along the way, from loners to convicts, from sex workers to self-styled preachers. He saw the river as both metaphor and dreamscape, describing it as ※a worn and faded place§ that he photographed ※optimistically, even with love§.From a distance beneath a glowering sky, he shot the shack in Dyess, Arkansas, where country star  was raised; and in Little Falls, Minnesota, he captured the boyhood bed of the aviator . Both homes are now sites of pilgrimage, arbiters of the still resonant mythology of the American dream of self-willed success. A quotation from Lindbergh 每 about how he slept and dreamed with his eyes open while making his epic crossing of the Atlantic 每 provides the epigraph to , the acclaimed book of photographs Soth＊s wanderlust gave rise to. A selection of the work will be shown in London, to coincide with a reissue of Soth＊s classic book, first published in 2004.The photographer＊s quiet charm gained him access to Louisiana State Penitentiary, where he made an arresting portrait of a youthful prisoner with the words ※Preacher Man§ etched on his white T-shirt, and to a brothel on Elvis Presley Boulevard in Memphis, where he photographed a young sex worker called Sunshine, ※the saddest person I met in my travels§. Religion, too, is a constant presence in the book, from the image of a convict work group standing by a huge memorial cross in Kentucky to the portrait of Bonnie, a woman holding a photograph of a cloud that resembles an angel. Soth photographed people and places along the river with a patient attentiveness, using an unwieldy plate camera on a tripod, the slowness of his approach echoing the pace of life he encountered. was Soth＊s first book, but its maturity is breathtaking. It is haunted by the ghosts of an older, stranger America, one that was brought most vividly to life by Mark Twain in . More palpable for Soth, though, was the looming presence of his photographic predecessors 每 such as Walker Evans, Robert Frank, ,  and , who was his teacher at the University of Minnesota. Did he feel the weight of that great documentary tradition on his shoulders as he set out along the river? ※Not as much as you might think,§ he says. ※You have to understand that, back then, I didn＊t have a career as a photographer. And, what＊s more, I had determined it wasn＊t possible to have one. So I decided, ＆Let＊s just do what I want to do without too much thinking about influences and tradition.＊ It is only over time that I have come to recognise the nuances that make me different.§Some of those nuances, most notably his way of evoking broken lives in a quietly powerful way without resorting to either romanticism or studied detachment, are undoubtedly rooted in his midwestern sensibility, which he once described as ※dark and lonely§. Nevertheless, he possesses a seemingly instinctive ability to gain the trust of his subjects, several of whom recounted their dreams for him as he set up his camera. Peter, who lived on the river in a houseboat, dreamed of having running water. Lenny, a construction worker who moonlighted as an erotic masseur, dreamed of living to 100 and still looking youthful. A young Mexican immigrant named Ismael said his dream was ※to be valued in America the way I would be in Mexico§.The discontent that underpins much of the American way of life courses through the book like a dark undercurrent. ※I did have the sense early on that I wasn＊t a big social statement photographer,§ says Soth, ※and I certainly didn＊t want to make the authoritative statement on the river. It was more a case of wanting to wander and have an experience. Given that the Mississippi has been burned into the American imagination since Twain, I did think that as a subject it was almost embarrassingly obvious, but weirdly it had not been done that much.§The republication of the photo book alongside the exhibition marks Soth＊s reemergence after a period of self-reflection. Last year, he decided to ※withdraw slightly from all my other activities to reconnect with the very basics of why I fell in love with the process of photography in the first place 每 the play of light on an object§. It is not hard to see why he needed a break. Now 47, the Minneapolis-based photographer has published 25 books and had over 50 solo exhibitions worldwide since the success of , while also establishing a reputation as a contemporary image-maker. He runs an independent publishing company  and, for a while, was an inveterate blogger and teacher. He describes his travelling Winnebago Workshop as an ※art school on wheels§, a place where people who did not study photography can learn the craft free of charge.Soth＊s working practice, like his photographs, blends the traditional with the new: several of his publications 每 including 2008＊s , comprising photographs he took during George W Bush＊s presidency, and his Lonely Boy Mag series, which pastiches men＊s vintage magazines 每 were published in small runs and disseminated online or through specialist bookshops. Others, such as his LBM Dispatch series, take the form of printed newspapers filled with images from his travels in Ohio, Michigan, Colorado, Texas and Georgia.What precipitated his sabbatical from all this feverish production? ※I think that with the success of my first book, it felt suddenly that my ticket had been called and I was off to the races 每 and there was this feeling for a long time that I couldn＊t stop or it would all come crashing down. I just felt I needed to be out there all the time on this ego treadmill. I＊ve finally seen though all that garbage and become much more relaxed about myself and my place. Plus, I recently read a quote by Donald Trump about never stopping. He equated stopping with failure rather than, say, self-reflection, which kind of says it all really.§Soth＊s best work has always had a melancholy undertow. In 2006＊s , he cast his gaze on the Falls, portraying a site of ※spectacular suicides and affordable honeymoons§ where the dream of romance is offset by a soul-sapping drabness and vulgarity. Darker still is , from 2010, in which he sought out recluses and latter-day hermits, the loners who live off-grid in America＊s backwoods and wildernesses. His most recent series, (2015), looked at the disappearance of small-town community, its narrative punctuated by lyrics from songwriters of the old school 每 Jerome Kern, Lorenz Hart, Johnny Mercer.His America is both recognisably real and oddly dreamlike, a place that seems to be fast fading from view even as he chronicles it. ※For me, it＊s still about going out into the world with a camera.

"hough English was the language of my parents, the language in which I was raised and schooled, I have never felt I belonged to it. I learned my mother tongue self-consciously, quite often confusedly, as if my mother were a foreigner to me, and her sole language my second. Always, in some corner of my child mind, a running translation was struggling to keep up. To say this word or that word in other words. To recompose the words of a sentence like so many pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Years before doctors informed me of my high-functioning autism and the disconnect it causes between person and language, I had to figure out the world as best I could. I was a misfit. The world was made up of words. But I thought and felt and sometimes dreamed in a private language of numbers.In my mind each number had a shape 每 complete with colour and texture and occasionally motion (a neurological phenomenon scientists call synesthesia) 每 and each shape a meaning. The meaning could be pictographic: 89, for instance, was dark blue, the colour of a sky threatening storm; a beaded texture; and a fluttering, whirling, downward motion I understood as ※snow§ or, more broadly, ※winter§. I remember, one winter, seeing snow fall outside my bedroom window for the first time. I was seven. The snow, pure white and thick-flaked, piled many inches high on the ground, transforming the grey concrete of the neighbourhood into a virgin, opalescent tundra. ※Snow,§ I gasped to my parents. ※Eighty-nine,§ I thought. The thought had hardly crossed my mind when I had another: ※979§. The view from my window resembled 979 每 the shimmer and beauty of 11 expanding, literally multiplying 89＊s wintry swirl. I felt moved. My parents＊ firstborn, I had been delivered at the end of a particularly cold and snowy January in 1979. The coincidence did not escape me. Everywhere I looked, it seemed, there were private meanings writ large.Was it from that moment 每 the sudden sense that my meanings corresponded to the wider world 每 that I first had the urge to communicate? Until that moment, I had never felt the need to open up to another person: not to my parents or siblings, let alone to any of the other children at my school. Now, suddenly, a feeling lived in me, for which I had neither name nor number (it was a little like the sadness of six, but different). I eventually learned the feeling was what we call loneliness. I had no friends. But how could I make myself understood to children from whom I felt so estranged? We spoke differently, thought differently. The other children hadn＊t the faintest idea (how could they?) that the relationship between 89 and 979 was like the relationship between, say, diamond and adamant. And with what words might I have explained that 11 and 49, my mental logograms, rhymed? The children at school intimidated me. In the playground every mouth was a shout, a snort, an insult. And the more the children roared, the more they laughed and joked in my direction, the less I dared approach them and attempt to strike up a conversation. Besides, I did not know what a conversation sounded like.I renounced the idea of making friends. I had to admit that I wasn＊t ready. I retreated into myself, into the certainties of my numerical language. The same understanding, the same excitement, also helped me learn to read. This was my luck, since reading had not initially come easily to me. My parents never read me bedtime stories, and because the anti-epileptic medicine I was prescribed at a young age made me drowsy in class, I was never precocious. I have memories of constantly falling pages behind the other children, of intense bouts of concentration in order to catch up.Back in those days, the mid-80s, it was possible for a teacher to give her young charge a repurposed tobacco tin (mine was dark green and gold) in which new words, written in clear letters on small rectangular cards, were to be brought home for learning. From that time on I kept a list of words according to their shape and texture: words round as a three (gobble, cupboard, cabbage); pointy as a four (jacket, wife, quick); shimmering as a five (kingdom, shoemaker, surrounded). One day, intent on my reading, I happened on lollipop and a shock of joy coursed through me. I read it as 1011ipop. One thousand and eleven, divisible by three, was a fittingly round number shape, and I thought it the most beautiful thing I had yet read: half number and half word.In writing the story of my formative years in the words I had back in 2005 (I was 26), with feeling but without confidence or high finish, I found my voice. The international success of  began a conversation with readers from around the world. Where some British and US critics saw only a one-off ※disability genre§ memoir, the account of a ※numbers wiz§, German and Spanish and Brazilian and Japanese readers saw something else, and sent letters urging me to continue writing.The numbers spoke through the printed page to my far-flung readers, came alive in their minds, regardless of the translation that conveyed them. My lifelong struggle to find my voice, my obsession with language, appeared to them, as it did to me, like a vocation.I＊d written a book and had it published. But it remained unclear whether a young man on the autistic spectrum could have other books in him. No tradition of autistic writing existed (indeed, some thought autistic author a contradiction in terms). I had no models (though, later, I made the discovery that  每 possibly 每 and , the Australian poet and Nobel prize candidate, to name only two, shared my condition), no material. I was on my own.But then another reader＊s letter arrived. It was in French, a language I had studied in high school, from a young Frenchman named J谷r?me, who would, in time, become my husband. Through months of thoughtful and playful correspondence, J谷r?me and I fell in love. For him, for his country and language, I chose willingly to leave the country and the language I had never felt were mine. We moved to Avignon, then north to Paris, settling among the bistros and bouquinistes of Saint-Germain-des-Pr谷s.Before J谷r?me, I had largely given up on literature. Novels and I had long since parted company. Now, though, in our apartment, surrounded by our books (J谷r?me owned many books), we sat together at a brown teak table and, taking turns, read aloud from the French translation of Dostoevsky＊s . Reading a Russian work in French, I was not invaded by the feeling of foreignness that the pages of English novels had roused in me. On the contrary, I felt at home. I could, at last, read unencumbered by my self-consciousness, solely for the pleasure of learning new words and discovering new worlds. I could read for the sake of reading.Something had worked itself out in my head. All literature, I finally realised with a jolt, amounted to an act of translation: a condensing, a sifting, a realignment of the author＊s thought world into words. The reassuring corollary 每 reassuring to a novice writer like myself, just starting out: the translatorese of bad prose could be avoided, provided the words were faithful to the mental pictures the author saw. I had more than one book in me. And each of my subsequent books 每 a survey of popular neuroscience, a collection of essays inspired by mathematical ideas, a translation/adaptation into French of Murray＊s poetry 每 was different. Each taught me what my limits weren＊t. I could do this. And this. And this as well. All the time that I was writing, I was also studying in my after hours with theUK＊s distance learning higher education institution, the . In 2016, at the age of 37, I graduated with a first-class degree in the humanities. I published my first novel that same spring in France.																																											"

Now he turns his attention to the increasing divide between rich and poor and wonders whether it＊s time for the return of Robin Hood. It＊s a thoughtful piece of low key but consummate storytelling that scratches at all sort of dilemmas, from whether giving to charity is merely a sticking plaster to asking whether giving away all our stuff would really change anything., Sergio Blanco＊s slippery play makes a welcome return in an impressive production by Daniel Goldman, a great champion of South American theatre. He＊s got a little cracker here: a two-hander that asks why a son might kill his father and then offers many different answers. It could have been as dry as tinder but is as playful as a puzzle. Terrific stuff.With Stephen Hawking and others warning that , 1927＊s witty parable has never seemed so pertinent. Melding live action with live music and animation, it has a wonderfully retro feel as it tells the story of the golem.

"he television shows of  teem with fascinating, complex characters, but at their essence they＊re all about social ecosystems. He＊s adroit when it comes to encompassing the full scope of a place and time, tracing the invisible connections between seemingly disparate parts of a population to show how they＊re all subject to the same institutional forces. ※It＊s all in the game,§ went the constant refrain on Simon＊s masterpiece The Wire. At the time, it referred to the intricate culture of drug commerce in Baltimore; he＊s now trained his circumspect sights on the neon-lit cesspool of 70s New York, and unearthed an economy just as knotty (while twice as naughty) in the era＊s flourishing business of flesh.Most TV pilots get saddled with the unenviable legwork of introducing and providing a small taste of depth for a full ensemble of characters that an audience could conceivably see themselves spending a season with. And in its 87 unhurried minutes, the premiere of Simon＊s latest series The Deuce, in collaboration with co-creator George Pelecanos, sets up a sprawling network of colorful figures linked by the sale, display and distribution of sex. Individually engrossing, the characters join together to form a frank portrait of American striving.We meet the flamboyantly attired pimps and their stables of girls, struggling hustlers and ambivalent cops, each one more than meets the eye. An ingenue fresh off the bus (Emily Meade) has more guile to her than she lets on, and yet less than she thinks. The pimp (Gary Carr) who lures her into his crew before she can even make it out of the station plays the role of the magnanimous provider, but turns violent and brutish without cause or warning. A curly-haired tough cookie of a prostitute (Maggie Gyllenhaal) represents herself without male assistance, firmly businesslike when explaining to a teen John why he can＊t get two handjobs for the price of one, and then tender and maternal when making the occasional visit to her daughter. Simon shows us what appears to be a vicious sexual assault, just so that he can expose it as a committed role-play a moment later. Nothing is as it seems at first brush. Look closer.Times Square is the scuzzy nucleus around which this collection of unstable atoms furiously revolve, getting ready to combust with the advent of mass-produced porno. The pilot doesn＊t quite reckon with the upcoming sea change in smut as much as it throws out the occasional omen, and yet change is palpable in the air. The gradual realization that there was far more money to be made in the studio than on the sidewalk revolutionized the city＊s sex trade by shifting authority to the women, though as with all things in Simon＊s grey-shaded world, it＊s not that simple. The pilot doesn＊t shy away from the uglier realities that women in the oldest profession faced at the time, and while X-rated film helped get these women out from under their abusive handlers＊ thumbs, it created troubling new forms of objectification as well.There＊s one more piece to this puzzle that the pilot deliberately refrains from pressing into place.  headlines the series as a pair of mustachioed twin brothers, contrasting portraits of battered moralism and oily self-interest. As the proprietor of a 42nd Street watering hole, Vincent Martino strives to conduct himself ethically, but can＊t resist the lures of drugs and infidelity. (Though, to be fair, his perfidious wife, played by Zoe Kazan, screwed around first.) Meanwhile, his good-for-nothing brother Frankie has been racking up debts all over town, imperiling his brother＊s business by association. Simon＊s clearly got big plans for the two of them, but in these early stages they＊re more adjacent to ※the game§ than in it. Vincent＊s bar gives the dramatic personae a convenient place to converge, and yet he doesn＊t emerge with a scot-free conscience. The episode＊s final shot confronts him with his own complicity in the wrongdoing all around him, and marks him as a man determined to do something about it. Even viewers unaware of the show＊s pornographic future can feel the fate of hangdog Vincent beginning to dovetail with it.One of the key factors that hobbled The Wire＊s popularity during its early seasons was the difficulty of keeping its massive cast straight; The Deuce has the benefit of boasting a few name-brand actors impossible to forget, but even so, it does not demand such a high price of admission to its absorptive world. Writing unencumbered by the jargon of police work or Show Me A Hero＊s bureaucratic government lingo, Simon has created his most accessible work of humanism to date, and he＊s done so without sacrificing his loftier ambitions of societal critique. (An instant-favorite monologue exposes Nixon＊s Vietnam doctrine as pimping under the guise of policy.) ※All the pieces matter§ is another one of Simon＊s classic axioms, and even before his new creations have fully come into focus, he＊s re-convinced us of the statement＊s truth.

It is expected to surpass its ?7,000 estimate. Leigh＊s presentation copy of the script for Gone With the Wind, given to her by the film＊s producer David O Selznick for Christmas 1939 has faired less well 每 the personal inscription from Selznick has been cut out. Despite the vandalism, the leather-bound screenplay is expected to fetch up to ?15,000.An estimate of ?7,000 has been placed on ＊s working copy of Hamlet, on which he scribbled notes for his acclaimed 1948 film adaptation. As well as his extensive edits to reduce the play to two hours, it contains his suggestions for casting. Though Leigh had campaigned hard for the role of Ophelia, reprising a part she had played a decade before, her initials do not appear beside the character＊s name. Instead her husband wrote ※Swedish§ and later cast 17-year-old 每 a decision that is believed to have had a detrimental effect on their tempestuous marriage.The library, on the market 50 years after Leigh＊s death from tuberculosis, reveals her to have been a bibliophile of wide taste that ranged from Truman Capote＊s In Cold Blood and ＊s James Bond series, to Evelyn Waugh, who inscribed her copy of The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold: ※For Vivien, this sad little chapter of my life. With love from Evelyn.§The collection also reveals Leigh to have been at the centre of intellectual and literary circles in mid-20th-century London and not just as one half of the most glamorous couple in theatre. ,  and , who decorated a gift of Barbara Jones＊s The Unsophisticated Arts with a drawing of a face and a pierced heart, are among those who wrote personal messages in her books.※There are very significant people in this collection,§ said Gabriel Heaton, director of books and manuscripts at Sotheby＊s. ※These are intellectual heavyweights who were writing to her and giving her books.§Announcing the sale, Heaton added: ※The collection reveals so many facets of her personality.

It will take place alongside a collection of artefacts from Leigh＊s homes in London and Sussex.As well as special and rare editions of books by luminaries of stage, screen and page, the collection contains more personal items, including notebooks in which a young Leigh had copied out poems and diaries covering two of the most significant periods of her life: 1937 to 1939, and 1953.The earlier diary recounts the period when she met Olivier and they began a relationship. In an entry detailing her confession of the affair to her then-husband, barrister Herbert Leigh Holman, she wrote: ※Told Leigh.§ Six days later, she wrote: ※Left with Larry.§The 1953 notebook was written as Leigh＊s mental health deteriorated. Earlier that year she was dropped from the film Elephant Walk, in which she was to star opposite her lover Peter Finch. It precipitated a breakdown that lasted for several months, and her eventual diagnosis of bipolar disorder.※[The diary] certainly gives hints of her struggle with mental illness during that time and of her hurt, trouble and sadness,§ said Heaton. ※There＊s nothing diagnostic, but you certainly get a sense of her struggling.§One mystery remains unanswered in the collection. ※Finding the document signed by Elizabeth was quite a surprise, but I would love to know more of the story behind it,§ Heaton said. The document appeared in an inventory of Leigh＊s library in 1948, but there is no record of how it was acquired. ※It could be acknowledgement of her role in Fire Over England,§ the auctioneer said.A clue could lay in the contents: the document commands Sir Thomas Heneage to pay ?133 Maundy money [specially minted coins distributed by British royals the Thursday before Easter] to Richard Fletcher, the Bishop of Worcester. Fletcher was the father of the Jacobean dramatist John Fletcher, who collaborated with Shakespeare and was his successor as playwright to the King＊s Men.※It is a mystery,§ Heaton added. ※As often is the case in these things, there is scope for further research.§																																											"
"here was a time, way back in the simpler, more innocent mists of the early 2000s, when Tulip Fever was a very hot Hollywood property. Deborah Moggach＊s bestselling novel, a historical romance set in 17th-century Amsterdam, put dollar signs and golden statuettes in the eyes of producers seeking a period hit in the vein of Shakespeare in Love. Tom Stoppard, that film＊s Oscar-winning screenwriter, did the adaptation; Jude Law and Keira Knightley were cast, only for the UK government to seal off the tax loophole enabling its funding.Nearly a decade later, with the mighty  on board, Tulip Fever bloomed again, albeit with slightly diminished prestige: the director Justin Chadwick (The Other Boleyn Girl) and stars Dane DeHaan and Alicia Vikander weren＊t quite on the A-list in 2013, though Weinstein juiced up the ensemble＊s awards cred with the likes of Judi Dench and Christoph Waltz. (Three years before Dunkirk, he also tried for Harry Styles, but no dice.) One way or another, by the end of 2014, the film was shot and cut and ready to go.Jump to late summer 2017, and Alicia Vikander is an Oscar-winning industry princess, Dane DeHaan is headlining pricey blockbusters and Cara Delevingne, then cast in a minor role, is a wall-to-wall mega-celeb. And they have all achieved this upgrade in status without a lick of help from Tulip Fever, which is only this week limping its way into US cinemas. The box office prognosis is not good, and it＊s already an industry punchline, following a farcical few years of repeated rescheduling and abruptly pulled release dates on the part of The Weinstein Company. (Even an industry screening for Writers Guild members was , once befuddled attendees had already turned up.) For its risen stars, the film is now the largely estranged, embarrassing ex-schoolmate who turns up awkwardly at the wedding.The embargo for reviews lifts, ominously, on the day of release 每 though advance word from colleagues who have seen it suggest it＊s an attractive mediocrity rather than an outright catastrophe. The Weinsteins evidently realised long ago that the once gilded project was no longer a prize pony, so why has it taken them nearly three years to send it to the (probable) knacker＊s yard?The words ※Tulip Fever§ are likely to become industry shorthand for the once-promising, high profile project that somehow hits a wall between completion and release, though it＊s far from the first example. Remember Serena? You＊re forgiven if you don＊t. The misbegotten Depression-era melodrama starred Bradley Cooper and , and was shot by the Oscar-winning Danish film-maker Susanne Bier months before Silver Linings Playbook made a mint from that particular star combo in 2012, winning Lawrence an Oscar in the process.Coming on the heels of that glory,  had it made, right? Wrong. For the better part of two years, the film floated waftily across the release calendar, skipping major festival dates before quietly premiering (in a non-gala slot, to boot) at the London film festival in October 2014. A well-acted but tonally mangled curio, the film delivered on its sunken expectations; it bowed in 30th place at the US box office the next spring, an object lesson in the fact that even at the zenith of their careers, white-hot stars can＊t sell absolutely anything.Tulip Fever and Serena are practically success stories, however, relative to the ignominious fate of Accidental Love 每 a title even industry insiders might fail to recognise, given that the film was known for nearly seven years as Nailed. Small wonder its cagey distributors practically put it in witness protection. The loopy political satire, starring Jessica Biel and  and directed by David O Russell, began shooting in 2008, only to run into repeated financial roadblocks; Russell finally abandoned the project, unfinished, in 2010, shortly before The Fighter kicked off his Oscar-approved career revival. Attempts to get Russell back on board for reshoots failed, though the new filming went ahead anyway, just before the production company went bankrupt; finally, in 2015, a haphazardly assembled, retitled final cut debuted on VOD, with Russell now credited as ※Stephen Greene§. It＊s every bit as good as you think it is.The cautionary tales continue, from the mishandled horror All the Boys Love Mandy Lane 每 another Weinstein problem child that only saw the light of day in the US seven years after its festival premiere, and five years after its UK release 每 to a notoriously bungled, still unreleased 2015 adaptation of Martin Amis＊s London Fields, plagued by legal battles between the director, producers and star.Don＊t let these disasters sully the name of all films that get a little lost on the way to the cinema, however. The poster child for delayed cinematic gratification is Kenneth Lonergan＊s sprawling, glorious New York morality meditation Margaret, starring Anna Paquin and Matt Damon. Shot in 2005, scheduled for 2007, it got tangled in litigation for years after, with the perfectionist Lonergan agonising over an elusive final cut while an exasperated Fox Searchlight snapped at his heels. Finally, in 2011, the impasse broke, with a finished cut (not Lonergan＊s preferred one, though that would come to DVD) doing the arthouse rounds: what was expected to be a curate＊s egg instead became a passionately advocated critics＊ cause, now routinely listed among the new century＊s greatest films. It＊s the happiest rescue of a film from pre-release purgatory since John McNaughton＊s Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, an electric, upsetting character-study-as-horror that made its acclaimed festival debut in 1986 but scared off distributors until, with the hefty critical endorsement of Roger Ebert, it went on release in 1990. In the UK, the road was longer still: with the British Board of Film Classification insisting on cuts, the film hit screens in 1991, though an uncut version was only approved in 2003. At least it reached the UK at all: Bong Joon-ho＊s roaring dystopian adventure  has never received so much as British DVD exposure, adding insult to the injury of its year-late US release in 2014 每 the victim, once more, of opaque Weinstein Company strategizing. (At least it＊s in good company: another fine film given the runaround by the Weinsteins, and seemingly forever nixed in the UK, is James Gray＊s gorgeous, operatic Ellis Island tragedy The Immigrant.)Delays have become an essential part of the underdog narrative for films like Margaret and Henry, though in other cases, the stigma falls away: not everyone now remembers that Bennett Miller＊s Cannes-honoured, Oscar-nominated Foxcatcher was tardily whipped from the 2013 release slate and released a year later, or that Joss Whedon＊s self-reflexive horror ride The Cabin in the Woods was passed around and messed around by studios for two years between its planned 2010 release and its eventual, enthusiastically received 2012 arrival. The holy grail of all unfortunate, endlessly detained films, meanwhile, returned to the cultural conversation last week, with the passing of Jerry Lewis. The Day the Clown Cried, a 1972 Holocaust drama that marked the comedian＊s first, cursed attempt at serious film-making, remains unreleased to this day 每 dismissed by Lewis himself as ※poor work§ and described in terms of awestruck revulsion by the precious few who have seen it. Lewis donated the one existing print to the Library of Congress in 2015, stipulating that it not be exhibited before June 2024. Should the institution duly unveil it then, ending decades of feverish speculation as to just how bad it can possibly be, a Margaret-style redemption seems unlikely to ensue 每 though Tulip Fever＊s problems will at least be put in proportion.

"nticipating and securing the ※hot tickets§ is always the toughest task of the festival programmer, but it＊s particularly challenging for the , which opens just days after the agenda-setting Man Booker longlist is revealed. So there were smiley faces all round when the organisers discovered that they had?bagged six of the 13 writers who had made this year＊s ※Booker dozen§. Sebastian Barry, Zadie Smith, Paul Auster and Ali Smith duly entertained sellout?crowds in the festival＊s biggest arena, while Jon McGregor commanded the rather smaller Studio theatre. But?it?is a mark of the?trickiness of programming that Colson Whitehead 每 whose Pulitzer prize-winning  is tipped in?some quarters to be the?next Booker winner 每 had been scheduled for a double-header with his?fellow American Laird Hunt in the?※informal§ space of the Spiegeltent (though a brief reading was shoehorned into the early morning session in the same venue the next day?for those lucky enough to?spot it).The double-header is universal festival shorthand for almost-maybe-but-in-the-end-not-quite-box-office-enough-to-take-a-risk-on. And fair enough, festival economics are scary. So what of the triple-header? In Edinburgh, this is reserved for poets?and the more edgy selections of the guest?curators.Consider ※21st Century Women§, from the ※Intersections of Identity and Culture§ strand curated by the Scottish poet and Makar Jackie Kay and the American cultural activist Roxane Gay: an Argentinian story of?a transvestite who renounces prostitution after being ※visited§ by?the Virgin Mary; an Icelandic writer＊s dialogue with the man who?raped her 20 years earlier; and?a short story collection by an?unknown New Zealand writer?of?Samoan, Mangaian and?Irish descent.These spaces might apparently be?marginal but they have a beautiful potential. I first spotted the now celebrated Madeleine Thien in one. Watch out for New Zealander Courtney Sina Meredith and her compatriots, who were out in force at the festival. Who knows, they may one day return as part of the Booker Dozen.																																											"
"n September 1967, I was 28 years old and had just been given the best job in the world: DJ on the soon-to-be-launched . London was swinging, youth culture was buzzing, and I felt I＊d landed at the centre of the universe.Over the next couple of years, I＊d play new music to millions, meet everyone from  to , and become lifelong friends with colleagues such as  每 despite never getting his music taste.And then, at the age of 30, I was called into a meeting, told I was too old and offered a job reading the news on . Such is life. But what a time to have been young.This picture was taken outside  at Radio 1＊s launch. For the BBC, a pop station was a revolutionary idea, and I?felt honoured to be among the founding DJs. My smile says it all. Quite a few of that group became broadcasting legends 每 Tony Blackburn (back row, far left), Jimmy Young (next to him),  (in front of Young) 每 but at that point we were all in the same boat: young men setting out on an unknown adventure. I don＊t know if anyone stood out especially 每 maybe Wogan: he was always pretty peerless.Before this, I＊d spent three years on pirate stations. They were as fun as you＊d imagine. It was astonishing to think you were in a rust bucket in the middle of the North Sea, talking to yourself, yet millions of people were listening. I was on one of the boats when I heard about . A BBC producer came out to ask a few of us to audition. I?jumped at the chance. It was the BBC 每 and on dry land.I was the second DJ on air. Tony Blackburn first, then me with Saturday Club.

The Beatles came in to record four songs, but we had a strict slot. They took a few takes getting the first two tracks right, so we had to hurry them. Imagine rushing the Beatles!As DJs, I suppose we were semi-famous ourselves, though I was never into celebrity stuff. I remember a girl outside Broadcasting House asking for my autograph. Then she looked at me and said, ※And who are you again?§ That keeps you grounded.Recent revelations that some DJs abused their positions have saddened me. It shouldn＊t have happened. The other incongruous thing is the lack of women in that picture. I?had no control over that, but when I was a director at Sheffield＊s , we stipulated that a proportion of our broadcasters had to be women. That＊s how it should be.These days, I＊m back doing .

"I＊ve been going to carnival for about 30 years. My dad used to take me down, since before I was five. August bank holiday 每 you go to carnival. My family is from Antigua so carnival is such an important part of Caribbean expression and cultural heritage, a celebration of emancipation across the islands. For my dad, it was really important that I connected with that culture 每 the food, colours, the smell. In the 80s there was loads of tension, there were serious riots, but for carnival people would come together. But it has got an edge, it＊s not fluffy, there＊s a strong community message that comes out of it. You almost like you feel like it＊s your duty to go. When I got into my teens and started going on my own around ＊98, that＊s when garage was popping. I definitely wasn＊t into dancehall, bashment or soca, that was dad and uncle music. So I＊d go to  and all the drum＊n＊bass sound systems, huge speakers blaring out. I＊ve put on parties in warehouses, beaches, amazing locations, but there＊s a realness about a massive stack on Westbourne Park.I wasn＊t allowed to go to carnival as a child, and I always seemed to miss it during my teens and mid-20s. But for the past five years, I＊ve made up for lost time. Growing up in a Caribbean culture (with a Jamaican father and Guyanese mother), I＊m used to big cook-outs with reggae music blaring. My tip for carnival first-timers would be to get fully stuck in; try the jerk chicken (with ketchup) and the hard-dough bread; move to the beat of the drums on the floats; let loose 〞 smile! Don＊t let the negative headlines fool you: any pre-conceived notion about carnival gets shattered upon arrival. Rampage on Colville Square is probably the sound system you want to be at; the  goes off as well. And do what I do: walk up and down and take in the united vibes of London. I live in London now but I＊m from Birmingham originally and from the age of 14 I used to get the train down just to go to carnival. Since then I＊ve been every year except one, but do I handle myself there better now than when I was a teenager? No! It just gets messier and messier and I never learn. But it＊s carnival, everyone lets loose. When it comes to planning your day 每 try to travel light, with a bum bag for your valuables, as pickpocketing is a problem. I like to go with just one or two people 每 you don＊t want to be losing people/waiting around and you＊ll bump into your mates anyway. If it＊s gonna rain, bring a rain coat! That said, I think my favourite carnival memory is of 2015 when it absolutely tipped it down. I don＊t think I＊ve ever been so wet in my life 每 but I stayed out and everyone was having an amazing time. Well I was... Carnival used to be something I looked down on, literally, while sitting on my dad＊s shoulders as a kid. We＊d go on Sunday, the ＆family day＊, but this year I＊m taking advantage of the whole bank holiday weekend. On Friday night,  is back for a carnival special with a line up of women DJs of colour. Then Saturday is for prep: buy water, buy wet wipes, find shoes you can walk and dance in, and plan your outfit. This year, I＊m wearing  in solidarity with the residents of Grenfell Tower. My Sunday night motive is , with DJs from across Europe and  Sade and Neela. And remember: carnival is not a group activity. Avoid disappointment by going with a friend whose vibe matches your own. I have been going to carnival for almost five years 每 it＊s a chance for me to go out with all my friends locally and party, like an annual celebration. One of my best moments has to be when I hosted the RinseFM stage a couple of years ago. I was literally a garage MC shouting over the crowd. Last year we arrived early for the parade, while the paraders were still painting each other ＃ and I was wearing all white. I love all the carnival costumes, but also the dancing. Rampage is one of my favourite systems, but KCC and the Rocking Crew on Wornington Road are amazing 每 they play US House old and newAs for preparing: I always bring a rucksack, bottle of water, face wipes ＃ and a whistle. And never wear uncomfortable shoes or high heels - you might look amazing but you＊ll be struggling by the end of it. As a born and bred south Londoner who hates crossing the river, I only go to Notting Hill once a year 每 for carnival. . This year, the plan is to go on an early morning walk to the Grenfell site to pay my respects on Sunday, and then head to the Red Bull Music Academy sound system to see rapper Stefflon Don and dancehall queen Spice. Grenfell will (rightly) loom over carnival this year, especially as the survivors and victims＊ families are nowhere near getting any closure, and I＊m hopeful they＊ll be in everyone＊s thoughts all weekend. I think it＊ll feel celebratory 每 carnival has always been a symbol of working-class and black communities refusing to back down, and surviving against the odds. London＊s been through a lot this year, and a celebration of the city＊s diversity is exactly what we need. I＊ve never had a plan for carnival, really. I like to weave between the festivities on the lesser known stages and side streets. You come across some real gems at the smaller sound systems. The best thing about carnival is how eclectic it is musically. I hang around the more dancehall-oriented sound systems, the rap ones and everything in between. Family day on Sunday is always really special because of the number of processions that go by 每 boys and girls, men and women all bejewelled and dancing in sequences. I somehow managed to get on the Toddla T stage in 2014. Ms Dynamite was performing and, through some act of God, I was dancing next to her. That was probably the best minute and a half of my life up to that point. It was raining but the energy was electric 每 and when she started her UK garage classic Boo!, I nearly fell off the stage I was so excited. Older and younger people were moving and shaking like their lives depended on it, and you really got the true essence of carnival. I didn＊t get to say hi to Ms Dynamite unfortunately 每 security did away with me before I could muster up the courage. For me carnival is always on the Monday. It clashes with my favourite festival in the world 每 Shambala 每 so usually I go on Monday afternoon post-festival. Minimal clothing is never a bad idea either 每 it＊s carnival after all! I＊m a huge fan of a colourful two-piece. My favourite spot last year was Different Strokes sound system on St Luke＊s Road, playing hip hop, jungle and drum＊n＊bass. I like to pick a base and stay there. Gone are the days of walking around all day...I think I＊m getting old!																																											"

"dentity politics has gone too far. PC has gone mad. These aren＊t unfashionable opinions: they＊re practically mainstream. What＊s new in fringe comedy is that we＊re now hearing it from leftwing comics. That＊s both a fascinating phenomenon, and a troublesome one. Fascinating because there may be some truth in these propositions, and the left needs to interrogate them. Troublesome because standup doesn＊t always favour nuance and fine margins, and one or two of these leftwing comedians 每 whether they＊re mocking champagne socialists, rehabilitating slavery or defending the Iraq war 每 can start to sound (accidentally or on purpose) pretty rightwing. Fin Taylor is pre-eminent among them 每 a rising star whose  made hay with white identity and privilege. It was an excellent show, as is its follow-up , with which he again lays siege to the complacency of his (presumed to be) white, leftwing audience. It begins with Taylor recalling his resolution to give up being leftwing for January; to stop, in other words, ※being a whiney little bitch§. Leftwing people, he goes on, are dismissive, pedantic and smug. Labour has been captured by the middle classes, who can afford to be blase about actually winning. Virtue signalling is their (our?) obsession, alongside political correctness, which ※is about demonising and shaming people§. You＊ve probably already identified the problem with all this 每 as an argument, if not as comedy. In short, Taylor＊s screed is a carnival of generalisations and misrepresentations. Again and again, he alights on legitimate arguments, then comes at them from the most extreme or crude available position. It＊s fair enough to mock Stoke Newington＊s (hipster, ※ethical living§) local economy, but to argue that those communities ※don＊t know what reality is§, or that their lifestyles ※aren＊t making the world better, just making it worse in a different way§? Not so much. Likewise, the left＊s lack of clarity on  每 that＊s fair game, but Taylor＊s assertion that ※white liberals don＊t want to criticise Saudi Arabia§ is nonsense. So where＊s all this coming from? A provocateur＊s impulse to get a rise out of his audience, or genuine political concern? It＊s never clear how seriously Taylor wants us to take him, as the show flits from wild extrapolation from a kernel of truth to obvious shock-comedy 每 the routine about making abortion mandatory, say, or the one about white people (via slavery, which led to the blues) being responsible for all good music. And to an extent, it doesn＊t matter. Yes, he might find himself making some unsavoury friends with this material. But Taylor is so emphatic a comic 每 playful, domineering, high joke count 每 it＊s gripping to watch as he dances around his bonfire of proprieties. Among the other lefty apostates on this year＊s fringe, I haven＊t see ＊s show, which reportedly takes aim at PC and identity politics from a working-class perspective. I have seen  at the Stand, whose show describes 每 with as easy a recourse to generalisation as Taylor＊s 每 his post-Brexit falling out with all his liberal friends. Again, the bogeyman is the middle-class lefty, caricatured as ever as a privately educated, quinoa-guzzling exile from reality. Against them, Doyle claims 每 via a working-class grandad, seemingly 每 a hotline to the common man, whom the left now hates. Doyle takes more pains than Taylor to carve out a coherent position on the anti-EU Corbynite left. But he shares the conviction that identity politics is just bourgeois entitlement, and that ※we [ie the left] look stupid when we worry about this stuff§. Both acts seem to see class and identity politics as antipathetic, which needn＊t be 每 and often isn＊t 每 the case. Doyle does make good points here (if not always as good jokes) about name-calling in modern politics, and our inability to tolerate disagreement. But he needs to practise what he preaches. You can＊t blame people for branding all  as stupid and simultaneously brand all lefties as snobs. With that in mind, I do wonder how effective these shows are at starting the conversation they insist needs to happen. Elsewhere in town, ＊s show argues just as angrily in favour of liberal values, and all these shows beg the question of whether, in these antagonistic, divisive times, we really need this kind of divisive, antagonistic comedy. Does joke-telling militate against nuance and sensitivity? Or is there such a thing as consensual political comedy, one that sheds more light than heat on our rancorous moment? (Ingrid Oliver＊s show , which ends in a plea for a less binary world, offers a glimpse of it.) In its absence, it remains exciting to see the faultlines in contemporary leftism probed in comedy 每 even if the comics in question seem less likely to bridge those faultlines than widen them.

"his exquisite, exemplary science documentary, directed by Irish editor turned helmer Emer Reynolds, recounts the rich and fascinating story of the Voyager mission, arguably Nasa＊s finest, noblest contribution to scientific understanding. Launched in 1977,  were sent billions of miles to the outer limits of our solar system to gather information about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune and then into deep space. In 2012, Voyager I slipped through the heliopause and officially became the first human-made object to reach , and it＊s still going today, to infinity and beyond.Although the main purpose of the trip was data collection, the thing most people remember about the Voyagers is that each of them contain a golden LP encoded with images, aural greetings in many Earth languages and, on the B-side, a playlist of top tunes (Beethoven, Bach, Pygmy tribespeople, Chuck Berry) to tickle the eardrums of any alien life form they might meet. A wide assortment of those involved are interviewed in depth 每 not just scientists but also people whose voices are on the LP 每 and one of the deeply admirable things about this film, in addition to the beauty of its imagery, its sprightly rhythm and its witty soundtrack, is that the science isn＊t too dumbed down. It＊s like one of those great Horizon episodes from the 1980s or 90s, before all science docs started sounding as if they were written for overexcited seven-year-olds. Grab the chance to see this in a cinema while it lasts.																																											"
"If you came of age in the 1990s and 2000s, there are plenty of questionable tunes from the era to reminisce about, from the easy prey of Boyz II Men＊s smouldering soul to Hoobastank＊s whine anthems. Even if you don＊t fit into that age bracket, there＊s a whole lot of joy in  (iTunes), a podcast ※about the music you liked before you knew any better§. Each episode ribs one cringeing song and its video in witty detail, thanks to host Alexander Edward and guests. Although the songs are broken down (or in some cases left in pieces on the studio floor), it＊s done in a loving way so some episodes serve as a reminder of how surprisingly good they are.Irresistible teen pop nugget Backstreet Boys＊ Everybody (Backstreet＊s Back) sparks a debate about Emma Maatman＊s love of boybands in her formative years. She discusses the politics of staying loyal, and why it wasn＊t acceptable to admit to liking both Backstreet Boys and *N Sync 每 and that＊s before she even considered the tricky matter of picking her favourite band member. Etiquette decreed that no two girls could share, so it was a race to claim the best one.Of course, there are some anthems that are indefensible: cue Chumbawumba＊s Tubthumping. ※This is a song you＊d slowly jazzercise to at a Christian physical therapy programme,§ offers Edward. Toto＊s Africa comes out only slightly better, with a debate about whether it＊s ※just a lame song from the 80s§, ※emotional stepdad rock§ or both. That Awful Sound manages to stay on the right side of sneering, even when it unleashes hell on its musical victims. It＊s not about snobbery, so Metallica get the same treatment as the Spice Girls. Nearly two hours is devoted to Aqua＊s Barbie Girl, with a broad discussion about whether or not Ken has nipples, the phrase ※hanky panky§ and what was going on in the film Coyote Ugly. And the surprise bonus of listening to That Awful Sound? You may well rediscover a song you＊d forgotten about, but secretly still like.My new hero, 94-year-old , preaches nothing but humanity and common decency in his passionate podcast. Every episode, he invites you to ※have a conversation over a pint§ with him, passing on a lifetime of social awareness, as one of the last of a generation who lived through the very real effects of everything from fascism to austerity (the first time round) and the creation of the welfare state. It＊s told not with fist-banging rhetoric but through painfully real stories from his life, such as the death of his sister as a child from TB. As stark as some of the stories are (I sobbed on the Tube over episode three), there is hope and warmth in every word spoken. The longest episode clocks in at 15 minutes, so this is far from your grandad banging on about the old days. Harry has a burning desire to communicate, and that deserves a wee bit of your time and all of your respect. Cheers Harry. If you always wanted to hear an honest ※girl talk§, Michel, Sharonda and Danielle host the podcast for you. The trio talk about music, BDSM protocol, herpes and so much more, all with a glass of wine in hand. You will get hooked in equal parts by their intelligence, passion, irreverence, humour and emotion. Here＊s a toast to this real, raw, uncorked show that has become a highlight of my week. Meticulously-researched curiosities plucked from the world of literature and presented in bite-size episodes. Presenter Conor Reid curates an eclectic lineup of everything from ghost stories with a scientific twist to fake news during the first world war, all linked to but not shackled by the world of literature. Delightful stuff. Exactly a year ago, we published a wonderful triptych of audio documentaries on our strand The Story. Titled Camera Off, they are deeply personal works by the playwright and documentary film-maker Rebecca Lloyd-Evans. The first episode, , tells one of the most incredible love stories I＊ve ever heard 每 between Chris, a retired art gallerist and David, a young American. David has paranoid schizophrenia, and survived on the streets of New York for 10 years by believing he was part of a special intelligence force working to stop George Bush＊s evil plot to take over the world, until one day he heard the voice of the Queen. It is the Queen＊s voice that eventually brings Chris and David together in Westminster Abbey. The other stories document Rebecca＊s grandmother coming to terms with her German-Jewish identity, and how one bright and privileged young man lets his passion for music damage his life. Please do dive in to some of the best work we＊ve done on Guardian podcasts. 																																											"
"assie came home and Willy was freed but the omens aren＊t looking good for Lean on Pete, the imperilled racehorse at the centre of Andrew Haigh＊s heart-rending creature feature. Pete, we soon learn, is overworked and past his prime, destined to be sold south for slaughter as soon as he loses his next race. And while Disney might conspire a happy ending for this horse, it＊s likely that British-born Haigh has a different destination in mind.Flushed with the homegrown success of  and the brilliant , Haigh＊s first American-set picture fairly wallows in hardship and misery, almost to a fault. It proceeds to cut Pete loose, point him towards the desert and then drags its anxious audience along for the ride.Except that Haigh＊s film isn＊t just about Pete. It＊s also the tale of Charlie (Charlie Plummer), the teenaged boy who loves him. Charlie works as an assistant to Del, a grizzled old trainer who is played by  in the sort of role that would once have gone to Burgess Meredith or Ernest Borgnine. Rounding out the team is Bonnie (Chlo? Sevigny), a bruised, cynical jockey, periodically forced to supplement her winnings with waitress shifts at Red Lobster. One day, she says, she will have to give it up altogether. ※There are only so many times you can fall off a horse and get up.§Adapted from , Lean on Pete is at its potent, stirring best during the opening furlough, when it focuses on this makeshift hobo family as it criss-crosses the Pacific Northwest from one racetrack to the next. It＊s a passage that jogs memories of John Huston＊s , another elegiac account of three lost souls struggling to find their bearings in the swirling dust, their fate inextricably bound up with that of the horses they handle. But the tensions are mounting; this family unit cannot hold. Del has a reputation for riding his animals into the ground and then fast-tracking them to the knackers＊ yard when their legs start to buckle. Pete＊s time is up but Charlie can＊t let him go. So he absconds with the horse under cover of darkness, meaning to light out for Wyoming, where he thinks his long-lost aunt lives.It is at this point, I fear, that Haigh risks slightly losing purchase, allowing the reins to go slack in his hands. He＊s not the first British talent to find themselves dazzled by America＊s wide open spaces and seduced by the poetic possibilities of its impoverished interior. Andrea Arnold, for one, was happy to luxuriate at length amid the sun-baked squalor of last year＊s  每 and yet I always had the sense that there was a point to her wanderings and a fine grain to her detail. Haigh＊s handling is a shade less distinctive, even generic in its arrangements of truck stops and trailers and isolated desert homes. It adopts the easy swing of a country-music ballad, piling on the hard times and all but dissolving into tears during the maudlin final verse.But if the trip feels familiar, that＊s not necessarily a bad thing. One might even go so far as to claim that it＊s part of the appeal; a welcome insulation against all the hazards in our path. And Haigh＊s film is never less than heartfelt and affecting. It cares deeply for Charlie and hopes we do, too. So it insists we stick with him as the truck breaks down and he runs out of cash, trailing the badlands in search of a new home. In the end, perhaps, the kid is as much a symbol of soulful, martyred innocence as the racehorse at his side. But we cheer him on all the same; a stumbling rank outsider who might just stay the course.																																											"

"here＊s a part of me that wants to be cynical about the BBC＊s new series of . After all, the Beeb put on its flashing blue light to do all this last year with the first series, which dealt with the London ambulance service, and once you＊ve seen one cardiac arrest, you＊ve probably seen them all. More to the point, we have endless medical shows, both fictional and real life (Casualty, Doctors, , ), suggesting a  stretching all the way back to  and  in the 1950s and 60s. Yet this national obsession, alongside polls that show the NHS to be the UK＊s second?best-loved institution after The?Great British Bake Off, never seems to translate into policy.The , which next year celebrates its 70th anniversary, remains underfunded; primary care is a mess, and the UK continues to  comparable European countries in health provision. How many TV programmes about heroic paramedics do we need before we realise that heroism isn＊t always enough? What message are we being given here 每 that all is well because ambulance crews will deal with whatever is thrown at them (and, believe me, they will), or that the service itself is at breaking point and needs some urgent political CPR? Trauma as entertainment only gets you so far.The new series follows ambulance crews in the West Midlands, but the issues are similar to those in London: too many 999 calls; too few ambulances; overstretched call centres 每 these really are the staff at the sharp end, and their job is in many ways tougher than that of the teams on the road; paramedics who have to work overtime to bump their money up; the many calls relating to drink and drugs that are less medical emergencies than deep-seated societal problems 每 too often paramedics have to operate as social workers. Some of these issues come through in Ambulance, but inevitably they get submerged in the life-and-death dramas. Resource allocation and organisational planning are less compelling TV, but ultimately that＊s what makes the health service tick.But enough moans. In the end, you do have to put the cynicism aside and celebrate the work of?the paramedics and those hard-pressed back-up staff who have to deal with often incoherent callers and decide who is most at risk of dying. Last September, when the first series was broadcast, I spent . It was both exhausting and exhilarating: there were dull patches 每 all the form-filling the paramedics had to do after each incident 每 and yet it was impossible to be bored, because you just didn＊t know what would be coming next. A message would flash up on the ambulance console telling you how serious the problem was and where to go, and you＊d be off, siren screaming.What was amazing was how quickly the crews could go into operational mode. One minute a paramedic would be texting his girlfriend, or we＊d be talking about music; the next they＊d be completely focused on the crisis they had to deal with. The first incident we were called to was a student who had killed himself 每 a year later I still get the odd flashback to the horrible yet strangely peaceful scene we had to attend. For the crews, such traumatic incidents are daily occurrences, though a suicide was sufficiently rare for the ambulance service to send along a senior paramedic to make sure they were able to cope emotionally.The range of challenges the crew had to deal with in the course of just one day 每 the suicide, a cardiac arrest, a man with dementia whose family could no longer cope, a woman with no obvious symptoms of ill health who was convinced she was in need of urgent attention and insisted on being hospitalised 每 was remarkably varied. Don＊t think these fly-on-the-wall programmes give you only the highlights of the paramedic＊s life; from my brief experience they are?extremely accurate and representative of an average day. There is no shortage of material. in episode one of the new series dealing with a mother giving birth at home, with only paramedics in attendance, uncomfortable viewing. ※Paramedics deserve more recognition,§ tweeted one. ※Such inspiring people and working under extreme pressure. Makes me so proud of the NHS.§ Many others agreed. Job done, the West Midlands ambulance service will think: plenty of positive PR for their long-suffering staff. But the real payoff for all this television attention would be better pay, shorter hours and a more rational approach to healthcare provision in the UK. Fine words 每 and tweets 每 are not enough. We?should aim to build a health service that is so boringly efficient that producers will have to start looking elsewhere for drama.  airs on BBC1 on Thursday 31 August at 9pm Stephen Moss is a Guardian feature writer																																											"
"t seems that 2017 will have a unique place in this festival＊s history as the year the organisers banned the pineapple. The blameless fruit was added to the prohibited items list owing to fans of  tendency to bring them to shows to illustrate one of the band＊s lyrics. Guffaws soon mingle with cheers as the band unveil their stage set; a giant pineapple.The unusually tropical sunshine certainly brings out the fun side of a festival which 每 with a simultaneous leg in Reading 每 has become a pilgrimage for teenagers celebrating their  results.

Josh Homme is in impish form, claiming to be ※already fucked up§ at 1pm and walking to the front of the stage to grin weirdly at the crowd like a (more) deranged Donald Trump.At the other end of the day, there＊s a stampede to see Liam Gallagher, who kicks off with Rock ＆N＊ Roll Star and brings insouciant star quality, his latest cagoule and a classic songbook. Everyone knows the Oasis songs well enough to sing along. Everyone, that is, except Liam, who bizarrely needs a teleprompter 每 but his new solo songs hold their own. Bold and For What it＊s Worth are beautifully frank reflections of a maturing male, while Wonderwall 每 illuminated by banned red flares 每 provides one of the weekend＊s most magical moments.Muse＊s appearances here are traditionally marked by monsoons, as if frontman Matt Bellamy personally requests them from God to illustrate his apocalyptic lyrics. Spookily, the band＊s arrival does bring the weekend＊s only raindrops but the real storm is in the show. With harder rocking, proggier prog, higher falsettos and sillier outfits than anyone else on the bill, they reach peak preposterousness during an anthemic Knights of Cydonia, when each note of Chris Wolstenholme＊s bass triggers a shower of fireworks. Although there＊s certainly a glut of generic pop and indie 每 Bastille＊s magnolia anthems and Major Lazer＊s no-common-denominator-too-low sub bass barrage prove mystifyingly popular 每 more off-piste delights range from emerging Leeds prog-ish rockers  (Radiohead meets Hawkwind, with saxophones) to a storming secret  set within half an hour, before Sunday lunch. Terrific Mercury-nominated band  reinvent the Phil Spector 60s girl-group sound with grungey guitars, while Hannah Hooper＊s  euphoric, Abba-esque indie pop is met by swaying hands. Saturday headliners Kasabian are like their beloved Leicester City 每 unfancied, unfashionable underdogs who somehow conquered the big league. This gig is no different. Singer Tom Meighan clambered off his sick bed (in hospital, on a drip), to perform, but their clubby-rocky stompers generate a massive singsong and the band look so delighted with their rapturous reception it＊s a wonder that they ever leave the stage. After criticism and an identity crisis, the festival gets it right this year by offering something for everybody, and the whole place unites for the return of . The rap icon has struggled with addiction, but tonight he is back on his game. He rages at events in the US, gets 90,000 people to chant ※Fuck Trump!§, has a full live band and a 32-song setlist, packed with hits from Real Slim Shady to Lose Yourself, which go down a storm. He dedicates Love the Way You Lie (with Ebony taking the  role) to ※anyone who has ever been in a relationship like this§, and hearing lyrics that dissect domestic violence being sung by a female audience choir is unsettling but thrillingly empowering. ※We＊ll always remember this show§, he yells, and it＊s impossible to disagree.

"his year was always going to be a big one for Jack Kirby. Today would have been his 100th birthday, and the month of August has long been earmarked by the comics industry to celebrate one of its most influential creators. As the illustrator of some of the biggest characters in comic history, the tough, tireless and trailblazing visual storyteller laid the foundations for today＊s seemingly unquenchable obsession with superheroes. But despite being overshadowed these days by Marvel＊s grinning nonagenarian , the stogie-chomping artist known simply as ※the King§ has retained his status as a legend.Unexpectedly, Kirby cropped up in the news again this January, when  每 done with such style by his Captain America 每 became an international debate. The patriotic super-soldier, co-created by Kirby and writer Joe Simon in early 1941, was memorably introduced on his first cover bopping Hitler with a solid right hook, months before the US even joined the second world war. Kirby 每 born Jacob Kurtzberg to Austrian Jewish immigrant parents in New York 每 would go on to prove he had the courage of his convictions. Drafted in 1943, he almost lost his legs to frostbite serving as a scout in Europe, before being honourably discharged in 1945. Punching Nazis was A-OK with the King 每 and 70 years on, critics of the alt-right have .Kirby＊s own origin story was similarly two-fisted. The way he told it, growing up poor on New York＊s Lower East Side consisted largely of him and his brother Dave battling rival street gangs. But between turf wars, his imagination was sparked by pulp sci-fi magazines and Prince Valiant, and he began to draw. By his early teens, he was a working artist, sketching single panels and strips for a newspaper syndicate, in production-line conditions comparable to the garment factory where his father worked. After various gigs 每 including a stint at Max Fleischer＊s animation studio making Popeye 每 and various pen names, Kurtzberg finally settled on ※Jack Kirby§, and making comics.In the 1940s and 50s, the US comic industry had a frontier mentality, similar to the cowboy comics Kirby was drawing. Dozens of publishers were furiously chasing fads, creating sensational content that often raised the ire of morality campaigners. The boom-and-bust nature of the business could be exhausting 每 but Kirby＊s versatility and phenomenal work rate kept him going. He was also conscientious: when he and Simon were drafted, they prepared a year＊s worth of material for their then-employer National Comics to publish in their absence. But everything Kirby produced was essentially work-for-hire, giving him no control over his art or ideas 每 a precedent that would haunt him later.When he gravitated back to publisher Timely, by 1958 renamed Atlas, Kirby had been a working artist for almost three decades, creating romance comics, war comics and monster comics. Three years later, reunited with one Stanley Lieber 每 who had worked for Atlas as a teenager and was now going by the name Stan Lee 每 the pair revitalised the ailing publisher by creating a comic about a bickering extended family transformed into superheroes by cosmic rays.The Fantastic Four was an emphatic hit. Atlas became Marvel, and Kirby＊s comics became superhero showcases, introducing a veritable who＊s-who of characters on cinema screens today: Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Ant-Man, the collective Avengers, Silver Surfer and the X-Men, not to mention the hundreds of . Then 每 as now 每 Lee was the grinning ringmaster who sold the mighty Marvel manner, with bluster and a somewhat ingratiating patter. Meanwhile Kirby, who worked 14-hour days, seven days a week in his windowless basement at home in Long Island, cranking out entire issues from outlines or conversations with Lee, was paid a page-rate only.Despite Lee getting the writer credit, Kirby always insisted that he came up with the ideas and plots. ※Whatever it took to sell a book I came up with,§ . ※Stan Lee has never been editorial minded. It wasn＊t possible for a man like Stan Lee to come up with new things 〞 or old things for that matter. Stan Lee wasn＊t a guy that read or that told stories.§ In a 1968 interview, Lee himself said: ※Some artists, such as Jack Kirby, need no plot at all. I mean I＊ll just say to Jack, ＆Let＊s let the next villain be Dr. Doom＊＃ or I may not even say that. He may tell me. And then he goes home and does it. He＊s so good at plots, I＊m sure he＊s a thousand times better than I.§Even now, Kirby＊s unparalleled creativity powers half of the comic book industry. Vivid characters and dazzling concepts seemed to pour out of Kirby (his wife Roz forbade him from driving because he would drift off into reveries at the wheel). This army of ideas was matched by revolutionary art: where rival comics appeared to be populated by stiff mannequins, Kirby＊s chunky characters lunged out of the pages. The punches felt like they landed; the colours thrummed with energy. Soon Kirby was cramming his pages with fantastically detailed technology and representing cosmic forces with energised dots 每 a trademark flourish nicknamed the ※Kirby krackle§ 每 that added even more dynamism to his ambitious page layouts.After an astonishingly productive decade at Marvel, Kirby was lured back to their rival DC in 1971 with the promise of more autonomy, and promptly started building his own Fourth World mythology, a cosmic story of New Gods and Forever People that relocated the battle between good and evil to beyond the stars. It was heady stuff 每 but within five years he was back working for Marvel. ※I bounced back and forth like a yo-yo,§ . Back at Marvel, he revitalised Black Panther, a character he had created during his initial Fantastic Four run, and worked on a comic adaptation of Kubrick＊s 2001: A Space Odyssey that voyaged beyond the movie.But while he was admired by his peers and revered by the incoming generation of talent, Kirby fell slightly out of fashion by the 1980s. He worked periodically with DC and some small publishers and animation studios, but his relationship with Marvel had soured. In 1984, the studio asked Kirby to sign a new contract confirming that all of his Marvel creations had been work-for-hire and offered to return just 88 pages of his art 每 some . Instead, Kirby tried to regain some of the estimated 13,000 pages he had produced for them; , Kirby was left with around 2,000.A lawyer would see this as a company protecting its intellectual property. To the comics industry, even today, it seems disrespectful, a dismissal of one of its visionaries. And the finding would haunt Kirby＊s family long after his death in 1994. His widow Roz was granted a pension and reportedly vowed to live long to make what she felt the family was owed (she died just two years later). When Marvel was bought by Disney in 2009, in an astronomical $4bn deal, Kirby＊s heirs filed a suit against Marvel, Walt Disney Studios, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, and Sony, to stop any studios interested in making films with characters he＊d had a role in creating. In 2014, the Kirbys and Marvel that would honour, as it solemnly stated: ※Mr Kirby＊s significant role in Marvel＊s history.§ During the legal tussle, the Marvel Cinematic Universe evolved into the biggest film franchise in history; today, it has earned more than $12.5bn.These days, Marvel is marking Kirby＊s centenary by , from Captain America to Black Panther (and selling them for a buck a pop). DC, meanwhile, have recruited artists and writers to create one-off stories based on classic Kirby characters, and is launching a new series based on his nifty escapologist, Mister Miracle. Later in the year, the trippy polychromatic palette of  has a familiar ※krackle§ to it (director Taika Waititi incorporated Kirby artwork into his designs), and November sees  do battle with Ciar芍n Hinds as the diabolical villain Steppenwolf, a whole-cloth Kirby creation. Collectively, it seems a fitting tribute in the year of his centenary, even if Kirby＊s legacy still contains a cautionary tale. If the King of comics gave us all this and was left with nothing, what chance do mere mortals have?																																											"
"f you happen to be a football fan who is unable or just unwilling to pay for a big-money TV plan, or you＊re simply petrified at the prospect of the net police kicking your door in when you＊re watching an illegal stream, then your only other option when it comes to watching top-flight football is Match of the Day. First broadcast on 22 August 1964, MOTD has become as much a part of the British Saturday evening as fighting in a taxi rank. But it has changed 每 and not entirely for the better.In its glory years, it was all so simple. With debonair Des Lynam at the helm and  and  vying for the commentator＊s top job (plus dependable deputy Tony Gubba waiting in the wings), you never got each and every game from the day＊s fixture list, just the decent ones. No sitting through West Brom v Watford when Des was in the hot soccer seat. Just the best bits. Thanks for coming. Twiddle of the ＊tache.Today, MOTD (and most other football shows, for that matter) is needlessly protracted, relying on the thoughts of a stream of ex-players, managers and analysts, seemingly brought together by a collective fear of actually putting their vast knowledge and experience into practice in club management.Whether it＊s Martin Keown picking apart Bournemouth＊s defensive frailties or Kevin Kilbane berating the technique of players who＊ve actually won stuff, it has become little more than a late-night vehicle for cliches, regurgitated opinions and received wisdom (※It＊s your foreign players, you see? They go down too easy§).It is too simple to blame  for everything, but it has its part to play in MOTD＊s decline. When those 22 clubs broke away to form the new top-flight division in 1992 it changed pretty much everything, apart, perhaps, from the shape of the ball. From the transfer fees to the salaries, the stadiums to the egos, they all grew exponentially. And in the face of the coverage offered by the new kid on the block, Sky Sports, dear old MOTD struggled to keep pace.Tune in to  these days and you＊d be forgiven for thinking they＊ve relocated their studio to the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. It＊s all touchscreens and super slow-mo, ultra HD and holographic team lineups. Now, you get every goal and every save, every career-ending challenge and every managerial meltdown. It＊s football, Jim ＃ but not as we know it.The net result is that there＊s precious little mystery in football any more. No longer can a veteran centre-half get away with an honest elbow in the chiselled jaw of a sprightly young striker when the ref＊s not looking. No more can a manager scratch somewhere he shouldn＊t and, as Germany manager Joachim L?w did recently, surreptitiously sniff his fingers afterwards.With cameras in every crevice and augmented-reality graphics running amok, MOTD seems to struggle to differentiate itself from the bells, whistles and fireworks coverage of the satellite broadcasters. That＊s why you get tired spin-offs such as MOTD2, MOTD2 Extra and MOTD Kickabout. That＊s why every Premier League tie is, like, the most important game ever. And that＊s why you have to watch Bournemouth v Burnley. .																																											"
"he bay is like a proscenium theatre 每 it＊s dramatic, it＊s magical, there＊s a sense of moving through a narrative as you follow the coast, through geographical, cultural and social history. But the thing we come for, the thing that＊s all around us, is the thing we don＊t notice 每 the sea, a truly wild thing.§I＊m on a boat with author Philip Hoare (and a hundred other punters) crossing Torbay. You might think his words for the oft-satirised resort hyperbolic. But I live nearby 每 shamefully, it＊s the first time I＊ve crossed the bay on a boat 每 and I have to admit that from the sea, the palm-fronded curves, clay-coloured cliffs and undulating coastal hills do look very beautiful. If I squint a bit and ignore the bruise-coloured clouds rolling in from Dartmoor, I could be in Saint-Tropez or the Caribbean.Hoare is in Torquay to put the final touches to the Tale, an ※immersive§ site-specific celebration of Devon＊s English Riviera produced over three years 每 and a dozen visits to the region 每 in collaboration with Bristol-based public art organisation . It＊s inspired by his book, , part memoir, part meditation on life 每 human, animal and mineral 每 in the liminal zone between land and sea.A central theme is childhood. Born in 1958 in Southampton 每 where he still lives 每 Hoare belongs to the generation of working-class families for whom Torbay (spanning the towns of Torquay, Paignton and Brixham) was an ※approximation of a foreign resort§, just as it was for the health tourists of centuries past.During the late 1960s and early 70s, Hoare, his five siblings, housewife mother and factory-worker father spent two weeks every summer on a caravan site above Paignton, tripping down to the coves, strands, harbours and headlands of Torbay.※Apart from the car, that holiday was the biggest single expenditure of the year. It bought freedom for the kids 每 and for our parents, who forgot about work for that one time in the year.※At the seaside, you could live out your dreams, escape your parents, meet girls, even have sex 每 that wasn＊t easy [at home] in a three-bedroom semi.§A cabinet of curiosities at  每 where the Tale begins 每 will showcase Hoare＊s memories through photos and slides, fashion relics such as platform shoes, and the flotsam of family life. He also wants to take visitors beyond Torquay＊s oppressive literary cliche 每 Agatha Christie 每 and visit sites associated with Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who bathed here to treat spinal problems; Oscar Wilde, who fell for Lord Alfred (※Bosie§) Douglas while holidaying at Babbacombe Cliff; and Amazon explorer , who was born in Torquay.But the Tale does not spring solely from Hoare＊s experiences. At tiny Beacon Cove, just south of Torquay centre, I meet local teenagers Jade Whatley and Robyn Evelyn, who are taking part in a project mentored by Australian theatre company .To challenge tourist industry tropes about Torquay, they and five friends have recorded stories 每 accessed via an audioguide 每 that, as Jade puts it, ※Show that it＊s not the idyll it looks to holidaymakers, and has problems such as joblessness, drugs and domestic violence ＃ In spite of this, I have a lot of hope for Torquay. I went into the other day and everyone was discussing how to be positive. It＊s not about the aesthetics, but the people.§Originally from Rhondda, Wales, Jade＊s family moved to Torbay because they came on holiday and her mum liked it. ※Even if it＊s not the same when you live here, it＊s still beautiful,§ she says. ※I have my own place where I can go and I can sit and not see people, buildings, anything. I go with friends sometimes to talk about problems, the planet, our mortality, our morality ＃§One Step＊s Julian Rickert sees the Torquay stage of the Tale as a psychogeographical ramble. ※People will experience aspects of the place they don＊t normally experience 每 back alleys, car parks, views from inside shops. We want to strip the place of all the ways you usually see it 每 shopping, eating, drinking 每 and make people look and feel something new. We＊re interested in the connection between Philip＊s memories as a young person visiting and what the local kids feel.§An hour away on foot is Paignton, where the art deco  will be used as a backdrop for a piece by visual artist Britt Hatzius. Welsh artist Marc Rees is contributing a work inspired by the lives of two celebrated sisters nicknamed , who promenaded around the resort in unusual clothes in the 1840s. The details of these, and works by renowned artists such as Ellen Gallagher, Jonathan Anderson and Ingri Fiksdal, are under wraps; Situations wants visitors to be surprised.For the three consecutive weekends of the Tale (from 8-10 September), all transport will be included as part of the ticket. For my preview, Philip and I jump on the ferry across the bay to Brixham, Torbay＊s main fishing port. Its tiers of terraces remind me of Italian coastal towns, rougher round the edges perhaps, but lovely in the right light. The Hoares came here every Sunday to the town＊s Roman Catholic church 每 named, aptly, Our Lady, Star of the Sea.※Even going to church was fun,§ he recalls. ※Because it was a different building, and there were different people, and you were on holiday.§At Brixham, the Tale will tap into Hoare＊s overriding passion: swimming. He swims off Southampton every day, no matter what the weather, no matter how busy he is. When he travels, he does his best to find water; he manages a quick dip while I＊m talking to Jade and Robyn. At 6.30am on Saturdays and Sundays during the Tale＊s run, he will lead dawn swims from  in Torquay.In RisingTideFallingStar, he writes: ※[I＊m] so in love with it that sometimes I think I can only think by the sea ＃ It is the only place I feel free and alive.§At , a seawater lido 15 minutes＊ walk from Brixham, swimmers choreographed by dancer Claire Cunningham will give form to this deep feeling. A little further along, at Berry Head quarry, musician and sound recordist Chris Watson 每 formerly of influential Sheffield band Cabaret Voltaire 每 will present a sound installation that takes listeners on to the waves, into the shallows and down to the seabed through recordings of underwater life.Multi-sensory, genre-hopping, participative and provocative, the Tale is part of an Arts Council-backed project to put Torbay on the map for those seeking more than fish, chips, caravans and crab sandwiches.※Torbay lacks any real cultural attraction,§ says Hoare. ※That＊s one of the main raisons d＊那tre for the Tale 每 to add something cultural. I hope it sums up the nostalgia we feel for the sea, such a vivid element in our lives; the sense of everything old and everything new, renewed by the tide ＃ what histories it holds and what possibilities it offers.§ 																																											"
"ow do you make a farce with no doors? This was the challenge  set himself in 1979 with . His solution: locate the action on three separate floors of one house 每 and locate all three floors on one level (this explains the, at first peculiar-seeming, jumble of beds and sofas of Kevin Jenkins＊s design). Have two sets of banisters marking two imaginary staircases. Give the action a slow, steady start until the audience twigs what is what and who is where. Then let the fun begin. One instance: in a first-floor bedroom a woman (Louise Shuttleworth) practises dance steps. In the ground-floor drawing room below stand the husband she means to leave (Russell Dixon) and the builder (Leigh Symonds) from whom the couple rent this supposedly haunted house. The men look upwards, wondering what is making the noise 每 they think they are alone. In reality, what we actually see on the stage is a woman jumping up and down between two men. Plaster falls from the imaginary ceiling. The audience howls. This is the extra level, the one without which no Ayckbourn play is complete: the complicity of the audience in the game of make-believe. In Scarborough＊s theatre-in-the-round, we can all see one another watching the action 每 some are seated so close they are virtually in the action 每 we share the pleasure of ※seeing§ what is not there.Ayckbourn describes  as his only really classic farce. In a collapsing house, relationships are falling apart. Four selfish characters get their just deserts, two deserving characters get theirs. On the night I was there, the clockwork mechanism of the construction seemed to turn just a little too slowly to release the gales of laughter that famously accompanied the first production, but the ensemble (including Laurence Pears as the wife＊s brother; Laura Matthews as his former fiancee; and the delightful Antony Eden as the husband＊s tongue-twisted solicitor) are finely tuned by the director: .

Indeed, she has a fully fledged vocal style of her own that is more than capable of doing justice to material ranging from Leonard Bernstein to Hank Williams. She plays proper jazz piano, too, and her excellent band has the settled-in sound of a regular working unit. I particularly enjoyed the version of Some Other Time, virtually a duet between her and guitarist Pat Sprakes, and the scat vocal unison with piano in .

"oving back in with mum might not sound like the sort of creative impetus every 27-year-old musician requires to overcome second album syndrome, but it worked for Ben Romans-Hopcraft. After touring his band＊s debut, Lacuna, the  frontman was left bereft of ideas. He moved into his mum＊s flat in West Norwood, south London, a domestic change which provided everything he needed to nourish his inspiration: vintage soul music every Sunday and, based on the rakish new look he is sporting today, quite possibly a functioning iron. It also proved integral for him to reconnect with his cultural identity.※I never really embraced black music in my own way [before now]. It＊s such a vague term. But I wanted to place a little bit more importance on my identity. Not just my identity as a black person, but also the community that I＊m from.§Influenced by the soulful orchestration and subtle rock grooves of  and Todd Rundgren that echoed through his mum＊s house, Hopcraft decided to abandon the shoegaze and dream-pop of Childhood＊s debut for a  sound with a little more spiritual depth. Universal High＊s lyrics, meanwhile, draw from the area Hopcraft grew up in: a multicultural, working-class community and a stark contrast to the music industry he had been ensconced in since 2012, an environment in which he was often the only black person in the room.※Where I come from it＊s a mixed bag, it＊s not just about indie, middle-class white culture. And that＊s what I wanted to show. I just feel like it＊s something that should be represented if you can, because it＊s honest. I wanted my music to be a more truthful look at where I am from.§While the record shares the same mellow soundscapes as the band＊s debut (there＊s even a baggy quality to Nothing Ever Seems Right), a lot of the lyrics are based around anecdotes about people who ※come from struggling backgrounds and are dealing with the modern oppression of living in a massive city,§ he says. Elastic funk track Monitor, for example, is about a family friend＊s 16-year-old son who was racially profiled and subsequently went off the rails when he was wrongly accused. ※It completely spun him out and it is about that kind of interaction on a really young black male and how it can really mess you up.§Aside from reconnecting with his roots, the years between  and Universal High offered some more unfamiliar experiences. Hopcraft and the rest of the band 每 Leo Dobsen, Jonny Williams, Max Danieli-Fantin, Thomas Tomaski 每 spent time in Atlanta with Ben Allen (Deerhunter, Gnarls Barkley, Animal Collective) producing the record, a luxury he says he thought was something you＊d only get ※if you were the §. As well as recording, Hopcraft integrated into the Atlantan lifestyle, having barbecues in the local neighbourhood and even visiting a Prince tribute night at the famous Clermont Lounge strip club. Then there was his side project, Insecure Men, with , an experience which led to him visiting New York for a collaboration with Sean Lennon, with in tow.※She is really, really lovely. She gave me a high five. It was really surreal,§ he says. ※[Sean and I] have established a good friendship, and me and him and Saul were writing songs while I was there 每 there＊s definitely going to be more music from that trio in future.§Core to Childhood＊s new vision is the overarching theme of identity and pride. The album artwork is a photograph of a preacher in the grips of a dramatic sermon in Elephant and Castle, while Hopcraft switched jeans and T-shirts for slickly tailored retro suits, styled by the award-winning , an innovative new figure in fashion who went to school with Hopcraft and explores the beauty and delicacy of black male identity in her work. It＊s a shrewd, sophisticated move, especially given most modern guitar groups have very little drive to look anything more ambitious than day three at a Deerhunter-curated ATP.Hopcraft is now playing festivals and will be touring the record with the rest of the band this year. He has moved out of the flat with his mum 每 he no longer needs the grounding. By the sounds of it, Childhood have grown up. ※When I was 22 I was really concerned with the mythology of being in a band, what to do, where to go out and hanging out with X and Y,§ he says. ※I wasn＊t getting any enjoyment out of it 每 I wasn＊t being creative. I feel a lot more comfortable with what I want to do now in music.§																																											"
"Counter-terrorism police have urged the public to be vigilant over the bank holiday weekend in the face of the increased terrorism threat. They said there was no specific threat in relation to events taking place but that crowded places were particularly vulnerable. There have already been three attacks in London this year, ,  and , and one in Manchester at The attacks have prompted a sharp increase in the number of requests for armed police presence at events. Not all can be or are deemed necessary to be met, but the National Police Chiefs＊ Council said officers had been focusing on improving security measures across a range of sectors.Among events taking place this weekend are , and  in west London, as well as a busy sporting calendar, including a full programme of football, the , the rugby league Challenge cup final, the British moto Grand Prix at Silverstone and the second Test between England and the West Indies at Headingley. DCS Scott Wilson, the national coordinator for protect and prepare, said: ※While there is no information to suggest that any event is facing an increased risk of attack, the fact is that the UK＊s threat level remains at ＆severe＊, which means an attack is highly likely.※We know only too well that tragic events can happen without warning at any time or place, and crowded places can be particularly vulnerable. With so many events taking place this weekend, we want as many people as possible to know exactly how to keep themselves and others safe.§Counter-terrorism officers have already trained football stewards, as well as festival and events staff in how to spot suspicious behaviour and what to do in the event of an attack but Wilson said it was important for the public to arm themselves with such knowledge as well. Thirty-six people have been killed and more than 200 injured in terrorist attacks in the UK this year. Last week,  in Barcelona and Cambrils, killing 15, and injuring scores more, many of them seriously. The UK＊s most senior counter-terrorism officer, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, said there had been ※a shift in the nature of the terrorist threat to the UK§.He said there had been a large increase in the number of calls to the confidential anti-terrorism hotline, but added: ※Just as important is equipping yourself with some basic knowledge that will help keep you safe.§The security minister Ben Wallace said: ※The recent terror attacks in the UK and across Europe have been a shocking reminder of the threat we all face ... This is a job for all of us. The public also have a vital role to play as they are ideally placed to notice activity which is unusual.※Families and communities should enjoy themselves this bank holiday, while remaining alert but not alarmed by the threat and report any concerns to the police.§ 																																											"
"This might sound a strange thing to say of a show that blew up Tom Cruise, revealed God to be an impostor and killed off pretty much its entire supporting cast in the finale, but season one of Preacher was disappointingly tame. Sure, compared to other TV shows it was a wild ride (that angel fight in the motel room was like nothing else you＊ve ever seen), but compared with the comic book series on which it＊s based, it was pretty safe. Now, though, after the ratings success of season one, it＊s thrown itself headfirst into the sordid, blasphemous, offensive-to-everyone world of Garth Ennis and ＊s comic.The latest episode pushed the envelope far enough for the Christian right to take notice. It was essentially trolling them for the whole episode. It opened with a graphic sex scene in which Jesus was asked to put his finger up a woman＊s bum, the birth of Jesus＊s illegitimate child and the reveal that his direct (but heavily inbred) descendent is a simpleton named Humperdoo. Oh, and the Pope turned up too, to give a bizarre speech about how God is busy creating a new 10ft-tall species with a honey badger＊s sense of smell. You have to suspect the Preacher producers were eagerly awaiting . You simply can＊t buy the sort of publicity a boycott will get you.Normally I＊m not your hard-to-offend type. I＊ve been called a snowflake more than once, and ranted about Game of Thrones＊ dubious use of rape. But there is something about the OTT ridiculousness of Preacher that keeps it on the right side of funny, even if you＊re giggling through gasps. The Jesus sex scene featured an Austin Powers-style shadow play depicting sexual positions that I don＊t believe are physically possible. In an earlier episode, when a prostitute mix-up results in chief villain/best character ever Herr Starr being ※sodomised§ by three ※ruffians§, as he puts it, the whole thing is played for laughs. But the show is careful not to laugh at homosexuality or rape 每 the comedy comes from the cartoonish characterisation of Herr Starr, his deadpan reactions, and his established ability to derive sexual pleasure from just about anything. In an earlier episode, inmates of hell scorned a fellow damned soul for claiming that his crimes of rape don＊t really count because it was date rape. ※No means no,§ another inmate tells him gravely.Speaking of hell, one of the show＊s main characters is currently Hitler. Hitler in hell. Because if your show is not offensive enough, you can always add Hitler. When he first showed up, and it seemed they would be portraying him as a bullied, almost sympathetic character, I confess I felt the show had gone too far 每 especially in the age of the ※alt-right§. But it soon became clear that Preacher is showing Hitler for what he was 每 a weak, pathetic, self-serving sad-sack. Turning him into an all-powerful villain would have been a mistake; showing him as helpless is exactly the right approach. Preacher isn＊t just offensive on a religious level (although it did recently shoot a guy dressed as God) 每 it＊s got a scattergun fondness for everything that could be considered depraved, disgusting and just plain odd. When searching for God, our heroes are taken to a man on a leash dressed as a dalmatian. The angel Fiore discovered he could make a living by committing gory suicide on stage in Vegas and immediately respawning. I only understand about two thirds of what Cassidy says, but it＊s all filth. Innocent bystanders die all the bloody time, and Herr Starr once won a fight by masturbating at his opponent.At the same time, Preacher has a strangely sweet core. Poor, arse-faced Eugene is the purest soul TV has ever seen. Jesse Custer might swear and brawl but his religious beliefs are strong and unwavering. In the midst of all the carnage, the brilliant  is telling a touching story of Tulip＊s PTSD 每 which is the inevitable result of an encounter with a murderous supernatural being, but something that other fantasy shows brush under the rug. Preacher＊s darkest moments are rarely the offensive ones. When Cassidy tried to convince Jesse to kill Tulip＊s husband, knowing it would drive Jesse and Tulip apart, we were given an unsettling glimpse into this funny character＊s dark heart. Fiore＊s suicide show stopped being daft the moment we realised he was deeply grieving for his lost partner, DeBlanc. Tulip and Jesse＊s domestic struggle following her miscarriage and his depression wasn＊t remotely funny. The show can be as irreverent as it wants, but it still knows how to land the serious moments. When a depressed and drunk Jesse beat his innocent friend to a pulp, it was rightfully portrayed as sickening behaviour 每 completely different in tone to the cartoonish supernatural fight scenes. So far, the show has managed to walk that tricky tightrope between hilariously offensive and morally responsible.If it keeps up that balancing act, it＊s on to a winner 每 and hopefully on to season three. With the Saint of Killers lurking in the swamps and tantalising hints about Jesse＊s family, it would be a shame if the controversy scared AMC into cancelling a show that, Hitler or not, is unique.

"he actor and comedian  is seven years old when the penny drops about boys and their feelings. He is in his final year at infant school and is known for being quiet. ※I wish they were all like you, Robert,§ say the mums at birthday parties as the boys run noisily amok, while his mother tells his teachers, ※He＊s just a bit shy.§ At the local golf club where his granddad works as a kitchen steward, Webb finds a bee on the gravel courtyard and, observing its laboured attempts at crawling, realises it is close to death. Rain is on its way so he builds a small circle of tiny stones around it for protection and, with tears in his eyes, leaves it to its fate.※I＊m not going to tell anyone about this, not even Nan or [Aunty] Tru or Mum,§ he decides. ※They would be nice about it, of course, but I know the truth about my bee. I wasn＊t supposed to look after it. I was supposed to stamp on it.§In this coming-of-age memoir, Webb, who was born in 1972, tells the story of his upbringing as the youngest son of a working-class woodcutter in the village of Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire. He also examines, with enormous poignancy and insight, the damage that can be done when young boys are encouraged to behave in ways supposedly befitting their gender.In the late 1970s, certain rules had to be observed for a boy to fit in. These included: not crying, not discussing feelings, not being gay, hating girls, getting into fights, obsessing about sport and, when the occasion demanded it, stamping on bees. None of these things came easily to Webb, who was sensitive, had sticky-out ribs, liked poetry and hated sport. During football lessons he would ※welcome the sight of the ball arching towards me in the same way that a quadriplegic nudist covered in jam welcomes the sight of a hornet§.Webb＊s early portrait of himself as a hapless underdog navigating the boulder-strewn path of masculinity is vividly drawn and very funny. There are echoes of  in the way he seesaws between priggishness and melancholy (the young Webb also kept a diary). These years are rich in period detail, full of Anaglypta wallpaper, Raleigh bikes, , aniseed balls chain-smoking adults and singalongs to Rod Stewart＊s ※Sailing§ in the car. His life, on paper, is close to idyllic, though, under the surface, anxiety, dread and confusion reside. Webb＊s childhood was spent under the shadow of his father, Paul, who was admired in the village for his drinking and philandering, and feared at home for his explosive temper. For Webb and his two brothers, elbows on the tables would be dealt with by being ※knocked clean from our chairs§. Once, while watching , he recalls being lifted off his seat and thrashed around the legs with his own Woody Woodpecker-embroidered shorts. He never found out why.Eventually Webb＊s mother left, taking her sons with her. A year later she married Derek, the ※teetotal and mild§ owner of an agricultural spare parts company, with whom they found a degree of stability. But at 17, Webb＊s life was upended again when his mum was diagnosed with breast cancer and died shortly afterwards.It＊s at this point, with his fate in the hands of two emotionally dysfunctional men, that his crisis began in earnest. What had started as self-doubt morphed into severe self-loathing that enveloped his years at Cambridge and his early forays into writing and acting, and manifested itself in arrogance, frequent drunkenness and treating his girlfriends badly.While Webb milks his most atrocious moments for laughs 每 there＊s the time when, talking to his mother on her deathbed, he moans about still being a virgin, while at college he cheats on his girlfriend with two women in one night 每 he treats the underlying problems that have afflicted him and scores of other men with the utmost seriousness. It＊s to his credit that he never loses sight of his privilege as a man, and the cost of that privilege to women. If at times his fear of a feminist roasting is palpable 每 ※feminists aren＊t out to get us,§ he explains, rather unnecessarily. ※They are out to get the patriarchy. They don＊t hate men, they hate The Man§ 每 he is clear and convincing in his argument that addressing the gender conditioning of men will improve life for all.It＊s with a mixture of bafflement and frustration that he unpicks the semantics of masculinity and femininity, noting how many words ※come pre-loaded with a steam tanker of gender manure from the last century§. He asks what it is to ※act like a man§, why men struggle to maintain adult friendships and why they are more likely than women to kill themselves. ※To put it childishly,§ he says, ※if you want a vision of masculinity, imagine Dr Frankenstein being constantly bum-raped by his own monster while shouting, ※I＊m fine, everyone! I＊m absolutely fine!§These, then, are the themes that underpin Webb＊s memoir, and are the prism through which he views his own life. Caitlin Moran＊s  is referenced here in the title and the cover image, but this is less a righteous manifesto for the modern man than a highly personal story that might just resonate with others and give them confidence to talk, too.※Being male is terrific,§ Webb says, ※but comes with an extra load of baggage that is worth noticing.

"here＊s an irony to the title of Roddy Doyle＊s 11th novel, in that the book eschews most of his trademark humour and the laughs fall thin on the ground. His darkest and perhaps finest work since  20 years ago,  combines tropes from the various strands of Doyle＊s career 每 childhood memories from , middle-aged regrets from  and , pub conversations from  每 and merges them into a unique novel, one that is terribly moving and even, at times, distressing, while saving its greatest surprise until the end. is narrated by Victor Forde, who finds himself alone in middle age, seeking the solace of a pint in his new local, Donnelly＊s pub. There he is interrupted in his reading by Fitzpatrick, who declares himself to be an old friend, although Victor is slow to remember him. Fitzpatrick, while uncouth, is affable and eager to talk, falling quickly into nostalgia with unsettling memories of their shared youth attending, like Doyle himself, a school run by the notorious Christian Brothers. ※What was the name of the Brother that used to fancy you?§ he asks, and his apparently innocuous question leaves Victor immediately hostile. ※I wanted to hit him,§ he tells us. ※I wanted to kill him ＃ I hated this man, whoever he was.§Despite an inauspicious start to their reunion, Victor finds the pub to be a place of safety; he goes there evening after evening and slowly ingratiates himself with the other regulars. His loneliness is profound, but the drink loosens him up enough to consider the things that he has lost: his ex-wife, Rachel, who has become a media celebrity through her television show, and his own music journalism career, which began with great promise but somehow never took off and has now finally ground to a halt.As with much of Doyle＊s work, however, it is childhood that lies at the heart of the story: a broken, troubled childhood whose traumas have been buried deep within Victor＊s psyche for decades. A living, cursing, badly dressed version of Proust＊s madeleine, it only takes Fitzpatrick＊s appearance to summon up every facet of his pain with traumatic results.The reason for the novel＊s title is revealed early on. In a classroom full of?mischief-makers, Brother Murphy, a?small but violent teacher who exercised power over his students with ruthless cruelty, had always left Victor alone, his explanation coming in eight words that would define the boy＊s schooldays and make him the object of?scorn among his peers: ※Victor Forde, I can never resist your smile.§It＊s a chilling line, one that, were it said today by a teacher to a student, would probably result in the police being called, but it＊s enough to silence a gaggle of aggressive 13-year-olds more accustomed to random acts of violence than unexpected words of flattery. Murphy＊s words single Victor out, they make him question what he has done to encourage such adulation, and lend the cover image, a small boy grinning in apparent good humour, a?sinister motivation.Another common theme of Doyle＊s work is the quixotic games that memory plays on us. It＊s there in , where impish recollections give way to a growing awareness of a failing marriage. It runs through the Last Roundup trilogy, charting the course of Ireland over a long and violent century through the eyes of an often unreliable narrator, Henry Smart, who remembers things as he wants to remember them. But it is at its most effective here where Victor＊s memories are continually challenged by Fitzpatrick, a Jiminy Cricket of sorts, sitting on Victor＊s shoulder, forcing him to confront the demons from his past.Throughout, there＊s a sense that Victor is going through a mixture of catharsis and breakdown, taking responsibility for his actions while finally allowing himself to explore the ordeals of his youth. All of this is done within the church-like atmosphere of the pub, a setting that Doyle has frequently used as a place for friendships to thrive, jokes to be made and eulogies to be spoken, but also as a location for husbands to escape their wives, where men can revel in their masculinity before returning home to engage in drunken violence upon the women and children they claim to love. There is none of the hilarity of the two old codgers from  here; Victor and Fitzpatrick are combatants from the start and the atmosphere of tension that lingers over their conversations is?palpable.While Doyle has never been a particularly experimental writer, he takes great risks with his story as the novel progresses. To say more would be to spoil the truly unexpected climax that  reaches, but suffice to say that to call this the least Roddyesque of?Doyle＊s work would be an understatement. There is a brave and complex ending to the novel, one that will leave readers astonished, and it＊s possible that not everyone will find it convincing, although I would not be among their number. Like all good literature, it will inspire debate but also admiration for the courage of a hugely successful writer who refuses to be predictable and uses the novel to challenge both the reader＊s sense of ease and the nature of the form itself.

"A quarter of the films shown at the 61st BFI  will be directed by women 每 a figure the organisers admit is ※bad§.But at least the proportion was rising, the festival director, Clare Stewart, said as she announced a programme of 242 feature films and 128 shorts from 67 countries, all to be screened over 12 days in October.Last year, a fifth of the festival＊s films were directed by women 每 a low proportion, but better than the 13% for films released in UK cinemas.Stewart said there was a long way to go in achieving gender parity, and the BFI needed to play its part. ※It is a responsibility of film festivals to highlight the important changes that need to happen in our industry,§ she said.※Getting more women behind the camera is something that will have a significant impact in terms of diversifying stories. But it＊s also just basic gender equity, which is what we＊re after.§Stewart said it was important to give prominent festival slots to talented women. Among the headline gala films announced on Thursday were , a story of racial tension ignited by the friendship of two second world war veterans in the Deep South, and , a brutal psychological drama starring Joaquin PhoenixIn the festival＊s official competition, four of the 12 films are directed by women, including Nora Twomey＊s animated drama The Breadwinner, which is executive produced by Angelina Jolie and tells of one girl＊s struggle in Taliban-controlled Kabul.The London film festival announced its lineup in the opening week of . Only one film out of 21 in the Venice competition is directed by a woman: Vivian Qu＊s Angels Wear White, which is also a London contender.Alberto Barbera, director of the Venice film festival, said it was not the festival＊s fault. ※I don＊t like to think in terms of a quota when you make a selection process. I＊m sorry that there are very few films from women this year, but we are not producing films.§Stewart said the  festival aimed to include more films directed by women than the 13% average, but true parity was not currently possible. ※We＊d have to shrink the programme,§ she said.However, Stewart said talking about the issue was important. ※Us making a point of it each year, to be speaking out about it, not trying to hide it like it is a dirty secret, is a very important element of ensuring that change happens.§London, the UK＊s largest film festival, is a big deal in the film world, but it is not quite as significant as Cannes, Venice and Toronto, which hoover up the most eye-catching world premieres.Nevertheless, 28 films will be seen for the first time in London. They include Paddy Considine＊s Journeyman, about a boxer rebuilding his life after a near fatal injury; Roland Joff谷＊s The Forgiven, a South African truth and reconciliation drama starring Forest Whitaker as Archbishop Desmond Tutu; and Funny Cow, starring Maxine Peake as an aspiring standup on the club circuit in the north of England.Stewart said there would be ※some really tough, challenging, edgy cinema§ at this year＊s festival, as well as films vying for the awards.One of those could be the opening night gala film Breathe, which tells the true story of Robin Cavendish (played by Andrew Garfield), who contracts polio as a young man and is left severely disabled. Given only months to live, he refuses to be confined to an institution and is broken out of hospital by his wife, Diana (Claire Foy). The film charts how the couple go on to live fulfilling, joyous lives.Breathe could not be more personal to its producer, Jonathan Cavendish, the son of Robin and Diana. Cavendish said he had wanted to make the film for 20 years but the project only began to take shape a decade ago, when William Nicholson agreed to write it. ※He agreed on one condition 每 that you don＊t pay me until or unless the film happens,§ Cavendish said. ※As Bill is one of the top writers in the world, I thought that was a good deal.※He didn＊t want the film to be controlled or owned by anybody else.§Cavendish said Breathe was a film about love. ※It is about love enabling you to overcome obstacles that seem insuperable. It＊s not really about disabled rights as such, my father didn＊t involve himself in that. He simply thought that by living the life he could live and showing what fun you could have, what joy you could have ＃ it would affect other people.§The producer＊s most pressing concern during the process was simple: ※It was so desperately important to not fuck it up. How embarrassing would it be to make a film about your parents and your own life and then make a fuck-up of it. That＊s been a strain and continues to be a strain, to be honest.§ The 61st  runs from 4-15 October. 																																											"
"Awkward recriminations over a?restaurant table. Another horribly moreish commission from BBC3,  dishes up eight seven-minute documentary vignettes, each featuring a former couple who meet for a meal to dissect old passions. Click on one as a starter and you will stay for the full tasting menu.The format is reminiscent of Channel 4＊s , but rather than switching focus between the couples during a longer episode, these snack-sized tasters allow you to eavesdrop on one pair to speed-digest the entire story of their relationship in a single gulp. It is like one delicious oyster after another. If you are the kind of person who gradually lowers your restaurant conversation to earwig on the obvious breakup happening at the next table, you will love this show but also be furious that only 56 minutes of it is available to watch.Obviously, participants who answer an ad for a TV show that will reunite them with their ex come with an agenda, so the drama arrives readymade. But this isn＊t a shouty recrimination bonanza in the mode of Jeremy Kyle. It is young folks, poking nervously at their lentil curry, and shyly attempting eye contact with someone who, often, has had a profound effect on them. Some want a?reunion, others want an apology or just simple closure, the severing of an elastic band that pings them back to the bad situation to make the same mistakes again.To move the conversation along, each course (there is only time for main and pudding) arrives on a plate with a leading question printed around the edge. ※Why are you polyamorous now?§ asks one. ※Why did you cheat on me?§ says another. I＊ve picked the two most tabloid-sounding queries, but the resulting conversation is anything but. The answers are laced with regret, sometimes a twinkling eye over the rim of a fiddled-with wine glass or a micro-expression that leaks the inner tempest.※I could tell you the day you slept with someone. It was on a Tuesday,§ says Kris to her ex-girlfriend, Luka, three years after the fact. Every word is loaded with meaning as she goes on to explain that she is happy in the three years she has remained single since their separation. She＊s fine.Sarah was scarred in an accident and met male model Bogdan soon after. The scar on her chin is something she is coming to terms with. He told her it?was beautiful. She wants him, and what he represents, back. That one is a tough watch but no one leaves the table any worse off for the experience.Not every interface has a romantic undertone, sometimes it＊s just two old friends wanting to put away the past and embrace their platonic future.This is not the shrill slanging-match you might expect, but rather a series of discreet firework displays over a dinner table; short plays about young love, very nicely directed by Paddy Hughes.

"hen Argentinian author Samanta Schweblin＊s first book,  came out in 2002, she was 24 years old, a fresh, female voice in a Latin American literary scene dominated by male greats: Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cort芍zar, Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel Garc赤a M芍rquez. Every good review was important, even if the praise was occasionally backhanded: one well-known Argentinian critic loved her debut and said that she wrote like a man.More than a decade later, she rolls her eyes. ※That＊s a compliment? It was so strange to me ＃ and he was trying to be very nice, trying to cheer me up and push my career,§ says Schweblin, now with a  nomination under her belt.It is an example of the insidious dismissal of female writing over time. Books by women are seen as domestic and unpolitical. As Margaret Atwood said in 1971: ※When a man writes about things like doing the dishes, it＊s realism; when a woman does it it＊s an unfortunate genetic limitation.§ Norman Mailer could famously ※§, for it was ※fey, old-hat, Quaintsy Goysy, tiny, too dykily psychotic, crippled, creepish, fashionable, frigid§.This dismissal is not merely anecdotal, but has been tested out in several revealing experiments by writers. When novelist  submitted her manuscript under a male pseudonym she got eight times more responses than she had received under her own name, while poetry hoaxer Gwen Harwood  under a male name were greeted more warmly than her genuine verse (even when they contained the acrostic: ※Fuck All Editors§). The bias is pervasive enough to have acquired a name: ※gynobibliophobia§.Reading itself is an undeniably gendered pastime: women , while men read more nonfiction, and  (nine books a year on average, compared with women＊s 14). Female writers attract mostly female readers (about 80%, according to a 2015 Goodreads survey), while male writers tend to attract an audience that is evenly split. Or, as Siri Hustvedt once said: ※Men who write fiction have an audience representative of the world as a whole while women don＊t.§ But translated female authors such as Schweblin have a particularly hard time finding their way to an English readership. In 2016, 33.8% of books translated into English were by women, compared with 63.8% by men,  recently. Of the last 10 years, 2008 was the worst, with only 23.4% of translated work by female authors 每 but that is only a little worse than the decade＊s average, with 28.97% by women (1,147) against 68.50% by men (3,351), with the remaining work jointly authored titles.What explanation do we have for this disparity? Is the writing of women the world over so consistently less impressive than that of their male contemporaries that it doesn＊t warrant the effort of translation? Is English publishing just more sexist? Could you go into any local bookstore and see this disparity on the shelves?Likely not; the phenomenal success of a few authors 每 Elena Ferrante, Han Kang, Isabel Allende 每 so skewed the landscape that it is hard to notice. But even a lifetime of success in their own language doesn＊t always help an author reach English. When Romanian-German Herta M邦ller won the Nobel prize in 2009, only one of her books had been translated into English; already more than her fellow female Nobel laureates Gabriela Mistral, Grazia Deledda and Nelly Sachs, none of whom had any until after their award. When Svetlana Alexievich won, six years after M邦ller, none of her books was available in English, an oddity explained thus by : ※English and American publishers are loth to take risks on a book just because it＊s good, without something like a Nobel prize.§ But only one male laureate out of 99 每 Italy＊s Salvatore Quasimodo 每 was unpublished in English when he won.※I think there is this belief that English produces enough of its own books, and so we don＊t need to look further,§ says Dr Chantal Wright, a German translator and coordinator of 2017＊s inaugural . ※It＊s like the local food issue 每 I get it, I do believe my potatoes should come from down the road. But I like oranges, too.§It is hard to identify a sole source of blame. In interviews for this article, some translators blamed the publishers; those in publishing said they didn＊t know about the books in the first place, so it was down to translators and agents. The tougher hurdle to leap is the systematic dismissal of female writers that has insidiously affected everyone agents, editors, publicists, readers. Strangely, as Wright points out, publishing is overwhelmingly female, ※which makes it all the odder that female writers wouldn＊t be picked up ＃ It＊s a tricky one. Active intervention is needed, because I think it is hard to look beyond one＊s own position. I＊m a woman, I＊m white. You have to remind yourself that there are other genders, other colours, other nationalities. It requires us to stand beyond ourselves,§ she says.But solutions for this undeniable bias towards male writers, translated or not, are alternately divisive and impractical. Kamila Shamsie demanded that 2018 should be a year of publishing only women, a call to arms  but ignored by the rest. Any talk of active intervention inevitably raises hackles. Even 20 years of the Baileys prize (now renamed the Women＊s prize for fiction) haven＊t halted the annual bunfight over whether it should still exist;  versus The Warwick prize, , is seeking to reward translators of either gender who bring a female author into English. (Interestingly, the balance of male and female translators is more or less equal 每 so far in 2017, women have translated 248 books into English while men are responsible for 249).But any talk of quotas doesn＊t appeal to Schweblin, who says we are in ※a very dangerous moment ＃ We are prioritising quantity over quality, making quotas and not finding the best writers. I am not saying this problem is solved in every field. It is not. But it is almost solved in literature. And I think it is important to think in quality, not quantity.§Every writer and translator I spoke to had the same solution: talking about it. And they are. Campaigns like  and  (each year in August) have given new energy to decades of resentment now bubbling into a loud and clear fury 每 at the Spanish publisher that tried to ; at the relentless obsession of journalists with the exotic beauty and offensive dislikability of Brazilian great Clarice Lispector. Both the speculation that the pseudonymous Italian author Ferrante must be a man, and her subsequent unmasking, were .All of which is feeding a new candour among translated women authors. ※This is the moment that things are changing,§ says Schweblin. ※Recently a BBC journalist asked me, ＆Why are most of the characters in your book women?＊ Now, four or five years ago, I would have tried to find an answer, invent something to explain myself.

"Told in diary entries and?letters, Andrew Martin＊s  (Corsair, ?14.99) is set in York at?the end of the 18th century, a time when shades, or silhouettes, were the latest thing in portraiture. Fletcher Rigge, languishing in a debtors＊ prison, is bailed by the louche Captain Harvey on condition that he find the murderer of his shade painter father, who has been fatally stabbed with his own scissors. The evidence points to one of Matthew Harvey＊s last sitters as the culprit, and Rigge has a month to discover which; failure to do so will mean reincarceration. As well as being a skilfully constructed whodunnit,  is an impeccably researched and wonderfully atmospheric evocation of Georgian England, from the snow-covered streets?of York to the waspish salons of literary London, taking in everything from fashionable gatherings to slums. Vivid and pungent, with plenty of grotesquery and dry humour, it＊s a virtuoso performance from a master of?historical crime fiction.Ausma Zehanat Khan＊s award-winning debut novel,  (No Exit, ?7.99), has its roots in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s 每 specifically, the  of thousands of Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica, a place that had the status of a UN-protected ※safe area§ 每 and the text is interspersed with real testimony from war crimes trials. In the present day, Esa Khattak, second-generation Canadian Muslim and head of Toronto＊s community policing section, is tasked with investigating the death of wealthy businessman Christopher Drayton. On discovering that Drayton is, in fact, Detective Drazen Krstic, former lieutenant colonel in the Bosnian Serb army and overseer of horrendous war crimes, Khattak realises that his death might not have been the accident it first appeared. Although somewhat uneven 每 the dead man＊s avaricious fiancee seems to belong in a different book, as does the femme fatale who almost wrecked Khattak＊s career 每  is a powerful and haunting story.Ruth Ware＊s third psychological thriller,  (Harvill Secker, ?12.99), reprises the themes of her first novel, : female friendships and guilty secrets. After 17 years, a text summons old friends Isla, Fatima and Thea back to Salten on the?south coast, where they went to boarding school and where the fourth member of the quartet, Kate, daughter of the art teacher, still lives. The others haven＊t been back since they were expelled, but now a human bone has been found in the marshes, and the lies the girls told the authorities 每 and, it turns out, each other 每 are about to be exposed. There are no high-octane thrills here, and the mystery itself is fairly straightforward, but well drawn, complex characters and the delicate, merciless filleting of tensions and loyalties will keep you turning the pages.In her first standalone crime novel,  (HQ, ?12.99), Mel McGrath, author of the splendid Edie Kiglatuk series, relocates from the high Arctic to south London, where the danger comes not from ice storms and polar bears, but something more insidious: the very people one should be able to trust 每 including oneself. Child psychologist Cat Lupo hasn＊t felt entirely safe inside her own head since the psychotic episodes she suffered during pregnancy, and she is still feeling the repercussions of a case that went tragically wrong, leaving her reputation in tatters. When little Ruby Winter arrives at her house one night, brought by the police, Cat discovers that the girl is the result of a one-night stand her husband had with a woman who has died unexpectedly. She agrees to take Ruby in, but soon suspects there is something very wrong with the girl, and that she may pose a danger to her own daughter, Freya. But could it just be paranoia? McGrath expertly ratchets up the tension for a multi-layered, intelligent mystery with an ending that will have your heart racing.In recent years, there have been several successful crime fiction plots focusing on loss of memory, including  by SJ Watson (amnesia) and  by Alice LaPlante (Alzheimer＊s). Felicia Yap＊s debut novel,  (Wildfire, ?12.99), employs the device in a dystopian setting: England, 2015, where a protein responsible for long-term memory is genetically inhibited for some at 23 and others at 18. This has created a two-tier society, composed of the elite ※Duos§, who have two-day memories, and the ※Mono§ remainder, who can only remember one day. Both are expected to get around this problem by keeping diaries as reminders. This is an ingenious and intriguing premise; unfortunately, the characters＊ ability to remember the ※facts§ stored in these diaries for longer periods rather undermines it, as do the unimaginative revenge narrative, cartoonish characterisation and stilted prose.

"Of the uncountable reality conceits that have blighted television schedules, it does seem weird that nobody has thought of this one before: putting people through the definitive physical and psychological test of astronaut selection. Among the tasks this week are simulated space-station docking and even speed origami, all overseen by former International Space Station commander Chris Hadfield. Explorer Levison Wood is an engaging mixture of courageous and curious. He＊s happy to camp in woods and neck vodkas by the dozen. But he＊s capable of negotiating the geopolitical currents of the places he visits, too. This trip is taking him across the Caucasus, through states that have barely recovered from the fall of communism. Expect a riotous travelogue punctuated by unnerving cameos from the Russian secret police. It is hard to imagine that JK Rowling＊s crime novels 每 written under her Robert Galbraith pseudonym 每 would have made it to TV had her cover not been blown. Tom Burke has a brooding charm as the titular detective, but some of the dialogue here is a bit boilerplate. This concluding episode begins with a flashback to the incident that saw Strike lose part of his leg, and 每 as they home in on Lula＊s killer 每 Robin comes under pressure. As if to cement the notion that jealousy can envelop absolutely anyone, Victoria becomes increasingly concerned that Albert＊s interest in female mathematician Ada Lovelace is about more than her scientific prowess. However, a greater cause for worry sweeps the palace upon the realisation that the young queen is expecting a second child. Life below stairs is equally untranquil, as superstition spreads that a ghostly presence has invaded the kitchens. As a poetic corrective to a partition that tore India apart, tonight＊s Prom aims to celebrate precisely the opposite: music＊s power to heal and to unify. There are performances from three separate classical traditions: Hindustani music from northern India, carnatic music from the south, and qawwali, devotional music from the Pakistani Sufi tradition, given much exposure in the west via the great Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. The return, for a third series, of the primary school answer to University Challenge. Susan Calman lobs questions at teams of kids, drawing on general knowledge and pop culture as well as proper educational stuff from the national curriculum. The fun part is when each school puts up a teacher for a much harsher quickfire spotlight round. Hoping to progress from this opening heat are Willow Brook from east London and, from the Caithness coast, Lybster. Even if you don＊t believe all pop stars are narcissists trying to fill the holes in their souls with the empty trappings of fame, the idea of celeb musicians undergoing therapy on camera sounds like a sketchy premise. Thankfully, LA-based guru Siri Sat Nam Singh is a calm, quizzical dude, capable of putting his famous clients at ease. In this illuminating session, rapper Freddie Gibbs 每 who was falsely accused of rape, and imprisoned for it 每 opens up about his personal and legal issues. The delightful and poignant conclusion to the game-changing animated trilogy tugs ever harder on the heartstrings, confronting that bittersweet time when youngsters put away childish things. When Andy heads for college, Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack) and the other toys are accidentally dispatched to the daycare centre-cum-nightmare prison. Cue a triumphant adventure about love, loyalty and a megalomaniac teddy bear. An old-fashioned, somewhat ponderous, biblical epic in the tradition of Cecil B DeMille＊s Ten Commandments. Christian Bale is a noble Moses, getting into a fearful family squabble with his brother, the pharaoh Ramses (a heavily eyelined Joel Edgerton) when leading his people out of Egypt. The special effects are stunning, from the parting of the Red Sea to the plagues 每 notably the creeping horror of the death of the firstborn. This US remake of the haunting Swedish vampire movie Let the Right One In loses some of the original＊s sly humour in favour of a horror fix. But with teen superstars in Kodi Smit-McPhee (of The Road) as the troubled 12-year-old boy, and Chlo? Grace Moretz (Kick-Ass) as the vampire who befriends him, the sweet, youthful emotion survives alongside the bloodlust.

"acbeth＊s horse is a skeleton on wheels, chalk-white and bionic. His wife sleepwalks across a squad of automated hospital beds, sheets bloodied. Birnam Wood is no green forest but a cluster of prickly pears from a hot, dry land not obviously on the road to Dunsinane.

It＊s back for the festival＊s 70th anniversary in a new staging by the Sicilian director, writer and actor Emma Dante, performed by the  as part of the company＊s two-opera residency ( is being staged this weekend).Heavy with symbolism, including a head-banging corps of twerking witches impregnated by tumbling satyrs and a murdered Duncan portrayed as the dead Christ, it may be tortuous. True, the fan-like gold crowns dangling from on high, each constructed from 19 splayed spears, do look like sunrise bedheads. Yet the action, on a near-empty stage, manages to be potent and direct, thanks chiefly to the musical wizardry of .There was some doubt that the Italian maestro, an incomparable Verdi conductor, would recover from an emergency back operation in time for this Edinburgh stint. Fortunately he did. Despite some stiffness when he took his bow, this most acrobatic of artists drew exciting vigour and intensity from soloists, chorus and orchestra.By mixing the 1847 original with the 1865 revision, Noseda maximises the dramatic and musical impact. You win and lose, as in most operas with more than one version, but this Turin staging 每 a co-production with Palermo and Macerata 每 was alive with conviction. Verdi＊s 10th opera and his first Shakespeare has no let-up. and , longer-breathed operas in form and structure, would follow much later. This early-period work is blunt, episodic, awkward in the libretto by Francesco Maria Piave (with additions by Andrea Maffei), but full of force and dark, turbulent energy.The Slovak baritone Dalibor Jenis had the right vocal beauty and brawn for the title role but never left any doubt that Anna Pirozzi＊s Lady Macbeth was in charge. The Neapolitan soprano, who will share the role with Anna Netrebko , combines accuracy with steely, rasping ferocity as the role demands. Banquo (Marko Mimica) led a robust supporting ensemble, all rising to their moments in the spotlight, notably Macduff (Piero Pretti) in his lament for his dead wife and children. The chorus of Scottish exiles, staged in darkness with faces scarcely visible, sang that great cry for liberation, Patria oppressa, with absolute precision and, after a whispered start, all the force they could muster.Verdi tends to get a critical drubbing for : too melodramatic, too rough-hewn and unsubtle. At his first attempt he still hadn＊t yet written those two landmark works  (1851) and (1853). Yet there is so much thrilling music here, much of it contained in the short prelude: first a mysterious woodwind melody, then a threatening interruption from the brass, followed by a soft staccato response from the strings and a hellish shriek from flutes and piccolos 每 the drama＊s every mood, from sinister to violent to illusory, contained in less than 20 bars. The orchestra of the Teatro Regio has this music in its sinews. So too does Noseda.Now that the  has been admitted into the mainstream for the second year running, deservedly, with its , we shouldn＊t forget that its activities run at , on the disused top four floors of Peckham municipal car park, all summer, and independently, drawing audiences you don＊t see at mainstream concerts.

"s it comedy, or a spirited child let loose on a dressing-up box? In ＊ Swan, it is not always easy to tell. The show 每 a one-woman-plus-puppets rehash of Swan Lake 每 is almost aggressively winsome. A graduate of ＊s clown school, Lyons delivers it all in wide-eyed Franglais, while dressed in a party-shop parrot costume. ※Quoi?§ as she might say. ※Quoi not?§ You could parse the show for satire on the gender politics of ballet, or for its supposed insights into Lyons＊ mental health (※I＊m on Prozac!§). But in fact this is dottiness for the sake of celebratory dottiness, an hour of our time (and many more of hers) dedicated to complete nonsense 每 which Lyons just about justifies.Lyons is open about the daftness of the undertaking, admitting that the garbled sub-French might be a bad idea, sending up the shabbiness of this prop or that mistimed cue. The evil Von Rothbart is played by Lyons dressed as a shark. The Queen is a suitcase talking through a flapping zippered mouth. The fellow swans of tragic heroine Odette (※Tr豕s belle but un petit peu of a plank§) are mops waggled by the audience.It＊s a kind of tightrope walk, whereby Lyons＊ charm alone prevents us looking down to the vast emptiness beneath. Yes, there＊s some fun to be had with ballet convention; the male characters are forever lifting her female characters and plonking them unceremoniously downstage. And there is a running joke in which Elf keeps being reminded of her relationship with her mum. (I preferred her ex-girlfriend Juliette, a haughty French caricature reincarnated as the scheming black swan, Odile.) More often, it＊s the silly set pieces that sustain Swan: a sultry faux-striptease of disgorged bras and fairy lights; glances exchanged between Lyons and a crocodile hand-puppet to a soundtrack of Jacques Brel.I＊m not sure how much the Franglais helps. It signals Lyons＊ commitments to her singular ideas, but it also restricts the range of expression available to her. The show can never be other than quirky and cute. Some have found that cuteness hard to stomach, and I sympathise. But as Lyons says: ※If you don＊t find me funny, you have to admit I＊d make an amazing imaginary friend.§ On that point, she＊s right. I didn＊t find Swan laugh-a-minute, but an hour in her company is certainly a memorable way to pass the time. At , Edinburgh, until 28 August.

" long line of sharpened knives have already been out in force for this one. Perhaps for a legitimate reason. Perhaps not. But before a frame of Netflix＊s ambitious franchise-starter had even been completed, there was widespread anger over what was seen as a whitewashed take on unavoidably Japanese source material. Asian and Asian American actors have long been de-prioritized in Hollywood, and this latest example was seen as yet another insult after the recent instances Ghost in the Shell, Doctor Strange and The Great Wall.Death Note, a multi-strand saga spawned from a manga series that＊s led to movies, video games and a TV show in Japan, has always seemed like prime real estate for a US intervention (rights were purchased by Warner Bros in 2009 and at one point Shane Black was attached). There＊s a juicy wish fulfillment concept that＊s easily tweakable for sequels and a wise-cracking villain who leaps out from the screen further than most of his contemporary peers. In trying to translate so much mythology into just one 100-minute movie, an awful lot is lost but given the sorry state of the horror genre, even the vaguest of glimmers is worth something.Light Turner (Nat Wolff) is a high schooler living in the background. He＊s picked on at school, largely friendless and still hasn＊t forgiven his cop father for failing to bring his mother＊s killer to justice. So when one day a mysterious notepad quite literally falls into his hands, emblazoned with the words ※Death Note§, he＊s eager for whatever change it might bring. After flipping open the pages, he＊s greeted by Ryuk (voiced by Willem Dafoe), a death demon who informs him of the power that＊s new been bestowed upon him: if Light writes someone＊s name in the book, they will die.Initially starting off small (so long, school bullies!), Light starts to expand the death toll, with the help of overeager classmate Mia (Margaret Qualley). The pair become avenging angels, targeting those who have harmed others and their global killing spree soon grabs the attention of eccentric detective L (Lakeith Stanfield) who is determined to uncover the method behind all of the madness.What＊s initially noteworthy about Death Note is that it＊s a proud, flashy member of Netflix＊s latest wave of slick, bigger-budget original movies and it lands amid mixed company. While Okja dazzled, War Machine fizzled and Death Note arguably lands somewhere between the two. Director Adam Wingard (inexplicably adored for overstylized throwback thrillers You＊re Next and The Guest, and understandably loathed for his regrettable Blair Witch sequel/reboot/assault) has a nifty eye for the macabre and, working on a larger scale than ever before, he successfully creates a distinctive universe to house the mayhem at play. The setup allows for a series of frantic Final Destination-esque set-pieces and unlike this summer＊s shoddy, similarly themed Wish Upon, there＊s no teen friendly rating restraining Wingard from going full Grand Guignol with the gore. As Light gets accustomed, and soon addicted, to his nihilistic superpower, there＊s fun for the viewer in the art of his discovery although the relentless pace soon becomes problematic. While not hampered by certification, Wingard is held back somewhat by the framework of a film. There＊s enough here for a 10-part series, not hugely surprising given the breadth of Death Note material that＊s come before, and rather than making us eager for a sequel, we＊re left breathless and frustrated that so much of the establishing narrative has been so carelessly rushed (one particular montage is so stuffed with intriguing imagery that it demands a rewind).The runaway plot also means that the characters are left frequently underserved, shifts in motivation and morality happening within the blink of an eye. The young cast manage well enough, with Short Term 12 and Atlanta breakout Stanfield of particular interest (his shadowy, sleep-deprived pursuer deserving of his own origins tale), but they deserve more than what they＊ve been left to work with. The finale in particular, despite an ambitious set piece, doesn＊t really gel, the swell of emo romance proving to be less tasty than the reckless horror that came before.The decision to relocate the action to the US, using a cast of almost universally non-Asian actors (Paul Nakuchi is a rare exception), has arrived at an unfortunate time for an industry that really should be doing better to improve inclusivity but, if anything, it recalls the many J-horror remakes that landed around the early 00s. Similarly, the attempts to translate some of the more location-specific elements of the original land with a thud (Light＊s codename is Kira, explained away here clumsily) yet the other idiosyncrasies do end up differentiating it from so many other teen-led horror films of late (Dafoe＊s apple-munching demon is a particular delight).Death Note is likely to find a warm welcome from Netflix＊s teen contingent, who also helped to make 13 Reasons Why one of the service＊s biggest hits. Horror fans will also find Wingard＊s stylish, gruesome direction a plus. But whether hardcore fans of the original will warm to the update is questionable. Given the more detailed adaptations that have come before, there＊s arguably little added here. In their latest stab at a blockbuster,  have failed to understand that sometimes more is more.																																											"

"Once upon a time, nine-year-old bookworms used to curl up with , or burrow under the bedclothes with a torch to read  after hours. Childhood reading was an idyll in a walled garden and books forever shaped the landscape of our minds.Did that golden age ever exist? One thing is certain: in troubled times the nation＊s reading habits have become a lightning rod for parental pessimism about video games and the end of civilisation as we know it. There is, however, a silver lining to these clouds.This week, as Britain＊s schoolchildren creep like snails back to the classroom, fretful parents can take heart from statistics that demonstrate a mini-boom in juvenile reading. In 2016, for example, sales of children＊s titles rose 16% to ?365m, an increase attributable to the buying of printed books.Forget the merchants of doom. According to : ※Children are now reading more and want to read print.§ This is confirmed by the Publishers Association, which recently reported that book sales for the previous year had jumped 7% to ?4.8bn, and data suggests that this has been driven by that whopping 16% jump in revenues from children＊s publishing.More significant still, as e-book sales fell by 3%,  that ※Britons are abandoning the e-book at an alarming rate, as ＆screen fatigue＊ helped fuel a five-year high in printed book sales.§ Moreover, for the first time since records began, nearly ?1 in every ?4 spent on print titles is on a children＊s book, a market share of 24%.The boom in children＊s lit has begun to have a tangible impact on adult bookshops. In the words of James Daunt, chief executive of Waterstones: ※We have been seriously increasing the amount of space we give to children＊s titles.§Those children＊s books that outperform all other genres are seen to prop up the publishing industry. On this analysis, bestselling David Walliams, described by some commentators as ※the new Roald Dahl§, is now as important as any Booker prize winner and the heir to JK Rowling＊s success.Another symbol of a rejuvenated children＊s book market is a self-styled ※kaleidoscope of creative genius for kids§, the magazine , a startup based in Dalston, east London, which the author Neil Gaiman has described as ※the kind of magazine I wish we＊d had when I was?eight§. is the idea of the writer Vita Sackville-West＊s great-granddaughter, the publisher Clementine Macmillan-Scott. A year ago, hers looked like a quixotic venture fraught with jeopardy. But, against the odds for little magazines,  has survived. Chris Riddell, the former children＊s laureate and  cartoonist, has called it ※the perfect accompaniment to the beautiful books we see on our shelves§.Macmillan-Scott said: ※I really wasn＊t certain we would get to this point, but we are now approaching our first birthday.§ She links the magazine＊s fortunes to a dynamic market and reports that ※through the hundreds of children, parents and teachers we speak to at our workshops, we know that children are greedy for storytelling.§The  story illustrates the resilience of print and paper in the face of the digital revolution. Inspired by an Edwardian model, Arthur Mee＊s ,  is a mix of crusade and creativity. Establishment heavyweights such as the playwright Tom Stoppard, plus children＊s writers such as Raymond Briggs, author of , have adopted its cause. The magazine has also given space to 10-year-old writers and pays all contributors, high and low, the same rate 每 10p a word.It＊s a winning formula. Macmillan-Scott reports ※a quarterly sales increase of roughly 150% every issue§, but is cautious about her good fortune. ※It＊s all too clear to us that these children are hungry for print.§ One of the biggest secondary schools in Hackney, east London, has just ordered 300 copies of for its Year 7s. There＊s also been an approach from Great Ormond Street hospital. focuses on the most lucrative sector of the children＊s market, Britain＊s eight to 12-year-old readers. In literary culture, this is the crucial bridge between toddlers and adolescents and its publisher knows it. Macmillan-Scott is committed to listening to readers aged eight to 12, who have an editorial board where they can express their ideas about the magazine. ※If we don＊t get these children reading,§ she says, ※we will lose out on adult readers. To be fully literate, you have to start as a child.§Macmillan-Scott disputes the suggestion that reading is in decline. ※If you look at our figures,§ she counters, ※you＊ll find that children do read and that  is part of a craze for reading hardback books. Kids love paper and print. They might play games on a digital device, but they prefer not to read on a Kindle. The real market for e-books is among YA [young adult] readers.§ Some of her evidence is anecdotal, but her sales figures and readership surveys support a picture of eight to 12s immersed in books.※What our research shows beyond question,§ she says, ※is that children have a love for reading that＊s not seriously threatened by other kinds of entertainment. Reading for pleasure is a very real thing at this age, and the worries that some adults have about children losing interest in reading are simply not grounded in reality.§Addictive digital games do not trouble Macmillan-Scott. She concedes that ※video games are incredibly sophisticated now and very appealing, especially to boys. But they have been around for at least 25 years and have not taken the place of reading. Books and magazines offer an alternative to the screen. Our surveys show that reading books is still desirable.※Besides,§ she adds, ※kids who were born after the millennium don＊t see a conflict between old media and digital. They just love the written word, in whatever form.§In this, these new juvenile readers are at one with the adult market. As the  has often noted, this is a golden age of reading in an unprecedented number of formats. ＊s editor, Sarah Odedina, says, ※kids judge books like their parents. They＊re looking for strong characters,?a great plot, good sentences?and a satisfying resolution.?Now isn＊t that as old?as the hills ?§																																											"
"From  versus  to  v  the BBC and ITV have a long history of  against each other. that rivalry will resume as?the BBC＊s bleak detective series  faces off against a psychological thriller, .This time, however, there is a twist: both shows are written by Harry and Jack Williams, the team behind the critically acclaimed  每 and they are as surprised as anyone to find that their main competition is themselves.※It is very weird for us,§ says Jack. ※We didn＊t know how we felt about it at first because you＊re competing against yourself. I got a bit worried about it but then Harry said to me, ＆You do know that people can just watch both at different times these days?＊§The sons of the novelist and screenwriter, Nigel Williams, Jack and Harry have become big names in television. Their intense and complex , which followed French detective Julien Baptiste over two series and two different missing child cases, has been joined by their increasingly successful production company , which made the hit comedy , in addition to and .※I think the main thing [about  and ] is that they＊re very different shows so I＊m mainly just curious to see how each one goes down,§ says Harry. ※The next morning will be very interesting, to say the least.§It＊s certainly true that the shows are worlds apart in tone and structure. The gripping  (the title is killer backwards) begins at the end of its story with the capture of a serial killer before unspooling to uncover why the crimes occurred and how everyone came to this place. It＊s bleak, dark and very tricky unravelling not only the main storyline backwards but also all the individual relationships the characters have with each other.By contrast, is a tense, topical tale of possible date rape, starring Joanne Froggatt and Ioan Gruffudd, in which both leads＊ accounts appear plausible and viewers are left unsure exactly who to believe.※In some ways  is the one that＊s most different from the things we＊ve written before,§ says Harry. ※We＊d written  for two seasons and then  and so we＊d done a lot of dramas with complicated structures and shifting timelines and wanted to try something that was a bit simpler and a bit more character-focused in some ways.§  was ※so complicated and intense and so hard to crack in terms of how you tell that story§, says Jack. ※Just before we went in to pitch it I said to Harry, ＆We can＊t tell this story because it has no consequences 每 don＊t pitch it＊. We went in and pitched four ideas which were all pretty bad and then Harry pitched  and they said, ＆Let＊s do that one＊.※Two days into the writing he turned to me and said, ＆There＊s no consequences, it can＊t be done.＊ I just said, ＆I fucking know ＃ that＊s what I told you.＊§The brothers are adamant, however, that viewers of  will not be left too confused. ※We＊re acutely aware how complicated it is so there are little bits in each episode to lighten that,§ says Harry. ※It shouldn＊t feel like homework. It should be entertaining.§And for all Rellik＊s unusual structure and dark subject matter  may yet be the show that causes more controversy. Did they worry about centring their story on an alleged rape?※We spoke to a rape counsellor while writing it to make sure that it felt authentic and truthful,§ says Jack. ※It＊s a psychological thriller and not an issue-led show but we were very aware that it was a sensitive subject and needed to be tackled carefully.§They chose sexual assault as a subject because ※there seemed to be so many of these cases where it came down to what each person said and what became interesting was the idea of what does the person themselves believe happened and how two people can view an event in very different ways§.That said, while there might be twists and turns through the series there is only one liar. ※We did definitely know which of them is lying and we knew what the ending would be,§ says Harry.Which of the two shows do they prefer? ※It would be dangerous to take sides,§ says Harry. ※They＊re so different that I do think if you watched them both you wouldn＊t have any idea that we＊d written both of them.※They＊re both us trying something new.§																																											"
"y father wasn＊t effusive with his love. At least not in the way my mother is. Or I am. My siblings and I lived with the comforting and affirming knowledge that he loved us 每 and if there＊s one single thing you could ask from your father, apart from a trust fund, it＊s this 每 but, when it came to Dad, cuddles, kisses and other acts of physical intimacy were rarely instigated by him.He＊d always acquiesce when we nuzzled up to his barrel chest, or kissed his bearded cheek, or slipped under his arm as he lay in bed on one of those gloriously indolent Sunday mornings. And some evenings as he watched TV he＊d induce us to sit on his shoulders so we could massage his bald patch. ※It will stimulate the follicles and the hair will grow back,§ he explained, keeping a straight face. We didn＊t care that he had a bald patch but the task meant we＊d get to watch more TV, so I＊d go to bed later than usual with the comforting smell of his scalp on my fingers. Despite all that I often had a sense that Dad remained forever surprised, or at times even embarrassed, by the physical manifestation of our affection for him. I share Dad＊s reserve, and his tendency to introversion 每 one that meant his emotional universe was one you＊d frustratingly only get glimpses of, as if from the pointy end of a telescope. If I＊m similar to my father in this regard 每 though I try not to be 每 I differ in that, for me, it feels like the most natural thing in the world to tell my children I love them and to further express that love through physical affection. It＊s a vital part of the way I＊ve bonded with my daughters, aged seven and 10. There＊s a time when this sort of thing comes to its natural end, and I can sense its approach now like the smell of rain in the air, so I＊m hungry for what I can get before we enter a new phase of our lives together. One that I assume will involve, on their parts, much more eye-rolling than hand-holding. So until then we hug, we kiss, we spill over each other on the couch, we wrestle and tickle until they scream for me to stop and when I do, they beg me to start back up again. I chase them down the hallway, roaring, and they flee, screaming, and not entirely for dramatic effect, before jumping on my bed. When I catch them up, I toss them about and I experience an extension of my own sense of proprioception to know where their flipping and turning bodies are in space at any given moment. If I＊m not pinning their shoulders to the mattress and dramatically counting out ※One! Two! Three!§ I＊m pretending to suddenly fall asleep mid-wrestle 每 the kind of deep sleep you＊d fall into during your child＊s school music concert without your partner＊s elbow in your ribs. This leaves them battling and struggling to get out from under my dead weight.If they ever have to muscle a corpse into the boot of a car, they＊ll have some experience to call upon. If I leave them with nothing else, they＊ll have that.My ease with physical intimacy with my daughters is a gift from my tactile mother but it may have happened anyway. With me being a freelance writer, it made sense that when my partner＊s two maternity leave stints came to an end she would return to the responsibility and burden of being the main breadwinner and I would take on the larger share of the at-home duties. This meant fitting my writing around the kids, the washing machine, the stove, excursions to the supermarket, the park, and not the other way around. Ten years on, I know well the toil at-home parenting involves and, at times, the negativity it spawns. Conditioned as a man to believe that the only work of any value is the kind that furthers you intellectually, creatively and, in particular, financially, I regularly endure periods where I devalue myself and entertain the notion that I am wasting time, treading water, not contributing. I＊ve felt that many times, usually in the periods between the publication of my articles or books, as if only these paid accomplishments are of value, and not the rearing of, and all the time spent with, happy, contented children who hum as they eat their dinner, who curl into you when you still read to them at night long after they＊ve learnt to read themselves.Hand in hand with that comes the self-doubt that all parents entertain. Am I doing a good job with my children? Am I devoting enough time to them? Am I doing whatever I＊m doing for their sake and not mine? Am I taking out my frustrations on them? Am I doing too much dictating and not enough facilitating? Am I screwing them up more than is normal? Amid it all, I watch all the lovely moments, the little things, come and go knowing they＊ll soon be forgotten, and I mourn their passing. Fortunately this fog always lifts, and I see that for all the Groundhog Day inevitability of another dinner to make, another school lunch to pack, another load of washing to hang out, raising kids is not just a necessary job but a noble, rewarding enterprise. It＊s humbling, too, especially since your children can＊t comprehend it. When my youngest, Ada, returned from school recently to find there was no bread in the house she asked, with some irritation: ※What have you been  all day?§ Not until your children have children of their own will they realise. To be alive for that moment is as good a reason for any parent to live a long life.Being an at-home parent makes intimacy with your children all but impossible to avoid 每 even if you＊re not of the school of parents who＊ll sniff a pair of kids＊ underpants they find on the floor to see whether they are clean or dirty; a parent＊s version of Russian roulette. In those first 10 or so years of being a parent, especially, one＊s previously well-maintained fortifications of personal space and sanctity are torn down and tossed on a bonfire.I read recently that the stereotype of the strict, aloof Victorian father is not fully deserved. Nevertheless it seems uncontroversial to state that, historically, the vast majority of fathers avoided cleaning up the steady stream of shit, piss, pus, spit, phlegm, blood, vomit and whatnot that goes along with raising a dependent human being. They never dragged nit combs through their child＊s hair or lanced their boils or cut their nails or brushed their teeth or patched up their cuts and scrapes or even wiped their tears away with a swipe of the thumb. Instead, it was accepted that as all this was going on in another room, they could sit in their dens with their newspapers and glasses of Scotch and get on with the important business of being a man. But that was then. Like many other fathers, I know I＊m up to my elbows in it. In some ways I＊ve revelled in it.When my daughter, Abbie, was about six months old, I sucked snot from her nose when every other effort to relieve her considerable discomfort failed. Standing in the doorway of her bedroom, where the soft light from the hallway illuminated her distress, I cradled her in my arms, clamped my lips around her tiny snout and sucked as if trying to syphon petrol through a snaking length of hose. Unfortunately 每 or fortunately 每 my efforts were more or less unsuccessful. Having steeled myself for a foul onrush, I managed only to extract a viscous dollop of something or other. Abbie＊s nose remained blocked, if a little shinier.When, later, I told people of what I＊d done, I was acknowledging, to myself, to others, the element of stunt to the whole affair. Yet at the same time I was sharing a story that I hoped would graphically illustrate the depths of my love and, in lieu of a careening bus in front of which to throw myself, the sacrifices I was willing to make for my children. Remember that, Abbie, when you visit me in the nursing home.If any man has a yearning to be a father, I wasn＊t one of them. As a boy I always figured, I＊d have children at some point in my life because 每 like watching the news, laughing loudly at dinner parties, and getting angry behind the wheel of a car 每 that＊s what adults did. But even as I grew into a man I never longed to have children with the kind of primal, biological ache we attribute to women whether it applies to them or not. Like most other men, then, when it came to the decision about the best time to start a family, I ceded to the imperative of my partner, rather than my own.The irony, then, is that from the moment Abbie was dragged into the world at the end of a pair of forceps, I was smitten. She was puffy-eyed, bruised and bloody, and her head resembled a missile, but I was happier than I＊d ever been in my life and my tears fell on her face as I leaned in to kiss her. ※Hello, my darling,§ I said to her, and I＊ve been saying the same thing to her 每 and then Ada 每 every morning, and plenty of afternoons too, for the past 10 years.Similarly, I＊ve spent that time impressing myself upon them, hoping to make a good impression in their lives as my father made in mine, though I go about it in my own way. A hug and kiss here, a fatherly stunt there.Only last week I placed a ladder on top of Ada＊s bed mattress so that I could climb to reach a switch on a ceiling fan. Of course I should have moved the bed out of the way first but it＊s heavy and cumbersome and that wouldn＊t have been at all entertaining. So despite my daughters＊ protestations 每 ※I＊m telling Mum,§ Ada warned 每 they were good enough to hold the ladder for me. And as the mattress moved under the ladder, as I swayed like a sailor in the riggings, I could see them down there on the poop deck, their little faces showing such signs of worry, illicit pleasure, and love as to make the whole exercise a roaring success.

"amous Hollywood actor Vera Lockman has not worked in months but she＊s not lost her audience; the public comes to her. Her New York loft apartment is like Grand Central station, criss-crossed by writers and cops and her mum and her granddad, plus a gun-toting ex-boyfriend who can＊t decide whether to kill her or kiss her. Amateur psychiatrists take note. Maybe this isn＊t her apartment at all. Maybe it＊s, like, an existential projection, the exploded set of her subconscious, a private life laid bare for all to see.If there＊s anything approaching an outright villain in this tale, it is surely Gun-Toting Ex-Boyfriend, who had the chance to pull the trigger and end the drama and then was promptly shot himself. This leaves the rest of to sit through the indulgent, free-associating The Private Life of a Modern Woman as Vera (played with a commendably straight face by Sienna Miller) dumps his body in the Hudson and then prepares to face the music and yes, quite literally, dance. The remainder of the film plays out as a series of visitations and lengthy exchanges. Here comes  as Detective McKutcheon of the NYPD. And now here＊s Charles Grodin, actually rather good as her grandpa with dementia, constantly confusing the apartment for a restaurant and wondering who the hell owns it.Then there are the other, less tangible visitations; the ghosts and demons that rear up to grab Vera. Time and again she suffers sudden, jarring flashbacks to that dreadful night with Gun-Toting Ex-Boyfriend. On other occasions the film＊s dialogue is all-but drowned out by Shostakovich＊s Leningrad Symphony No 7, cranked up to full volume, to the point where I half wondered whether Vera might be sitting on the remote.The Private Life of a Modern Woman is written and directed by James Toback, a once-talented iconoclast now largely fighting shadows. You can see him in the film, presumably playing himself and subjecting Vera to a long journalistic grilling. He asks about what she＊s been working on and when we can expect to see her back on screen and excitably speculates that she might have some secret life on the side. He asks, ※Are you depressed?§ and, ※Do you ever think about committing suicide?§ That＊s the question I always leave until last in my own interviews but props to James Toback 每 he throws it right there in the middle and doesn＊t even get shown the door.Toback＊s film is defiantly rough-edged and loose, still wet from workshopping; a trail of half-formed ideas. That＊s fine as it goes 每 a necessary antidote to the bland uniformity of the average studio picture. But it＊s it＊s a perilous tightrope walk, ensuring that these kind of films ultimately hold together. One step out of place and the film cheesewires itself, loses all shape and logic. The Private Life of a Modern Woman hits the ground in a mass of wet, bloody pieces. A few of these cuts are not without interest. As for the rest, they can go straight in the bin.																																											"

It is glowing, gregarious music and was one of Rameau＊s most popular pieces during his lifetime. This new recording from  and his French baroque specialists Les Talens Lyriques demonstrates why. The playing is sumptuous, broad and vibrant. Cyrille Dubois sounds rapt and vigorous as Pygmalion, a natural for Rameau style, which is as much about acting as singing. C谷line Scheen is more piquant as the statue. We also get a graceful, earthy performance of Rameau＊s orchestral suite Les F那tes de Polymnie.																																											"
"The summer of love is perhaps most closely associated with San Francisco＊s hippy movement, which reached its zenith in 1967, but a similar phenomenon was seen in many other parts of the world that year, particularly in .It was a summer during which Procol Harum released , The Beatles put out All You Need is Love, and Pink Floyd were playing psychedelic gigs at the UFO Club in Tottenham Court Road.The small patch of of green dotted with park benches in the middle of Mayfair is one of the West End＊s most expensive and exclusive areas. The square was named after John Berkeley, 1st Lord of Berkeley of Stratton, who took possession of the land to the north of his newly acquired house in Piccadilly in 1675.One of the large plane trees opposite Berkeley House was estimated in 2008 to be worth ?750,000.The shopping street in the West End is . Carnaby Street was pedestrianised in the 1970s and is still a major shopping street home to more than 50 independent restaurants and bars and 150 shops.Lord John, which opened its first store on the street, went on to become an international chain of menswear shops, which were eventually sold and became Next stores. Jimi Hendrix＊s iconic military jacket was bought in 1967 at a shop in the area called I was Lord Kitchener＊s Valet. Today the street is still home to brands such as the Dutch fashion label ST.studio. Running parallel to Carnaby Street, Newburgh Street forms the boundary of what is known as the Newburgh Quarter, where fashionable concept stores and classic tailors sit alongside traditional pubs such as the White Horse. Now pedestrianised and cobbled, back in 1967 it was a tarmacked road.Originally just a winding country path called Green Lane, the road took its name from Porto Bello Farm, in the area now known as Golborne Road. It in turn was named after the port of Portobelo in Panama, captured by the British from the Spanish in 1739.Portobello Road is famous for its weekend antiques market, which evolved after ※rag and bone§ men began selling their wares at the market in the 1940s. Though the surrounding areas were rapidly gentrified from the 1980s, the market retains its energy and charm.The square was established in 1670 and is named after Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester. Originally an upscale residential area, retail stores and theatres made their home there in the 19th century, many of which were converted to cinemas in the 20th century.It was refurbished extensively for the 2012 Olympics and has a park in its centre; in 1967 it was a roundabout. The Empire Theatre in the original 1967 photograph was showing Night Must Fall with .

The Tudor storefront was rebuilt in the 1920s from the timbers of the ships HMS Impregnable and HMS Hindustan. It is a Grade II*-listed building, which explains why little has changed.

" famously lives in a grand Georgian house on Royal Avenue in Chelsea, a Grade II-listed building that he was allowed, many years ago now, to alter internally, the better that its main room 每 the piazza, as he likes to call it 每 could be triple height and expansive enough for the riding of bicycles by small children. As anyone who has even glimpsed it from the road will attest, it＊s an amazing space, and in his new book, , Rogers makes much of its essential conviviality. It is, he writes, often used for parties, whether to benefit a charity or for an annual celebration of the architect of the Serpentine Pavilion in Hyde Park. By way of illustration, there follow some photographs. In one, taken at Christmas, some 30 paper-hatted people can be seen sitting down for lunch, yet still there is room beside the table to move, and perhaps even to dance.For the weekday visitor, however, the feeling of the place is not so much friendly as mildly intimidating 每 which makes me wonder all over again if architects have any idea at all of the effect of their buildings on other people. Having entered through a metal gate on an anonymous side door, I reach the piazza by means of some equally antiseptic open metal stairs. There, I＊m greeted by Luiza, who ※looks after the house§, after which I＊m left alone to contemplate the Philip Gustons, Cy Twomblys and Andy Warhols that hang on its walls. Except, I＊m not quite alone. From high on the mezzanine above 每 looking up, I＊m just about able to read the spine of Robert Hughes＊s  on a bookcase 每 comes the sound of papers being shuffled, and a cough or two. Is this power play, I wonder, as the seconds tick by. Down below, I start to feel rather small.But perhaps this is paranoia. When he appears, Rogers is all smiles. It is a sunny morning, and he meets it like a rainbow: green shirt, blue trousers, turquoise braces, orange socks, yellowish shoes. He walks stiffly, the result of a recent accident in a taxi, but he talks quickly 每 too fast, sometimes. At first, we sit at a round table from where my view, beyond his shoulder, is mostly of the lovely pots his late mother made, arranged in village-like clusters, little ceramic San Gimignanos all. But when his wife, Ruthie, returns and needs the kitchen for a magazine shoot to promote her latest cookbook (she, in case you don＊t know, is the chef-patron of the River Cafe in Hammersmith), we move to the flat downstairs where his in-laws once lived. ※This is where Renzo [Piano, the architect and Rogers＊s former collaborator] stays when he＊s in London,§ he says, grinning boyishly. ※He is my closest friend, practically my brother. As he used to say, we were the bad boys.§ isn＊t Rogers＊s first book: there have been several others. But while those were largely theoretical, manifestos for city living and a certain kind 每  kind 每 of architecture, this one is closer to a memoir. Naturally, it includes accounts (sometimes, unintentionally hilarious accounts) of the building of his greatest designs, among them the Pompidou Centre in Paris and the Lloyd＊s Building in the City of London; his battles with planners, politicians and Prince Charles are all given their place. His main focus, though, is on the people, places and times that have influenced his thinking over a long and successful career (he is now 84): his Italian parents; London, in the bleak years after the war, as well as in the 80s and 90s; his beloved Florence, Milan and Trieste; his one-time partner, Norman Foster; and, of course, Ruthie, ※his closest friend and intellectual partner§ and the woman to whom the book is dedicated.※It follows my life story,§ he says, ※which sounds a bit pompous but I＊ve always tried to communicate. I feel strongly there＊s more to architecture than architecture. It is about social responsibility, too, and politics. It was a pretty amazing time: the war, the creation of the welfare state＃ and now we＊re going through  In the 70s, when we built the Lloyd＊s Building, they were seriously thinking of moving to Frankfurt. And so, history repeats itself.§What effect is Brexit likely to have on his world? ※It is ridiculous. We＊re going to lose a very large part of the building workforce. Either houses are going to have to double in price, or we＊re going to have to find new ways of building them. The modern builder is only in it for profit. He is perfectly happy to build only one house if that means demand is increased. You can＊t ask him to change. So the government is going to have to do it.§Do what, exactly?※There is going to have to be more prefabrication, and people are going to have to pay more tax.§ It＊s his belief that people will be happy to do this. ※They tell us people don＊t want to pay more tax. But what they mean is that the rich don＊t want to pay more tax. The 1% doesn＊t want you to have a bigger house.§When he saw the images of the Grenfell Tower fire, it told him that ※the wealthy are all right: you don＊t see towers that are lived in by wealthy people go up in flames, only those of the poor§. Does he wish, then, that his practice had done more social housing? ※Well, we do a lot of work on prefabrication,§ he says. Rogers Stirk Harbour is, he adds, built on the idea of social responsibility: partners can＊t earn more than nine times the lowest paid employee after two years.Nevertheless, wasn＊t it uncomfortable to work on a project such as  that were developed by the Candy brothers, and which may be the most expensive such complex in the world? (There is no avoiding the fact that Rogers Stirk Harbour has, in recent years, .)※Yes, let＊s try that! That＊s a good one,§ he says, with a laugh that may or may not be intended to cover his irritation. ※No, it didn＊t really [feel uncomfortable]. One Hyde Park is a very rich area [in Knightsbridge, close to Harrods]. This wasn＊t a situation where you could either do social housing or private housing 每 you don＊t have a choice 每 and we did get a lot of social housing built in the postcode to go with One Hyde Park.§ (This, of course, is a little disingenuous. Seventy homes were indeed built as the development＊s affordable housing contribution, but they are two miles away, and the Candys were no more generous than they needed to be: under planning rules the development had to include 47% social housing.)He loves London, and marvels at the way it has changed. ※In the 70s, its population was down to 6 million, and everything was going wrong. Now it＊s arguably the greatest city in the world, an international place. It has great confidence. The spirits lift when you return to it, and in the end, all its problems are solvable.§ He won＊t pick out a favourite building 每 save for his own house, which he loves for the fact that it has the King＊s Road on one side and what he jokingly calls ※the countryside§ on the other (he means the grounds of Wren＊s magnificent Royal Hospital). But equally, he doesn＊t mind letting rip, just a little, when it comes to his dislikes. ※We all hate it,§ he says, of 20 Fenchurch Street (AKA the ※Walkie-Talkie§). ※One of the problems is that it is like a tombstone. And the view from the old Tate [at Millbank, on the north side of the Thames]＃ the buildings [apartments, mostly] are ghastly: awful, awful.§When it comes to London＊s skyline, however, he doesn＊t believe that height is what we should be worrying about. ※It＊s about bad buildings. One of the mistakes, if I may say so, is that the space around a building is as important as the building itself: the two can＊t be judged apart. The twin towers in New York, for instance. They weren＊t great buildings, but the space between them was.§It＊s an obvious question 每 and, in the minds of architects, doubtless an infantile one 每 but isn＊t the biggest problem still that architects are disconnected from the results of their designs, never having to live or work in them? I always think of Ern? Goldfinger, who spent two months living in Balfron Tower, the building he designed in Poplar, east London, in 1968, the better to evaluate the pros and cons of high-rise living 每 after which he scampered straight back to his lovely low-rise house in Hampstead.※Well, Goldfinger was a very good architect, by the way. But yes, I think there are many who are distant from the problem, and it isn＊t solved by living somewhere for a few months.§ Rogers has come to feel that ※parks and trees are a right§, and a relatively inexpensive one, to boot. ※I would hope that most architects know this,§ he says. ※But do they? You would know better than me.§When I don＊t answer 每 would it be rude to say that I＊m not sure they do? 每 he responds by asking, rather sweetly, if I would like a glass of wine.Rogers was born in Florence, still the city he knows best. ※I came from a rather spoilt, upper-middle-class family,§ he says. His father, Nino, was a doctor who had grown up in Venice, and his mother, Dada, was an art-lover from Trieste who had once been taught English by James Joyce. They were cultured, and highly cosmopolitan. ※I wasn＊t called Riccardo,§ he says. ※I was called Richard, which was a very strange thing. But my father, you see, was totally anglophile [Nino＊s father, a dentist, was a British emigre to Italy]. He didn＊t actually wear patches on the elbows of his jackets 每 which is something Renzo does 每 but in a way, he was more English than Italian. He always dreamt of England.§ Thanks to Mussolini, his dreams would become a reality sooner rather than later.In 1938, once it was clear that war was on the way, the family moved to England, swapping their elegant flat with views over the Florentine rooftops for a single room in a Bayswater boarding house with a coin meter for the heating and a bath in a cupboard 每 and so life switched to black and white.※It was hell at first,§ says Rogers. ※My dad arrived with only ?800 in his pocket. There was rationing. London was smoggy and cold. But＃ you have to be careful how you say this. Obviously, if someone in your family was killed in the war, that was one thing. But in a way, for us boys, it was a game [he has one brother]. We didn＊t know about the camps, and so on. And England has never since been healthier or its society more fair.§ Nevertheless, he felt his parents had let him down. On his first Christmas, his only present was a grey lead toy submarine.He hated Kingswood, the boarding school to which he was sent first, but was happier at St John＊s in Leatherhead (by now, the family had moved to Godalming in Surrey, and he could cycle there every day). Still, he struggled academically. ※I really was backward,§ he says. ※Dyslexia wasn＊t invented then, and I was called stupid.§ A private school in the 1940s, clenched and conservative, probably wasn＊t the place for him, ※though I mixed easily and, being a boxer, knew how to look after myself§. His politics, inherited from his parents, were leftist, and he shared their enthusiasm for modernism (visiting the Festival of Britain in 1951 with his mother, he marvelled at the way art and science came together in the Dome of Discovery). ※They were strict in some ways. But as a teenager, they didn＊t mind who I slept with, so long as she was there for breakfast. I was brought up to be free.§As soon as the war was over, he and his parents began spending their summers in Italy again, and at the age of 17, he began to travel alone. ※I was adventurous,§ he writes. ※I ran with the bulls in Pamplona, and dodged ticket collectors by hanging on the outside of trains; I spent a night in the cells in San Sebastian after being arrested by the Franco-ist Guardia Civil for swimming naked in the sea.§ One adventure nearly tipped into disaster, when he was arrested in Venice, supposedly for groping the wife of a man who＊d attacked him. (The two men fought, and Rogers again spent the night in the cells, his passport confiscated. Later, on the advice of the magistrate, he absconded, his grandfather having paid his bail 每 though not before two prostitutes he＊d met in jail had shown him around the city.)He left school in 1951, with no A-levels and no idea of what he wanted to do 每 and to buy himself time, he chose to do his national service immediately. Because he could speak Italian, he was posted to Trieste, then still under British and US military rule. What luck. His grandfather gave him a season ticket to the Trieste opera, and being in Italy meant he could also see more of his cousin, Ernesto Rogers, a noted modernist architect whose practice, BBPR, was in Milan. On periods of leave, he worked in the BBPR office. Once his service was complete, then, he somehow convinced the Architectural Association that even though he＊d failed his exams, he might be allowed to join its diploma course. He didn＊t draw well: by his own account, he still doesn＊t. But by the time he reached his final year, something had changed. He received the association＊s final-year prize for his project, a design for children with special educational needs in Wales.He met Su Brumwell, his first wife and the mother of three of his five sons, in his third year (she was doing a sociology degree at the LSE), and after their marriage in 1960, they travelled together to Yale, where he would take up a Fulbright scholarship to study for his master＊s degree. It was at Yale that he struck up a friendship with Norman Foster, also on a scholarship. Back in England, he and Su and Foster and his wife, Wendy Cheeseman, formed the firm Team 4, and  for Roger＊s parents-in-law, a dramatic concrete house in Cornwall that vaguely calls to mind Frank Lloyd Wright. He and Su also worked, a little later, on a home for his parents, Parkside in Wimbledon, comprising two brightly coloured single-storey pavilions with steel frames. Both are now listed.※I think I would have had a go at designing for the devil at that moment,§ he says, laughing. The Brumwells were, he says, the better clients. What about his parents? Can he remember the moment when they clapped eyes on the finished article? Did they love it? ※Well, yes and no. My father was more concerned with practical problems: I think he was about to sue by then. It was my mother who had the eye. She loved beauty and colour.§ Still, he learnt a lot from both projects: ※It took six architects six years to get Creek Vean built, as well as almost bankrupting both us and our in-laws. Not much was being done for society there, and it made us think: there must be a better way. We moved to easier construction systems, and highly flexible ones, too.§ Team 4, however, was dissolved in 1967.Rogers was introduced  by his doctor; they bonded immediately, and together they entered the competition to design a grand new cultural centre for Paris: the building that would become the Pompidou Centre. Having won it, they had no idea what it was that he was taking on. ※Young architects are immensely naive,§ he says. ※I would never dream of doing it now. We had a great client, but the press gave us hell. In seven years, there were only two positive articles. I don＊t know how we got to the end.§ Sonia Delaunay, an artist who was proposing to give a large collection of works to the museum, announced that she would rather burn her paintings than see them in the space he and Piano were designing; an elderly Frenchwoman, on discovering his identity as its architect, once hit him on the head with her umbrella. But everything changed once it opened. ※It was successful, even if we made very little money out of it.§Does he feel it blazed a trail, a forerunner of the ever more extraordinary museum buildings that have been built the world over ever since? He insists not. ※I think we were just making the building we had to: a loose container, a great big piazza, and a facade; a cross between Times Square and the British Museum.§By this point, he and Ruthie had met and had their first son. In his book, Su Rogers simply disappears, and before you know it, he＊s on Long Island marrying her replacement at the home of her left-leaning parents (Ruthie is American). But now he tells me how difficult his divorce was. ※The most painful thing I＊ve ever done. I had no reason to leave Su. I just happened to fall in love with Ruthie [they met at a dinner party in London, when she was studying at the London College of Printing]. It is very difficult because the person who＊s left behind loses their confidence.§ He and Su are, however, friends these days: ※She lived here for at least a year while she was doing up her house.§He and Ruthie, meanwhile, remain intensely close: in their presence, you can almost feel it. Since his practice moved to Leadenhall in the City from the building in Hammersmith that it shared with the River Cafe, it＊s her that he misses most: ※The spontaneous cups of coffee, asking her to look over a drawing, visiting the kitchen to taste a soup.§ He counts the day a ※disaster§ if he doesn＊t speak to her at least six times. They holiday every year in the Val d＊Orcia in Italy, and thanks to their extended family, there is rarely a bed free 每 though there will always be someone missing. In 2011, their youngest son, Bo, died of a seizure. ※There is no recovery from the death of a child,§ he writes in . Whenever they go away, he and Ruthie go up to their roof terrace, where an olive tree was planted in his memory, to say goodbye to him.After the chapter which recounts the building of the Pompidou Centre, his book loses momentum 每 though it＊s pretty funny when he describes, with a straight face, his disappointment when the board of Lloyd＊s refused to sign off his plan to commission a clock by the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely (you can hardly blame them: Tinguely had insisted that it would never tell the right time). He devotes too much energy to bemoaning the lack of vision of the supposed enemies of modern architecture, and not enough to addressing the matter of his own regrets (though when I ask him about this, he says: ※I don＊t know that I do regret a major piece of my professional life.§)His forays into politics are a bit irritating, too (Rogers, who joined the House of Lords as a Labour peer in 1997, has sat on several quangos, most famously the Urban Task Force; he was also an ally of Ken Livingstone during his time as the mayor of London). It is, for instance, extraordinary that he sees fit to praise John Prescott, the man who oversaw the obscenely wasteful and destructive  每 a blind spot that seems to be born only of the fact that, as environment secretary, Prescott pushed the recommendations of , a report Rogers helped to write.In conversation, though, the opposite is true: his energy is amazing, his stories growing ever less varnished as he goes on. ※How long have you got?§ he asks me. For a while, , and what Rogers regards as his chilling power over developers; they will, he says, use any excuse to lower their risk, including a daffy royal (the nearest he has ever got to debating with HRH was when he told him, after a dinner in 1984, that by his logic, Christopher Wren should have designed his extension to Hampton Court in a late medieval style to match the Tudor buildings rather than in his own baroque). But then, as he admits, there＊s always something. The architect＊s lot has never been a happy one. ※Things don＊t change,§ he says. As the dean of St Paul＊s told him at the opening of the Lloyd＊s Building in 1986, by the time Wren had been working on the cathedral for 30 or 40 years, he was so sick of people criticising him, he built an 18ft-high wattle fence to shield the works from prying eyes.※Every architect will sympathise with that story,§ he says. His voice, though, is rueful rather than self-pitying 每 as well it might be, given the splendour of our surroundings, the fact that the word ※masterpiece§ still appears so often next to his name.When we returned from the USA in 1963, Norman Foster, my wife Su and I had set up Team 4 with my ex-girlfriend Georgie Cheesman, and her sister Wendy. At first, we worked out of Wendy＊s bedroom in a two-room flat in Belsize Park. Frank Peacock, who had studied with me at the Architecural Association (literally alongside me, as our surnames made us neighbours in every class) and was a brilliant technician and draughtsman, built a box to put over Wendy＊s bed, so that we could use it as workspace during the day. When clients visited, friends would be roped in to pose as architects, to make Team 4 look like a larger concern than it was.As neither Norman nor I had completed our training, we were not entitled to call ourselves architects. Georgie had qualified and gave Team 4 some legitimacy, but she quickly saw that Norman and I were going to be impossible to work with, so moved on. The core of Team 4 was Norman and Wendy (who fell in love with each other and married), and Su and me. Norman and I did manage to complete our registration, but only after being summoned before the Architects＊ Registration Council for practising without a licence.Marcus Brumwell, Su＊s father, had asked us to look at the plans for renovating his holiday home on the banks of a Cornish creek by the Fal estuary. We soon decided, and persuaded our client, that he needed to demolish the existing house and start again. Our designs set up a dialogue between light and shadow, between the geometry of concrete blocks and soft contours of a creekside, between modern materials and sense of place.＃＃＃＃＃＃At the same time as Creek Vean, we were working on three houses at  in Camden. We were exhausted, putting in 14-hour days, seven days a week. It＊s not a good way to work, but we were young, and it was the culture we were used to from those late nights at Yale. I remember saying to Su that I didn＊t expect to ever have a whole weekend free, but that it would be nice to have just one Sunday off, maybe every other month.Where Creek Vean was exciting and tiring, Murray Mews was dispiriting. The clients had very different requirements or changed these over time: one of them, Naum Gabo＊s stepson Owen Franklin (our GP), wanted a bachelor pad full of art and sculpture at the outset, but had married and had children by the time the house was finished. His needs had changed, but the building had difficulty meeting these.The budgets were very low and the contractor was incompetent and keen to cut corners: everything leaked, walls weren＊t square, we discovered a small river running through the sunken dining room in Owen＊s house, and chimneys missed fireplaces. I remember one horrendous site visit with one of the clients. First of all he poked at a piece of what looked like asphalt, to discover it was just a copy of the  painted black. Then we went downstairs, where the U-bend of the lavatory was visible. The owner hit it to make a point, and it broke, showering him in sewage. Charlie Chaplin couldn＊t have done better. John Young, who had just joined us, prepared intricately detailed plans for tiling the bathrooms, showing how every tile would fit. These were ignored, and used to wrap fish and chips. I walked off site one day and went to sit under a tree on Hampstead Heath, and burst into tears. I wondered, not for the first or last time, whether I was really cut out to be an architect.＃＃＃＃＃＃We couldn＊t continue to work like this. Creek Vean and Murray Mews pushed us to fundamentally rethink our approach to technology and the process of construction. Technology is the raw material of architectural expression, the equivalent of words in poetry. Without a proper understanding of words there is no poetry, and architecture starts from an understanding of technology, materials, the process of construction and a sense of place. Norman and I were modernists, but were inspired by the amazing heritage of early industrial buildings, from  at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, to the incredible lightness and delicacy of Brunel and Paxton, who used iron, steel and glass 每 the hi-tech materials of their day 每 to create great station sheds, bridges, glass houses and crystal palaces.Norman and I had studied the use of manufactured components in Buckminster Fuller＊s work, in  and ＊s early designs, in the open-ended architecture of the , in ＊s prefabricated steel structures, and in modern industrial buildings and machinery. Though industrialisation had created countless new possibilities for building and construction, many of the buildings we saw in 1964, and see today, still use tools and techniques 每 bricks, mortar and timber frames 每 that have been used for 500 years or more. As Peter Rice, the Irish engineer who became an indispensable partner on the Pompidou Centre and so many other projects, liked to say, traditional techniques have been used so many times that you don＊t give them any thought; radical architecture has to start from first principles.Our experience with Creek Vean and Murray Mews had shown the limits of traditional technologies; the challenges of working with ※wet trade§ contractors 每 those deploying traditional techniques of bricks and mortar on site 每 even when they were competent; the time taken, and the risks of constructing fixed buildings for clients whose needs changed over the years. In 1969, a few years after we had completed these projects, I wrote a manifesto arguing for change. At a time when we needed 400,000 houses a year in the UK (a curiously similar challenge to  nearly 50 years later), it made no sense that it had taken six architects four years to build four houses. We wanted to create buildings that took advantage of industrialised technology, that were general-purpose not tailor-made, so that the same shell could cater for different clients＊ needs or for one client＊s needs changing over time.  and , the house we built for my parents in Wimbledon, were our first built expressions of this new direction.

"his is an undisputed jazz classic which every jazz lover should have, and this is the format in which it sounds best 每 in mono, with no distracting alternative takes.

"Patty Jenkins has responded to criticisms made by  about her film , saying that the director has an ※inability to understand what [the character] is or stands for§.Cameron made his comments in , in which he calls Wonder Woman a ※step backwards§ and says that Hollywood＊s ※self-congratulatory back-patting§ over the superhero movie＊s success had been misguided. ※She＊s an objectified icon, and it＊s just male Hollywood doing the same old thing! I＊m not saying I didn＊t like the movie but, to me, it＊s a step backwards,§ he said.The director pointed to the character of Sarah Connor from his own Terminator films as a positive example of a female protagonist. ※Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon. She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit. And to me, [the benefit of characters like Sarah] is so obvious. I mean, half the audience is female,§ he added.Jenkins responded to the comments in . ※James Cameron＊s inability to understand what Wonder Woman is, or stands for, to women all over the world is unsurprising as, though he is a great film-maker, he is not a woman,§ she wrote.Jenkins thanked Cameron for his past praise of her 2003 film Monster, which starred Charlize Theron as real-life serial killer Aileen Wuornos, but said that strong women can be portrayed in a variety of ways. ※If women have to always be hard, tough and troubled to be strong, and we aren＊t free to be multidimensional or celebrate an icon of women everywhere because she is attractive and loving, then we haven＊t come very far have we,§ she said.※I believe women can and should be everything, just like male lead characters should be. There is no right and wrong kind of powerful woman. And the massive female audience who made the film [the] hit it is, can surely choose and judge their own icons of progress,§ Jenkins added.Wonder Woman, which stars Gal Gadot as the Amazonian superhero, was released in June and quickly attracted praise for its feminist stance. The film has also proved a global box-office hit, and is currently the second-highest grossing movie of 2017, behind . A sequel to the film is set to be released in 2019, with Jenkins again directing. The success of Wonder Woman represents a remarkable comeback for Jenkins, who has not directed a film-since the critically acclaimed , for which Charlize Theron received the 2003 Academy Award for best actress. Jenkins herself has suggested that industry sexism may have been partly responsible for her career difficulties in the years since the release of the film.※It＊s played a part 每 I＊m not offered things that are authentic to me very often,§  in May. ※I did not necessarily feel that Hollywood was interested in what I wanted to do. They wanted me to do what they wanted to do.§In  this week, Jenkins expressed a desire that the success of Wonder Woman would open doors for other female filmmakers. ※I hope the success of the film will lead to change and lead to other people getting opportunities. I hope women become a diverse, easy hire for all sorts of jobs in the future,§ she said.																																											"
"ationalism is back, coursing its way through the veins of Europe and other parts of the world. I?see it on travels to the central and eastern parts of the European continent 每 in Hungary, Poland and Ukraine. Those who have seen the BBC Storyville film  will have seen me standing in a faraway field in Ukraine talking to people dressed in SS uniforms, men celebrating the creation in 1943 of the Waffen SS Galicia division.I see it in the United States, from  to Wyoming, a country with a president who is able to identify ※very fine people§ among marchers who wave swastikas, Confederate battle flags and antisemitic banners.I see it here in Britain, in some Brexit votes and related political developments. The nationalism＊s there in Daily Mail and other front page headlines, the ones that describe our judges as ※enemies of the people§ because they are doing their jobs, interpreting and applying the law with independent minds. It＊s there in the views of a prime?minister who＊d like to leave the  and who  that ※if you believe you are a citizen of the world, you are a citizen of nowhere§.Those words 每 bereft of historical understanding 每 brought to mind a passage from Stefan Zweig＊s , a book for our times, published posthumously in 1942 after Zweig＊s suicide. ※For almost half a century,§ he wrote, ※I trained my heart to beat as the heart of a citizen of the world.§ An Austrian passport, he has learned, refers to ※more than a patch of?territory within set borders§.Where are we heading? The president of the United States rails against the media and ※§ (more shades of Germany in the 1930s?), and signs an executive order that would 每 but for the actions of the federal courts 每 ban entire categories of individuals and groups  simply because they are of a particular nationality. Two years ago he called ※for a total and complete shutdown for Muslims entering the United States§.Targeting people not because of their smiles or other individual propensities but because they happen to be a member of a group has a long history. Primo Levi, who spent a year at Auschwitz, made the point in 1947, in : ※Many people 每 many nations 每 can find themselves holding, more or less wittingly, that every stranger is an enemy.§ When this happens, he continues: ※When the unspoken dogma becomes the major premise in a syllogism, then, at the end of the chain, there is the [concentration camp].§One thing leads to another. Experience 每 recent experience 每 teaches us to where such nationalisms can lead, singling out people not for what they have done but because they happen to be a member of a particular group. My family knows to where such a beginning can lead. I found the order expelling my grandfather from the German Reich, in November 1938. He posed no threat to anyone. He could be expelled because he had been made stateless. He was then expelled because of his religion.How ironic, seven decades on, that the two countries that did more than any other to put in place rules to limit the excesses of nationalism and national sovereignty, recognising rights under international law for individuals and for the protection of groups, have fallen off their perches. How extraordinary, seven decades after the opening of the Nuremberg trial, with its British and American prosecutors and 22 Germans in the dock, that many will look to Germany as the bastion of liberal democracy, as protector of the rule of law, of the rights of refugees and of individuals.I actually worry less about the United States, with its robust constitution. Over there we see for ourselves the forces of opposition joining to protect basic rights. , if it happens, is no four-year interlude. Its consequences are far greater 每 socially, politically, economically and even existentially. Writing my memoir , I learned how extraordinary was the preparation 每 by politicians, civil servants, the people 每 for all eventualities in the course of the war. By contrast, we now know that in the run-up to the referendum no work was done to prepare for departure. I know from my day job as an international lawyer that preparations for a post-Brexit world are wholly inadequate, a pitiful blend of jingoism, nationalism, hope and delusion about Britain＊s essential greatness.All this is nudged along by the poison of slow-burning nationalisms, a desire to ※take back control§, in the case of the UK, and ※make America great again§. One thing leads to another. Bedazzled by the power of statehood 每 that most artificial and fake of constructs 每 are we not also citizens of our?home, our street, our borough, our?city, our Europe and our world? The reform is clear: to recognise that our essential rights flow not from the happenstance of nationality 每 and certainly not just from our national passport 每 but from our essence as individual human beings. That＊s what the 1945 moment said, that we are citizens of the world.We should have, beyond our national passports, a global passport. Over time,?the withering of the monopoly power of the nation state, and the oppressive, absurd, monopoly power of the national passport 每 that would be?my reformation.

"ll caught up with ? Then you＊re probably hankering for another violent tale in which ruling clans scheme and scuffle in a bloody battle for sovereignty. It should be good news, then, that Marvel are poised to launch their latest TV project, The Inhumans 每 about a royal family of mutants jostling for dominance over their secret kingdom on the moon 每 in unprecedented big-screen style.The Inhumans arrives on Friday in 1,000 Imax screens across the US and UK, with its first two episodes reformatted as a 75-minute would-be blockbuster. Imax is an investor in the show, and according to CEO Richard Gelfond, the decision to launch it on their global network of mega-screens is a way of . Those towering (and likely deafening) presentations will be a shock-and-awe introduction to the Inhuman universe, before the series arrives on significantly smaller screens at the end of September.Debuting a new show in cinemas, particularly one about whose characters there is zero brand awareness, might seem a hubristic move. But it does echo the origins of the project. The Inhumans was , before a corporate reshuffle saw it  in 2016. Now, weirdly, it gets to be both.The first  suggested that at least one executive spotted the Game of Thrones parallels between the Inhumans＊s lunar kingdom of Attilan and the lethal political machinations of King＊s Landing. Iwan Rheon, the Misfits star turned sausage-waggling sadist Ramsay Bolton in HBO＊s megahit, plays the revolutionary Maximus, a non-superpowered Inhuman looking to upend the status quo. As Ramsay, Rheon proved himself a big talker, which is just as well as Maximus＊s brother and main opponent Black Bolt 每 the king of Attilan, embodied by Hell on Wheels cowpoke Anson Mount 每 is essentially mute, since a mere whisper from his lips unleashes overwhelming destructive power.The rest of the superpowered Inhumans family hews closely to the cosmically strange 1960s characters created by : element-controlling ingenue Crystal, amphibious infiltrator Triton and beastly palace guard enforcer Gorgon, who can trigger earthquakes with a clop of his mighty hooves. Black Bolt＊s queen is the most wigged-out of all: Medusa (played by Serinda Swan) is a regal redhead whose long flowing hair also functions as an extra set of limbs she can use to restrain foes. Earthquake-triggering hooves and sentient hair might sound exciting, but the Inhumans has so far . The unfamiliarity with the characters and the neither fish-nor-fowl Imax/TV rollout has muddied the message, to the extent that there is a growing and almost gleeful expectation that it will be Marvel＊s biggest critical flameout since the . It does all seem faintly ridiculous. The interiors of Attilan look bland, bare and brutalistic, while the costuming and production design manage neither grandeur or grit. The reveal that Black Bolt and his followers will get kicked out of Attilan and end up on Earth also recalls the 1987 Masters of the Universe movie, whose producers, tasked with staging a sweeping war epic beyond the stars, chucked He-Man through a cosmic portal to New Jersey so they could shoot on contemporary streets.It feels like the Inhumans might be a victim of Marvel＊s post-success scramble, now that the company has found itself custodian of the biggest movie franchise in the world and a constantly expanding portfolio of TV shows.

"ill & Grace made an unexpected comeback last September after 10 years away from the small screen, releasing . The short clip got the old gang back together to discuss the impending election. Will and Grace were as appalled at the idea of Donald Trump the presidential candidate as they were at the notion of a ※butt double§ in 50 Shades of Grey. Karen, of course, is friends with the Trumps, and returns from a stay in Mar-a-Lago with Donald and Melania. ※Please tell me you are not voting for that guy,§ Will pleads. ※All he does is call people names.§ ※Grace, did you hear what your pussy gay Muslim boyfriend just said?§ Karen fires back.What a difference a year makes: it seemed much funnier in September 2016 than it does in September 2017, where it seems more documentary than sitcom. Nevertheless, it was the preamble to a reboot, with the cast returning for a full season this fall. (Whether it will address the original season finale, which made it clear that Will and Grace had not spoken in 18 years, is yet to be seen.)  unravels into a self-referential musical, in which Eric McCormack and Debra Messing visit the old set, only to find the characters of Jack and Karen still there, unaware that they＊re part of a TV show. It mentions Instagram and Airbnb, so we know we＊re in for contemporary jokes.  has a gag about Grindr. Apps are an easy way of making jokes sound current. Aren＊t smartphones modern! I give it until episode three before Snapchat filters see them all with kitten ears and cute pink noses. ※It was a phenomenon that changed television forever,§ announces the voiceover. Whether this is true is up for debate; I have a soft spot for the original series, despite its flaws, and am intrigued to see if it can survive today. Though its limitations have been made more obvious by its decade of absence, particularly its strange queasiness about gay people doing gay stuff like kissing, it certainly provided something fresh and new in 1998 when it first aired on NBC.That＊s a problem not only for the new Will & Grace, but for TV as a whole, which is in the grip of a wave of nostalgia, so much so that even the trashy 80s extravaganza Dynasty is getting a much-needed chance to show us rich people being awful onscreen. Like movies, music and even video games, television has realised that new versions of old things are highly appealing to a certain audience, who have an in-built fondness for something they once knew. The warmth of familiarity can make a launch a much less risky proposition than something totally alien, though the recent Baywatch movie flop showed this strategy is not without limits. The most talked-about TV revivals all had a huge impact on culture, but crucially, those impacts were of their moment. Talk of an L Word reboot, featuring some of the original cast but focusing on a new generation of queer women, takes a show that once stormed television simply because it was unlike anything before it and brings it into the modern era. As with Will & Grace, this lays bare the flaws of the original. While it was soapy and spectacular, it was also questionable, in hindsight, on things like class, race, trans issues and bisexuality. The danger is that if the show changes too much, people will miss its familiarity and its legacy may suffer 每 but in order to remain relevant, it must adapt to its current context. This is a delicate balance to find.It＊s something Roseanne will have to grapple with too, even more so than its ※the last season was all a dream§ finale. Announcing the show＊s return, ABC claimed that when its first episode aired, ※television was changed forever§. It was changed because the show spoke about class, and put a self-defined ※respectable white trash family§ scraping together a living at the centre of its story. The ABC Entertainment president, Channing Dungey, has said that the return will ※speak very honestly§ about the Trump era, and that it will ※bring back a point of view that has really been missing on the air§. This assessment risks feeding into the myth that working-class voters elected Trump 每 again and again, it＊s been proven that the majority of his supporters were from middle-to-high-income households 每 but perhaps the show itself will be able to make that plain. There are two recent pinnacles of TV＊s revival culture, which indicate when it works and when it does not. When Netflix brought Arrested Development back to life, the news was received with near ecstasy by fans. There was a sense that after only three seasons, the sitcom had been cut short in its prime by a network that did not understand its genius. But its fourth season was a letdown; it was messy, overly long and confused. Though fans＊ appetites may have been blunted, that hasn＊t dampened Netflix＊s enthusiasm 每 the streaming service announced a fifth season in May. ※In talks with Netflix we all felt that stories about a narcissistic, erratically behaving family in the building business 每 and their desperate abuses of power 每 are really underrepresented on TV these days,§ the show＊s creator, Mitch Hurwitz, said in a statement at the time, with winning self-awareness. (When discussing the return of , Larry David was asked about a similar kind of context, now that rich men＊s political incorrectness is perhaps more of a talking point than when the show originally aired. ※Well, I don＊t consider myself a prick,§ he replied, succinctly.)The stakes were higher for Twin Peaks, which had been off the air since 1991, following a notoriously shambolic second season ruined by network interference. Fans seemed as nervous as they were excited. While other shows can claim to have changed television, few had the long-lasting reach and impact on culture that Twin Peaks did. The new third season is not yet over, but so far David Lynch has only solidified the series＊ legacy, by making something more inventive and more astonishing than Twin Peaks fans might have dared to dream a strange dream of. If the creators have new stories to tell, and if there are new ways in which to tell them, then nostalgia may not be as damaging to TV as it has been to Hollywood. But those ifs are big.																																											"

Its outreach work 每 exploring the difference between legality and morality 每 is spreading across the country.Based in Nottingham＊s old courthouse and jail, the Georgian-fronted complex exhibits the Bow Street court dock where Emmeline Pankhurst argued for suffragette rights, an 18th-century birching stool and forensic evidence from the Great Train Robbery.In the mid-1990s a Reading solicitor, Geoffrey Goldsmith, came up with the idea of establishing a museum of law to preserve its vanishing past.

Prisons cells, public executions, a police station and magistrates court have all operated from the building. The last crown court hearings in 1986 involved offences from the miners＊ strike. Initially launched as the Galleries of Justice, the museum has gradually absorbed other collections and expanded its mission. Fortified with a ?1m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, it has reopened as the National Justice Museum.The outreach work, staging costume reenactments of famous trials and debates about social justice, is now also held at the Royal Courts of Justice, the Rolls Building in London, and Manchester crown court. Events are open to school groups, students and the wider public. Tim Desmond, the museum＊s chief executive, plans to expand sessions to Barkingside magistrates court in Essex and Reading crown court.The museum contains artefacts accumulated from centuries of criminal justice. Oscar Wilde＊s lime-green cell door from Reading jail, owned by the museum, is on loan to the Tate Britain exhibition, §Queer British Art§. The last working gallows in Britain was preserved in working order at Wandsworth prison and tested regularly into the early 1990s; the death penalty remained a theoretical possibility for treason, piracy with violence and mutiny in the armed forces until then. It has been rebuilt. Visitors can stand on the trap door above what would have been a 3.6-metre (12ft) fatal drop. A nearby glass cabinet holds a two-thirds empty bottle of Teacher＊s Highland Cream from which the condemned were permitted a final tot. ※You would think they would have given them the whole bottle,§ Desmond observed. ※They could choose brandy or whisky. It was a nip to steady the prisoner＊s nerves.§There is a black executions box that hangmen used to transport equipment to prisons around the country. It includes a measuring rod, chalk, a sand bag, restraining straps, ropes and a block and tackle.Ropes would be stretched the night before to ensure the prisoner＊s neck was broken so that he, or she, did not die from slow strangulation. Among those executed on the Wandsworth gallows were the Nazi broadcaster William Joyce in 1946 and the posthumously pardoned burglar Derek Bentley in 1953.※Over the years we have expanded and obtained HM Prison Service＊s collection,§ Desmond explained. ※We have also acquired the [metal trellis] dock from Bow Street magistrates court in which Wilde, Roger Casement, the Kray twins, Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, Dr Crippen and even Jeffrey Archer once appeared.§More than a decade after its closure, the Bow Street magistrates court building in Covent Garden, central London, is scheduled to reopen as a boutique hotel. The slow pace of redevelopment highlights the difficulties of preserving the architectural history of hundreds of courtrooms closed by Ministry of Justice economies and the fall in reported crime.Desmond said: ※Our warning is that heritage buildings cost a lot of money to maintain. It has been a real labour of love to make the Nottingham museum sustainable.§ One of the museum＊s most prominent supporters has been the former justice secretary and local MP Ken Clarke. Force-feeding equipment used on suffragettes and a bronze statue from the mother and baby unit at the demolished Holloway women＊s prison have recently been acquired.The exhibits highlight shifts over time in attitudes towards penal reform. There are 18th-century leg irons and elaborate measuring jugs for imposing restricted diets on those who did not complete hard labour tasks. Forensic evidence from the Great Train Robbery includes watches, combat jackets, keys for a getaway Land Rover and the Monopoly game the gang played while hiding out after the 1963 heist.One of the trials reenacted in the museum＊s imposing, wood-panelled court is that of Daniel Diggle, a 21-year-old Luddite agitator and knitting-frame breaker who was convicted 200 years ago for a shooting a woollen manufacturer. Diggle was hanged on 2 April 1817 outside Nottingham Shire Hall.Later this year the museum will stage an exhibition about the playwright Joe Orton to mark the 50th anniversary of the  in 1967.

"here is a tremendous warmth and tenderness to this sweet, sad love story starring  and Jamie Bell 每 a stranger-than-fiction true romance that unfolds in Los Angeles, New York, London and Liverpool 每 and there is a bittersweet rightness in a new song from Elvis Costello over the closing credits: You Shouldn＊t Look at Me That Way. Director Paul McGuigan finds the balance between pathos and humour, working from Matt Greenhalgh＊s adaptation of a memoir by the actor and writer Peter Turner.As an unknown, struggling young actor in the late 70s, Turner met and fell in love with Gloria Grahame, the legendary Hollywood star and Oscar-winner who, incredibly, was living in the same north London boarding house. She was in the endgame of her career yet maintaining a never-say-die optimism, looking for stage work in Britain and suppressing worries about her health. Then, some time after their affair ended, Turner received a phone call: Grahame had collapsed in her dressing room while on tour in the UK, and had asked to come and stay with Peter and his family in Liverpool, poignantly convinced that she could recover there. Kenneth Cranham and Julie Walters play Peter＊s mum and dad and Bell is very affecting in the role of Peter, exasperated and angry with his impossible superstar ex-girlfriend, and yet still in love with her to the very last. And Bening is excellent as Grahame: imperious, vulnerable, romantic, sexually excited about her younger man, wanly aware of secrets she cannot share with him. She is not so much a  figure, staying big while the movies got small; she is closer to someone her mother (played by Vanessa Redgrave) compares her to: Marilyn Monroe, an actor having to stay tough while life and showbusiness give her . Peter and Gloria have a yearning to play Romeo and Juliet, and there is a Capulet/Montague tribal division: Brit and American, young and not-young, famous and not-famous. There is an interesting scene when Peter takes Gloria down to the local pub for a couple of pints of bitter. (90p 每 yowch! Pricey!) Gloria goes off to powder her nose while Peter pays for the drinks, and the landlord asks, with an air of disbelief: ※Isn＊t that Gloria Grahame ＃?§ And he leaves it there. It was a pre-web age when movie history was more difficult to retrieve, when it was still possible for former film stars to go to British pubs and stay obscure, when the drinkers were not in a position to take out smartphones and tweet about her presence and watch YouTube clips. Later, you see Peter in a cinema, wonderingly watching Gloria in her glorious heyday in Naked Alibi from 25 years or so before. The lustrous and mythic black-and-white celluloid, so different from modernity＊s colour, make it seem like she came from another planet. There is a great spark between Bell and Bening, and I think these are the most relaxed performances I have seen from either of them. It is very touching when Gloria first invites Peter into her room in the middle of the day to do a little disco dancing, ostensibly because she needs someone with whom to rehearse a routine. Of course, it is a seduction, and yet there is something very innocent, and absurd, and almost childlike, about the pair of them bopping around her room. Bell taps into his  spirit for this, and Bening is herself no mean dancer. It＊s a scene that allows us to believe in their romance, and allows us to have a romance with the pair of them.Cranham and Walters are reliably excellent as Peter＊s parents, as is Stephen Graham as his brother. Screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh has perhaps taken a decision to scale back the black-comic raucousness of the Liverpool household in which Gloria found herself at the last, preferring to emphasise gentleness and sadness rather than any how-are-the-mighty-fallen ironies. The movie makes the right decision to focus on the humanity and compassion. It＊s a beguiling story and Bell and Bening are tremendous as the star-crossed lovers.																																											"
"ne of the pleasures of reading Lesley Nneka Arimah＊s debut collection is the feeling of?being thrown off balance: not knowing where this playful and adventurous new talent will take you next. The 12 stories that make up  are set in Nigeria and the US, sometimes moving between the two (the author was born in the UK, has lived in Nigeria and is now based in the States). Arimah＊s focus is on the lives of girls and women, and while her perspective is often bleak, the collection is bracing and varied.Here is a debut writer showing serious range 每 drawing on realism, magical realism, the fantastic and speculative, myth and fable. In the title story, Nneoma, a ※grief worker§ in a?post-apocalyptic future, possesses the power to draw grief and sadness out of people ※like poison from a?wound§. In ※Second Chances§, a?young woman＊s mother returns from the dead, opening up the possibility of a longed-for reconciliation and forgiveness. In ※Who Will Greet You at Home§ a childless woman working in a hair salon makes herself a baby out of human hair. While the scenarios that Arimah depicts are at times fantastical, they are always rooted in human need and longing.The seam of bleakness running through the book concerns the diminishment of women: an outcome which starts to appear almost inevitable, even for girls born brave and quick-witted with a ※streak of fire§. The story ※Light§, a tender portrayal of a father-daughter relationship, opens: ※When Enebeli Okwara sent his girl out in the world, he did not know what the world did to daughters. He did not know how quickly it would wick the dew off her, how she would be returned to him hollowed out, relieved of her better parts.§ In one quietly heart-breaking line, his daughter ※becomes aware that the world requires something other than what she is§.Arimah explores women＊s dispossession from?many angles, including the fraught relationships between mothers and daughters and the complicated dynamics of female friendship. In ※Redemption§, a young servant, Mayowa, who ※walked as though the?earth spun to match her gait§, is punished for her audacity. In ※Wild§, two cousins are rebuked by their mothers for bad behaviour: both struggle with the consequences of their boldness as they try to find their place in the world. In ※Buchi＊s Girls§, a daughter once thought of by her father as a hard diamond becomes reduced to?※a jumpy mouse§ when his death leaves the family dependant on others.Arimah keeps her readers on their toes, and the disorientation can come with great rewards. While at times her use of narrative or rhetorical devices brings a degree of self-consciousness to the page, it also brings energy, momentum and humour. Some stories hold readers at a distance; others address them directly; some pull them close into the physical and emotional realms of the characters 每 and some of?the stories do all of these at once. Overall, the collection offers a rare combination of daring and nuance. can cover unexpected distances in a brief space of time 每 and?at best, in this collection, the effect can be striking. In ※War Stories§, inflections of humour are superseded as the story takes an increasingly troubled course. The passage of time is?compressed as a father＊s accounts of?traumatic experiences as a young soldier sit alongside his 12-year-old daughter＊s recent experiences at school, with the juxtaposition of these elements carrying real charge. In ※The Future Looks Good§, Arimah telescopes time as she explores history in a very different way, presenting the dizzying stream of past events and family history that have led a young woman, Ezinma, towards the moment they will catch up with her. Here, and elsewhere, Arimah captures a sense of time and change as chaotic, fast and unsparing 每 slippery, and out of our hands.She is also skilled at stopping time, and allowing the reader, along with her?characters, to dwell: offering the consolation that can come with getting lost in a moment, and paying attention to something or someone as vivid, insistent and vital as the unnamed girl in ※Light§ who, winning in a board game against her father, delights him as she ※crows in a very unladylike way and yells, In your face!§  is published by Headline.

Or, as one top London orchestra had it last year (my favourite), ※§, which leads you as far as you can go in any direction, including up.The 2017  has chosen ※identity§. Another capacious term, until you consider the nature of this cosmopolitan Swiss city. River, lake, mountain and plain converge on the north-south axis of Europe. Its name is pronounced in five different ways by its own German-French-Italian-Romansch-speaking inhabitants. A quarter of its population is foreign. Questions of identity are of its essence, whether you yoke them to music or not. The festival began in 1938. Its early history is a tale of European fragmentation, of musicians in flight from Nazi Germany or fascist Italy, determined to meet and perform together on one platform.The politics may be different today but the goal is the same. Three years after his death, the visionary if exacting spirit of  still guides this month-long event. He founded (with the festival＊s director, Michael Haefliger) the flagship , now under the baton of , who as a teenager learned his conducting technique at Abbado＊s elbow.Last week in Switzerland I heard Chailly in his other role, as music director at La Scala, Milan. Identity does get a bit entangled here. Abbado also once held that title, and in 1982 established the Filarmonica della Scala 每 essentially the company＊s opera orchestra out of the pit and on stage playing symphonic works. They performed Brahms and Respighi before heading  and Edinburgh.This musical forging of rock and honeycomb was as odd as it was intriguing. Brahms＊s Violin Concerto, played with compelling seriousness by Athens-born , is weighty yet compressed and majestic. Lucerne＊s beautiful 每 in all respects 每 KKL hall slightly favoured the soloist. Having followed Kavakos＊s every supple trill and pliant detail, I was aware that the orchestra had not commanded such close attention. Respighi＊s  and , two parts of an orchestral trilogy of polychromatic extravagance, gave the Filarmonica its moment or, in these episodic works, an awful lot of moments to excel.Here, the string sound was mellow, the brass bright and clear, the woodwind elegant. Written between 1916 and 1928, almost the only compositions for which this Italian oddball is remembered, they positively drip with sensuality on an epic scale. Yet this music still needs more dollops of vulgarity to leave its mark. It culminates in a gargantuan march down the Appian Way at dawn, a show of imperial Roman power. It was noisy enough to waken the living and the dead. In either state, I would be happy not to hear this music for quite a while. For an encore the musicians switched mood, becoming once again the exemplary opera orchestra they are. Verdi＊s overture to  was tense and incisive.These days spent in Lucerne were crammed with highlights: music by featured composer Michel van der Aa played by the young Lucerne Festival Academy; all three Brahms trios, executed with fire and cogency by Michael Barenboim (violin), Elena Bashkirova (piano) 每 mother and son 每 and Julian Steckel (cello): two Haydn symphonies made properly vital and thrilling by the Mahler Chamber Orchestra (another Abbado-inspired ensemble), conducted by Fran?ois-Xavier Roth.Yet the chief purpose of going was to catch the Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists in all three Monteverdi operas in the composer＊s 450th anniversary year: (1607),  (1639) and  (1643), the first written for the court of Mantua, the other two for the public theatre in Venice.  每 using his own edition of , and a collaborative one, made with his musicians, for 每 has been , all or part, since April, with Berlin, Paris and New York, among others, still to come.The rapport between voices and ensemble resulted in performances of electrifying intimacy. The instrumentalists deserve several paragraphs of their own. Rich with the dark-light colours (think aural Caravaggio) of lutes, theorbos, harp, dulcian, harp and more, their agile playing supported the drama with a restless repertoire of whispers, dissonant groans, sighs, outbursts and exclamations. Any regular reader may have noticed my unapologetically repetitive shout-outs for  (violinist and leader) and  (lutenist), in hope of drawing attention to at least a couple of these under-celebrated period instrument musicians, all tireless in their virtuosity.A core of some 15 singers, equally supple and responsive, take roles across the trilogy, joining forces to make a generous chorus. Hana Bla?赤kov芍, Kangmin Justin Kim, Francesca Boncompagni, Robert Burt and Anna Dennis each shone in multiple contributions.The operas 每 semi-staged, with elegant, adaptable costumes and an understated but telling lighting design 每 are co-directed by Gardiner and Elsa Rooke. From nine hours of unforgettable music-making, a few arresting moments: in , the Polish tenor Krystian Adam conjured every nuance of suffering and grief as the bereft Orpheus, urgently coaxing that ferryman of the dead, Caronte (top Italian bass Gianluca Buratto), to take him to the underworld. The veteran Monteverdian, Italian baritone Furio Zanasi, brought rewarding complexity to the title role in  每 a work powerfully concerned with identity and recognition 每 with French mezzo-soprano Lucile Richardot as the exalted, sorrowing Penelope.And so from the sobriety of  to the carnal greed of Monteverdi＊s final opera, . The characters who pierce the heart are those innocently wronged: Ottone (the striking countertenor Carlo Vistoli) tormented by the perfidious Poppea; Drusilla seduced into crime out of love for Ottone; Seneca forced to kill himself; and above all Ottavia, abandoned by Nero for no other reason than that he cannot keep his hands off Poppea.The language of this libretto in particular 每 all three texts are remarkable 每 has the emotional cadence of Shakespeare, especially in the role of Ottavia, impetuously and thrillingly sung by the Italian mezzo-soprano Marianna Pizzolato. In one soliloquy-aria she describes how her unstoppable tears are like a flood of mirrors in which her husband may ※behold my suffering amidst your happiness§. Does any composer express pain better than Monteverdi? The closing moments, the rapturous, sexy duet Pur ti miro, were perfectly staged and exquisitely sung by those reckless lovers, Nero and Poppea. It ended in darkness, before a standing ovation yanked us back to our senses. More or less.																																											"

He peppers me with questions about who I am and where I am from long before I get a chance to turn on the recorder. There is a sense that his travels throughout the world as a goodwill ambassador for the  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a post he has held for more than a decade, most recently in Uganda, have given him an increased appreciation for his life and whoever is in front of him. His primary contribution has been to speak with those fleeing fighting in countries such as Afghanistan, Chad, Iraq, Jordan and Uganda and to write their stories down, much as he did for his characters Amir and Hassan in his bestselling 2003 novel The Kite Runner.Another writer faced with such unexpected success (The Kite Runner sold more than 7m copies in the US alone) might have retreated from the world. But Hosseini, himself a fugitive from war, has instead committed himself to quietly documenting the lives of more recent refugees, in the hope his writing will spur the world to take notice of their plight. ※Everybody knows there＊s a war,§ he tells me, ※but once you feel what that war means, I think for most people it＊s unfathomable not to act on it, even if it＊s in a small way. It becomes that much harder to simply dismiss or move past. It prickles your consciousness.§In a sense, Hosseini＊s entire mission as a writer has been to prickle the consciousness of the western world. His father was an Afghan diplomat working in Paris when Russia invaded his home country in 1979. His family sought asylum in the US and Hosseini arrived at 15 years old, with only a limited grasp of English. He went on to attend medical school and began practising as a doctor in California. While still working as a physician, he began writing The Kite Runner,hoping to share what life in his homeland had been like. ※I expected the book to resonate with people who were interested in the region, who maybe were interested in Afghanistan specifically,§ he remembers. ※But the degree to which it caught on ＃ it did take me by surprise quite a bit.§The Kite Runner spent 110 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Hosseini followed it up with A Thousand Splendid Suns in 2007 and together, his first two books sold 38m worldwide. But before writing his third and most recent novel, 2013＊s , he began his work with UNHCR, an experience that he says changed him as a writer. ※I think my third book was a quieter book. It dealt less with archetypes, [is] a little bit more complex,§ he says. ※Displacement, refugees, these things are still very much with me ＃ I think I live now, not preoccupied, but engaged in my mind with bigger issues than I was when I writing The Kite Runner.§His latest work is a short story, Sea Prayer, which has been . It is a terse and devastating story, told by a father who has sent his son on a boat from Syria and pleads with the vast waters to keep his child safe.The novelist was inspired to write it after seeing the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in 2015 after the boat he was on, destined for Europe, capsized. When his lifeless body washed ashore in Turkey, the shocking photos , transforming the child into a tragic symbol of the crisis in Syria. At least .※The way I thought about it, when I saw the photo, was all the unseen work that goes into the raising of a child,§ says Hosseini. ※All the private worries, the private anxieties, the making sure they have this, the making sure that they eat properly, that they＊re vaccinated, that their clothes fit them, they＊re not uncomfortable, that they sleep well, that they get their vitamins. We worry and fret over their wellbeing, and to have done all that work, and see the person that you poured all that love and all that passion and all that work into, and to see that body lying face down on the beach ＃§ He trails off.In the virtual reality project, Sea Prayer is transformed into an immersive painting by artist Liz Edwards, using Tilt Brush technology, to appear with flourishes and splatters of paint in time with the narration, read by . Alongside the visuals is a haunting score composed by musician David Coulter, working with the the Kronos Quartet, an ensemble who donated their time to score the piece.Reading 每 and watching 每 Sea Prayer, I am struck not only by the beauty but by the futility it represents; the father pleads with the sea, but the sea either cannot or will not answer his prayers. I ask Hosseini if he remains optimistic, even after spending much of the last decade immersed in the darkest aspects of humanity.※If I don＊t have faith or confidence that by doing the work that we do we make [a] difference, then I would live in a really cynical world that I don＊t find to be a productive way of living,§ he says. ※There, the game is really over. At least this way there＊s a hope that somebody will connect with these stories.§Hosseini＊s hope, as tempered as it may be, is impressive. It is one thing to feel optimism when seated in a comfortable home in a country not quite at war, but quite another to travel and sit with people who have barely escaped unspeakable darkness, and still feel that a difference, no matter how small, must and can be made. This article was amended on 5 September 2017 because an earlier version to the characters in the Kite Runner as ※Amir and Hazara§.

"It seems as though Noriko Hisada prefers to let her music speak for itself. Other than the year and place of her birth 每 1963, Tokyo 每 and a list of her works to date, it is hard to find out much about Hisada or her musical background. We do know, however, if you hadn＊t guessed it from the title, that Led By the Yellow Bricks 每 her seven-movement suite for an instrumental sextet of two strings, two woodwind, piano and percussion, which was first performed by the Ensemble f邦r Neue Musik Zurich last year 每 was inspired by Frank Baum＊s children＊s classic . Hisada＊s work does not attempt to tell ※seven consecutive stories§, she insists, nor to portray the events in Baum＊s book. It is more an attempt to suggest the childhood memories that reading the book evoked, which her music does in gestures of increasing power. Tiny ideas become kernels for much larger ones. The gigantic climaxes she extracts from the ensemble are balanced against textures and solos of much quieter intensity and interrupted a couple of times by a child＊s voice. It is approachable and a bit mysterious.																																											"
"＊s new film is a ravishing 60s-set romance, sweet, sad and sexy. It＊s about two lonely hearts who like to meet up during lunch break at work, passing food back and forth and listening to records on a portable turntable. Together, they overcome their impediments and start merrily bounding over all the hurdles in their path 每 such as the fact that lovelorn Elisa is mute, unable to speak since she was a child. Or that her boyfriend has fins and gills and lives underwater, like the Creature from the Black Lagoon. The course of true love was never meant to run smooth.I confess that I＊ve been agnostic about Del Toro in the past 每 filing the Mexican film-maker away as an ideas man; a director who shoots for the moon only to fall slightly short. But I really liked The Shape of Water, which plays in competition here at Venice. It feels less of a fevered artistic exercise than his other recent work; more seamless and successful in the way it orders its material. Yes, Del Toro＊s latest flight of fancy sets out to liberally pastiche the postwar monster movie, doffing its cap to the incident at Roswell and all manner of related cold war paranoia. But it＊s warmer and richer than the films that came before. Beneath that glossy, scaly surface is a beating heart. gives a lovely, limber performance as Elisa, the cleaner at a shady Baltimore laboratory, swabbing out the toilets alongside the hard-bitten Zelda (Octavia Spencer). ※Some of the best minds in the country,§ sniffs Zelda disapprovingly, ※and they still pee all over the floor in here.§ Then one morning a big metal tank is wheeled into the basement. It contains an exotic amphibian, mute like Elisa and recently fished from a South American river. The creature is dangerous 每 it devours cats and human fingers. But Elisa is entranced and takes to stealing downstairs whenever she has time to spare, placing hard-boiled eggs on the rim of the tank and waiting for the beast to come and eat his lunch.The Shape of Water isn＊t simply a romance, but a B-movie thriller as well 每 which naturally means the clandestine meetings can＊t last. Prowling the corridors, swinging his nightstick, is ＊s Strickland, a brutal government goon who styles himself as the monster＊s tormentor-in-chief. ※That thing we keep in there is an affront,§ he barks at the cleaners. ※You know what that means?§ So Elisa finds herself embroiled in a three-way tug-of-war. Strickland wants to dissect the beast; the Soviets want to capture it. So Elisa embarks on a fraught rescue mission 每 aided at various turns by the redoubtable Zelda and her middle-aged, gay best friend (Richard Jenkins), who lives in the apartment next door.Let＊s gloss over the notion that a minimum-wage cleaner would be allowed unfettered access to such a fantastical beast, never mind embark on a scheme that involves spiriting him out, into the midst of Baltimore, concealed inside a linen trolley. Del Toro provides just enough spade-work to keep the scheme plausible and his film is stylish and charming; red meat for the senses with some sugar on top.Who can say whether these two star-crossed lovers will find their own perfect ending? The odds remain stacked against them, while the motto on the wall calendar strikes a cautionary note. ※Life,§ it reminds us, ※is just the shipwreck of our plans.§ But in the meantime here they are, lying low inside a flea-bitten apartment, like Robert Redford and Jane Fonda in Barefoot in the Park. Elisa is happy and horny and very nearly free. She used to begin every working day by masturbating in the bath. She now has an exciting new partner waiting for her in the tub. 																																											"

"ven in the home entertainment market, African cinema still gets such short shrift from UK distributors that the announcement of an on-demand service from London＊s  initiative is genuine cause for celebration 每 even if their selection at the moment, available through the Nollywood-specific , is something of a lucky dip for the unacquainted. Dominated by Nigeria and Ghana, the menu mixes impassioned, socially conscious storytelling with clunkier stabs at genre, but it has a couple of winningly accessible entry points.Glowingly shot but uncushioned by sentimentality, Ghanaian director Priscilla Anany＊s  stirringly tells of a young rural mother＊s social ostracism after she gives birth to a deformed child. In a more western vein, Frenchman Simon Rouby＊s gorgeous animation  is an engrossing first world war survival story.

Deprived dog-lovers will get fleeting, heart-fluttering pleasure from this canine-reincarnation saga 每 wherein one stout-hearted mutt travels through multiple adorable dogs＊ bodies over several decades, for maximum ※awwww§ value 每 but it＊s less a movie than an unprecedentedly glossy ※dogs do the darndest things§ YouTube video.That said, a few more cute-critter montages would liven up  (Universal, 12), a pallidly earnest, clean-scrubbed Holocaust drama in which Jessica Chastain＊s saintly Polish animal lover opens her husband＊s zoo to Jews seeking sanctuary of another sort. Chastain smiles bravely through the dewy lighting, but deserves better.So does Noomi Rapace, the original girl with the increasingly faded dragon tattoo, stoically kicking arse through a standard triple-crossed CIA obstacle course in cheerfully anonymous spy thriller  (Lionsgate, 15). Bonus points for Toni Collette in an Annie Lennox crop brandishing a machine gun; points immediately rescinded for a faux-Cockney Orlando Bloom. Meanwhile, the week＊s least competent film is handily its most rompingly enjoyable.

A star is reborn.This week＊s worthiest rereleases include smart new transfers of Sidney Lumet＊s (Powerhouse, 12), a stern, smoke-singed John Le Carr谷 adaptation; Ermanno Olmi＊s lovely, somewhat sidelined 1978 Palme d＊Or winner (Arrow, 12), a tough and tender, season-to-season evocation of Bergamo peasant living; and  (Powerhouse, 15), in which Alan Bates and Janet Suzman gutsily interpret Peter Nichols＊s oft-renewed play about two parents＊ perverse comic response to the plunging pain of their daughter＊s disability. Finally, a spiky, salty Joe Orton double bill from 1970, as both Silvio Narizzano＊s  (Studiocanal, 15) and Douglas Hickox＊s  (Studiocanal, 15) preserve the late playwright＊s razored language and slinky queer sexuality to still-seductive, still-disorienting effect.

They thought because it was Game of Thrones it＊d be a big deal.§ Independent cybersecurity experts agreed that HBO seems to have emerged without serious damage despite the data dumps and banner headlines. They cautioned, however, that only  and the hackers know the full story. The company declined interview requests for this article.The experts, who have advised other companies targeted by hackers, described such crises in terms of attacks, breaches, plundering, firewalls, war rooms, psychology and alliances 每 things familiar to characters in the Seven Kingdoms.※It＊s a continuous evolution between attacker and defender. If you build a 10ft wall sales of 11ft ladders will go up,§ said Richard Ford, chief scientist at Forcepoint. Even if HBO won this battle companies should not be complacent, he said. ※It may not be you in the crosshairs now but you will be. No company can consider itself immune to the digital threat environment. That motto, winter is coming, has never been more relevant.§Earlier this year hackers threatened to  and Netflix＊s Orange is the New Black series. Neither company is known to have paid ransoms.HBO＊s turn came at the end of June when an individual or group calling itself Mr Smith released four unreleased episodes of various shows and the script of an unreleased Game of Thrones episode. The hacker claimed to have stolen 1.5 terabytes of data, including shows, emails, actors＊ personal details and shooting schedules for Westworld＊s second season. A follow-up ransom note reportedly demanded $6m to avert further leaks.Additional, unrelated blows hit the company.

HBO appeared to cave in an email dated 27 July which offered the hackers $250,000, only for the hackers to leak the email to the media, along with additional material. ※HBO hackers just hit us with another huge data dump,§ . ※Oh boy, they＊re quite something.§But HBO held its nerve, according to anonymous sources who told several outlets the $250,000 was a ruse to buy time.

"Gamescom, the world＊s largest video game event, has just taken place in Cologne, bringing 400,000 visitors 每 including Angela Merkel 每 to the vast Koelnmesse for a week of hype and hands-on action.Here are the 11 games we most enjoyed amid the chaos.This long-awaited platformer matches its astonishing 1930s cartoon art-style with manic gameplay inspired by classic console titles from the 1980s and 90s. The run-and-gun action is deceptively tricky, thanks to some seriously challenging bosses, but its meticulous detail will keep you in awe while you die over and over again. Gets extra points for its soundtrack, composed by a 10-piece ragtime jazz band (including the occasional tap shoe sound effects).The slick new addition to the beast-bludgeoning fantasy series is full of gasp-out-loud moments. Huge detailed areas (split into seamlessly connected zones), giant monsters and satisfying combat are all promised, with a range of weapons that utilise different combos and strategies. Add the drop-in co-op gameplay and it＊s far from the watered down experience some fans feared.Published by Coffee Stain (developers of the absurdly popular Goat Simulator) this four player co-op shooter has space dwarves mining for precious minerals amid a huge underground cave system riddled with giant spiders and other monsters. The stylised visuals, procedurally generated environments and digging mechanic have drawn comparisons with Minecraft, but this is much more loot-and-shoot than click-and-create. Drawn in cute isometric visuals, this complex real-time strategy game has you defending various islands against hordes of Vikings. As you play, the detritus of war starts to litter your realm, the bodies, burned buildings and crashed ships affect both the Vikings and your own warriors. Seeing enemy craft gradually appearing through the fog is as beautiful as it is eerie.Created by a new indie studio set up by ex-staff from the  and Mad Max titles, BioMutant is described as a ※post-apocalyptic kung fu fable§. In practice, that seems to mean an open-world RPG with an idiosyncratic comic book art style, deep Wushu fighting system, and a racoon-like protagonist who can be augmented with mutations and prosthetics. Kung Fu Panda meets Fallout? OK then.The Anno series of real-time strategy city builders has gone back to what it does best: the past. Anno 1800 focuses on the industrial revolution of the 19th Century, dealing with issues of colonialism, empire and workforce exploitation, and allowing you to deal with them as you see fit. But be warned that a small strike in your city can lead to a protest, which leads to a riot, and then a revolution. This looks to be a game about systems rather than morals, but you have to deal with the consequences of your tyranny.Ubisoft has refreshed its assassination adventure series in this latest instalment, adding a focus on narrative and a new hitbox-based combat system. The recreation of ancient Egypt looks stunning, with thorough historical research clearly on show. Judging by the Gamescom demo, however, unnecessary UI and markers on maps still have the potential to distract and disrupt the beautiful view.Inspired by the developers＊ childhoods playing in the forests of Sweden, the focus here is on exploration and discovery. Playing as an adorable fox-type creature you sing to animals and plants in the woods, gradually gaining their trust and help as you rid the woodlands of a corrupting evil. Riding deer around, chucking lizards about, scampering up trees and gliding elegantly down; it＊s a delightful natural playground in a blue and purple palette.A hit at E3 and now a star at Gamecom, the latest  adventure has the plumber travelling through various worlds, possessing people and objects with his anthropomorphic hat, Cappy. While the implications of being able to inhabit the bodies of enemies is a little disturbing, the game＊s intricately designed 3D platforming and feature-packed environments are sure diverting.Set throughout a serene post-apocalyptic environment, the goal in Far is to pilot your vessel across the vast expanse of a dried-up sea, now barren and littered with the remains of a seafaring civilisation. Wonderfully eerie and atmospheric, with a painterly grey-hued palette, you discover the stark narrative via ruins and wrecks. Created by Zurich-based studio Okomotive, who began this striking game as students, there are no enemies, apart from the emptiness around you, making for a subtly moving experience.The delicate and pretty look of this game masks a dark story: a young girl must understand her own death if she is to help guide others to the afterlife. The isometric point-and-click puzzle adventure is a collaboration with Dutch author Joost Vandecasteele, offering discreet, gently coloured interiors to explore. An award winner in its native Belgium, The Almost Gone looks set for further acclaim.																																											"

At 42, healthy, successful and two months married, he suffered a right hemisphere haemorrhagic infarct 每 AKA, a stroke, insult to the brain or cerebral mugging 每 that left him paralysed down one side and with his speech impaired. The memoir he published afterwards,  (1998), is a compelling account of his recovery and of his reluctant adjustment to a slower pace of life. Many stroke patients, doctors and nurses have found the book invaluable, both for its honesty and for its lightly worn neurological research. Drawing on the diaries that he and his wife Sarah Lyall kept at the time, it had the immediacy of frontline reportage, with the body as a battleground and the outcome, if not a total victory, certainly a triumph against the odds.Though occasional ideas and phrases from that book recur,  is very different in tone and texture.

Rather than asking ※What has become of me?§, McCrum wants to know ※What lies ahead?§ For answers he looks to the literature he has read over half a century (his title comes from : ※Every third thought shall be my grave§) and to friends and experts in the field, some still living (, , ), others not (, , ).※Let us disarm Death of his novelty and strangeness,§ Montaigne said.

McCrum is more patient with those who find reasons to be cheerful. ※If you have religion,§ Sally Vickers (a Christian) says, ※it gives the drama of death a place in the theatre of things.§ As to ageing, Adam Phillips argues that ※Every stage of the life cycle is interesting§, and there are ※more possibilities when we are 70§.Denial is another coping mechanism (William Empson considered death a topic ※people should be prepared to be blank upon§). It doesn＊t let you off the grave but may ease your passing. When McCrum visits a friend who is dying from leukaemia, he＊s troubled by his deluded talk of recovery. But he accepts that it would be cruel to disenchant him. I had a similar experience with my father. Having been told the worst (inoperable cancer, just weeks to live), and having made sure I knew it too, he chose not to discuss it again.※The dying have a right to their decease,§ McCrum says, though in the UK the law is stacked against them. What terrifies most of us is the prospect of dependency. We had it before, as infants, but have no memory of that; this time we＊ll be conscious of it, with the knowledge that our dependency will only get worse. Interventions that prolong life can also impair it; as the neurosurgeon and author Marsh says, death is often a preferable outcome. McCrum himself hopes for a quick death, in his sleep; better that than a decade of incontinence in institutional care. Yes, the will to live persists, even in those with no quality of life. But if their brains were fully functional, would they choose to go on?Death is the ※fairest thing in this world§, the Nobel prize-winning author Svetlana Alexievich has said, because ※no one has ever managed to buy himself out of it§. It＊s also the cruellest, when it takes lives that have barely begun. The cautious go under as well as the wild: ※We study health, and we deliberate upon our meats and drink,§ John Donne wrote, ※But in a minute a Canon batters all, overthrows all, demolishes all; a Sickness unprevented for all our diligence ＃ destroys us in an instant.§ As an assemblage of great quotes and prompt for further reading,  rivals DJ Enright＊s anthology . McCrum adds striking metaphors of his own, likening death to ※an indifferent electrician switching off lights in the deserted stadium of the human soul§.Impatient readers will want to shake him: come on, mate, you＊re not even a pensioner yet; the deceleration you＊re experiencing is no big deal. But for the most part McCrum counts himself lucky: he may use a cane but at least he looks youthful and still has his hair. The closing chapter distils the wisdom he has learned: keep fit, accept your fate and live in the now. It also offers an ※improbably romantic§ happy ending when, depressed and solitary after the breakup of his marriage, he meets a woman he＊d briefly talked to under a crab-apple tree a decade earlier and falls in love.To find love again in your seventh decade won＊t stop you getting older or, eventually, pegging out. And it doesn＊t happen to everyone. But after the struggles he has been through, it is perhaps the least this author deserves. And at the end of a journey through hospital wards, hospices and darkened rooms, it＊s a shaft of sunlight for the reader, too.  is published by Picador.

"t is sometimes said that those at the lower end of politics are often more acute observers than those who occupy the commanding heights. A touch of self-deprecation and a sense of humour also help. John O＊Farrell has these qualities in spades. And as he would be the first to concede, you can＊t get much further down the political pecking order than O＊Farrell. After decades as a humble footsoldier in the army of Labour, his political career peaked as a candidate in a long forgotten byelection where he came in fourth, behind . Oh yes, and he , his hometown, where he was also duly smashed.Yet, for all that, he is better known than many who have sat in Labour cabinets. He has dined with the prime minister at Chequers, has been invited to drinks in Downing Street, and top politicians have sought his advice on content of key speeches. O＊Farrell was propelled into the political limelight by his first book, , a very amusing memoir of life as a lowly Labour activist during the dark days of the Thatcher supremacy, which in 1998 spent weeks at the top of the non-fiction bestseller list. Since then his books have been translated into 25 languages, while he has written for comedy programmes such as  and  and even co-authored a Broadway musical. (note the question mark this time) is the sequel, offering our hero＊s experience of the rollercoaster ride during the 20 years from the glorious night of the  to the  and the , concluding with the glimmer of hope afforded by the surprising outcome of the .First, however, like many who spent the 80s and early 90s engaged in the politics of protest, he had to come to terms with the compromises and disappointments of office. As he says, ※satire is easier under the Tories§. He writes: ※One of the secrets of the right is that they are more comfortable with power; being in control comes to Tories as naturally as inconsiderate parking or talking too loudly in restaurants. But from the moment  came to power it became clear to me that there is a significant section of the left who ＃ would rather snipe from the sidelines than do the difficult bit of actually effecting change themselves.§He also had to learn to take responsibility. For years, O＊Farrell led a campaign for a new secondary school in Lambeth. No sooner was his wish granted than the difficulties began. The government would make the money available only if the new school was an academy 每 and a Christian one at that. O＊Farrell found himself grappling not only with irate residents who didn＊t want any kind of school in their backyard but also fellow campaigners who would rather no school than one with a religious ethos. Once the new school was up and running, he was asked to be chair of governors. It wasn＊t all plain sailing, but he remained in office for 12 years, steering the school through several crises and playing a leading role in a project that has transformed the life chances of some of?Lambeth＊s poorest children. A substantial achievement. The author is no longer just a serial protester and piss-taker. He is a man who gets things done.Even so, he can＊t resist a lost cause. In 2001, he decides to run for parliament in the Tory stronghold of Maidenhead, the town in which his parents still live. ※There are many ways to have a mid-life crisis,§ he writes. ※Mine was to go back to my home town and then be rejected en masse by the people I grew up with.§ Actually, it was great fun. His dad turned up to every public meeting and asked embarrassing questions. The BBC made him the subject of a documentary in which he was depicted canvassing on the Thames in an ugly little dinghy, handing out Labour leaflets to people on ?100,000 yachts with names like Just a Whim. No one is more surprised than he when his Tory opponent,  (※competent§, ※polite§, ※diligent§ 每 ※I could picture her as headmistress of a small independent girls＊ school in Surrey§), ends up prime minister.O＊Farrell is not a Corbynista. Of ＊s ascent he writes: ※I was really depressed. I didn＊t dislike Corbyn personally or disrespect him or think he was insincere, it just felt like my student daughter had married a very unsuitable older man ＃ all I could do is hope I was completely wrong.§ As it turned out he was wrong (like many of us), although in the long term the jury is still out.In the 2017 election campaign O＊Farrell, an ardent pro-remainer, had another little dilemma to grapple with. He had the bad luck to be living in the constituency of , one of only a handful of Labour MPs who were Brexiters. Through his letter box each week came Lib-Dem leaflets depicting . What to do? Does he follow the example of his wife and tear up his Labour party card or does he soldier on? In the end, he sticks with Labour. ※I am married to the Labour party for better or worse, in sickness and health, in Kinnock and in Blair. And sometimes they drive me mad, and I feel embarrassed and ashamed, but much more often I feel proud.§ As for Hoey, ※she＊s that auntie in Kettering who got crossed off the Christmas card list; she＊s my nutty cousin who got drunk at the wedding and took a swing at the vicar, but she is still related (twice removed, maybe)§.Sequels often disappoint, but O＊Farrell hasn＊t lost his touch. There are laughs as well as large doses of common sense.

"ar from the madding crowds of Valencia in eastern , Fernando Abellanas is enjoying the solitude of his unique new studio. But it＊s not the airy, light-filled glass and white walls affair you might expect of a designer: it＊s a purpose-built desk space that hangs in the underbelly of a major city overpass.On one ※wall§ 每 the concrete pillar that supports the highway above 每 a detachable structure of plywood boards and metal tubes serve as a desk, chair and shelves. Using the bridge＊s beams as rails, Abellanas＊ structure can slide on rollers from one side to the other.It＊s an example of what is becoming known as  每 buildings that cling, perch or sprout from others. The studio took Abellanas, a furniture designer and plumber, just two weeks to build after he discovered the space. He was drawn to its strange mix of materials and location. ※Despite being next to trains and with traffic above, it＊s a place no one stops to look up at,§ he says.Parasite architecture is a growing trend and ranges from planned projects, such as residential wooden pots installed on Toronto＊s CN tower, to makeshift structures 每 such as Tadashi Kawamata＊s artistic , which he scatters everywhere from New York parks to the Paris Pompidou centre, or the entire illegal ※villa§ one man built  over the course of six years. Abellanas says he wasn＊t looking for ※a feeling of total silence or peace, but rather that sensation you get as a kid of being able to sit and peek at what＊s happening around you without being seen 每 be it in a cabin or a cardboard box in your own house§.The new ※parasite§ phenomenon is partly due to how difficult it has become for many architects to realise their designs for public buildings, explains Ellis Woodman, director of the Architecture Foundation. This has lead to a rise in low-cost, short-term projects, many of which seek to engage local communities in new ways. Woodman gives the example of the  above the Hayward Gallery on London＊s South Bank, and the  in north London＊s Wood Green, a work and community space on the site of a car park and defunct council building.The foundation has created its own parasite, the , a rooftop project above an east London building for which it plans to commission a young architect each year. For 2017, an  has been built by PUP Architects as a provocation for local councils to re-think urban planning in the area. In many cases, pop-ups 每 such as restaurants, temporary stores and artistic projects 每 and parasites are much the same thing, but while a pop-up might be a temporary standalone structure, a parasite is often a longer-term intervention in the urban landscape.Meanwhile, Abellanas says he is self-taught and favours a DIY approach to urban intervention. One of his previous projects involved riding train tracks that were built but never used (the recession killed the state project) . In another, he climbed a 24m disused tower block in the vein of skyscraper ※§.Abellanas sees his project as part of a series looking at Valencia＊s disused spaces, and despite the obvious opportunity for social commentary, he says he＊s not trying to make a statement about the lack of affordable space in the city. Rents in Spain have grown by , according to housing site Idealista, but thanks to Abellanas＊ own ingenuity 每 and his willingness to work under a busy bridge 每 he has his own workspace and home.City authorities are yet to react. ※I think they haven＊t discovered it yet,§ Abellanas says. When they do, he assumes they＊ll order him to dismantle it 每 or that someone will break it or steal its materials. ※It＊s surviving a lot longer than I thought,§ he says. ※It＊s really well hidden.§																																											"
"Lucrecia Martel is the elusive poet of Latin-American cinema, missing believed lost, the Mary Celeste in human form. She made  and ; split the Cannes audience in two with her brilliant, maddening . And then, all at once, Martel seemed to vanish. There were rumours that she had been unwell, or that she spent years kick-starting a stalled science-fiction picture, or that she＊d embarked on a long boat trip right up the Amazon. I think I like the third option the best. It makes her sound like Mr Kurtz.Now Martel is back, after a nine-year absence, with the astonishing Zama, adapted from a novel by Antonio Di Benedetto, about an 18th-century Spanish colony perched on the Asuncion coast. Her film is haunted, haunting and admittedly prone to the occasional longueur insofar as it runs to its own peculiar rhythm; maybe even its own primal logic. It arrives in Venice as if blown in from another world.Audaciously, Martel refuses to provide date or a location, let alone any handy background information. She＊d rather set us down at the water＊s edge and leave us to find our own way from there, mixed in amid the other colonialists and settlers who cling to this desolate lip of the land, sweating buckets beneath their periwigs.Soon enough we encounter Don Diego de Zama (Daniel Gimenez Cacho). He serves as the crown＊s magistrate, a Spanish functionary, but his pleas for a transfer are being constantly rebuffed. He＊s pining for home, for cold weather; lying in the grass to ogle women bathing and dreaming of ※Russian princesses wrapped up in their furs§. Beyond the settlement there is the jungle, the wilds. This is reputed to contain masked warriors, painted ghouls and a terrifying brigand named Vicuna, who may already be dead, assuming he ever existed at all. But these, perhaps, are mere distractions. Basically Zama is a film about a man who waits, unhappily, for his own release.I hope Martel won＊t have to wait a further nine years before she makes her next film. She＊s too good a director to be sat on the sidelines for long and Zama may just be her left-field masterpiece; a picture that＊s antic, sensual and strange, with a top-note of menace and a malarial air. The heat is intense; the settlers go berserk. Nobody here is quite stable; nothing can be trusted. When Don Diego finally encounters the grinning Vicuna in a meadow at midnight, one half-wonders if he＊s suffering from some sick hallucination.But then this fabulous film is full of so many odd scenes 每 and some of these scenes are very funny as well. One day, for instance, Don Diego is called to meet the governor inside his fancy office. The governor explains that Zama＊s latest appeal for a transfer has once again been turned down and that a despised fellow functionary is now being released in his stead. At the peak of Don Diego＊s misery - just when things can＊t get any worse - a dirty white llama clip-clops into the room and takes up a position at our hero＊s back. It＊s a devastating moment; insult added to injury. No humiliation, one feels, is truly complete without a dirty white llama breathing down your neck.																																											"

"xactly two decades ago Britain officially handed over to a delegation of Western Australian Noongar people the head of murdered on the Swan River near Perth in 1833.It was an important moment of spiritual healing for the Noongar and a critical step in their conciliation with Great Britain, whose officials 每 at least at a local level 每 had come, finally, to assist in returning Yagan＊s head, and thus his spirit, to his country.The moment was, however, dramatically overshadowed. On 31 August 1997, the day Yagan＊s head was officially handed to his people, England＊s self-declared queen of hearts, Diana 每 the princess, who, as Hilary Mantel writes,  每 died in an auto crash in Paris. An already bittersweet moment was suddenly freighted with added poignancy as Britain lapsed into collective mourning for a lost princess on the same day it returned, after 164 years, the Noongar＊s equivalent of a warrior-prince.Yagan＊s murder by colonial settlers was, even by the day＊s standards, an act of hideous violence. That his head (※kaat§) was subsequently removed and dispatched to England as a biological curio, a specimen to aid the discredited voodoo science of phrenology 每 whereby racial intelligence and personality could purportedly be determined by cranial distinctions 每 added indignity to death.Yagan＊s experience, in life and death, also came to highlight the existence in the scientific collections of numerous foreign institutions the bodies of thousands upon thousands of . Many, like Yagan, were frontier war victims. Some were killed specifically for their body parts. Bone collectors 每 men who stole remains from sacred Aboriginal burial grounds 每 dispatched thousands of others to museums, medical schools and other institutions overseas.The bodies of thousands of Indigenous people remain in the collections of major Australian state, federal and territory institutions, unable to be returned to their people and their country partly because governments will not adequately invest in the research and infrastructure to render repatriation possible. The  on the urgent need for a keeping place for unprovenanced remains. Twenty years after the return of Yagan＊s head to the country by the Swan River where the Noongar believe his body is buried, the federal government is yet to formulate a policy on how to deal with the Indigenous bodies that, due to an absence of archival evidence, cannot be linked to specific country and so remain in makeshift repositories while, according to Indigenous beliefs, their spirits wander restlessly.To mark the 20th anniversary of the return of Yagan＊s head, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies has released hours of raw archival film footage of the final effort in England by Noongar elders and their associates to secure Yagan＊s head.They had already spent decades scouring museum, library and cemetery records to trace Yagan＊s head to a corner of a graveyard in Liverpool, north-west England. The video footage by Lyndon Ormond-Parker chronicles how, with considerable bureaucratic impediments before him, the enigmatic Noongar elder Ken Colbung landed in London in late August 1997 to declare to a press conference that he would not be leaving England without the head of his ancestor.The then 66-year-old Colbung told the press conference:The footage also includes Cressida Fforde 每 then a young doctoral student who worked with Colbung and archaeologist Peter Ucko in the 1990s to trace Yagan＊s remains. It includes footage of Colbung, a former soldier, fronting the then prime minister John Howard at a commemoration ceremony for Anzacs in London＊s Battersea Park, to explain the importance of returning Yagan＊s head.It was a time of significant racial disharmony in Australia, heightened by what became the  over arguments regarding the importance of historical truth telling about frontier violence.In one of his London press conferences, Colbung referred to the ※racial disharmony§ that had heightened since the election of the ※red-headed typhoon§ (Pauline Hanson, who was heavily critical of Indigenous peoples＊ access to welfare) ※who＊s ... brought about all the racial disharmony§. He said:Yagan died on 11 July 1833 when 18-year-old Englishman William Keates shot him in the head at point-blank range on land claimed by a magistrate, Mr Bull. Despite a ?30 bounty being placed on Yagan＊s head, Bull had ordered that no workers were to harm the Indigenous leader and warrior because he acted as a bridge between white settlers and traditional owners. Yagan was a noted warrior who had resisted colonial dispossession. But he was also, according to Fforde＊s research, admired by some settler/farmers as the ※Wallace of his day§ 每 a reference to the Scottish resistance leader William Wallace (1272-76 to 1305). An  details Yagan＊s murder and that of another Noongar man, Heegen, who was also shot in the head and later, with a gun, ※put ... out of his misery§. Keates 每 who apparently wanted the reward money so he might return to England 每 was speared to death. His 13-year-old brother James escaped. In a compelling , Fforde recounts 每 based on archival evidence 每 how a worker from Bull＊s estate cut off Yagan＊s head ※for the purposes of preserving it§ and also ※flayed the distinctive [traditional] cicatrice from his back§. They took the head to Bull＊s house where a nearby settler, George Fletcher Moore 每 who knew Yagan and had likened him to Wallace 每 sketched the trophy.The head was smoked, to preserve it, for three months. Fforde＊s paper recounts how, through painstaking researching in Australia and the United Kingdom in the early 1990s, the head was eventually traced to a plot in Everton Cemetery, Liverpool, where it had been buried with that of another Aboriginal person, some dried viscera and a Peruvian mummy in the 1960s.But the task of retrieving Yagan＊s remains was sensitive and difficult because of the burial, in 1968, in the same grave of 22 stillborn children. Yagan＊s head was eventually removed, in late August 1997, through an adjacent grave to avoid disturbing the childrens＊ bodies.The next day Yagan＊s skull was positively identified by a fracture that had first been noted in a 1835 phrenology report.Since 2010 Yagan＊s head has been buried in a  in Perth, close to where his body was initially put in the ground. The determination of Colbung, Ucko, Fforde and others, including Lyndon Ormond-Parker, to retrieve Yagan＊s head, illustrate the commitment that is required to achieve successful repatriation of Indigenous ancestral remains from overseas.Body parts belonging to thousands of Indigenous Australians still languish in Australian and overseas (mainly British and European) archives 每 a shameful reminder of colonialism＊s traumatic, generational legacy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.Twenty years after Yagan＊s head was reunited on country, far too little is being done to repatriate and respectfully keep Indigenous ancestral remains.

"ven if the  persists in ignoring everything  composed before The Flying Dutchman, Wagnerians generally acknowledge that his career began with his first two completed operas,  and . But even those works are not the beginning of the story, for Wagner composed a wealth of orchestral music from his student days onwards. Four of the scores from the 1830s are included in ＊s collection, alongside the overtures to the first two operas. Die Feen, based on a Gozzi play, was not performed in full until five years after Wagner＊s death in 1883, but the overture was played in 1835, the same year that Das Liebesverbot, which used an adaptation of Shakespeare＊s Measure for Measure, reached the stage. This disc features two concert overtures, in D minor and C, from 1831 and 1832 每 while Wagner was studying in Leipzig 每 plus the overtures from two suites of incidental music, for Raupach＊s historical drama K?nig Enzio, also written in 1832, and for Apel＊s Christopher Columbus, from 1835. None of these works is an unrecognised masterpiece, but they offer perspectives on the origins of Wagner＊s musical language and where he looked for what he might absorb into his expressive world. The main sources are predictable enough 每 Beethoven (the Egmont and Leonore overtures) and Weber (Der Freisch邦tz) 每 but others are unexpected, especially the Italian (Bellini) and French (Auber) influences, tambourines, castanets and all, in Das Liebesverbot. Hints of Mendelssohn＊s Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage and Hebrides overtures come through in the seascapes of Christopher Columbus, although it is that piece＊s incessant fanfares for six trumpets, surfing over the strings, that really catch one＊s attention (and perhaps anticipate some of the brass writing in Lohengrin more than 10 years later). Some of Wagner＊s scoring is precociously striking and one can only imagine what a top-flight orchestra might make of it, for on this evidence the Leipzig Radio Symphony isn＊t quite that. It is a decent ensemble, though, and M?rkl＊s performances are suitably nimble. The routine account of Siegfried Idyll that bulks out the disc is neither here nor there.																																											"
"ir Arthur Conan Doyle strongly believed in the possibility of spiritual survival after death. If he was right, his own ghost must be amazed and gratified by the adaptability of the Sherlock Holmes stories. With top-rating TV modernisations 每 theand?每 on each side of the Atlantic, American writer Joe Ide now begins a series of novels relocating the brain of Baker Street to South Central Los Angeles.Holmes finds his latest incarnation in Isaiah Quintabe, a 26-year-old African American, whose brilliant mind justifies his initial-nickname of IQ. In Hurston, a rough area where the finest diner is the Big Meaty Burger, he?sets up as a private eye, taking on ※local cases where the police could not or would not get involved§.IQ has known, as his London predecessor did, the temptation of recreational drugs, and his understanding of the criminal mentality is based on experience. His involvement in crime was typically idiosyncratic, stealing items (hair extensions, luxury pet products such as ※feline epilepsy strips§) with low security but high resale value.In common with all renovated Holmeses, Isaiah is notable for noticing, although, when complimented on his deductive skills, characteristically corrects the compliment, pointing out?that the process he employs is, in fact, ※induction§, in which a broader truth is drawn from a particular detail, rather than ※deduction§, which does the opposite.Ide sensibly leaves to Benedict Cumberbatch＊s TV version those signature riffs in which a stranger is immediately categorised as a bisexual zoo-keeper who plays cribbage on alternate Thursdays. IQ＊s inductive leaps tend to come from a single sight, sound or smell that no one else has considered significant. He survives one?violent stand-off through mental arithmetic and sharp hearing.Ide＊s relationship with the original stories is loose but learned. IQ＊s sidekick is Juanell Dodson who, unlike John Watson, could only claim a medical title in the way that , although, like Conan Doyle＊s creation, he is a war veteran; in his case, from the gang battles in LA.IQ＊s brother, Marcus, seems clearly to be a version of Holmes＊s sibling Mycroft, although, in a formative character point, the elder Quintabe boy is present only in the 2005-06 flashback chapters that interleave the main storyline set in 2013. The absence of Marcus is what made his brother a detective; in an electrifying scene, the 17-year-old Isaiah teaches himself to memorise every detail of each passing car, convinced that the gift of total recall will prevent him from ever forgetting Marcus.Most satisfyingly, the plot line of the first novel adapts a Conan Doyle plot 每  每 in a recognisable but thrillingly distorted form. A superstar rapper, Calvin Wright, who records as Black the Knife, faces an attempted assassination by a 130lb pit bull, who seems to?have been bred by an enemy for murderous purpose.Many people＊s idea of a perfect crime novel would combine the narrative and characterisation of Conan Doyle with the phrase-making of and, while openly acknowledging the first debt, Ide also makes a quietly impressive attempt at the second. Paragraphs crackle with one-liners that?capture telling details about a person 每 the possessions of Black the Knife include ※a bundle of rolled-up antique Persian prayer rugs from his two weeks as a practising Muslim§ 每 or?a place: a finance tycoon＊s mansion is so big that ※you could take a piss every day for three weeks and never be?in the same bathroom§.Like his protagonist, Ide is brilliant at noticing, spotting in the background of a cycle shop ※a family of eyeless mannequins pedaling along in matching spandex§. The career of a struggling TV reporter is skewered by her showreel of past stories having included ※a kid that carved whistles for the troops overseas. A potbellied pig that could say I love you§. But, between the jokes, there is also serious critique of an American society willing to sacrifice so?many (disproportionately black) lives through its gun laws and educational policies.A small regret is that, in the first book, Isaiah does not seem to encounter anyone who might become a recurrent potential nemesis in the manner of Moriarty, but the blurb of the second IQ novel, , published in the UK next year, suggests that such a criminal mastermind will arrive in that book, which sounds like Conan Doyle＊s  translated to Las Vegas. Nor, so far, is there any direct equivalent of the housekeeper Mrs Hudson in the ＊hood.With Ide already signed to write the third and fourth books in the series, it will be fascinating to see which details from his inspiration the writer adopts. Promisingly, the first book succeeds in being both highly original and continuing the spirit of Conan Doyle. Mark Lawson＊s  is published by Picador. is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson.

"win Peaks: Fire Walk With Me is David Lynch＊s . With  currently earning acclaim, it might be hard from today＊s perspective to fathom the stink the prequel caused when it was released back in 1992. Although there has been a critical reappraisal in recent times, Fire Walk With Me＊s reputation at the time was of the atrocious movie from a director who＊d lost his pop-surrealist mojo. When it was released in 691 screens across the US on 28 August, the show＊s rabid fanbase were feverishly expecting another slice of quirky cherry pie on a bigger canvas, with all their favourite characters back and as adorably odd as ever. Instead, they were presented with an intense, sordid, phantasmagorical tragedy about sexual abuse and loneliness, filled with bizarre sequences and wacky details 每 David Bowie showing up as rogue FBI agent, for instance 每 that, detractors claimed, made zero sense to anybody but the director and co-writer Robert Engels.Even before the cameras rolled, it was clear things weren＊t going to plan. The show＊s co-creator Mark Frost fell out with Lynch over whether the movie should be a straightforward sequel to the two TV series or a prequel focused on Laura Palmer＊s last days. Frost walked away. Kyle MacLachlan dragged his feet over returning to play the heroic Agent Dale Cooper, finally acquiescing only to a small role. Lara Flynn Boyle then threw a major spanner into the works by refusing to come back as Donna Hayward. This was a potential project wrecker. In the end, Lynch was forced to recast Moira Kelly as the new Donna.Fire Walk With Me＊s reception at Cannes has entered festival lore as one of the most disastrous ever. When the credits rolled, any positive responses from the Cannes crowd were drowed out by boos. Reviewers lined up to give the film a shiner, the New York Times＊s Vincent Canby summing up the general mood. ※It＊s not the worst movie ever made; it just seems to be,§ . ※It glazes the eyes and the mind.§Even fellow film-makers stuck the boot in. Motormouth Quentin Tarantino, on the Croisette with his era-defining crime movie Reservoir Dogs, blabbed that one of his favourite directors had ※disappeared so far up his own ass that I have no desire to see another  movie until I hear something different§.After that, Fire Walk With Me was ignored for years, until a revival of its fortunes earlier this decade thanks to critics such as Mark Kermode, who  as ※maligned but frankly marvellous§ in a 2012 video series. The following year, the Village Voice＊s  declared it ※Lynch＊s masterpiece§ in a reappraisal that applauded the film＊s refusal to offer comfort or easy answers to life＊s horrors. Revisiting Fire Walk With Me today, it is clear the film was a huge creative gamble, paddling in the shallows of the horror genre but never taking the plunge. The opening 25 minutes discombobulate the viewer. The setting is Deer Meadow, a sort of alternate, hellish , where two FBI agents are investigating the murder of drifter Teresa Banks (Pamela Gidley). The only connecting thread to the established plot is Banks＊s relationship with Laura＊s father Leland. Visually, the evergreen look of the show is completely absent, the screen instead awash with the glow of ambers and gold, or eye-popping neon light. Lynch also had Angelo Badalamenti compose a new theme; a haunting, woozy jazz piece.Lynch could only get away with so much on network television, but the big screen afforded him an opportunity to truly show off Twin Peaks＊ dark side. The town＊s seedy underbelly was picked at like a scab, while the horrors suffered by Laura Palmer were lingered on with surgical focus. Lindsay Hallam, author of a forthcoming book on the film, thinks the allergic reaction in 1992 was in part because ※Lynch does not let us off the hook 每 we are taken so far into Laura＊s experience, without any respite and with none of the humour associated with the series§.Putting Laura Palmer front and centre gave the actor Sheryl Lee the chance to play more than the dead girl wrapped in plastic or her buttoned-down doppelganger cousin Maddy. Laura is reintroduced as alone, afraid and emotionally broken, traumatised by the abuse she is experiencing at the hands of her demonically possessed father. Lee＊s capturing of Laura＊s inner turmoil and fatalism is virtuosic.But Fire Walk With Me is not just an artistic triumph in its own right, it＊s the key to the entire Twin Peaks universe. At the annual  event in January, the usually tight-lipped Lynch explained that Fire Walk With Me was ※very much important§ to understanding the events of the new season. He wasn＊t kidding. They links are numerous: the meaning of ※blue rose§; the function of the jade ring; the use of electricity as a malevolent supernatural force; what became of Laura＊s missing diary pages. Most crucially, Phillip Jeffries＊s ambiguous line ※We live inside a dream§ has been revisited in what might be Lynch＊s attempt at a unifying theory. ※We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives inside the dream,§ Monica Bellucci, playing herself in a black and-white-dream sequence, tells Gordon Cole (played by Lynch), at one point in the new season.The direction taken by the current series 每 which is nothing at all like the original 每 owes everything to the groundwork laid by the prequel. ※I＊ll see you again in 25 years,§ Red Room Laura in finale of the second season. A quarter of a century on, the film is being rightly rediscovered. It took a long time, and it took its toll on  																																											"

" dying sheikh must be taken to the medieval Moroccan city of Sijilmasa, despite the decidedly rocky route. When the sheikh dies prematurely, rogues Ahmed (Ahmed Hammoud) and Said (Said Aagli) offer to transport the deceased for a fee 每 running into Shakib Ben Omar＊s guardian angel along the way. Plot is not the takeaway from , which reminded me of Abbas Kiarostami＊s , another slow-winding ramble through the mountains. The pleasure is in the crunchy, wind-bitten soundscapes and the texture of Oliver Laxe＊s compositions; landscapes that encompass tiny figurines dwarfed by mountains.

"fter announcing a  back in 2013, Steven Soderbergh is officially back in the director＊s chair (though it＊s not as if he＊s been away these past four years, having worked on TV projects  and  as well as  sequel ).Despite the title＊s suggestion, the Logan family could not be called lucky 每 Adam Driver＊s droll bartender Clyde lost an arm in the Iraq war, while big brother Jimmy (Channing Tatum as an ursine, divorced dad) has been fired from his job fixing sinkholes. Younger sister Mellie (Riley Keough, tough, funny and underused here) fares a little better as a joyriding hairdresser, but she＊s not superstitious. The three follow Jimmy＊s to-do list (※Rules For Robbing a Bank§) to stage a heist in a bid to rewrite their family history, enlisting the help of local prison inmate and explosives expert Joe Bang (Daniel Craig). It＊s bizarre to see Bond with a bleached buzz cut (not to mention a tiny tattoo of a star adorning his left cheekbone), but he＊s one of the very best things here, whether flirting with a nurse in a slightly off southern drawl or fashioning a gummy bear bomb (※it＊s an equal exchange of ions!§).Though the prison break and heist scenes are slickly and efficiently staged, the film＊s great strength is its good nature. Soderbergh sets his crime caper in West Virginia (cue John Denver＊s Take Me Home, Country Roads), and features a beauty pageant, a saloon bar and a cameo from country-pop star LeAnn Rimes. But not all the film＊s jokes are about the south; there＊s a warm wackiness to the humour 每 like the way  slowly draws out the word ※cauliflower§ (itself triggering the heist), or a gag about the  books.

"n a house in Surrey in 1911, the small talk is about newfangled electric lighting, and yet for a modern audience ＊s superb and seldom performed  (1924) takes place in what we might like to think of as a dark age, in which English women were treated with condescension by men and unenlightened on the subject of money. This is a play about the various ways in which women were subjugated. The action takes place in a sombre drawing room where everything has weight: furniture, conversation, atmosphere (design by fastidious Tim Hatley, master of mahogany).On press night, when Will Keen＊s Eustace took a bow, he was 每 and I＊ve never heard this happen outside pantomime 每 booed. A better compliment than applause, this was in response to his outstanding performance as a manipulative, abject, self-serving husband. Eustace (married to the stepmother of the title) is a cad and a bounder, and Keen comically covers for his character＊s morals with a delinquent＊s prancing, a defensive quickstep 每 he is a middle-aged, not-so-artful dodger. He smokes his pipe luxuriously, laughs mirthlessly, and does shock as well as any actor I have seen. When he hears that he is not inheriting his aunt＊s money and, later, when he understands his wife has been unfaithful to him, there is something comically clockwork about Eustace＊s gait as he staggers away from blows.Richard Eyre is at his masterly best as an orchestrator here, harmoniously overseeing moral chaos. Sowerby 每 best known for her 1912 play  每 shows that it is not enough to have a purse of one＊s own; a woman must have control of the purse strings (Eustace yanks at these). The play reminds us that money is always about more than money 每 control, for instance. Eustace＊s old aunt (Joanna David) has made her peace with financial incomprehension. For her, ignorance is, if not bliss, preferable to the truth of understanding Eustace＊s profligacy.But Lois, the stepmother, never chose to be in the dark. Unaware that Eustace married her for her inheritance, she is a shrewd clothes designer, a breadwinner with no control of the bread. A snappy dresser, Lois can be snappy in the other sense, although manifestly devoted to her stepdaughters. She is beautifully interpreted by  每 a mix of vulnerability and resolution. When her stepdaughter Monica wishes to marry against Eustace＊s wishes, Lois boldly agrees to a ?10,000 dowry (multiply cash figures by 100 for their equivalent today, Eyre advises in the programme). In flapper＊s pink, Eve Ponsonby＊s delicious Monica resembles a recently hatched butterfly with nowhere to land. Her sister Betty, in frumpier frock, is more stalled, charmingly played by Macy Nyman. Monica＊s fiance, Cyril (Samuel Valentine), brings an exuberant gaucherie to his suit. Peter (David Bark-Jones) is excellent as Lois＊s steady, debonair, neighbourly love interest (he knows about the other sort of interest too, yet proves no better than her husband at sharing what he knows).The play becomes as tense as a thriller, with traces of Chekhov, Ibsen and Henry James 每 although the characters are less developed. The writing is satisfyingly direct. The line that best expresses the play＊s tenor (and one most of the women could pose to most of the men) is Lois＊s simple question: ※Why didn＊t you tell me?§ It is a measure of the subtlety of the production that, by the end, one is reflecting that this hugely enjoyable, tremendously well-performed play is not altogether a period piece after all.

"hat  doesn＊t feel like news. That this new ship bobbing on the veritable seas of Austen remakes and rehashes across TV, film and publishing, is promised to be ※darker§ and ※less bonnet-y§ doesn＊t make it seem any fresher. Every reboot these days seems to be geared towards grittiness, to suit our troubled age. But don＊t viewers deserve something truly fresh exploring these themes? Rather than mushing a 200-year-old book into a shape that resembles what we know today, like a particularly miserable papier-mache.A great adaptation can give an audience insight into a particular era, or shed new light on an original text for modern sensibilities. The queer Victorian vaudeville of  has stayed with me for years. Broadway musical Hamilton, using hip-hop to tell the story of a founding father has been a wild success, and with the recent TV version of The Handmaid＊s Tale, shows that audiences need not be familiar with the original versions in order to love them.But as much as there is to admire in Austen＊s writing, I＊m utterly bored by the adaptations, however slickly shot or cleverly written. Many are insufferably twee, with bonnets aplenty but little of Austen＊s wry insight into personal and social quandaries.Austen will not suffer; her fans are legion and whether they came to her from books or TV, there is no doubt she＊s comfortably settled as a favourite on the nation＊s shelves. (I once even spotted a birdbath for sale that boasted the selling point of being ※suitable for a Austen tableau§.) It＊s wonderful to see the lasting cultural legacy of any writer, especially one who wrote during a time when her own name was occasionally left off book covers, lest her femaleness deter readers.Considering what a successful adaptation can do for a classic novel 每  每 what might a TV show do for the sales of lesser-known or even contemporary authors? TV commissioning can be shamefully risk-averse, and historical dramas continue to perform well. In my former publishing job, it was unsurprising but still dismaying to hear TV researchers at a pitching session admit that they were only looking for well-known, historical fiction. TV needs a bolder approach to deciding which books land in prime time. For any bigwigs reading this, here are the risk-taking books I＊d like to see adapted, difficult as they may be: Donna Tartt＊s The Secret History, because after I read it I couldn＊t stop mentally casting it, peering at people＊s faces walking down the street; David Wojnarowicz＊s memoir Close to the Knives, which seethingly documents the injustices of the AIDS crisis of 1970s New York City; and Out by Natsuo Kirino, centred on four women working in a bento box factory, could be an engrossing probe into the dark entanglement of female friendship. I＊d also love to see the claustrophobic tension of a father-and-sons road trip on screen if One of the Boys by Daniel Magariel was adapted, and the paranoia of Samanta Schweblin＊s Fever Dream. If any of these proved as compulsively watchable as they were readable, a producer would be on to a winner. Books about displacement and migration would make for timely adaptation, such as Stefan Zweig＊s heartrending, home-seeking 1920s/30s novellas, or Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie＊s Americanah, weaving different immigrant experiences together. Immediately intriguing as a premise, these would go some way to diversifying historical drama from the white and rich inhabitants of stately homes, as well as containing a clear link to contemporary discussions about immigration and our understanding of the part it has played in our country＊s economic and cultural life.Or perhaps they could take a line out of Austen＊s book 每 Northanger Abbey, to be precise. That gothic satire took its own inspiration from the delicious gloominess of books from earlier generations, transforming those dark tales into something fresh and funny. Austen banished cobwebs with a lightness of style and wit to reach a contemporary audience 每 rather than the other way around. And we should do the same. No dark Austen, please 每 and while we＊re at it, let＊s put down the bonnets and find something new to put on.																																											"
"here＊s a scene in  that features Tom Cruise＊s  downing tequila after a successful international drug drop while Talking Heads＊ Slippery People blares away in the background.

Interspersed with animated inserts 每 coloured a sickly yellow 每 that crudely illustrate the film＊s backdrop of cold war politics, Liman＊s film is a playful, if not especially probing, jab in the ribs of Reagan＊s America and its interventionist politics.

McKinnon gets a couple of good lines as Jess＊s Aussie friend Pip (※singer-songwriter is the dream; party clown is the reality§), but even the film＊s saltiness feels safe. Gags about piss and penis pasta, vibrators and?self-waxing strips confuse vagina-related ※jokes§ with a feminist?perspective, as signalled by Jess＊s plan to win a game of beer pong ※for womankind§ in the opening scene.

Still, she must (and does) duck and dodge the masked snipers that spray bullets in her direction 每 like Lara Croft meets Taylor Swift, flanked by burly ex-soldier Stupe (Dave Bautista). Jonathan Milott and Cary Murnion＊s action thriller inhabits a videogame perspective, keeping Lucy in frame and moving with her as though she＊s an avatar we＊re operating. A neat trick, but it gets old fast, much like the constant cacophony of -style gunfire. The film works as a hollow tale of ※resistance§, with less of a stake in the politics of collective action than in the visceral business of individual survival.

"I first heard about Aids as a serious issue in 1985. I didn＊t know much about gay culture at the time; I didn＊t have any gay friends. But the attacks on gay people motivated me. Some people thought anyone with HIV should be left to their own fate, and there were certainly people in government who felt uneasy about homosexuality. I thought 每 this is unjust.We had no knowledge of this disease and no drugs with which to treat it. I was reading a note the other day from the chief medical officer at the time and some of the predictions as to what could happen were terrifying 每 we were talking millions and millions of people becoming infected. That＊s why we launched what is still the biggest public health campaign there＊s ever been in this country with leaflets sent out to every home.Not everyone was on board with the idea. Margaret Thatcher wasn＊t a natural supporter. She had the view that if you told young people about HIV and unprotected sex, you＊d be telling them about things they didn＊t know about, and . I always thought that was an eccentric view. We were warning people, not urging them. The TV adverts we ran were certainly hard-hitting. There was no point spending a load of money to send out innocuous adverts. We did follow-up research that said 90% of the public recognised the advert and a vast number changed their behaviour because of it. Columnists at the time said we were going over the top but the public didn＊t agree. It was a life and death situation. I＊d been to San Francisco, where the wards were full of young men dying. Same in Germany, same in the United Kingdom. There was no time to think about whether it might offend one or two people. And history shows we were right 每 people took care and HIV cases went down.I＊ve heard it said that the advert was so scary it put a whole generation off having sex. Well I don＊t think there＊s any evidence that it actually did! What I do know is that I get letters from time to time from people who say thank you 每 that it saved their life. In politics, you don＊t get that sort of letter very often.My agency, , had been working on health campaigns for the government for five or so years 每 nurse recruitment, blood donations, rubella epidemics. So when Aids hit the news they turned to us. The big problem was that nobody knew anything about it. It was like an alien plague. Where did it come from? How big would it get? Panic and speculation was spreading.Norman Fowler and his team gathered a hefty bunch of people around 每 people from the prison services, the army, immigration and social services 每 to discuss how to tackle it. It was agreed we would attack the disease itself rather than the people who had it, which is how other agencies might have gone about it.Nobody even knew what to call it. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome wasn＊t very catchy, but when they came up with the acronym Aids it was something we could work with. For the posters we went for modern typography 每 we wanted people to know this was a new thing, not just another bunch of medical letters 每with an underscore on the word Aids. Almost like a logo. The phrase ※don＊t die of ignorance§ was coined by [fellow designer] David O＊Connor-Thompson. The death part was important 每 and knowledge was really the only thing we had at the time to defend ourselves against it.With the TV advert we knew we had about 40 seconds to get people＊s attention. That＊s not enough time to explain anything complex 每 we just needed viewers to make sure they read the leaflets that would be arriving through their door. Scaring people was deliberate. The director  was specifically chosen for his doom and gloom sci-fi aesthetic. It starts with a volcano because it＊s about the end of the world. Originally it was even scarier: we had metallic sirens blaring like the beginning of a nuclear war. But Thatcher thought we were overdramatising it and she was probably right. If we＊d kept it like that I think everyone would have headed for the beaches.People remember the tombstone but there were a lot of smaller, softer campaigns that went with it 每 tailored messages for people who might be affected such as dentists or tattooists. We had to inform people and reassure them 每 we didn＊t want hairdressers shutting down because suddenly people were scared of catching something from scissors. We also had  with the campaign slogan. I know some people didn＊t like that 每 receiving a letter from their auntie with ※don＊t die of ignorance§ stamped on it.I knew at the time that what we were working on would be history so I kept a lot of stuff 每 including an actual black granite Aids tombstone. Not the original 每 that was three tonnes 每 but I＊ve got one in lock-up that＊s about a hundredweight. I had to get it out the other day because it＊s being exhibited, so it was in the garden when my builder arrived. He jumped back and shuddered when he saw it 每 so it can definitely still scare people.   is at the Wellcome Collection, London, from 7 September.																																											"
"he  brings one of pop＊s most idiosyncratic songwriting partnerships to a close. With Becker＊s knotty soloing and funky bass licks paired with Donald Fagen＊s organ tones and earnest, knowing croon, the pair stand alone: too literate and socially conscious for soft rock, too naff for hard, and all the better for it. Fagen will hopefully continue to perform, but either way, they leave behind a magical canon 每 the selection here is a very small part.A quintessential lead guitar line floats over Becker＊s dancing bass: charged with both the inquisition of jazz and the direction of rock, it meanders with purpose around acoustic strumming, and a soulful vocal line by Fagen. The resultant blissed-out vibe pre-empts the Balearic slickness of Chris Rea or Steve Winwood, a good decade before their pomp; it also jars with the lyrics, which pour icy realism onto the idiot warmth of the hippie dream. On the 1972 album Can＊t Buy a Thrill, Only a Fool Would Say That segues into the rollicking Reelin＊ in the Years, encapsulating both sides of the band 每 their smoothness offset with an almost wacky energy. Elliot Randall＊s guitar stutters into life with an affecting gawkiness utterly in opposition to the swagger of the typical American axeman, further inverting expectations by frontloading the song with a guitar solo. Where usually the solo is a kind of euphoric realisation of a song＊s building energy, here it becomes (as in jazz) a place for the song to work out its melodic identity. When Fagen＊s perfect chorus line emerges, it hits like a rainbow after a squall.Another of Becker＊s greatest melodic triumphs, from the album Aja, is paired with not only another virtuosic solo from session musician Jay Graydon but also lovely, featherlight funk plucking in the verses. The track has become a firm favourite for sampling by the hip-hop community: De La Soul sampled it for summer jam Eye Know, while MF Doom sampled Black Cow from the same album. Kanye West meanwhile slightly pitched up the chorus from Kid Charlemagne, off previous album The Royal Scam, for his track Champion, having won over Becker and Fagen with .You can see why hip-hop artists were : the hip-hop samples were part of a symbiotic relationship with black music, as Becker and Fagen nodded to jazz, funk and gospel 每 sometimes, as on The Royal Scam, all on the same track. The uplifting gospel swell at the peak of the chorus is savage irony from the pair, in a song that laments the plight of ethnic minorities in New York.Their ultra-smooth 1980 album Gaucho featured 42 session musicians and showcases one of the less appealing facets of soft rock: immaculate production put to the service of underwritten songs. Becker＊s mania is also ironed and starched, and on this and their early 00s return to recording he＊s mostly content to play rhythm licks. But Glamour Profession is excellent, skewering the shallow pretence of Los Angeles not only in the lyrics but in the very form of the song itself: a gorgeously cheesy disco strut perfect for poolside cocktails.

"hristopher Shinn＊s , receiving its premiere at the Almeida, is an admirably ambitious attempt to look at the reasons for violence in the modern world. Ian Rickson directs this intense, far-flung, multitasking play with seamless elegance. Luke, a Silicon Valley billionaire, who has made his money in artificial intelligence and rocket science, believes he has had a message from God to go forth and investigate violence. Ben Whishaw is outstanding in a contradictory role 每 messianic, tentative and self-involved. He travels the US, interviews the parents of the boy responsible for a high school shooting, discusses sexual violence on a university campus, becomes a celebrity. He visits ※Equator§ 每 presumably a version of Amazon and presented in Ultz＊s satisfying design with a curved sliver of carrot as logo 每 creepily familiar.A first-rate cast ensures momentum. Amanda Hale is excellent as Sheila, Luke＊s associate and wannabe lover. She and Luke confer earnestly like patients listing symptoms. Kevin Harvey is brilliant in multiple roles, but especially as Equator＊s CEO, moving sinuously between oily charm and stony hostility. Nancy Crane is priceless as a university dean, Fehinti Balogun powerful as Tim (former friend to the high school assassin).

"avid Harrower＊s  (1995) is a tense, violent, unrelenting piece. One white feather after another falls on to a dark stage 每 a chicken is being plucked. Set in medieval times, the play explores the marriage between a young woman (superb and courageous Judith Roddy) and her ploughman husband, Pony William (compelling Christian Cooke). Life is feral 每 between a rock and a hard place. A handful of carrots, an old sheet, the aforementioned chicken. What is there to do other than toil, copulate, quarrel and eat? But life changes after the young woman hears laughter ringing from the stables where her husband keeps his horses.Harrower is interested in the way that words transform experience 每 as does a written record (the pen is a means here to rising above your lot). The young woman＊s language is inchoate, she is engaged in a wordsearch abetted by a lonely miller (a powerfully still Matt Ryan). Ya?l Farber directs surely, and the fluent physicality of the evening is striking (movement director: Imogen Knight). Designer Soutra Gilmour honours the play＊s darker purpose with a mighty millstone, and occasional flurries of white flour punctuate this nightmarish Miller＊s Tale.

"n the face of several grief manuals that have been published this year, Richard Lloyd Parry＊s account of the and its aftermath arrives like a ghost at the feast, its mind set not on platitudes, but on the very hardest kind of truth-telling. As he notes late on in his singular and powerfully strange book,?it is perfectly true that people can be brought together by catastrophe; they may even come to see such unhappy solidarity as a comfort. But the balance of disaster is,?he adds, ※never positive§.How could it be? In the villages where he spent many months talking to survivors, Lloyd Parry was struck again and again by both their fortitude and their extreme generosity. It was chastening to hear them apologise for their inability to provide him with hospitality. Nevertheless, he will not avoid the facts. Ultimately, the tsunami did to their connectedness the same thing that it did to their roads and bridges. Divided according to the measure of their loss 每 ※a spectrum of blackness§ that came down to the horrible matter of what each of them had left after the water receded 每 they slowly fell to quarrelling, to bitterness and envy.This is not, then, a book of easy consolation. It is, as it should be, painful to read. All the same, every time I think of it, I＊m filled with wonderment (and, I suppose, professional envy). Lloyd Parry is such a good reporter: discreet yet unsentimental; ever-present, but able also swiftly to absent himself from the page. He never overwrites. His capacity for intimacy with relative strangers is a kind of gift. But there is something else, too. As an Englishman in , albeit one who has lived in the country for many years, he has an abiding sense of the ways in which its culture remains (to him, as to us) other, and something about this difference 每 the fact, perhaps, that it keeps him on the alert 每 works to his benefit. Here, amid all the misery, are miracles. Not once does he write a truism; the reader looks in vain for a single example of half-baked psychobabble.On that fateful morning in early March, Lloyd Parry, a foreign correspondent for the , arrived a little late at his 10th floor office in Tokyo, having made a detour to see the ※paddling arms§ of his soon-to-be-born son on a small screen in a hospital. Soon, he felt the vibrations that signalled an earthquake. At first, he was blase. He was used to this by now; tremors are not so unusual in Japan. But as the minutes passed, his sang-froid deserted him. Though his building, like the city around him, survived unscathed 每 the epicentre was far away, in the region called T身hoku 每 it was nevertheless an extremely powerful quake: the biggest ever to have struck Japan. By the next morning, he was on his way to the ruined north-east coast where, in the tsunami that followed it, .Such a number is inconceivably vast, and the only thing to do, if one hopes to make sense of it as a writer, is to zone in on half a dozen or so individual stories. This Lloyd Parry duly does, though it＊s a less clinical process than I＊ve made it sound: in the end, it＊s as if he simply can＊t drag himself away from the Okawa primary school where 74 of its 108 students, and 10 of its 11 teachers, were drowned, or suffocated in the mud. There is a story here: some years after the tsunami, , believing that the school＊s staff had hesitated too long before leading them to higher ground.But what really interests and moves?Lloyd Parry is not the uncovering of lies, but the weight of the families＊ loss.

The dead play a continuing role in domestic life: their descendants offer up food and prayers in exchange for which their ancestors bestow on them good fortune. The tsunami wreaked havoc on the religion of the ancestors, sweeping away these altars (some may have died because they went back to retrieve the ihai 每 an action akin, in their eyes, to saving a relative＊s life).But more than this, it left the ancestors ※as helpless as that of orphaned children§. With their descendants gone, who would care for them? And who would perform the necessary rituals to placate the unhappy spirits of those who had died so suddenly? No wonder T身hoku, an emblematically lonely region that was once associated with goblins, suddenly swirled with ghosts. People＊s unreason yoked itself, in the aftermath of the tsunami, to their time-honoured culture. They were haunted, just like Fukuji in , a book of T身hoku folklore that recounts the story of a man who survived the Sanriku tsunami of 1896.Lloyd Parry＊s accounts of the pastoral work of men such as Taio Kaneta, a local Buddhist priest, and Nagoya Kawakami, a Protestant pastor,?and in particular of the exorcisms they were required to perform in the wake of such hauntings,?make for some of the most?profoundly eloquent sections of?his book.

"he descent of Orpheus into the underworld, a familiar subject taken from Ovid and celebrating the power of music, was turned into a two-act opera around 1686-7 by Marc-Antoine Charpentier, better known for his sacred music. This short drama, possibly unfinished, was written for the 10 singers employed by Charpentier＊s Parisian patron, Madame de Guise 每 here the  directed by S谷bastien Dauc谷. Orph谷e is cast for countertenor (Robert Getchell), offset by the dark colours of three accompanying bass viols. Throughout, the writing is rich, unusual yet immediate.

"aving been reduced to a four-part harmony following the departure of Camila Cabello, US girl band ＊s self-titled third album simultaneously feels like a statement of intent and a hastily cobbled together swansong. There are flashes of brilliance, on the low-slung, sweaty R&B of He Like That (which samples MC Hammer), Don＊t Say You Love Me＊s airy heartbreak and the Skrillex-assisted , which features scattergun drum-claps slowly distorting into a head-spinning cacophony.

Don＊t Believe the Fife could play the part here - everything from a weakly punned title to its move from moody atmospherics to cathartic rock climax feels definitively . Instead, it illustrates how poorly structured the rest of the album is. Songs meander between uninvolving minimalism and introverted stadium prog without raising any of the necessary joy or transcendence. Old Poisons raises some of the 90s indie furies the band seems to have outgrown, but elsewhere music that＊s supposedly sparse ends up feeling hollow.																																											"
"The Yellow Pages will stop printing from January 2019 after more than five decades, its owner Yell has announced. Yell has taken the decision to fully digitise the business, ending the publication＊s 51-year run. The first of the 104 final editions will be distributed in Kingston in January 2018, and the last will be sent out a year later in Brighton, where it was first published in 1966.The company will print 23m copies of the final editions, which Yell hopes will become a souvenir.Richard Hanscott, CEO of Yell said: After 51 years in production Yellow Pages is a household name and we＊re proud to say that we still have customers who＊ve been with us from the very first Yellow Pages edition in 1966. How many brands can say they＊ve had customers with them for over 50 years?§The publication became famous for its advertisements, including the ※JR Hartley§ campaign in the 1980s and the ※French Polisher§.It was a vital tool for finding service providers and tradespeople, but the rise of social media and Google have reduced demand for printed directories.Yell, part of Hibu Group, says it aspires to ※help a million businesses be found, chosen and trusted by more customers online by 2020§.Instead of the Yellow Pages, Yell will offer a free listing to businesses on yell.com.※Like many businesses, Yell has found that succeeding in digital demands constant change and innovation,§ Hanscott continued. ※We＊re well placed to continue to help local businesses and consumers be successful online, both now and in the future.＊＊ In recent years, the directory has caused environmental concerns, prompting the launch of the Say No to Phonebooks campaign in 2009, which called for an ※opt-in§ scheme whereby only those who want these directories left by their door would receive them.At the time, the Yell Group, then maker of Yellow Pages, maintained it was ※among the most sustainable companies in the world,§ adding: ※Our directories are produced in an environmentally responsible way and are 100% recyclable. In common with other members of the Data Publishers Association, we maintain an opt-out scheme that enables consumers to choose not to receive a directory.§The Yellow Pages telephone directory came about in 1883 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, when a printer producing a directory ran out of white paper and used yellow instead. The first Yellow Pages publication was formed three years later. In the UK in 1966, the  first launched the directory, which later became part of British Telecom.The Business Pages was launched in the mid 1980s when British Telecom was privatised by Margaret Thatcher＊s Conservative government, growing in popularity with a series of funny adverts.

"ith its shadowy John le Carr谷 atmosphere, communist eastern Europe was a melancholy place in the late 1980s. The Estonian capital of Tallinn typically teemed with Russian money-changers (※Comrade, we do deal?§) and prostitutes from Uzbekistan and other parts of Islamic central Asia. The television in my hotel room was detuned from Finnish to Soviet channels but I was able to pick up  or  from across the Gulf of Finland. Guests were forbidden to visit the 21st floor, which officially did not exist. KGB officers (it is now known) had a room up there where they monitored Helsinki radio waves and the hotel＊s 60-odd bugged rooms. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the matchbox-sized Minox camera had been invented in Tallinn (by one Walter?Zapp, in 1936): it was a favourite?with cold war spies.As Odd Arne Westad relates in , Estonia was a display case for long-held plan to transform the monolithic face of communism and east-west tensions. In the last days of the cold war, the Russian leader made much of the ※Estonian model§, by which individuals were allowed to make profits at work but without surrendering (too much) to capitalist?enterprise. Ahead of the game, Tallinn instituted a number of?self-financing co-operatives ranging?from a public lavatory (where you could relieve yourself for 20 kopeks) to a pie-shop selling cheburechnaya Tatar meat pasties. The singular world of the cold war meant that one half of Europe was dining out expensively, while the other?half was standing in queues for?meat pasties.In November 1989, however,  and Soviet authority began to unravel. On Christmas Day that historic year, the Romanian communist dictator Nicolae Ceau?escu and his wife, Elena, were executed by a military firing squad. By the time the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania petitioned for independence soon after, the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse; in 1991 the Russian president Boris Yeltsin (reportedly fired up by vodka) officially put paid to the USSR＊s existence when he outlawed the Communist party within Russia. Considering the magnitude of what happened, surprisingly few people died in the twilight months of the cold?war.Westad, the Norwegian-born scholar who heads US-Asia Relations at Harvard University, reminds us that the term ※cold war§ was coined by George Orwell in 1945 to denote capitalist-socialist antagonisms between the United States and the USSR after the defeat of Nazi Germany. It is often asked how a cold?war was possible when Stalin and Franklin Roosevelt?had been such strong allies in the second world war, yet their alliance was entirely opportunist.Until 1941, when Hitler decided to attack the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany (not the US) was communist Russia＊s chief ally. A secret protocol in the 1939 Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact had left Stalin free to annex Estonia, Latvia, western Lithuania and eastern Poland, while Hitler was able to overrun western Poland. Beyond their ideological differences, Hitler and Stalin were united in their determination to carve up the Baltic states and Poland between themselves.?In many ways, Westad suggests, Hitler was the only person?Stalin ever trusted. He distrusted?Trotsky, his former allies Zinoviev and Bukharin, the politburo, his generals and even his own family. Yet in the F邦hrer the great? (※Boss§, as Westad calls Stalin) placed?a?rare confidence. Intelligence reports had reached Stalin?about Hitler＊s impending invasion, yet he chose to ignore them. At its peak between 1945 and 1989, the cold war was born of these geopolitical complexities and miscalculated allegiances.In well-researched if occasionally bland-sounding pages (※The world had changed tremendously in the 1970s and early 1980s, and in the late 1980s it changed even more§), Westad chronicles US-Soviet strategic?competition in the south-east?Asian theatre and in the building?of?the Berlin Wall in 1961. In many ways, the cold war was a continuation of the old European colonial enterprise and the bankrupt imperialisms of the western powers, Westad argues. An important facet of the cold war was Russia＊s competition?with America into space. In?1961 the Soviets stole a march on their rivals when Yuri Gagarin became?the first man to break the bonds?of the Earth＊s gravity. Notably, both the US and the USSR co-opted ex-Nazi German?ballistics experts to engineer their space programmes. Distinctions between the ideological left?and right were not always obvious in?the cold war.Today, western attempts to contain radical Islamism continue an us-and-them mentality. Angry Muslims decry the perceived depredations of US imperialism and the?infidel free market; the threat posed?by suicide bombers makes the old east-west rivalries look almost manageable by comparison.

"Impassioned pleas for acceptance and inclusivity dominated this year＊s  video music awards, a ceremony traditionally associated with flashier water cooler moments.Artists including Jared Leto, Pink, Kesha and Logic all used their time on stage as a platform to shed light on issues that included suicide awareness, mental health and body image. The night also featured an appearance from , who was killed in Charlottesville. kicked off the night, playing news footage of a police brutality report interspersed with Fox News commentary before delivering an audacious, high-energy set, including stunt performers crawling up and down a wall filled with fire. The rapper, who led the night with eight nominations, won for best video, best hip-hop video, best art direction, best visual effects, best cinematography and best direction.He lost out on the award for best artist of the year to . Following in the footsteps of MTV＊s movie and TV awards this year, the night did away with gendered categories, with male and female performers up for the same prize.※You know what brings us together and finally unites us? Music,§ said the host, , while taking a light-hearted stab at the state of affairs in the US under the new president. ※Even in the apocalypse, we deserve good music,§ she joked.But many of Perry＊s skits failed to create much of a reaction, including a belated Fyre festival sketch, a fake ※social media baby§ vomiting over her dress and a pre-filmed segment involving Fred Armisen as a musical guru. An appearance from Billy on the Street＊s Billy Eichner, harassing Perry outside of her trailer, was somewhat more successful. ※Blink twice if you＊re really JonBenet Ramsay,§ he asked, referring to a .The night＊s most powerful moment came when Robert Wright Lee, a pastor and descendant of the confederate general Robert E Lee, appeared on stage. ※It is my moral duty to speak out against racism, America＊s original sin,§ he said, while bemoaning the use of his great-great-uncle as a symbol of hatred and white supremacy. He then introduced Susan Bro.※Only 15 days ago my daughter was killed as she protested racism,§ she said. ※I miss her but I know she＊s here tonight. I＊ve been deeply moved to see people across the world find inspiration in her courage.§ She then used her moment to announce the Heather Heyer Foundation, a non-profit organization that will help fund scholarships to help people fight against hatred. ※I want people to know that Heather never marched alone,§ she said. ※She was always followed by people from every race and every background in this country.§There was a similar plea for acceptance from Paris Jackson, Michael Jackson＊s daughter, as she presented the award for best pop video to Fifth Harmony. ※If we were all able to stand up united as one, our impact would be huge,§ she said. ※And that＊s not fake news.§ While discussing white supremacists, she went on to state that people should have ※zero tolerance for their violence, their hatred and their discrimination§. Leto delivered a tribute to the Linkin Park singer, Chester Bennington, who died last month. ※Chester was my friend as he was to so many and witnessing his life taught me important things, especially about working relentlessly, pursuing dreams and being kind and caring while doing it,§ he said.He went on to stress the importance of seeking help for viewers struggling with depression. ※You are not alone,§ he said. ※There is always a way forward§.A similar note was struck in a performance by the rapper Logic with Khalid, who won for best new artist, and the best dance video winner, Alessia Cara. The song 1-800-273-8255, named after the US suicide hotline, was introduced by . ※We all have struggles and as long as you never give up on yourself, light will break through the darkness,§ she said to great applause.The three performers were surrounded by tearful suicide attempt survivors. ※I believe that we are all born equal but we are not treated equal,§ Logic told the audience at the end.This year＊s Michael Jackson Video Vanguard award, a lifetime achievement of sorts, was handed to , who performed a medley of tracks while on a car that ※flew§ through the audience and drove past a series of nude models dancing with chainsaws. Her outfit was also adorned with a slogan reading: ※Wake the fuck up.§During her speech, she told a story about her six-year-old daughter telling her she thought she was ugly and looked like a boy. The singer then used a PowerPoint presentation showing androgynous rock stars and artists who ※live their truth§ to teach her the importance of being different. ※We don＊t change, we take the gravel and the shell and we create a pearl,§ she said. ※We help other people to change so that they can see more kinds of beauty.§MTV also invited transgender military members to the event after Donald Trump announced that they would no longer be permitted to serve. ※Any patriot who is putting their own life at risk to fight for our freedom and stand for equality is a hero at MTV, and to young people everywhere,§ said the MTV president, Chris McCarthy.Other winners included Taylor Swift and Zayn Malik, who won best collaboration for their 50 Shades Darker duet.

"A theatre company says it ※will not be silenced§ after members of the cast, crew and audience attending a play about a gay couple had their tyres slashed.At least 12 people had their tyres punctured or slashed at Lane Cove  Company＊s penultimate performance of Holding the Man on Saturday. This month posters for the play were were ripped down.The production is based on Timothy Conigrave＊s 1995 autobiographical book about his 15-year relationship with John Caleo.Lochie Beh, president of the theatre company, said: ※In today＊s society and especially in the Lane Cove community this behaviour needs to be condemned. Whether one supports the content of the play we are producing or not, this behaviour is unacceptable. Having our posters torn down is one thing, but being targeted by deliberate vandalism is quite another.※Not only were members of the audience targeted but some of these members travelled from interstate to see the show and had to then find accommodation for the evening, after midnight, after they had tried every avenue to repair the tyres.Beh said he could only assume the latest attack is some sort a hate crime. ※We realise that the play has a little bit of controversy to it but we＊ve not had anybody that＊s actually come forward to say we are not happy about you putting on this show,§ he said. ※We can only feel like we are being attacked for a reason that we＊re actually unsure of.§The theatre company said in a statement: ※There is no doubt that the whole  and  is fuelling the flames of hatred and making people take stands.§ to contribute to the repairs and emergency accommodation for those hit by the attack.

"t＊s raining in the morning ahead of the Our Souls at Night screening. The bedraggled delegates gather outside the theatre. There is a click of umbrellas, a squelch of wet shoes. These people are in dire need of some cinematic chicken soup, a spoonful of comfort food to soothe aching limbs and revive flagging spirits. They are soon to receive rather more than a spoonful. It＊s about to come down in bucket-loads.Adapted from , Our Souls at Night is your classic Hollywood weepie, so immaculately played that it confounds crass preconceptions. It arrived in Venice saddled with a premise that could hardly sound more cloying, together with an unfortunate title that has had hardened British hacks giggling like schoolboys at the back of the class. Critics get their first sniff of Our Souls at Night! Two thumbs up: Our Souls at Night! But Ritesh Batra＊s film comes cynic-proofed. It won me over from the very first scene.Louis (Robert Redford) is a widower who lives on the sleepy fringes of small-town Colorado, where he is unable to get much shut-eye of his own. He＊s always up before the sun comes up, with the radio on and the newspaper open, just another lonesome old man living an Edward Hopper existence. Then one night there＊s a tap on the door and in walks Addie (Jane Fonda), who lives across the street and is in pretty much the same boat. Out of the blue, without preamble, Addie asks Louis if he wouldn＊t mind coming over to sleep with her. Not for the sex, just for the company, because she is lonely and the nights are the worst. It＊s a terrific opening gambit and Fonda plays it with aplomb. Her appeal is so nakedly sincere that something catches in your chest.※Talk to me,§ she says, once they are sitting in bed, and this is just what Louis does. He tells her of his extramarital affair and of his failed ambition to become a painter and she in turn tells him about her infant daughter, who was killed on the road. Batra cleverly frames these encounters as an intimate dialogue, like My Night With Maude or a co-counselling session in which the participants are candid and direct in a way they could never otherwise be. His film is at its most affecting during these hushed exchanges, in the weeks before Louis and Addie take the relationship out of doors, thrilling the curtain-twitchers and rubberneckers and the gossipy old crocks down at Frederick＊s cafe. Life moves on; wounds are healed. The pair are a secret, then a scandal. And then all of a sudden they＊re not news anymore, just another elderly couple pottering down Main Street.Batra made his reputation with , a charming Mumbai-set romance, and Our Souls at Night shares the same connective tissue. It is a graceful, easygoing September song of a film, complete with slide guitar and autumn leaves; the perfect late showcase for Redford and Fonda, more than 50 years after they appeared together in The Chase. Both give performances of such quiet conviction that it scarcely looks like acting at all. They keep the film honest when it turns more conventional and pitches towards soap opera. There＊s something moving about the sight of these two 60s poster-children grown old and careworn, and Batra＊s film no doubt is trading on that. But it also provides them with fresh challenges; allows them ample room to stretch and breathe and find their range. Overnight, in the dark, Louis and Addie murmur their secrets and tend their wounds. When they step out, hand-in hand, into the daylight, they look just as beautiful as they ever did.Our Souls at Night was showing at the  and will be available on Netflix from 29 September.

"It is being described by the very few who have seen dress rehearsals as a ※thriller§, ※the grief Hamlet§, and ※vibrant§ with an ※extraordinary§ central performance by its superstar lead.Sounds good? To see or not to see? Looking for a debit card? Well unless you were randomly selected for a ticket then forget about it. You will never see one of the most anticipated theatrical events of the year: HiddleHamlet.Tom Hiddleston on Friday night takes to the stage in London for his , as directed by Sir Kenneth Branagh. The production is raising funds for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada), and is staged in Rada＊s 160-seat Jerwood Vanbrugh theatre. It is running for only three weeks with tickets offered via a now closed lottery. Instead of the estimated 250,000 people who watched , on stage and , it will be seen by just short of 4,000.※What is exciting is to have a fundraiser which is also about the art,§ said the director of Rada, Edward Kemp. ※Sometimes it is about how can we extract as much cash from people as possible ＃ what has been thrilling about this is how do we do something which raises money for Rada and serves the values that we and the Kenneth Branagh theatre company stand for? It is piece of art, not just a big old gala.§Branagh became president of Rada about 18 months ago and Kemp recalled talking with him about directing a show, ※thinking it would be a third-year student production. He rang back a week later to say that he and Tom had been talking.§Branagh had, in fact, been talking to Hiddleston for 10 years about directing him in Hamlet but clashing schedules meant it never happened. ※They suddenly thought, actually, this is a way we could make this work,§ said Kemp.It felt important to stage the play at Rada and that would bring its own rewards, he said. ※There is something about the intimacy of the experience that has made the production very special. It is really extraordinary seeing this play that close. Nobody in the theatre is more than about 12ft away from the stage. In the fight at the end you are pretty much in the fight if you are in the front row.§Critics have not been invited 每 though some may have managed to get a ticket through the ballot 每 purely because Rada wants to maximise the money raised, and that has ruffled some feathers.Mark Shenton, an associate editor of the Stage and chair of the theatre critics＊ circle, said he understood the reasons for not inviting critics, but it was ※difficult to shift a sense of exclusivity around this Hamlet§.However, he added: ※Reviewing it would only amplify the disappointment of those who can＊t see it and put critics in an impossible position of extreme privilege. So it＊s right that we were excluded.§Shenton said a possible lack of critics raised interesting questions. ※It makes one wonder: if this tree falls, or rises majestically, in the forest of Hamlets around at the moment, will it have actually happened if critics weren＊t there to record it?§ All funds raised will support the  which aims to bring in ?20m for the regeneration of the school＊s Chenies Street premises, providing a library and, for the first time, on-site accommodation for students.There are no plans to film the production, no returns and measures in place to prevent secondary ticketing. Put simply, if people do not have a golden ticket, they will not see it.Of course that does not mean Hiddleston may never do Hamlet again. John Gielgud played the role more than 500 times in six productions; Mark Rylance was in three.Because there is no chance of seeing it, there will be many theatre lovers who do not want to know if Hiddleston＊s Hamlet is as good as the numerous recent popular Hamlets 每 from  to Cumberbatch to , currently in the West End.For those who do want to know, expect social media to be a blur of reaction over the next few weeks.Kemp is one of the few who has seen it and reports that it is modern dress, and set in a modern kingdom that is recognisably Denmark.※More than other Hamlets I＊ve seen recently I would say it is a play about grief,§ he said. ※Someone said to me last night this is the ＆grief Hamlet＊.§It has a cast of 10, and ※felt like a genuine ensemble, not just a star and some other people. It feels very present, alive and of now. There are also nudges to other kinds of leaders. I＊ll say no more than that.§ 																																											"
"ne of the strengths of the cycle of  symphonies that  recorded with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic was his convincing performances of some of the lesser heard works, scores that are often dismissed as emptily rhetorical. One of those, the 12th Symphony, was the main work in Petrenko＊s visit to the Proms with the Oslo Philharmonic, whose chief conductor he has been now for four years.This was only the second performance of the 12th Symphony at the Proms; Malcolm Sargent conducted the London premiere there in 1963. It was Shostakovich＊s third attempt at composing a ※Lenin symphony§, a programmatic work celebrating the success of the 1917 Russian revolution; material for the first of them, shorn of its programmatic associations, had eventually become the Sixth Symphony, and despite its subtitle 每 The Year 1917 每 the 12th is not graphically programmatic either. The movements all have descriptive titles 每 the first is Revolutionary Petrograd, the finale The Dawn of Humanity 每 but otherwise it follows a conventional symphonic scheme.It＊s certainly not top-drawer Shostakovich, and by the time it reaches the end of its over-protracted finale, we＊ve heard more than enough of the motto theme. But the best of the symphony is well worth hearing; Petrenko ratcheted up the tension thrillingly in the first movement and allowed the wind soloists the space to make the most of their opportunities in the slow second, even if he couldn＊t do much to mitigate the repetitiousness of what comes later.The orchestra, which made its mark internationally when Mariss Jansons was its music director in the 1990s, remains a top-class ensemble. It had already had a chance to show what it could do in the 1919 suite from Stravinsky＊s Firebird ballet 每 a moment of raggedness in the Infernal Dance stood out only because it was such an outlier 每 even though Petrenko kept things on a tight rein, and then created just the right glitzy backdrop for  performance of  Fourth Piano Concerto. For all the polish in Andsnes＊s playing there was just a touch of brittleness about it all too, which wasn＊t inappropriate.																																											"

One of those members was Paul King, who said he was still in dispute with Murdoch＊s papers, which he made a point of hiding whenever he was in a newsagent＊s shop.The two men refused to accept either＊s position, and their ongoing animosity crackled across the airwaves like static electricity. Somewhere in the middle, trying to occupy a sensible place was Brenda (now Baroness) Dean, the general secretary of Sogat ＊82 during the dispute.She all but admitted that the chapel leaders were intransigent to the point of destruction. It was a bad time for organised labour, which suffered a number of punishing defeats. But it was also a bad time because too often organised labour had no viable vision of the future, just a determination to hold on to the failed practices of the past.And just as the printers were made obsolete by new technology, so now do newspapers find themselves in a similar position. Time plus irony equals history.																																											"
" decade ago, in September 2007, the Whitechapel Gallery closed its doors for two years to expand and renovate its exhibition space. While its physical walls were stripped bare, however, the gallery persisted in spirit by embarking on a unique collaborative programme to establish , with partners in cities in 15 countries, from Kabul to Troms? to Buenos Aires. The goal of this collective was to share and extend the craft of film as an artistic medium, and to bring challenging work from around the world to a gallery audience. In years since, the resultant short films, each suggested by one or other of the partner organisations, have been a fixture in the gallery＊s programme, like vivid messages in a bottle washing up on Whitechapel Road. The films that have been featured 每 each year has a theme and a pair of films is shown each month 每 could hardly have been more diverse, but they share an invitation for a certain kind of looking. We are used to our knowledge of the foreign coming in the 30-second packages of TV news, or in extended fact-heavy documentary. The Whitechapel films champion a different kind of storytelling; intense impressions from elsewhere.The current pairing of films 每 each responding to the annual theme of ※collaboration§ 每 are representative of the kinds of experience that the collective has explored. They are shown on a loop, and in turn they circle around their themes. The first, (2015), is the work of two Indian artists, Sonal Jain and Mriganka Madhukaillya, who work together under the ambitious moniker of the .  was made in response to the motifs on a particular devotional textile, sacred to a Krishna cult of the 16th century, woven in silk. Like all the Whitechapel films it asks a question of the gallery goer: can you give yourself up to these arresting images on the screen that don＊t quite resolve into a story for a quarter of an hour on this busy London morning? Many viewers step in and drift away. But the film repays attention. It was made on a misty river island on the Brahmaputra river and enacts half-forgotten rituals; men in eagle masks and wearing boar＊s heads invade the screen in an irregular pageant, summoned apparently by a devotee at prayer. From the surface of the river butterflies and moths emerge and flicker into translucent life, and then hover apparently ecstatically over a brilliant yellow field of rapeseed. If you have ever wondered ※What＊s it like to be a moth?§, this film offers some persuasive insights.In many ways, the film that follows, (2016), makes a perfect double bill with . Again it requires a suspension not of disbelief, but of documentary expectation. A collaboration between the artist Arjuna Neuman and the philosopher Denise Ferreira da Silva, it takes its impulse from the discovery of a sunken slave ship, and obliquely examines the margins of life and commerce, the ways that ecosystems feed capitalism. To this end the film dwells for longer than seems comfortable on a series of images 每 an oil refinery, a forest, a frozen waterfall, the troubled surface of a JMW Turner sea, an estranging underwater seaweed jungle 每 forcing you to look, and to make what connections you will, while from time to time the camera returns to a pair of black hands shuffling a tarot deck, and offers phrases of a commentary about the interfaces between geology and organic matter. We are used to seeing arresting images on a loop, gifs that keep on giving, but we expect punchlines and payoffs. doesn＊t deliver on that front, but it might get under your skin 每 you may find yourself hearing the drip, drip of doom in the melting ice, or feel yourself ※full fathom five§ among the weeds of the ocean, or you may not.The Whitechapel keeps no figures for the attention time given to these films. My guess would be it is quite short. However hard we resist, most of us are in thrall to the seduction of narrative, of beginnings, middles and ends. In September there will be a special celebration of 10 years of the collective, a greatest hits of films, one selected by each of the 15 partners. Highlights will include the Afghani ＊s work, in which a sculptor chips away obsessively at tombstones, and ＊s hypnotic self-flagellation with a red flag. At their best such images can be retained on the retina in a way that news footage rarely is. And next year, after ※collaboration§, the collective will be meditating on an equally timely global theme: truth.																																											"
"The impeccably regal Jenna Coleman is back in the title role as series two begins. Queen Vic is keen to return to business as usual, just a month after having her first child, but Albert and Robert Peel would rather keep news from Afghanistan away from her. With Albert＊s family in town for the baby＊s christening, the queen＊s frustration mounts. So she brings in the Duchess of Buccleuch (Diana Rigg) who soon puts them in their place over a cock-a-leekie soup. The latest in a flurry of docs marking the 20th anniversary of the royal＊s death. The story 每 from the national hysteria over the loss of the ※people＊s princess§ to the belated appearance of the Queen 每 will be familiar, of course. This time, though, alongside Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell and the Spencers, her sons are on side to discuss their feelings as they walked behind Diana＊s coffin. ※[It was] one of the hardest things I＊ve ever done,§ says William.Don＊t be fooled by the hip Brit-flick cast, this adaptation of the detective novel by Robert Galbraith (AKA JK Rowling) feels ploddingly familiar, from the sub-Bond theme tune to the upturned coat collars. Best-case scenario, it＊s a Soho-set Wallander; worst case, a slightly less white Midsomer Murders. Even so, Tom Burke as Strike and Holliday Grainger as his assistant Robin are intriguing enough to justify your viewing. The astronaut life is a harder sell in the post-Apollo stage, with no prospect of a moon landing in sight. Nonetheless, 12 men and women volunteered to undertake gruelling physical and mental tests under the supervision of Commander Chris Hatfield to see which of them could make it into space. Tonight: simulated splashdowns in which you have to escape the sinking pod. This turns out to be a problem for one claustrophobic candidate. Described as ※compelling, radical and incredibly modern§, the painter born Hannah Gluckstein and known simply as Gluck is celebrated in this timely doc. Besides her brilliant artwork (notably in the 1930s), Gluck is famous for choosing to dress 每 immaculately 每 like a man. With humour and vigour, this profile explores her passionate relationships with society women as well as attitudes around sexuality in the era. More short but sharp global reportage from the Emmy-winning doc series. At a time of escalating nuclear tensions, Charlet Duboc visits North Korea on a stage-managed press trip. The vox-pop interviews may all be eerily on-message, but the berserk pageantry of mass parades and rolling missiles tells its own story. Meanwhile, in Somalia, Gianna Toboni meets the gutsy expats who have returned home to rebuild their country. It is next to impossible not to become riveted by footage of wild lions, among nature＊s most beautiful and powerful creatures. On that score, this inevitably compels. On many others, it＊s a chore. While it deserves credit for its acknowledgment of nature＊s redness in tooth and claw, the narration could have afforded to revel less in the conflict of its subjects. And the soundtrack, even by the standards of US docs, is unendurably annoying. This stunning romantic epic confirmed Anthony Minghella as a major talent. Adapted from Michael Ondaatje＊s novel, it has Ralph Fiennes＊s cerebral Almasy drawn into a passionate wartime affair with newlywed Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) in north Africa. Minghella won Oscars for best picture and best director, while Juliette Binoche won the supporting actress Oscar for her turn as Almasy＊s nurse. Scorsese has a high old time of it, revelling in the debauchery of late 20th-century Wall Street＊s cocaine-and-sex-addled stockbroking princes, as described in the (surely overblown) memoir of trader 每 and later convict 每 Jordan Belfort. It＊s done with great skill and energy, but is basically Goodfellas without the violence and, pretty much, the humour. Leonardo DiCaprio exerts all the star appeal he can and still, over nearly three hours, fails to make the arrogant Belfort likable. In Peckinpah＊s only war film, a German platoon faces extinction on the eastern front and grapples with the themes of loyalty, honour and survival explored in his westerns. James Coburn is the pragmatic corporal; Maximilian Schell the Prussian officer ready to sacrifice his men to win the Iron Cross; James Mason noble and touching as a disillusioned old soldier. There＊s the trademark slow-mo violence, but coarse-grained beauty too in John Coquillon＊s cinematography. Clooney co-writes, directs and stars in this intelligent and gripping political thriller. He is Mike Morris, the liberal governor of Pennsylvania and leading contender in the Democratic primaries; Ryan Gosling is a brilliant, slightly shifty aide, and Philip Seymour Hoffman a veteran campaign manager in a polished, serious tale of political skulduggery and compromised principles.

"ward-winning designers Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby met at the Royal College of Art in 1992, where they were studying architecture. But it turned out that neither was really interested in skyscrapers.As students, they were offered a restaurant interiors project and came up with their first piece of hit furniture, . On the back of this success they set up a design practice, working out of Barber＊s flat in  in west London. ※We were running an ad hoc, unprofessional studio,§ explains Barber, looking back.Confidence to take on projects came from their friendship. ※I＊m not sure either one of us would have done it on our own at that point and I don＊t think that＊s changed,§ says Osgerby. ※When we left college we didn＊t consider working anywhere, we just thought we＊d carry on.§Collaboration is a theme that often comes up in conversation with the designers, too. ※One of the great things is that our process is analogue: lots of model-making, lots of drawing, which can be interpreted in different ways by somebody else,§ says Osgerby in their light-filled east London loft studio. ※If Ed draws something, I＊ll often misunderstand what he＊s trying to do.§※Usually because he＊s looking at it upside down,§ quips Barber. ※But seriously,§ he continues, ※people often ask: how does it work, two of you designing one thing, which is strange to us, because with any named designer, there＊s always someone within their studio 每 it might not always be the same person 每 who they bounce ideas off. No one designs in complete isolation. Our process is naturally collaborative.§Next month a book of their work, written by the curator and lecturer Jana Scholze, looks back on their 21-year career. Included is their instantly recognisable  (2012), , a vast, site-specific installation made with BMW for the London Design Festival (2014), the plastic  for Vitra (2011) and their solo exhibition, , held at London＊s Design Museum (2014).Their collaboration has seen them win the  in 2004, which led to their creating new chairs for the newly restored De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill on Sea. A competition win for new chairs for the Bodleian Library in Oxford followed, as well as commercial product hits such as the Tab lamp for Flos, Puzzle Tiles for Mutina, and Poppins, an umbrella stand for Magis. They were both awarded OBEs in 2013.The common thread in their work is understatement, the absence of superfluous detailing 每 that and personality, not an easy combination to achieve. ※In Germany there＊s a saying that four eyes see more than two,§ says Eckart Maise, Vitra＊s chief design officer, who has worked closely with them since 2004.Their collaborative way of working probably explains their very long-standing partnerships with many of the world＊s leading design companies. The list is impressive: B&B Italia, Cappellini, Dedon, Herm豕s, Venini, Established & Sons, as well as their limited-edition pieces for  in Paris.※Every single thing, every detail starts in our studio with the two of us,§ says Osgerby. ※Everything comes out of this room. It＊s the only way we know how to work.§ ,																																											"
"The singer＊s first-ever retrospective includes artefacts from the tour, his Raspberry Beret cloud suit from 1985 and more. ※There are several countries that meant a lot to him. I know London was one of his favourites,§ explained his sister Tyka Nelson. ※It＊s the perfect place to start the exhibition.§  is at the O2, in London, from 27 October.Already billed as ※unmissable§ by the great Mary Beard, this show, at Oxford＊s Ashmolean museum from 19 October, examines the artistic roots of five major world religions; Christ, it will be revealed, was once portrayed as clean-shaven, while Buddha was represented by mere footprints and hands.Two great homecomings for leading British talent are ahead: Simon Rattle＊s arrival from Berlin to take up the baton as music director of the London Symphony Orchestra is marked by This is Rattle, 11 days of special concerts at the Barbican Centre, LSO St Luke＊s and the Guildhall School＊s Milton Court concert hall, while, for ballet fans, Akram Khan＊s acclaimed  returns to Sadler＊s Wells on 20 September, before travelling to the Liverpool Empire.Big autumn art shows abound, with arriving at the Royal Academy on 3 October, C谷zanne at the National Gallery from 26 October, and the work of the late New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat explodes on to the walls of the Barbican＊s gallery from 21 September in , his first major show in this country. Yet a strong pull is exerted too from outside London, with the reopening of Tate St Ives on 14 October. British sculptor Rebecca Warren, a 2006 Turner prize nominee, will fill the new Cornish space with her first solo show in a national museum. The unseen work includes large bronzes, steel and neon figures and collages.The scrum surrounding the opening of the Broadway mega-hit  at the Victoria Palace threatens to dominate the West End from November. Less high-profile but equally safe artistic bets include Hull Truck theatre＊s staging of Tanika Gupta＊s adaptation of  in the UK City of Culture and James Graham＊s new political jousting match . But interest is surely most piqued by , Terry Johnson＊s new play, starring Robert Lindsay and Claire Skinner, about British cinematographer Jack Cardiff, at the Hampstead theatre. Lindsay plays Cardiff, ※the man who made women look beautiful§, from 6 September.Autumn cheer is heading your way in the rumpled form of comic anti-hero Larry David. ※The world needs him now more than ever,§ reads the Sky Atlantic tagline as the network, despite the hacking and leaking of a few of the 10 new episodes, prepares to launch a ninth series of HBO＊s dyspeptic  from 1 October. Many of ＊s key supporting actors are involved, with appearances expected from Jeff Garlin, Susie Essman and Cheryl Hines, as well as from Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen and Richard Lewis, who all play themselves again.On 15 September US space engineers will send  每 which has been studying the planet Saturn and its moons for almost two decades 每 on its final manoeuvre. They will direct the craft to spiral into the planet＊s atmosphere where it will be destroyed 每 bringing to an end one of the most successful planetary missions ever undertaken. Cassini＊s achievements included the release of a small, European-built probe, Huygens, which landed successfully on Saturn＊s largest moon, Titan, revealing the seas of ethane and methane that cover its surface.The 50th anniversary of the publication of  falls on 12 October. In the book, wrote about humans in the same way that scientists describe other animals 每 thus offending a great many sensibilities. Among Morris＊s claims was the assertion that  not only has the largest brain of all higher primates, but also the highest ratio of penis size to body mass 每 while the more rounded shape of human female breasts means they are mainly a sexual signalling device rather than simply a means for providing milk for infants. Expect more controversy as the anniversary approaches.At least 700,000 people a year die from, and if nothing is done this number could rise to 10 million a year by 2050, costing the global economy up to $100 trillion and pushing a further 28.3 million people into extreme poverty. That is the background to a major international conference 每 held in Berlin on 12-13 October 每 that has been set up by, the UN and the UK government. The aim is to coordinate a cohesive international campaign backed by government, private and philanthropic sources to halt the spread of anti-microbial resistance.Results from one of the most controversial scientific projects of recent years 每 the use of gene editing techniques to alter the makeup of human embryos 每 are expected to be released before Christmas. The work, approved by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (the fertility treatment regulator), will be carried out by biologist Kathy Niakan at the Francis Crick Institute, London. She plans to alter genes active in the days after fertilisation; experiments cease after seven days, and the embryos destroyed. The aim is to help develop treatments for infertility.England＊s efforts start in Brisbane on 23 November: a tough ask because 1) Australia haven＊t lost a Test there since 1988; 2) It will be sub-tropical. In an effort to acclimatise, the pre-Ashes friendlies include a four-day affair in the heat of Townsville in northern Queensland. The series, on BT these days rather than Sky, is preceded by the Women＊s Ashes: Australia adapting to life without injured star Meg Lanning. The first women＊s one-day international is on 22 October, also in Brisbane.Russia 2018 is looming.

The backdrop has shifted hemispheres, too: England hosting Australia, Argentina and Samoa at Twickenham in November; Scotland facing Samoa, New Zealand and Australia at Murrayfield; Wales playing Australia, Georgia, New Zealand and South Africa at the Principality; and Ireland facing South Africa, Fiji and Argentina at the Aviva Stadium. Raising the curtain: the 4 November the Barbarians versus the All Blacks.It＊s that time of year when title contenders start to strut or stumble, and managers start being sacked. Among the key autumn fixtures: Chelsea hosting Manchester City on 30 September then Manchester United on 5 November; Liverpool playing Chelsea at Anfield on 25 November; and, on 9 December, a pre-Christmas six-pointer/festive personality clash: Jos谷 Mourinho versus Pep Guardiola in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford. Expect hype.With the heavily pregnant Serena Williams absent, the women＊s competition in New York is as open as it was at Wimbledon, with one notable addition: 2006 champion  since her 15-month drug ban.  Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal face a field minus the injured Novak Djokovic, Milos Raonic, Stan Wawrinka and Kei Nishikori. Andy Murray is second seed 每 but how will his hip hold up?

He has hired film-maker Steve McQueen and models Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Adwoa Aboah as contributing editors and, in what the  described as a ※posh girl exodus§, said goodbye to many  veterans.We＊ve been saying it for a while, but this time, THIS time, it＊s true. There＊s a huge growth in demand for vegetarian, vegan and ※free from§ options. This Christmas is set to be. Expect more vegan street food festivals, and watch as ingredients such as jackfruit (a breadfruit family native to south India, widely used as a meat alternative) get a supermarket push.Raise a glass to ※mindful drinking§. Young people are drinking less than their parents (fewer than half of those aged 16 to 24 report drinking alcohol in the previous week compared with 66% of those aged 45 to 64) and helping usher in this new form of mindfulness. It＊s not quite teetotalism, it＊s not quite＃ not. There are mindful pub crawls, around venues with decent selections of low-alcohol drinks, and since a mindful drinking festival in August, a whole community of gentle drinkers is beginning to emerge.Honestly, wear a hat. They＊ll be everywhere, after Dior＊s leather berets, Loewe＊s bread printed sou＊westers and Coach＊s furry caps. Also: socks. If you＊re not already wearing socks, wear socks. This season is basically your nan hassling you before you leave for the park.There＊s so much to get through in  negotiations in so little time that even before August is over talks resume in Brussels on Monday. The EU＊s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he will not allow any discussion of trade issues until substantial progress has been made on the thorny matters of money, the Irish border and the rights of EU citizens in the UK post-Brexit. But there is no sign of agreement on any of these issues as the clock ticks towards an EU exit in March 2019. The time for both sides to make hard choices is approaching just as the full complexity starts to dawn.After a better-than-expected result in June＊s snap general election, Jeremy Corbyn will receive a hero＊s welcome from Labour supporters in Brighton (from 24 September), even from a good many who doubted him. The party will, though, want to look forward as well as back.By contrast Theresa May will arrive in Manchester on 1 October with her political tail between her legs. The damaging June election and Brexit divides the Conservatives more by the day. Any hint that May is backing away from the ※hard Brexit§ she promoted a year ago will anger the right of her party. Last year she looked all-powerful during the conference season. This year she needs the speech of her life to shore up her weakened power base.The chancellor has replaced autumn statements with a full budget. No date has yet been set for this year＊s, but it will be a key event. Hammond messed up his first budget and had to perform a hasty U-turn on reforms to national insurance within days. Since then he has made himself unpopular with many in his own party by pushing for a pro-business, soft Brexit and warning of disastrous consequences unless transitional agreements are reached. May＊s election fiasco, paradoxically, saved Hammond from the sack (she was too weak to get rid of him). His second budget will be a key test of the economy＊s 每 and Hammond＊s 每 resilience as Brexit approaches, and of whether the Chancellor himself has continued to repair his power base at May＊s expense.The fall of the Islamic State＊s most important stronghold in Syria is said to be imminent. After Isis was ousted from its Iraqi bastion in Mosul, this will mark a decisive end to the group＊s claims to establish a new caliphate. But it will not be the end of Isis. And the fall of Raqqa will set the stage for a struggle to control territory by the Syrian regime and a host of outside players, including Russia, Iran, Turkey and the US.Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron will both deliver maiden speeches on 19 September to the UN general assembly 每 historically a platform for politicians who aspire to global leadership. It will be high theatre and a study in contrasts: the US president vowing to break from the customary civilities and assert US superiority against a young, urbane European urging a resumption of collective effort to save the planet.It＊s now Germany＊s turn to weather the dyspeptic mood rippling across Europe. On 24 September, Angela Merkel and her Christian Democratic Union should emerge from parliamentary elections as the strongest force, followed by some distance by the Social Democrats. The anti-immigrant AfD has been on the wane since the peak of the refugee crisis, but it could still cross the 5% threshold for guaranteed Bundestag representation.One of the most carefully orchestrated political events on earth is likely to be a raw display of power this October/ November. It will consolidate Xi Jinping＊s grip on power as China＊s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, and comes at a time when China is asserting its role as a global power player, challenging the US and its allies in the Pacific.It is called the October Revolution, because Tsarist Russia was using the Julian calendar at the time. On 7 November 每 100 years on from the turning point in world history that ushered in the 70-year Soviet experiment 每 Russians will have a lot to reflect on. And for once, their government will not be telling them what to think.																																											"
"As the nation prepares itself for a fresh bout of fever, Prue Leith, one of the faces of the revamped show that hits TV screens on Tuesday, is putting her support behind a campaign to protect the provenance of artisan bread.The push for an ※Honest Crust act§ by the  is designed to ensure that not only do consumers know exactly what is in their loaves, but also that a level playing field for large supermarket chains and smaller bakeries is created. These include a new generation of microbakeries, which have sprung up partly as a result of the nation＊s growing obsession with baking.※Of course we should know what＊s in the bread we eat. The Real  Campaign＊s call for better labelling legislation will also help small, local bakeries thrive,§ said Leith, who is replacing Mary Berry as one of the two judges on .Microbakers and other small independent bakers are increasingly feeling the squeeze from supermarkets selling sourdough and other breads under an an ※artisanal§ banner. They will be encouraged to make their views known to the government in an online campaign, which gets under way next month. Organisers hope the movement will gain momentum as a result of a new wave of fever expected to grip the country soon after the latest series begins on its new home on Channel 4. The campaign 每 part of Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming 每 argues that British consumers are prevented from getting honest and accurate information about the loaves they buy because retailers are not required to display a full list of ingredients or declare any artificial additives used in the production of unwrapped loaves. The campaigners also point to an absence of legal definitions for many terms commonly used in loaf marketing, including freshly baked, sourdough, wholegrain, bakery, artisan and craft. A letter, which independent bakers will be encouraged to sign up to will be sent to the environment secretary, , whose department has responsibility for food.It states: ※Microbakeries and other small, local, independent real bread bakeries help to keep our high streets alive, supporting more jobs per loaf and keeping more money circulating locally. However, an update of British loaf labelling and marketing legislation is urgently needed to help protect smaller and craft bakeries from the worrying increase in ＆hijack marketing＊ and to ensure that British quality food, and its traditional recipes, local production and standards, can survive and thrive.§Among the new generation of bakers is Lucie Steel of Hermitage, Berkshire, who runs  from her home and bakes in a shipping container in the Berkshire countryside. ※Bakeries are incredibly difficult to keep going because a loaf of bread is such a small value item,§ she said. ※Along with your rates, labour and other costs it can be an incredibly expensive business,§ she said.The Campaign for Real Bread is urging Gove＊s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to introduce safeguarding measures before Brexit amid concern that new trade deals could potentially undermine existing standards. A Defra spokesperson said: ※We want consumers to have clear information on food they buy, and we are committed to working with industry to make sure consumers are not misled. When we leave the EU, we will bring the whole body of EU legislation into UK law and will have the opportunity over time to change rules and legislation so they work better for our country.§																																											"
"he Edinburgh festival fringe at its peak mounts more than 1,800 shows a day, but this year from my sample it was  that really caught my imagination. From the first scene, where a Boris Johnson in Union Jack underpants realises with horror that Leave has won 每 ※ We will bugger the economy,§ he sings 每 to the last, where he and his sidekick ※Govey§ finally discover the plan that will save them and the country from ※catastrophe§, you are ever more uncomfortably aware that however?effective a Brexit satire, it is trumped by Brexit truth.This joyful assault on bumbling, hypocritical Tory politicians completely at sea faced with the forces they have unleashed never misses its target. The portrayal of limelight-loving Andrea Leadsom as vaingloriously prejudiced and supremely ignorant particularly resonates 每 as does a David Cameron who, after his resignation, no longer has to pretend he likes ordinary people. A  who bounces with effortless unjustified self-confidence from debacle to debacle is also more than recognisable 每 the buffoon-in-chief in a cast of buffoons.You find yourself shaking your head in disbelief at the familiar follies, even while you laugh. The generosity of the writing makes the characters all too human prisoners of their own idiocy. Yet these are the people and party who run the country: why is such a shower not exposed to more satire and mockery?It would be so much better if we did not have to live through the consequences of Brexit, but too many people are emotionally invested in the  case to allow argument, facts and reason to change their minds. Satire 每 showing how the project and people behind it are completely farcical 每 has the better chance of persuading millions in any imminent electoral or second referendum test that they have been sold a pup and must save themselves from both the perpetrators and the wreckage.Yet Chris Bryant, the musical＊s author, could not have anticipated the position papers that the government has published over the past fortnight in which it is becoming clear that the planned special and deep relationship that it wants with the EU is to become a shadow member 每 with no control.Britain will shadow the EU＊s product regulations and the bulk of EU law; it will respect indirectly the judgments of the European court of justice; freedom of movement will continue; we will create a shadow customs union; the border with Ireland will remain open. And we will pay a bumper cheque, , for the privilege. The Brexiters will be able to say we have left the EU, when in fact we will be shadow EU members with even less of a voice than Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland. It is one of the great cock-ups in British political?history.The reasons why are obvious. There is no viable option but to stay as close to the EU as possible. Every key economic constituency 每 trade unions, universities, technology startups, manufacturing, including the food and drink industries, the City, agriculture, the creative industries, the NHS, the big four accountancy partnerships and magic circle law firms, foreign direct investors 每 are losers from leaving the EU. The property market is freezing. Real incomes are under pressure. The pound 每 now a ※toilet currency§ 每 is close to parity with the euro. The Tory party 每 for it is the Tory party that has created this mess 每 is fearful for its very future.Nor are there huge easy trade deals to compensate for the loss of European markets. China, pledged to create , is no soft touch; nor is India; and the US has long wanted to open up British agriculture and public services to US multinationals. Dr Liam Fox, surely one of the most inadequate politicians to hold high office since 1945, has simply no idea of the dynamics of world trade nor the likely negotiating position of his cherished non-European counterparts. He is as vapid as ＊s Andrea Leadsom.For perhaps the biggest message from the show is that there is no wider cultural constituency for Brexit. The Foxs and Leadsoms are cultural oddities. It is true that some of England＊s poorest areas 每 eight of northern Europe＊s 10 poorest regions are in England 每 voted Brexit, but this should be understood as a proper protest against a status quo that provides so little for them. The millions of disadvantaged are not natural allies of Johnson, ※Govey§ or now Jacob Rees-Mogg.As we reach 2018 it will be game on: there is a potential majority in the House of Commons for at the very least insisting on a referendum on the final deal 每 being a shadow EU member with no say or control 每 or maybe even stopping the process completely with a second general election. Great countries don＊t go over cliffs without some attempt at saving themselves.This parliamentary majority can only be unlocked by the Labour leadership changing its position of studied ambiguity, building on the piece written by Keir Starmer in these pages today. National and party interest are aligned 每 one of the happiest positions for any politician. Privately, a number of former Brexiters in business and the media regard the whole exercise as an unfolding disaster. Blair and Brown were permanently frightened of the right: Corbyn, especially now, does not have to follow the same callow path.But when we＊re faced with the next test of public opinion, however it happens, the economic case for continued EU membership and having a say in its rule-making has to be rammed home, along with the high ground argument about making common cause with European countries who share our values against the world＊s Donald Trumps and President Xis.But above all, let＊s make the EU case full of hope 每 and, on top, a carnival of fun and mockery. There?must be multiple versions of  mounted in every pro-Leave constituency in the country, continually revised as every twist and turn in the story becomes ever more incredible. Every old people＊s home, every ex-mining or ex-steel town, every seaside resort fearful of immigration should see the show and laugh at Brexit. Let＊s smile our way to victory 每 and use satire, that most British of reflexes, to consign Brexiters?to?history.																																											"
"od save Judi Dench, protector of tat, defender of bad films and the imperious queen of Stephen Frears＊ suspect British costume drama, which screens out of competition at the . Frears＊ latest is a cloth-eared Gunga Din tale, painted up as a chaste romance and charting the true (but never convincing) friendship between Queen Victoria and a young Indian Muslim. It＊s only Dench＊s shrewd, affecting performance that keeps this sorry affair on its feet.Our nominal hero is Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal), plucked out of Agra to present HRH with a commemorative coin at a golden jubilee banquet. Victoria, poor soul, is deep in decrepitude, a shrunken white toadstool at the head of the table, but she perks up like a teenager when she claps eyes on Abdul. She thinks that he＊s handsome whereas he lives to serve, promptly grovelling on the ground in order to kiss the royal boot. So this is a match made in heaven: the flattered old monarch and her eager young lickspittle. I was left wondering how this would look if the genders were reversed: if Frears made a film about a jaded old king who takes a passing lustful fancy for some subcontinent maiden. Would that also be presented as charming, gracious and touching?Naturally it transpires that Victoria is lonely, oppressed by the royal doctor who monitors her bowel movements and the solicitous Sir Henry Ponsonby (played by the late Tim Pigott-Smith) who monitors everything else. She needs a true friend and appears to have found one in Abdul. He becomes her cherished manservant, ascends through the ranks, begins teaching her Urdu. But really, beyond the obvious, what does she see in this guy? Fazal＊s performance is spectacularly uninteresting, which might not be his fault 每 the script by Lee Hall gives him precious little to work with.Here and there we get occasional hints that Abdul is out for himself, that he＊s as much an ambitious operator as the other palace players. But the film moves quickly to shoot down these suggestions. More dubiously, it seems intent on casting , the bastion of empire, as some progressive outrider, railing against white racists. If Frears doesn＊t quite go so far as to paint her as Gandhi and Nehru come early, that may only be because the historians broke in and held a gun to his head.This director is skittish; his career jumps and troughs like a cardiogram reading. Frears has made some great films (The Grifters, Philomena, My Beautiful Laundrette) and some god-awful ones too (Lay the Favourite; Muhammad Ali＊s Greatest Fight). Victoria & Abdul belongs with the duds. Matters marginally improve when politics intrude on the idyll and when the scandalised courtiers start plotting the man＊s downfall, but it＊s too little, too late. What a peculiarly dodgy, conservative film this is 每 a lazy salute to a good queen and her faithful Indian servant. It＊s a film about the Raj era that looks as if it was made back then, too.																																											"
"Notting Hill carnival-goers have paused to observe a minute＊s silence for those killed in the .At 3pm on Monday, the music stopped playing and the procession paused for 60 seconds to remember those who died in the fire in June. Outside North Kensington fire station, about half a mile away from the charred high-rise, firefighters lined up, removed their helmets and bowed their heads.The moment was concluded with a round of applause and cheers from the hundreds of thousands of people celebrating the bank holiday weekend. The firefighters were then embraced, congratulated and thanked by carnival-goers, posing for photos with them.The local Labour MP Emma Dent Coad, who observed the moment of reflection outside the fire station, said of the carnival: ※It＊s a really, really lovely atmosphere: there＊s gorgeous weather, there＊s a lot of good feeling out there, a lot of people wearing green, and I think it should continue in that vein.§Dent Coad, who was elected MP for Kensington in the June general election, said she would be keeping Grenfell ※very high on the agenda§ when parliament returns next Monday. ※I won＊t rest until every single family is properly housed, and despite my efforts over the last 10 weeks I＊ve got nowhere at all and I find that very, very, very difficult,§ she said.After the minute＊s silence people continued to dance and relax in the sunshine as sound systems played hip-hop, calypso, dub, reggae and more. Policing appeared to be permissive, with officers walking past carnival-goers smoking cannabis and inhaling balloons of nitrous oxide gas.Matt Parr, HM Inspector of Constabulary, was observing the police operation on All Saints Road. Two sound systems were moved from the road this year to lessen the crowds.※I expected the police, if I＊m honest, to be less enthusiastic about it than they are,§ Parr said. ※They all recognise what it is that people are trying to do; they want to see people having a good time.§Parr said he had reviewed the defences put in place by the Met to guard against terror attacks, and judged them to be sufficient. He said police had met carnival organisers to plan their operations. ※The effort, of course, is behind the scenes. I think they [the police] have actually got a pretty mature away of approaching it; they are not looking to cause trouble 每 they are aware that it＊s sensitive,§ Parr said.※I＊m a parent and I＊m much more comfortable about my children being here having seen the way that the police deal with it.§The  later said that there had ben a total of 313 arrests at the carnival on Sunday and Monday, 108 of which were for drug and offensive weapon offences.Lines of officers with riot gear to hand stood filtering the crowds milling down Westbourne Park Road. On All Saints Road officers stood at every junction. Some sound systems attracted more enforcement than others, with the house stage Disco Hustlers enjoying an apparently light touch.David C, from Harrow, was sitting in Tavistock Gardens eating takeaway food. This year was much better than the last time he came, he said.※I thought there was going to be much more security,§ he said. ※I＊m from America so I＊m used to seeing people walking around strapped. But it＊s different, I was in two minds about coming§ because of the  this month.Local people said it had been a good carnival, blessed with good weather, but complained that it had lost its link to the community.※We want residents to take part more,§ said Nadia Boujjettef, who lives on the carnival＊s east side. Her parents used to serve food and drink from their front garden, she said. Council rules now require expensive licences for vendors.※And that＊s so sad,§ Boujjettef said. ※I think that＊s so unfair that the residents don＊t have any part to play.§ 																																											"

" year after  formed in 2015, its three founders played a set in a church in Amsterdam. All had to cross borders to get there: Chino Amobi from the US, Angel-Ho from South Africa and Nkisi from London. Despite having built one of the electronic underground＊s most exciting collectives, it was the first time they had been in the same place at the same time.A combination of experimental record label, radical art project and social network, NON is a community of musicians that straddles the African diaspora, slipping between borders and timezones to fight against the silencing of black people everywhere. Their combined histories span the world., the performance name of Melika Ngombe Kolongo, is Congolese, but grew up in Belgium before settling permanently in London, initially as a photographer. , a childhood nickname of Angelo Valerio, was born and raised in Cape Town, and initially created work to soundtrack films and performance art. And , whose parents are Nigerian, is currently studying for a masters in design at VCU in Richmond, Virginia, where he grew up. During high school, he began producing beats and designing album covers for his brother＊s rap music; that branding moxie has carried over into NON, whose stickers and badges feature arresting slogans such as ※EXORCISE THE LANGUAGE OF DOMINATION§ and ※NON IS A HAMMER WE USE TO CRUSH THE ENEMY§.Although there＊s no particular NON sound, its members each have individual qualities. Nkisi＊s is fluid techno that ripples purposefully towards the end of each track. Amobi samples everyday sounds like car horns and sirens, and navigates around genres with the confident beat of a city native. Angel-Ho＊s music has flickers of repetitive sound that threaten to flare up at any moment. ※You＊re listening to [our] music, and then the track is over, and you＊re like: ＆OK, where was I?＊§ Nkisi explains over the phone from Belgium. ※The track is two minutes long, but you feel like you＊ve been transported to another world for the whole day.§Their signings range from Johannesburg performance artists , a duo who match suave attire with poised dance moves whilse exploring black queer identity, and London-based Zimbabwean artist Farai, whose  featured some of the London diaspora＊s brightest young things, including stylist  and ICA associate poet . ※We try to bring physicality into the online world and also the virtual experience into the physical world,§ Chino tells me over Skype.Their platforming of scattered African voices is a kind of decolonisation process, unpacking how the legacy of colonialism continues to affect black people globally. Their  at London＊s ICA gallery discussed the creation of ※social spaces that disrupt the flow of power§, and Angel-Ho has described how the NON-released EP Emancipation, a collaboration between Angel-Ho and FAKA＊s Desire Marea, is for ※black queer trans communities 每 it is our time to get our reparations ... [and] reclaim our erased narratives§. Much of NON＊s output confronts power structures that exclude black people and, as the title of Angel-Ho＊s EP suggests, looks to emancipate them from that framework. The internet acts as an intercontinental forum for discussions. Amobi calls NON ※a leg up§ for black people to tell their own stories: ※How can we use the technology we have now to create and write our experience, before those themes are written about us?§NON are not the only underground musicians with cross-continental networks, joining the likes of London-based , Stockholm＊s  and Mexico＊s , . ※The beauty of collectives is that they＊re a constant experiment. In a weird way, they＊re like research on how to be with other people,§ says Nkisi, explaining how her NON collaborators have grown into friends as well as artists. The trio are hugely collaborative: Amobi created artwork for Angel-Ho＊s Emancipation EP, while Angel-Ho is performing at  每 a one-day music festival curated by Nkisi later this week, with a programme of artists and producers creating temporary, immersive soundscapes. NKISI (EDIT) is the name of a song on Amobi＊s new album PARADISO, named partly after the club in Amsterdam where the three of them met for the first time. Amobi describes the process of working so closely together as similar to playing a role-playing game, constantly interacting like avatars in different formations across each other＊s work. ※We are able to build each other up and almost crash into one another,§ he says. ※Because I feel that crashing into one another has the potential to spawn new life, new realities, and push culture forward.§The dedication of the NON founders to creating their own worlds 每 whether that be in pockets of the internet, temporarily in museums, or throughout their music 每 is what sets them apart. ※In a weird way, it＊s like magical realism, to work with the senses and be able to put people in a type of trance,§ says Nkisi, explaining what draws her towards making music. ※Music is a kind of portal that can be opened. But what am I pouring through it? What are my motivations?§ Even if her motivations aren＊t fully clear, the results are: NON＊s musical portal provides the African diaspora 每 dispersed across continents 每 with the kind of voice and community that has often been denied them. Nkisi＊s  festival is at Wysing Arts Centre, Cambridgeshire, 2 September.																																											"
"The late, great Bill Hicks  that rather sums up the death of Apollo-era optimism. In 1989, in Fyffe, Alabama, thousands of townspeople and visitors from the surrounding area were reported to have headed out into the night to witness a strange, metallic, triangular-shaped object in the sky. Rather than greeting the first conclusive proof that we are not alone in the universe with wide-eyed awe, Hicks reports with barely concealed disbelief that a number of the townspeople brought guns to defend themselves.Were attitudes so very different 40 years ago, when Steven Spielberg＊s  first touched down in cinemas? Watching the film in today＊s political climate of fear and distrust in one＊s fellow man 每 let alone technologically superior beings from the cosmos 每 it is impossible not to note the glorious naivety of the picture. In Close Encounters, the US army＊s reaction to the threat of alien invasion is limited to marking out a site where it is believed the extra-terrestrial mothership might choose to make first contact. The aliens themselves are benevolent, celestial beings who only want to learn more about us, test out our ability to understand basic chord progressions, and so forth. The movie＊s early scenes may establish that our visitors＊ arrival has the power to terrify those who are not tuned in to their wavelength, but by the time we get to meet them, there is little sense of threat. Ultimately, nobody brings any guns to the ray-gun party.It is not hard to imagine the outcome if a real mothership landed on US soil today: Trump might well be on Twitter, threatening to nuke it to kingdom come, before our enlightened new friends got to the second part of John Williams＊ famous five-note refrain. The pervading, populist cloak of suspicion that envelops the world has fed into our science fiction cinema, too. It is no shock that the most enduring ※serious§ space saga is Alien, with its terrifying multi-jawed, acid-blooded monstrosities. The slasher-in-space sub-genre is now so much a part of the mainstream that we are subjected to copycat ventures such as March＊s Jake Gyllenhaal flop Life.It seems we are teaching ourselves to be terrified of incursions from another world. A year after the release of Close Encounters, the big superhero movie of 1978 was Superman, the story of a Jesus-like alien who arrives on Earth with the sole aim of stopping really bad stuff happening. Everybody loves him. And why wouldn＊t they, when our pant-wearing messiah even has time to rescue cats from trees while repairing fault lines and saving the USA from nuclear apocalypse?Warner Bros＊ recent films about the superhero, 2013＊s Man of Steel and last year＊s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, essentially feature exactly the same character, bar a little dulling down of the costumed titan＊s famous outfit. Yet this time Earth＊s citizens are at best utterly terrified of Superman, and at worst would quite like to kill him - immediately - with the help of the nearest batch of kryptonite.Even last year＊s Arrival, on the face of it a pretty optimistic science fiction picture, features a scene in which the local military grunts try to murder the lovely heptapod creatures who are gently trying to teach us useful stuff like psychic time travel. This is the epoch we live in.The big-hearted Spielbergian sci-fi of the 1970s and 80s is largely dead, despite the best efforts of Christopher Nolan via the ambitious but tonally muddled Interstellar in 2014. We may be another quarter-century on, but Hicks＊ description of that UFO ※sighting§ in Fyffe seems to tally far better with the modern outlook on life, the universe and everything than the wide-eyed sense of wonder exhibited by Close Encounters＊ Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss).For Spielberg, the experience of interaction with extra-terrestrials is one of gods, not guns. Neary has repeated, Moses-like visions of a mountain that turns out to be the landing site of the mothership, his sudden, overwhelming sense of purpose likened to a religious experience. The aliens themselves are untouchable, godlike beings, whose presence seems to project a sense of peacefulness and awe 每 of amazing grace 每 to all who enter into it. There is never any sense that we should fear them, that those cute countenances might suddenly dissolve into features of warlike menace, the quintet of notes joined by a dissonant, off-key sixth that signals our species＊ imminent doom.Will we ever see the like of Close Encounters again? Fresh off the huge blockbuster success of Jaws two years previously 每 a paradigm-shifting moment in Hollywood history 每 Spielberg was in effect given carte blanche with his next project. He could probably have got away with making a six-hour epic about the mating habits of the giant sloth, so high was his standing in Tinseltown. The result is perhaps early-era Spielberg＊s most personal picture, one that is even more optimistic in tone than its later companion piece, ET.The latter film contrasts Elliott＊s childlike innocence towards his alien friend with the desire of cynical, coldly painted adults to capture the extra-terrestrial and study him. But in Close Encounters, there are few real grown-ups to be found 每 just a cavalcade of awestruck Elliotts waiting to meet their best friends from the stars.

" on Tuesday addressed the latest revelations regarding the investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, particularly the release of damning emails exchanged between the former Trump adviser Felix Sater and Donald Trump＊s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.※As you know by now, the Trump campaign＊s possible ties to Russia are currently under investigation, both by Congress and separately by , the special counsel and handsome bird impersonator,§ Noah began. ※Just to refresh everyone, the big question in all of this is what was the connection between Donald Trump and the Russian government. And all along, the Donald has always answered that question like this.§Noah showed several clips of Trump denying he has connections to Russia, claiming he ※knows nothing about Russia§, has ※no loans§ and furthermore has ※no deals§ there.※I don＊t even know what a Russia is,§ Noah said, impersonating the president. ※On my map, there＊s China and then there＊s white China. ※So from the beginning, Trump insisted he had absolutely no connections with Russia whatsoever,§ Noah continued. ※And then this morning, this came out.§The host summarized new reporting that reveals Trump signed a letter of intent during the 2016 presidential campaign to build a new Trump Tower in Moscow; the project was slated to be the tallest building in the world.※How can one person lie so big?§ Noah went on. ※You have no connections with Russia but you signed a deal to build the world＊s tallest building there. Like, the gap between the lie and the truth could not be wider.§Noah continued: ※We suspected this before and now it＊s confirmed. Yes, during the campaign  totally had connections to Russia. The people who Trump signed this Russia deal with aren＊t exactly helping his case.§Noah then introduced Sater, a former FBI informant and convicted felon who acted as the middleman between Trump and Russia in facilitating the deal. Sater, Noah explained, was convicted for stabbing a man in the face and neck with a margarita glass in a bar fight.※Trump Tower is the only place where ticking ＆yes＊ on criminal conviction is what gets you the job,§ Noah quipped. ※And in case you were wondering, yes, this Sater guy is also Russian. Apparently Felix Sater also committed non-stabbing crimes including $40m of stock fraud.§Noah showed footage of Trump officials denying their involvement with Sater despite the existence of his business cards, which read ※senior advisor§ to Donald Trump.※Come on, guys,§ Noah said. ※This is the same lie as the Russia one. ＆I have nothing to do with this guy. Oh, actually, he＊s my senior adviser and I printed it in gold.＊ But the big story isn＊t just that this shady, Russian-born criminal was acting as a middleman between Trump and the Kremlin. The real story here is what the shady guy was saying.§The Daily Show host then read aloud a newly released email chain between Sater and Cohen, Trump＊s personal lawyer. In it, Sater writes: ※Buddy, our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putin＊s team to buy in on this.§※So this buddy-boy email may not be the smoking gun for Trump, but what it could end up being is the broken taillight,§ Noah explained. ※The thing that gives law enforcement the excuse they need to look into Trump＊s trunk. And we all know he＊s got a lot of junk in that trunk.§																																											"
"t＊s hard to become a superhero when you have a super-ethnic name. Just ask Chloe Bennet, who stars in the TV series Marvel＊s Agents of SHIELD. Bennet, who was born Chloe Wang, recently  for defending her decision to anglicise her name. The actor made it clear it wasn＊t a lack of pride in her Asian heritage, but rather industry prejudice that prompted her to trade Wang for Bennet. ※Hollywood is racist and wouldn＊t cast me with a last name that made them uncomfortable,§ Bennet announced on Instagram this week. ※Changing my last name doesn＊t change the fact that my BLOOD is half-Chinese,§ she wrote. ※It means I had to pay my rent.§Bennet isn＊t the first celebrity to have whitened their name in the pursuit of fame; there is a long history of entertainers adopting anglicised public personas. Sir Ben Kingsley, for example, was born Krishna Pandit Bhanji. ※As soon as I changed my name, I got the jobs,§ he said in .Kingsley changed his name in the 1960s; over half a century later, little appears to have changed. Once Chloe Wang became Bennet, she too got the jobs. ※The first audition I went on after I changed my name, I got booked,§ she told  last year. ※That＊s a pretty clear little snippet of how Hollywood works.§ Kal Penn, one of the most famous Indian-American actors in the world, is another little snippet of how Hollywood works. Penn was born Kalpen Suresh Modi. He said that after anglicising his name, his audition callbacks soared.There are numerous examples of celebrities choosing to whiten their names. Charlie Sheen was born Carlos Irwin Est谷vez. Mindy Kaling was born Vera Mindy Chokalingam. George Michael was born Georgios Panayiotou. Bruno Mars was born Peter Gene Hernandez. That＊s to name a few.There are also a lot of Jewish celebrities who have opted for more Christian-sounding surnames. Ralph Lifshitz became Ralph Lauren. Allen Stewart Konigsberg became Woody Allen. Lawrence Harvey Zeigler became Larry King. Jonathan Leibowitz became Jon Stewart.Not every celebrity who adopts a whiter or Waspier name attributes the change to circumventing prejudice quite as bluntly as Bennet did. Often, they will just say something along the lines of they changed their name to make it simpler. But ※simpler§ is often code for ※more marketable to white people§. After all, do you honestly think Ralph Lifshitz polo shirts would have become the off-duty uniform of affluent, Aryan America? Or that Charlie Sheen would have had quite as ※winning§ a career as Carlos Est谷vez?Of course, many white celebrities have also changed their names to make themselves more marketable. Marilyn Monroe was baptised Norma Jeane Baker. Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight. Vin Diesel was born Mark Sinclair. However, you rarely find someone changing a white-sounding name to something more ethnic-sounding because they think it will give them a leg-up on the fame ladder.There are, of course, exceptions to every rule. One of those is Calvin Harris, a DJ/producer/ex-boyfriend of Taylor Swift. Harris was born Adam Wiles but reportedly changed his name because he wanted to sound blacker. (Having a hard time seeing how ※Calvin Harris§ sounds racially different from ※Adam Wiles§? Don＊t worry, you＊re not alone.) In , the Scottish musician said: ※My first single was more of a soul track, and I thought Calvin Harris sounded a bit more racially ambiguous. I thought people might not know if I was black or not. After that, I was stuck with it.§Calvin Harris＊s semantic blackface is in poor taste but, then again, so is most of his music. It＊s also, as previously noted, very much the exception to the trend of celebrity name-whitening. It＊s not just those in showbiz who whitewash their names in the hope of economic gain. It has become a fairly standard practice across the broader job market, as minorities attempt to circumvent institutional racism. that looked at the US labour market, for example, found that minorities who modify their CVs to remove information that hints at their ethnicity (a practice known as ※r谷sum谷 whitening§) are more than twice as likely to get a follow-up interview as those who don＊t. The study, published in the Administrative Science Quarterly journal, also found resume whitening is common. The researchers spoke to 59 Asian and African Americans aged 18 to 25: 36% admitted to whitening their CVs, and two-thirds said they knew somebody who did.There is clearly a business case for minorities to whiten their name and many are doing so. I＊ve often thought about it myself. But what about the moral case? You are being complicit in the same institutionalised racism you are attempting to escape. You are helping to contribute to the idea that the Bennets of the world are ※normal§ and the Wangs are somehow flawed. Like it or not, you＊re sending a message to everyone else with an ※ethnic§ name that there＊s something wrong with them. I＊ve spent most of my life hating my name and apologising to people for the fact that it＊s different. It＊s only in the last few years that I have stopped feeling my name is something I should apologise for, and started embracing it.To be clear: I don＊t begrudge the likes of Bennet changing their name. We all need to pay our rent. But we shouldn＊t have to do that by selling out our heritage or buying into a deeply flawed status quo.																																											"
"The  is on track to becoming the V&A＊s most visited music show, outdoing even David Bowie.The gallery announced on Wednesday that ticket demand was so great that it would extend  by two weeks and fully expected it to exceed the visitor figures for Bowie.The , staged in 2013, three years before his death, attracted 311,000 visitors. Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains has already reached the 300,000 mark and will now close on 15 October.It tells the story of a band that rewrote the rules of rock music performance and repeatedly pushed artistic boundaries, but whose members were always somewhat reluctant rock stars.The V&A curator Victoria Broackes, who also worked on the Bowie show, said the exhibition had been a ※massive collaboration between the V&A and  ＃ the band members, particularly Nick Mason, but notably the creative individuals, designers and architects they have worked with over many years.※That combination of authentic staging, amazing sound, rock＊n＊roll spectacle and the V&A has really shone through in the success of the exhibition and the popularity with not just fans, but with a diverse audience of all ages.§Blockbusting exhibitions exploring rock and pop have become an important part of what the V&A does since the success of a Kylie Minogue show in 2007. Some have sniffily accused the gallery of dumbing down. The V&A argues that performance and music are a key part of what the institution is and has always been.Broackes said: ※The fusion of music, theatre, design and performance which the band excelled at throughout their entire career makes them ideal for an exhibition at the V&A.§Pink Floyd may well beat the Bowie numbers at the V&A in London but it will have to go some way to beat the global success of the Bowie show, which has toured venues across the world and attracted in excess of 1.5 million visitors. That makes it the most visited show in the V&A＊s history.The most visited exhibition at the V&A in London remains , which attracted a remarkable 480,000 visitors over its 21-week run in 2015. After that it is Art Deco, which attracted 359,000 in 2003, and wedding dresses in 2014, which had 316,000 visitors.																																											"
"ear the end of?,?Amit Chaudhuri＊s seventh novel, the narrator, who is also named Amit Chaudhuri, reflects on?a book he is writing, which may well be the book we are reading. ※The book is a novel,§ he thinks; ※I＊m pretty sure of that. What marks it out as a novel is this: the author and the narrator are not one. Even if, by coincidence, they share the same name. The narrator＊s views, thoughts, observations 每 essentially, the narrator＊s life 每 are his or her own. The narrator might be created by the author, but is a mystery to him. The provenance of his or her remarks and actions is never plain.§ It＊s a moment of metafictional tricksiness which in less assured hands might feel arch, but Chaudhuri＊s mastery is such that it strikes you as utterly plausible: simply the kind of thing a writer-narrator in a book by  would?have on his mind.Chaudhuri has for a long time been ambivalent about the cultural capital the novel has claimed for itself. Addressing a symposium on literary activism in 2015, he spoke of how the form＊s dominance seemed unlikely when, as a postgraduate student at Oxford, he began writing. It is ※almost impossible now to remember§, he said, ※that poetry was the literary genre to which the greatest prestige accrued until the mid-80s ＃ that we didn＊t think of success in writing mainly in relation to the market, and in relation to a particular genre, the novel§. Where once style seemed more important than form, and readers could argue all night about the weight and measure of a writer＊s sentences, now the question of whether or not literature accurately reflects reality seems paramount. We have, so Chaudhuri has argued, been manipulated by the marketplace 每  and the complicity of academe 每 to think of the novel as the only game in town, to the detriment of other kinds of writing. is a taut, efficient book: part novel and part manifesto. It?presents itself as a work of fiction about friendship, the experiences of youth and the city of Mumbai, but really it＊s a kind of anti-novel: a book about the failures of fiction to account for the realities of memory.It opens with the narrator arriving in?Mumbai for a book tour (one of the ways in which Chaudhuri hints at the politicisation of memory is that he refers to the city as Bombay throughout, despite its renaming by the right-wing Hindu nationalist party Shiv Sena in 1995). He＊s travelling alone, and so messages friends, or people who were?once friends, to invite them to a?reading he is giving. Few respond.Like Chaudhuri, the narrator?was born in Mumbai but raised in Kolkata, and now feels ill at ease in the city of his birth. In a taxi from the airport the driver tests his knowledge of the territory. ※I＊d grown up here, but never belonged here,§ he thinks. He now spends most of his time in England, and in the years since he left most of the people he had known as a boy have also left to study or work abroad 每 part of the postcolonial diaspora of middle-class Indian life.The only school friend with whom he＊s stayed in touch is a man named Ramu, a charming but unreliable chancer who has for most of his life been addicted to heroin (※a chronic but doubtful user; he flirts with but doesn＊t revel in danger; he＊s timid§). Ramu＊s addiction has prevented him from properly growing up, or leaving the city of his youth. Through the arrested development of hard drug use he embodies the narrator＊s memories of his own childhood. But on his return to?Mumbai he discovers that Ramu has been sent to rehab, and his friend＊s absence from the city haunts the first half of the book. Also haunting him are?thoughts of the 2008 terror attacks on the city, when 10 members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, an al-Qaida offshoot, carried out a series of bombings and shootings that left more than 160 dead.Chaudhuri would probably disavow the term, but in part is a work of what is nowadays called ※autofiction§, having something in common with , or Chris Kraus＊s , or Nell Zink＊s wonderful . Like the narrator, Chaudhuri studied at UCL and Oxford. Like him, he is a talented musician, and wrote a novel set in Mumbai about music called .

"ast weekend, 24 newly renovated houses in  were opened to the public so that prospective tenants could apply to live there. Within a day all were taken.That these houses exist at all is something of a miracle, as they are part of the Welsh Streets, an area of handsome Victorian terraces that national and city government, at a cost of millions in public money, spent more than a decade trying to destroy. Their survival shows how, sometimes, persistent campaigning can defeat the monolithic, clumsy and capricious thinking of authority.The Welsh Streets were victims of the Blair government＊s housing market renewal initiative, which was one of the more perverse applications of market ideology to social issues. Launched in 2002, it saw the problem of rundown city neighbourhoods as being one of , which it sought to address by, among other things, spending hundreds of millions of pounds on the demolition and clearance of thousands of what were seen as ※obsolete§ houses across northern England and the Midlands.It repeated the much-derided rehousing policies of the 1960s 每 the crude condemnation of houses as ※slums§, the failure to see inherent value either in building stock or in the communities contained therein, the belief that social ills could be cured by attacking their physical fabric. But it came with less of the 1960s idealism about the new homes that might be created. The programme failed to acknowledge the value of respecting the past, with its memories and the sense of continuity and identity that it brings. According to one campaigner, it was also an over-reaction to the decades-long decline of industrial cities, and failed to notice that a corner was being turned.In Liverpool, in areas such as Anfield and Granby, it led to the forced eviction of hundreds of people from homes that, in some cases, they had occupied for decades. Homeowners were obliged to sell for low prices, which were insufficient to buy replacements.  were broken up. Whole neighbourhoods went into ※managed decline§, which meant streets vacated and ※tinned up§, some demolished, and a few determined residents left behind in what became frightening wastelands.The Welsh Streets, an area built by Welsh developers and Welsh labour 每 ※hewn§, as walesonline put it, ※from the clay and slate of Wales by the sweat of a generation of migrant workers§ 每 became famous. This was partly because Ringo Starr was born there, in , but also because the destruction of these houses, of a type that in London would sell for six- or seven-figure sums, looked particularly wanton. Liverpool city council, incentivised by national government funding, planned to demolish 440 homes, and set about buying them up, emptying them and creating mini-ghost-towns.Whatever good might have come of the housing market renewal project 每 reports by National Audit Office and the Audit Commission suggested that it was limited 每 was curtailed in 2011, when the coalition government decided to terminate what had been planned as a 15-year programme. Liverpool city council, arguing that most residents wanted the new homes they had been promised, pushed on with its demolition plans.In January 2015, following a public inquiry, the demolition plans were stopped by the then communities secretary, Eric Pickles. The decision, said the city＊s mayor, Joe Anderson, was ※yet another kick in the teeth for long-suffering residents§, but the council 每 having no other option 每 set about plans for refurbishment. It went into partnership with , a company that had successfully renewed derelict terraces in Accrington. Their big idea was to build for rent, not sale, at sufficiently low rates to be accessible to nurses, careworkers, university lecturers and others usually priced out of good-quality housing. There would also be homes for social rent and others for sale and combinations of renting and selling.The 24 houses just snapped up are the result of a pilot project for a plan to create about 300 homes, mostly through refurbishment. Placefirst has worked out ways to recombine the traditional houses to make homes of two, three and four bedrooms. It improved the planting and the paving in the streets and cleared out the old backyards, alleys and rear extensions in order to make communal gardens. The intention, I＊m told, was to make place where ※kids can play and people can really get to know each other, not like standing in a lift in a block of flats§. Anderson now says that the plans are ※really exciting§ and will ※breathe new life into the area and give it a long-term sustainable future§.Throughout the long struggle over the Welsh Streets, their most persistent champion has been Save Britain＊s . The campaign group＊s Liverpool heritage expert Jonathan Brown says that it challenged the official line that the houses were sub-standard, outdated and beyond repair. Although they had problems, they were, ※according to the council＊s own statistics, in above-average condition. House prices were rising. These houses had survived two world wars, Margaret Thatcher, and the 1981 Toxteth riots, and now Tony Blair came along with all this money to knock them down.§ The option of renovating old houses to modern standards is, Brown says, ※actually a futuristic sustainable housing form§.Save Britain＊s Heritage was joined by some local residents, but not all, as one effect of housing market renewal was to divide communities. Some wanted to keep the streets they knew, others saw new houses as the only way to end the damp and rats from which they were suffering. The option of getting the best of both worlds 每 the one now being implemented 每 was not available.If the Welsh Streets are now heading for a happy ending, it is also, as Brown says, ※bittersweet§. The residents who were there over a decade ago were moved out and scattered, although some are now returning. Money has been wasted.But, if by much too convoluted and destructive a route, it has been demonstrated that the past has a value to the present, and you don＊t have to scrub it all out and start again.

"After 51 years of controversy and celebration, Europe＊s biggest street party 每 the  每 opens today against one of the most politicised backdrops in its history. following more than 650 pre-emptive arrests by police and simmering disquiet over the where at least 80 people died. Its blackened shell stands close to the official carnival route.Organisers yesterday appealed for the event to ※lift the spirits of people§ and serve as a mark of respect for the victims and those left destitute, most of whom are waiting to be rehoused. At 3pm today, and again on Monday, hundreds of thousands of revellers will observe a minute＊s silence for the Grenfell dead as well as for , 25, and , 20, who both died recently following contact with police. The families of both men will be attending the festival on the float.Many carnivalgoers in west London are expected to wear or accessorise ※green for Grenfell§. Hip-hop artist Akala was among those yesterday . Stafford Scott of said feelings were running high among many in the black community and levels of anger were ※very close§ to conditions before the  32 years ago. ※There＊s a feeling that the police are waging a war against the black community,§ said Scott. Jair Tavares, Da Costa＊s cousin, said the family was  and believed that recent policing tactics had stirred tensions. ※It＊s almost like they want something to happen so they can shut it [the carnival] down,§ said Tavares. ※If anything, people should be scared of going to the carnival because the police are something to be scared of. They don＊t guarantee our safety.§Scotland Yard, which is expected to have around 6,000 officers on duty, has remained unrepentant about its policing approach, which apart from 656 arrests will see facial recognition technology at the carnival, though this has been criticised by human rights group Liberty. A protective ring of steel barriers and concrete blocks and weapons checks will be in place. David Musker, the commander in charge of policing the event, said there was no specific counter-terrorism intelligence, but security plans had been ※thoroughly reviewed§ after the Barcelona attack on 17 August, in which 15 people died after being hit by a van.The police have also  in Catford, south London, in a raid that it linked to the carnival, 12 miles across the capital. A statement by the Metropolitan police  ※How many drugs did you lot seize in the run-up to Glastonbury or we only doing tweets like this for black events?§ Weyman Bennett from Stand Up Against Racism said: ※We need the carnival more than ever, especially as the black community is angry at the repeated deaths of their young people at the hands of the police. The carnival calls for justice and unity and we will remember Grenfell and we will hold the authorities, the government and the police to account.§ Carnivalgoers will be able to offer tributes to the Grenfell victims in a quiet ※reflection zone§ near the blackened high-rise, where performers have been encouraged to lower their music volume in respect for those who died in the inferno. Posters have been erected at locations where the tower can be seen, asking the public not to take photographs or selfies. Medical staff will also be on hand to provide ※mental health first aid§ for those affected by the tragedy.Local Labour MP Emma Dent Coad said the festival could be viewed in terms of a mass wake for the entire community. ※It＊s a time in the middle of the grieving to relax and honour the dead and get together and party briefly. I don＊t think there＊s any problem. It is a cultural thing to have a wake, and that＊s how I see it,§ she said.The chair of the carnival trust, Pepe Francis, said the Grenfell tragedy had imbued the festival with even more meaning than usual. ※Because of Grenfell, I would like to see the carnival this year become one of the most successful ones ever, because I think it will pay a lot of tribute to what a festival like this can do to ease the minds of the people (who are) the victims,§ he said.Francis added that he had spoken to members of the Grenfell community who had indicated they wanted the carnival to go ahead as normal. ※Obviously there are varying views 每 some people feel it shouldn＊t. But the majority feel it should, and it should be one of the best carnivals. Even the people who come and for whatever reason cause trouble 每 even they 每 I think it＊s a reason for them to respect that,§ he said.																																											"
"e has made waves in television with the smash hitand the acclaimed and controversial adaptation of his royal drama; now Mike Bartlett is hoping to make a similar splash on his return to theatre. His state of the nation play  opens at the Almeida in London next month 每 but whatever you do don＊t mention the B word.※It has been presented as a Brexit play but the word Brexit isn＊t mentioned once,§ says Bartlett. ※It＊s as much about personal things as political. I wanted to write something about what it feels like to live in Britain at the moment, something that was clearly set in 2017. Theatre was more suited to that because in television by the time it aired the world would have moved on.§The play＊s description on the Almeida＊s website is deliberately vague although Bartlett does offer further clues. ※It takes place against a background of national uncertainty but it＊s also about a woman [＊s Victoria Hamilton] making a very big decision in her life and how that affects both her family and her sense of identity.§The choice of setting 每 an English country house 每 is equally deliberate. ※There＊s something about French windows and a garden and a house that feels very like the environment that people always talk about when they think of the state of the nation and class,§ says 36-year-old Bartlett. ※A lot of plays about this country in the 20th century have taken place in those sorts of environments. They＊re a very resonant way to talk about British identity or a certain kind of British identity, which is what the play is interrogating.§As always with Bartlett, however, things are not quite as straightforward as they appear. ※As well as asking what do we want Britain to be?＊ we can also ask ＆what do we want a quintessentially British play to be?＊ and hopefully is playing with that idea and exploring it and slightly detonating it.§Before that, however, comes the return of  and Suranne Jones＊s beleaguered GP Gemma Foster whose well-ordered, ever-so-slightly-smug life falls dramatically apart after she begins to suspect her husband (Bertie Carvel) of infidelity. The first series was a word-of-mouth hit that pulled in more than nine million viewers for its finale, making it the most watched new BBC drama of 2015. Bartlett admits that he was stunned by its success.※The moment I realised it was really working was when the  families were shown watching it. In theatre you can sit and watch the audience and understand what the play is doing to them but TV goes out to all intents and purposes in silence. It was only when I saw  that I could see that some of the stuff I really hoped would work 每 the plot twists but also the bigger questions 每 were really landing and making for uncomfortable sofa viewing. It＊s an extreme situation but I think people relate because almost everyone who has ever had a relationship knows what it feels like to feel betrayed.§Given the explosive yet deeply satisfying finale was he tempted to leave it there and ratings be damned? ※I did know that the second series had to be a new thing on some level,§ he says with a laugh, adding that he was determined not to simply retread old ground. ※This series deals with divorce and a child trapped between two parents and with what happens after you＊ve invested your entire passionate self into creating a positive marriage and then that＊s broken up. Because all that passion doesn＊t go away it just goes in a different direction. My hope when writing it was that if we had pitched series two as a new show with entirely different characters it would still have been greenlit.§That said, fans of the ＆oh my God did she/he really just do that?＊ moments that turned the first series into such much-watch television should rest assured they are still there. ※Often when you＊re going through this kind of thing it can feel like you＊re going crazy and the world has detonated and I wanted to reflect that,§ Bartlett explains. ※When what＊s at stake are the things that are most primal to us 每 our children, our emotions, our choices 每 then we do crazy stuff. So yes, it＊s enjoyable to watch and has big rollercoaster peaks and troughs but, I hope, it＊s also got truth to it.§While his first love remains the stage, Bartlett is increasingly at the top of every television executive＊s shortlist: next year will see the arrival of , a three-part mini-series starring Adrian Lester and John Simm for ITV and the six-part newspaper drama , , controller of BBC1 drama commissioning, as a prime example of the new ※aspirational§ dramas the channel hopes to create.※I＊d love to say it＊s going to restore journalists＊ reputations but I＊m not convinced it will,§ Bartlett remarks drily of , which follows the fortunes of two newspapers not a million miles from the  and the  in the post-hacking era. ※What it does do is interrogate why news is important and how we cover it. It＊s also very much a workplace drama set in a very distinct workplace in a time of uncertainty. I know that people might expect the liberal left broadsheet are the heroes and boo the tabloid but it＊s more complicated than that. Part of the fun is never letting an audience know which way the show sits.§, which covers the fallout after Lester＊s surgeon fails to save the life of Simm＊s son after a stabbing, similarly rejects easy conclusions. ※I was fascinated by the idea that when you go to a hospital you have to give yourself or your loved one over to someone you＊ve never met before and completely trust them more than you trust anyone else in your life,§ he says. ※What then happens if the outcome isn＊t what you＊d hoped? I was very clear when writing  that we were never going to land on one opinion as the right one. We＊re legitimately telling both stories at the same time.§Yet for all that Bartlett loves the democracy of television 每 ※It＊s the ultimate Shakespearean model of we＊re going to gather up as many people as we can of all different types, tell them one story and try to take them to a place which is further than they wanted to go§ 每 he stresses that theatre, now more than ever, is one of our most contemporary art forms. ※Twenty years ago, we didn＊t have mobile phones so every room we went to was almost like a little theatre. There were no other screens, no other distractions. Now no room is like a theatre, and that＊s placed it in a very different, vital and important place.§																																											"
"n 8 July, 2012, the philanthropist and writer Sigrid Rausing flew with her family to their summer house by the sea in Sweden. While they were travelling, everyone was happy: even their dog, Leo, seemed to be smiling as they pointed out the old familiar landmarks to one another from the plane. Once they were on the ground, however, something changed 每 for Sigrid, if not the others. The sky was blue. The policeman who checked their passports on the tarmac was kind. But the atmosphere was suddenly eerie. ※I feel like something is going to happen,§ she said to her husband, Eric.The next day, she had a telephone call scheduled, the subject for discussion being the issue of human rights in Belarus. It began, as planned, at 2.30pm. Soon afterwards, Eric slipped silently into her office. He had written a note, which he now passed to her, and which she read as the voice on the other end of the line continued to talk of Andr谷i Sannikov, the activist who had recently been released from prison by President Lukashenko. Five words: half expected, and yet so utterly unimaginable. ※They have found Eva＊s body,§ it said. What does she remember of this moment? That the room stilled. That she couldn＊t breathe, or move. That the shock had an underwater quality, heavy and silent.Everyone knows 每 or they think they know 每 the rest. The headlines were feverish, gothic to an almost exuberant degree. As she would shortly find out, that morning her brother Hans had been stopped by the police on Wandsworth Bridge Road in south-west London, their attention having been drawn by his driving. Following the discovery of a crack pipe and drugs in his car, as well as a collection of letters addressed to his wife, Eva, his vast house in Cadogan Place, Chelsea, was searched, and it was there that the horrible discovery was made. On a bed in a first-floor room that a policeman would describe as looking like a squat, a body was found, covered first by a pile of blankets, duvets and clothing 每 these were coated with white powder, possibly a kind of deodorant 每 and then by a blue tarpaulin, several television screens and some drawers.  had lain there since 7 May, when her heart, weakened by years of drug dependence, had finally given up. Later, Hans would say in a statement that he had hidden her like this because he could not face the fact that she was dead. On 1 August, he was convicted of preventing the lawful burial of her body, and given a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.In her powerful and spare new memoir 每 it is called , which, as well as meaning chaos, is an old English legal term for the crime of maiming 每 Hans Rausing＊s sister takes a long time to reach this horror show. Circling around it, she is more than 100 pages in before she finally arrives at the fact of a body. Naturally, this has to do with dread. Five years on, and though the details are well known to her now, she would still rather look away. But other forces are at play, too: her refusal, perhaps, to give in to ghouls; her natural tendency to approach any subject in an academic manner, pausing for thought as she goes (she trained as an anthropologist). To be writing such?a book at all felt, she says, ※very transgressive§ in a family, both famous and famously secretive, that has its own code of omerta, so no wonder if she drags her feet. Still, whatever her reasons, her elisions and prevarications have a striking effect. As the weight of her pages makes clear, what seemed sudden to the world 每 flashbulbs do not take account of a backstory 每 was, for her, years in?the making. And thanks to this, you find yourself, once in her presence, thinking less about?Hans and the awful thing that he did than about the fact that Sigrid somehow managed, in spite of everything, to keep going, and even, perhaps,?to?thrive.When I tell her this, she laughs. ※I don＊t know about that,§ she says, in an accent that is still Scandinavian at its edges (her family came here from Sweden in the 1980s). Pressure, she believes, expresses itself in various ways, not all of which involve having a nervous breakdown. ※Remember, in my book I write about my horse and a concussion I suffered when I fell [in 2009]. That gallop was dangerous, and I knew it was. But now that I think about it, I couldn＊t have asked for a more perfect condition. It was a very severe concussion, and concussion is about the obliteration of memory. Under pressure, you couldn＊t ask for something better, and curiously, it was a relief to have it.§ As she also reminds me,  is full of portents, most memorably an adder that crosses her path not once, but twice. ※Suppressed pressure turns into superstition, too. I noticed it in myself, the way I got more superstitious.§ Foreboding, in the dark years, was a constant: a queasy cloak she could never quite take off, even as she got on with her life.Our meeting takes place at the Holland Park offices of , the literary magazine that she owns and now edits (she lives nearby in a huge house that is supposed to have London＊s second-biggest private garden after Buckingham Palace). It is high summer, and everyone seems to be away; the building is cool and quiet and our voices, even lowered, sound unnervingly loud to my ears. She is wearing what I take to be her uniform 每 white shirt, trousers, mannish brogues 每 and her face, as she＊s about to remind me, is entirely without makeup. ※It＊s always the same,§ she says. ※In every interview I do, there＊s always a line that goes: Sigrid Rausing, the Tetra Pak heiress who wears no makeup.§ This isn＊t a warning: though she isn＊t one to talk for the sake of it (it＊s impossible not to notice that she isn＊t afraid of silence), her manner is confiding, almost eager. Later, when we talk about money, I＊m not surprised when she tells me that, in spite of her huge wealth, she finds it perfectly easy (too easy, perhaps) to trust people.Even before its publication, her book is causing trouble. In the days after we talk, Eva Rausing＊s father, Tom Kemeny,  and damn it for being ※self-indulgent and pretentious§ and upsetting to the family. Sigrid, though, has no regrets, at least not in the fact of the book＊s existence. Yes, there were things that, for legal reasons connected to Hans and Eva＊s four children, she could not say; if she＊d been completely free, ※it would not perhaps have been quite so sweet＃ there is a sweetness to it that now＃ disturbs me§. But this cannot detract from the relief that writing it has brought her. ※It＊s interesting,§ she says. ※I never believed in catharsis. I thought of it as a cliche. But the truth is that it was immensely cathartic. I often wept as I wrote, and I did come through to another place. When you write a book, you end up with a tremendous grip on the story. You＊ve taken parts out, so it＊s a false grip; the real story was much worse and far more complicated. But in the?process of writing it＃ I suppose it＊s like knitting. You create a pattern, you stitch it altogether, and that becomes the story, and you feel like you＊re on top of it. That discipline is very?comforting.§Did she feel compelled to write it? ※I think I started because I was so shocked,§ she says. ※There was so much grief. I＊m somebody who has always written in response to what is going on in my life. After that, I got this very intense urge to find out exactly what happened; it became almost like a detective story. I needed to do it, but very little of it ended up in the book. Then I started to think about the broader questions to do with addiction. I came to the conclusion that it is more mysterious than we think: a no man＊s land, halfway between mental illness and bad behaviour.§ What, she asks in , is the relationship between her family＊s wealth and privilege and Hans＊s addiction? Is his illness in the Rausing genes 每 her great-grandfather was an alcoholic 每 or has it as much to do with nurture as with nature? Outwardly, the three Rausing children, with their green eyes and brown hair, were peas in a pod. But while she and her older sister, Lisbet, became academics at first, like their mother, Marit, Hans, who is 16 months her junior, went a different way: at the age of 18 or 19, he met heroin on a Goan beach. In a meritocratic country like Sweden, was it impossible for him to model himself on his father, Hans Sr, the billionaire? Or was he simply more susceptible to temptation than his sisters?What does her family make of the book? She is interested in how different their responses have been. ※My editor at Knopf [the American publisher of ] kept interrogating my use of the word ※us§. ※Who is this ＆us＊?§ he would ask. But in fact it turns out that he was right and the ※we§ is a collection of individuals. Everyone has their own view. Some do [like it], and some don＊t, and I have to live with that.§ What about Hans? Has he read it? She shakes her head. ※He has said that he prefers not to, and I can see why.§ In 2014, Hans, who is in recovery, married Julia Delves Broughton, a director of Christie＊s and the younger sister of Isabella Blow, the late fashion stylist. They celebrated with a ritzy party. How would she describe him now? ※I think he is happy and well,§ she says, carefully.While this is the case, her long-held vigilance remains in abeyance, something that comes as a relief: ※I can feel it subsiding,§ she tells me, her shoulders visibly falling. However, it is unlikely ever to disappear altogether, and not only because recovery is, as she puts it, a ※fragile§ state. In her book, she notes that she continues to be haunted by the sight of such things as sweet wrappers and plastic bottles, however innocent their purpose 每 and it＊s a line that she stands by. ※Oh yes, I meant it when I wrote that it seemed to me that the line between teenage mess and a drug den was very fine,§ she says. ※It  very fine 每 much more so than we＊re willing to admit.§Hans and Eva Rausing met in the late 1980s, when she was asked by the rehab facility she had recently left to come back and talk to him, to persuade him to stay on (he was about to walk out). They became friends, and some time later 每 by now a couple 每 Hans took her to visit his family in the country. Sigrid remembers that first encounter well: there she was, a thin, blond, American-seeming woman (her mother was from North Carolina) in a pink Chanel suit, who looked simultaneously ※young and old, conventional and wild, groomed and unkempt§. Their wedding took place in 1992. By 1999, they had three children. Then, eight years after they were married, they had a ※catastrophic§ relapse. This lasted for 12 years. Sigrid was 38 when it began, and 50 when it ended.She did what she could to help, but she also knew 每 experience had taught her 每 that the families of addicts are as powerless over drugs as addicts themselves. ※You can be too understanding,§ she says. ※It would have been better if everybody had taken Eric＊s view [her husband, , doesn＊t really regard addiction as an illness and saw Hans＊s and Eva＊s drug taking as irresponsible and selfish]. Part of codependency is that you start to think that you can help.§ In her book, she reproduces parts of a letter she wrote to Eva in 2004, in which she reassures her that she is on her side. Reading it, it struck me as not only generous and kind, but amazingly frank, too. ※The problem is that the descent into rock bottom is so long if you live the kind of life we do,§ she writes. ※Propped up by nannies and staff, one could go on in a twilight existence of alcohol and pills for years.§ But it was no good. The descent would indeed be long. ※[Without their wealth] they would both have died, or gone to prison,§ she says. As it was, locked in their room with only their drugs for company, the names of their dealers scrawled on its walls, Hans and Eva were like a couple of castaways, ※scavengers in their own house§.In the summer of 2006, Eva almost died from endocarditis, a heart infection, probably caused by dirty needles. The family staged an intervention. Eva stormed out, enraged. Hans listened, checked into rehab, but stayed only a few days. After this, social workers became involved. The couple＊s children were deemed to be at risk. In 2007, the social workers told Sigrid and Lisbet that unless they took measures to remove them, they would do this themselves. And so, the sisters went to the family court. The section in  that covers this period is perhaps its most painful to read. Hans and Eva would arrive for the hearings hours late. He would be ※slumped forward, eyes half closed§. She would fidget constantly, and then abruptly leave. On her return, she would be swaying and dreamy. Eventually, the children were placed in Sigrid＊s care (she also has a son of her own). The youngest was six years old. ※Hans and Eva loved their children,§ she writes. ※I know that. But isn＊t that also a cliche of parenting? What＊s the point of love?if drugs come first?§ By her telling, which is never boastful, she was a devoted, conscientious aunt. Still, guilt gnawed away at her: ※People praised us for looking after them. But removing children from their parents is always an exercise?of?power.§After this, contact was patchy. She never saw Eva again, and she did not see Hans from 2008 until 2014. Eva, though, was inclined to text and email. Sometimes, these notes were furious: ※I despise you with an intensity that is not describable.§ Sometimes, they were sad: ※I sense that I am going to die soon.§ She told social workers that Eric was gay and that Sigrid was depressed and on drugs, and that they were not suitable parents (somewhat comically, the social workers, even as they investigated, felt compelled to communicate their disapproval of Eva＊s implicit homophobia). She made a wax doll of Sigrid, for the purposes of witchcraft. She also pursued a vendetta against Sigrid＊s father, Hans, who , the Swedish prime minister who was assassinated in 1986. She even wrote to a journalist about this (the Swedish tabloids made much of it after her death).In January 2012, she told a friend she was going to go into rehab 每 and she did, in April, a week before she died. But she was thrown out, for having brought Valium with her. ※I couldn＊t have predicted what happened, partly because I really did think it was possible that Eva was on her way to recovery,§ Sigrid says now. ※I felt so angry with myself afterwards, because I thought it would [if anyone was to die] be Hans. But of course it was going to be her. He was a big, strong man and she was a petite woman with a weak heart.§ Was it secrecy 每 by now, they were virtual recluses 每 that made her blind? ※Yes. But it＊s also about love. Its price [is] fear of loss of the beloved. In some sense, this book is a love letter to?my?brother.§She and Hans were close as children 每 all three siblings were united in their loathing of school 每 and their childhood was, in the holidays at least, idyllic. She describes the weeks they spent at their Swedish summer house as charmed, as if out of a fairytale. And yet, her parents seem to have been, for all their immense wealth, quite normal. It is not as though the place was running over with chauffeurs and butlers: her father cooked and shopped and took out rubbish: ※I think that was to do with Sweden, and social democracy. My mother was a radical social democrat when she met my father.§When did she first know her family was different to other people＊s? ※It was always there,§?she says. And quiet Hans struggled with it. ※Who do you become if you are the son of a very, very successful entrepreneur? I don＊t know if you saw Hilton Als＊s  She came from a very wealthy background, and she once wrote a letter to a friend in which she described walking through the family fur emporium and sensing everybody＊s reaction when they saw her, the heiress: she felt a bit like a princess, but there was also something slightly malicious about that gaze. I think that was true for us, too. The question of inheritance is one that society hasn＊t solved.§In the late 1980s, while Sigrid was studying for her PhD in London, Hans came to stay at her flat in Islington. This wasn＊t a success. By the time she asked him to go, he had stopped washing. Again, he went into rehab, but as he slowly recovered, Sigrid fell into a depression that felt like a ※cold claw§ at the throat. One evening, she took a knife and cut long stripes on her arm. Sensing danger, she went into rehab herself. ※I don＊t like the word codependence,§ she says. ※The relationship between my depression and his addiction is quite complicated. But I think they weren＊t dissimilar. Somebody said there is a bit of survivor＊s guilt in the book, and that＊s possible. Science has shown that alcohol addiction at least is inheritable. People think this might be true of all addictions, and I broadly agree with that. So, you come into the world with a vulnerability. If you＊re going to be all right, you need certain conditions. Work is one. Love is another.§Work has always been her balm. ※In the end, the thing that really helped me was going to live on a collective farm in Estonia [she wrote about this experience, fieldwork for her PhD, in her book ].

"One of the most important artists in the history of recorded music,  seemed to arrive fully formed into the post-second world war country-music landscape. But the Alabama native had spent years honing his craft. By the time he made his first records, for the Sterling label in 1947, Williams had extensively toured the south yet those releases failed to garner much attention. One song, Honky Tonkin＊, had given Sterling＊s A&R consultant, Fred Rose, a sense that Williams had something special: Rose had just set up a music-publishing company with his friend, Nashville stalwart Roy Acuff, and, after signing Williams to the Acuff-Rose roster, brokered a deal for the singer-songwriter with a new label established by film studio MGM. The first MGM session didn＊t bring Williams his breakthrough hit, but with Move It On Over he laid down a valuable marker, hinting at how country, when mixed with blues, would soon evolve into rock＊n＊roll. That day＊s work also yielded I Saw the Light. In an era where pop songwriters were still for the most part reporters, standing at a distance from their subject and describing it for the listener, Williams took the lessons he＊d learned as a child from a black street musician, , back home in Montgomery, and wrote a very personal piece of blues-infused gospel music. The idea for the song came from a late-night ride back from a gig, with the driver 每 his domineering mother, Lillie 每 shouting to wake him because she＊d seen the light at the nearby airfield, so knew they were just about home.Infamously recorded against Fred Rose＊s wishes, something of a mystery to the players who performed on the session, and the subject of a lawsuit after it emerged that what Williams had led Rose to believe was an original song turned out to be a 1920s show tune, Lovesick Blues had an inauspicious birth. But it was the making of Hank Williams, its weird structure 每 the verses are choruses, there＊s more than one middle-eight, the intro was copped from another song entirely 每 and his -like yodelling turning it from a novelty to a classic that topped charts for months after its release. Williams had been diagnosed in childhood with a spinal deformity, and a horse-riding accident in his teens left him in constant pain. Alcohol became his primary medicine, and those long drives in cramped cars through pre-interstate America, added to crippling shyness and stage fright, compounded the problem. Long before he hit the big time, Williams was a full-blown alcoholic. His reputation preceded him, to the degree that the  每 the Nashville-based radio show that effectively determined who became a country star, and how long they remained at the top 每 had refused to book him. On 18 June 1949, Williams played the song on stage at the show＊s Ryman Auditorium venue, and the raw promise Rose had seen just months earlier was transformed overnight into the stuff of legend.Williams＊ reputation today rests, in part, on his status as the artist who cemented the notion that the singer and the song had to be indivisible if the effect on the listener was to have sufficient resonance and depth. Yet Williams was also a fine interpreter of others＊ songs, so much so that Lost Highway, written by , is often mistaken for a Williams original. The song＊s protagonist seems to have ambled straight out of the dustbowl, an everyman doomed by luckless love to roam, rootless and alone, in constant search of redemptive purpose. Williams＊ own struggle to reconcile the sacred and the profane certainly helped him wear Payne＊s song as if it were one of ＊s trademark suits, but it＊s his voice 每 cracked, careworn but never tired 每 that makes this the definitive reading of an all-time classic, and a high point in a career that had more than its share.Williams has been hailed as the ※Hillbilly Shakespeare§, and the epithet fits in more ways than one. The idea of a largely self-taught, working-class genius clearly was to prove so unsettling to certain cultural gatekeepers that conspiracies of hidden helpers powering the art along are advanced as the only rational explanation.    Even in as singular a body of work as Williams＊s, I＊m So Lonesome... is a shock. The idea of narrative is abandoned for a series of bleak visions of desperate, aching loneliness, almost all involving sights from nature 每 a train passes through, but the only human soul we sense in this desolate landscape is the writer. It isn＊t until the penultimate line that we know for certain that this is a song about missing a particular person, rather than an examination of loneliness and isolation in the round: and even then it＊s never made clear who that might be (a lover, presumably; but it could be a parent, a sibling, a child, a friend), nor why they＊ve gone, nor whether there＊s a realistic expectation that they＊ll ever come back. Yet, more than anything in the lyric, Williams＊ taut, resilient performance compels because you can hear the efforts he＊s making to keep alive the faintest hope that the situation might yet be resolved.More than anyone who came before him 每 and in a way that would become de rigueur for every singer-songwriter worth their salt in the decades to follow 每 Williams was adept at mining his real-life travails to unearth the raw material he would carve into masterpieces. His tempestuous relationship with Audrey Sheppard began in 1943: the couple were married a year later, in a petrol station, just days after Audrey＊s divorce from her first marriage came through. She became his manager and brokered Williams＊ first meeting with Fred Rose: but her insistence on appearing on stage and on record with her husband caused tensions which his dependence on alcohol only worsened. Among the many songs that lay bare the pain and heartbreak of a love that＊s falling apart, Williams also wrote just as vividly about the kinds of domestic storms that most folks could manage to weather. Why Don＊t You Love Me is firmly in the latter camp, the tone playful, the song written from the perspective of the husband attempting to use jocularity to dig himself out of an argument he knows he was wrong to pick to start with (※My hair＊s still curly and my eyes are still blue / Why don＊t you love me like you used to do?§). There is a real power here 每 a sense that a determination to find something to laugh about, even in the midst of crisis, can help keep two people from tearing each other to pieces. Williams is rightly lauded for his bleak songs of irreparable heartbreak and irretrievable loss, but he was just as brilliant when writing about the times where the darkness hadn＊t yet completely edged out the light.  The 1950 session is also notable for marking the first time on record that Williams was able to record with the majority of his regular touring group, the Drifting Cowboys: hitherto, he＊d been paired with session musicians on his records. Fred Rose often encouraged the Drifting Cowboys＊ steel-guitar player, Don Helms, to play the highest notes possible, partly to help the records cut through the AM radio static and compensate for the limited fidelity most listeners would get from their radio sets. Helms＊s high, lonesome playing, and to an only slightly lesser extent Jerry Rivers＊ fiddle, became as defining features of the remainder of Williams＊ output as their leader＊s voice and writing. With his records selling by the bucketload, Williams had the power to call his own shots, and he embarked on a series of recordings of talking blues, cautionary tales and verse-form morality plays set to music. MGM, wary of damaging the powerful Williams brand, agreed to release them as long as they were billed to an alias, so that jukebox owners and those putting their cents in the slot on expectation of hearing the next Williams hit wouldn＊t end up getting an unexpected three-minute browbeating of their dissolute ways.Williams would sometimes refer to Luke the Drifter as ※my half brother§, and there was no real secret about his real-life identity: after his early radio stints in Alabama, his residency on the Louisiana Hayride, and the expanded exposure brought by the Grand Ole Opry, Williams＊ speaking voice was as familiar and distinctive as his singing voice. But the sermonising and the finger-wagging had selective appeal: for every record Luke the Drifter sold, Williams shifted dozens. Everything＊s Okay shows that Williams was on to something with Luke, even if the numbers didn＊t back him up. There is considerable humour in the song and Williams＊ deadpan delivery milks the material for every last chuckle and wry smile. But the song＊s real intentions are to offer something deeper and far more substantial. True, some of the things Uncle Bill is facing are in there as jokes 每 ※my ma-in-law just moved in to stay§; ※the preacher＊s comin＊ Sunday, to spend the day§ 每 but they are heavily outnumbered by the biting problems many of Williams＊ rural fan base would know all too well: ※The weevils got the corn and the rain rotted the hay§; ※the mortgage is due, and I can＊t pay§; ※we＊re gonna have a new baby ＊bout the first of May.§ In the hands of an outsider, it would have come across as the songwriter laughing at the poor and their delusions. But Williams knew his people, and understood their lives: in his gentle, perceptive care, this story 每 made-up, yet consisting entirely of truths 每 becomes a hymn to the heroic stoicism of those able to do nothing but keep on keeping on.The dualities embodied in Williams are perhaps nowhere more inextricably intertwined than in Cold, Cold Heart. Audrey was in hospital: the couple had been rowing, each suspecting the other of infidelity, Williams＊ drinking turning every conversation into a potential battleground. He visited with gifts to try to make amends, and she threw them 每 and him 每 out. It requires courage, and perhaps a degree of clinical detachment, to turn an episode like that into a song 每 not to mention a particular mentality to describe it as among his favourite pieces of his own work.  covered it, to considerable commercial success, within weeks of its release: bandmates recall Williams delightedly playing that version any time they found it on the juke box in a diner or bar. However, what＊s better than the original version is what appears to be its first public performance, recorded in January 1951, and available on a box set released in 2009 called Hank Williams Revealed. Williams and the Drifting Cowboys were under contract to perform every weekday during 1951 on a , and sponsored by the Mother＊s Best flour company. When the band were on the road, pre-recorded shows were broadcast: a cache of 16-inch acetates containing 72 of these shows came to light when WSM was clearing out its archives and, after a legal battle, were released in the 2000s. The clarity of the recordings is often better than on Williams＊ MGM releases, and the relaxed and informal nature of the sessions allows for some startling moments. The truth and the tragedy of Williams and Audrey＊s relationship was that they loved each other despite the traits each possessed which prevented them from being able to sustain their happiness. Lycrecia, Audrey＊s daughter from her first marriage, but who bridles at the term stepdaughter 每 ※By law that＊s what I am,§ she said in a 2008 interview, ※I realise that. But not really. He was my father in every sense of the word.§ 每 doubts that the details in songs Williams is supposed to have written about himself and Audrey were real. But, as so often, the broader truths are unmistakable. The song grew from the opening line: ※Today I passed you on the street / And my heart fell at your feet.§ Even from a writer as sparing and economical as Williams, it＊s a marvel: the subject is the briefest of moments, as former lovers brush against one another while walking in different directions. Whether or not that encounter happened as it is portrayed couldn＊t matter any less: what＊s clear is that the emotions the song describes are undoubtedly the ones Williams felt for Audrey.For all that his catalogue is full up to that Stetson brim with sad songs, Williams only released one record written entirely in a minor key. On its own, that might have been enough to make Ramblin＊ Man stand out 每 but there is an otherworldly weirdness to the track that ensures it delivers and retains a unique power and potency. Originally recorded and released as a Luke the Drifter track, it was reissued posthumously as a Hank Williams single 每 the only time that happened. It is easy to hear why, as Ramblin＊ Man fits better in Williams＊ evocative discography than the Luke the Drifter canon. In some ways it＊s a companion piece to Lost Highway 每 a tale of a man compelled to stalk the margins by powers outwith his control, or even perhaps his comprehension. The narrator of the song clearly wants to find peace and a place to call home, but a force he can＊t resist compels him to keep moving on. The final stanza, which imagines a response to the character＊s inevitable death, certainly acquired more power once Williams had passed away: but this would still sound spooked and unsettling even if he was still alive today. 1951 had seen Williams become country＊s first superstar, but his success was achieved at unsustainable personal cost. Records are incomplete but it appears he played around 100 gigs, in addition to his weekly commitment to appear in Nashville for the Grand Ole Opry most Saturdays, and the daily Mother＊s Best breakfast shows on WSM. Six recording sessions produced 21 tracks; he and Audrey opened a shop in Nashville; he signed a film deal (though never made any films), and in June was honoured by his home town with a Montgomery Hank Williams Homecoming Day. In November, he had an accident while hunting with Jerry Rivers that further aggravated his back: in December he underwent surgery. Unable to fulfil commitments for dates around new year, he recorded an apology that Audrey was to play to audiences. Knowing he was at home, likely had been drinking, and therefore keen to avoid him, Audrey slipped in to the house to pick up some clothes on her way to the shows: Williams had a gun, and fired four times. Audrey would later say she did not think he had fired at her, but it proved the final straw. The couple had gone through divorce proceedings in 1948, but made up; this time, Audrey had had enough. The divorce was finalised on 10 July: the following day he recorded the caustic, resigned, bitter You Win Again. By the middle of 1952, Williams had ended a relationship with a woman who would bear a daughter, Jett, he would not live to see; and begun another with Billie Jean Eshliman. He would marry her in the October, perhaps 每 friends have since suggested 每 less because of his feelings for her than to send a message to Audrey. (In what must have been a deliberate echo of his 1949 hit, Wedding Bells, he invited Audrey to the ceremony: she did not attend.) The Opry sacked him after repeated no-shows and drunkenness; the attentions of a bogus doctor precipitated further decline. Your Cheatin＊ Heart 每 perhaps the song that best defines the Hank Williams sound and style, and a piece of writing right up there with the greatest in-song evocations of love, loss, betrayal and heartbreak 每 was apparently the result of a conversation between Williams and Billie Jean during a car ride from Nashville to Shreveport, where the couple were going to announce their marriage plans to her parents. He was lying on the floor, racked with pain; she had asked about his previous marriage: he described Audrey as ※a cheatin＊ heart§, quickly realised the writerly potential in the idea, and dictated the song to Billie Jean 每 one of 14 songs that she says poured out of him that day while the car sped along. According to Helms, after a quick rehearsal of the introduction, the band recorded the song in a single take 每 the one and only time it was ever performed by them. Helms never saw Williams again. Williams died in the back seat of a car, on his way from Knoxville to Ohio, for a gig scheduled to take place on 1 January 1953, aged only 29. His earliest records are now 70 years old: his legacy and legend will last as long as recorded music.																																											"

Previous opening nights hurled the delegates from the black expanse of  through the ensemble free-for-all of  to the frozen wilds of . But a tipping point has been reached; a corrective is called for. And sometimes it＊s true that the best things come in small packages. Particularly when the package is as cram-packed with nourishment as Downsizing, Alexander Payne＊s gorgeous, giddy parable of a modern-day Lilliput. stars as Paul Safranek, an overstretched man in an overstretched world, working as an occupational therapist down at Omaha Steaks and still living in the house where he was born. Paul hungers for a fresh start and finds it courtesy of the newfangled technique of ※cellular miniaturisation§, which promptly shrinks the recipient to a height of five inches. This technique has apparently been pioneered by scientists out in Norway, although one might just as easily claim that Payne has been doing it for years. Films like ,  and , for instance, spotlighted a burgeoning crisis in American masculinity, focusing on men who fear that they＊re seen as small by the world. With the excellent Downsizing, Payne has simply gone that extra mile.The benefits for Paul are clear from the outset. As a little man, he costs less and consumes less. His assets of $152,000 convert to a whopping $12m in the bonsai community of Leisureland Estates, which means that he can now afford a McMansion or a luxury bachelor pad, like one of those cash-poor Londoners who sells their Hackney flat and then buys up half of Rotherham. A flick of the switch and the process is complete. Afterwards the nurses return to theatre and lift the clients from their beds aboard small steel spatulas.Donwnsizing＊s premise, then, couldn＊t be more high-concept. But Payne runs with it, plays with it, explores its implications. Having ticked off the pros, he moves on to the cons. Miniaturisation, we learn, is prone to misuse: African dictators shrink rival ethnic groups; US Homeland Security is worried about pocket-sized terrorists infiltrating its borders. Meanwhile, out in Leisureland, Paul has befriended the rascally Dusan, his playboy upstairs neighbour, played with reliable zeal by the great . If this Eden has a serpent, it is undeniably Dusan, who is making a fortune smuggling in contraband goods. ※It＊s the wild west, baby!§ he explains with a grin, reclining on his designer sofa during a brief break between parties.The point, of course, is that glass-domed Leisureland is merely America in microcosm, with all the same corruption and wealth-disparity, loneliness and strife. Neither does it exist in splendid isolation. If the outside world starts to burn, then Leisureland is all-but guaranteed to go down in flames too.What a spry, nuanced, winningly digressive movie this is. No sooner I had it pegged as a jaunty black comedy than it starts folding in elements of dystopian sci-fi, or compassionate human drama. A less polished director might have become lost and confused along the film＊s lengthy running-time. But Payne＊s handling is perfect. He never puts a foot wrong, rustling up a picture that is as bright as a button and as sharp as a tack. Downsizing contains multitudes. Inside, it＊s a giant. 																																											"
"A portrait of a sad-eyed young soldier has been released from museum stores after members of the public succeeded in identifying the young officer and the heartbroken artist 每 his mother. However, argument still rages over the identity of a woman in a handsome black dress and whether an imposing mill building is really in Manchester, or built under much hotter skies.project invites the public to join forces with museum curators, art historians and costume experts to identify mystery paintings: more than 100 debates are currently rumbling on. Amateur local historians, genealogists, map collectors and devotees of the yellowing pages of centuries-old regional newspapers chip in snippets of knowledge that often lead to genuine revelations 每 a watercolour puzzlingly titled Margate in the Time of Turner, owned by Kirklees Museum, was recently triumphantly identified as a work by Walter Sickert, inspired by a print in an 1852 copy of Leisure Hour magazine. The project was launched three years ago on the back of the , which set out to record and catalogue every painting in public collections in the UK 每 more than 210,000 works in 3,000 locations to date. As paintings were hauled out of stores or dark civic corridors to be photographed for the first time, some masterpieces and many puzzles turned up. Often there was no record of the artists, what the paintings represented, or when 每 or indeed why 每 they had come into the collections.The portrait of the young man is owned by Carmarthenshire museums, but catalogued Unknown First World War Officer, there was little interest in the picture and it went into storage. However, when it appeared on the  Detectives website, Martin Gillott tracked down a newspaper obituary with a photograph and the war records, which proved the mystery man was 2nd Lt Paul Chancourt Girardo. He signed up in February 1914 and was killed in September with 43 other members of his company, and 50 men from the company they were relieving, when a shell exploded in the French quarry where they were resting. He was 19.That discovery led to another member of the public identifying the artist as Mary Girardot, from Carmarthenshire. She was a widow and when she painted the portrait of her only son, he was already dead. She also commissioned a memorial stained glass window at Holy Trinity in Kensington in west London, near their home, which poignantly shows the same soldier with the barely out of adolescence wispy moustache.Bendor Grosvenor, the art historian and star of the BBC＊s Fake or Fortune?, says the site brings together a range of skills from amateurs and professionals, which can lead to genuine revelations. The young lieutenant is his favourite to date. ※Suddenly, a painting that nobody paid much attention to became an item of heartrending sensitivity,§ he said.There is still no consensus about the woman in the black dress 每 or on the artist, date of the painting, identity of the subject, her age, or why she ended up in Peterhouse college in Cambridge. Some have seen a pre-Raphaelite influence in her calm direct gaze, others think the painting is earlier. Several people have seen an engagement portrait because of the prominently displayed ring, others have seen a wedding band as well on her finger. Some thought the vase of flowers suggested she was a botanist, others that she was wearing Victorian mourning dress 每 promptly disputed as the elaborate lace collar, large brooch and red ribbon would be unsuitably frivolous. It was suggested that she was a college benefactor, or the wife, sister or daughter of some college notable. One mournful suggestion was that ※a Fellow with rooms in College where portraits of his own family were hanging died without any close relations and left a will in which he left much or all of what he had to the College§. Whoever she was, she came briefly into the light for a college dinner in 2015 and then went back into store.There is equal dispute over the street scene with a background of an imposing building topped with a belfry, a painting Manchester City Galleries acquired in 1938 on the understanding that it showed Holt Town in the city, a group of mills built by David Quaker Holt. Those joining in the argument cannot even agree whether it is really a mill building 每 some see it as a cotton warehouse because it lacks the usual towering smoking chimneys. The art detectives have pored over every detail, from the man＊s white trousers to the shape of the basket and the construction of the cart. Sites have been suggested ranging from Stockport and Chorlton-upon-Medlock, to Morocco and New Orleans 每 ※the hats on some of the men seem more of the American ＆ten gallon＊ type whist others appeared to derive from British ＆topper＊ models suggesting ※British Colonial＊,§ one wrote. The game is still afoot.																																											"

" was never a straightforward TV programme. Ostensibly, the main story was that of architect Michael Scofield, who gets the plans to Fox River State Penitentiary tattooed on his body so he can break his brother Lincoln out from the inside. But, rather than leave it at that, the show was intent on throwing as many complicated plotlines into the mix as it could. As the series progressed, it got tangled in a confusing mess of conspiracies, secret service double agents and a mysterious, probably evil movement called The Company, who framed Lincoln for murder and seemed intent on ruining Michael＊s life.Furthermore, it was a concept with a built-in problem: what happens to a show called Prison Break once they＊ve broken out of the prison? It＊s on to another prison, of course, which they have to break into ＃ and then out of. And possibly into again. And so on, like a jail-based hokey cokey. Has nobody pointed out that , not crawl through miles of sewers?However, its real shark-jumping moment came early in season three with the death of Michael＊s love interest, Sara Tancredi. Sara＊s decapitated head was sent to Lincoln in a box, Seven-style. Tears were shed, revenge was sworn ＃ only for Sara to turn up, alive and with her head very much intact, one series later. She＊d been in witness protection, y＊see, and couldn＊t tell Michael for his own safety (in reality, actor Sarah Wayne Callies left the show because of a contract dispute). The sheepish explanation for Sara＊s magical return from the other side was that the head must have been a very complicated trick by The Company to force Michael into making a series of dangerous decisions, although nobody ever explained how a) The Company managed to make such a realistic head and b) how Lincoln managed to mistake it for that of his brother＊s partner.Shark fully cleared, the show spun off into a series of increasingly unbelievable plotlines: one where the escaped prisoners were recruited by Homeland Security to get information on an advanced renewable power cell; another where they attempted to escape a Panamanian prison by helicopter (it＊s that easy, apparently 每 just get a mate with a pilot＊s licence and leave!). But the show＊s fondness for killing off main characters, then panicking and bringing them back from the dead, was definitely the most incredible part.Indeed, death meant little in Prison Break. The emotional ※final§ episode when the show originally ended back in 2009 saw Sara weep as she laid flowers on Michael＊s grave. Plus, we had to watch a video he＊d made, telling his family that he loved them and that, if they were watching it, he was no longer with them. Well, not quite: , managing to shake off the terminal brain cancer he＊d suffered from in the previous series by, er, pretending to be dead for seven years during which he ＃ broke into and out of prisons. He＊s now working for a rogue CIA agent in Yemen. Confused? You shouldn＊t be: once you＊ve seen someone make it out of the slammer that many times, returning from the afterlife is no big deal.																																											"
"It is hard to decide whether the waiting room depicted in this oil-on-plywood painting is a nice place. This station seems to be richly furnished 每 perhaps better than the austere train terminals of today 每 but it does look a tad lively.The blobby brushstrokes are a mark of the artist＊s work to come. Later paintings take the battle between figurative and abstraction to extremes. For now, we are given a recognisable scene, although the subject is colour as much as travel.This formative work was created after Zeid＊s own period of travel. Born of a prominent Ottoman family in 1901, she was back in Istanbul in 1943, having previously moved to Iraq with her diplomat husband. Before that, .The artist, who was one of the first women in Istanbul to receive an art education, was a consummate appropriator of culture, picking up vernacular craft aesthetics as she travelled the world. This work borrows as much from Arab tapestry and Byzantine heritage as it does European modernism.																																											"
"The Great British Bake Off is back in its new home on Channel 4. But what did you make of the show＊s return 每 was it a showstopper, or did it leave a sour taste? Here is the verdict from our readers. Rating 4 out of 5 from Alison Williams, 49, Cardiff I thought they kept the best bits from the BBC and brought that to Channel 4. It＊s the same old nice, fun and lighthearted show.I really like Noel Fielding and Prue Leith so I was pleased when I heard they would be presenting. Noel is great and seemed very genuine. He is still finding his feet, but he brings a bit of quirk and makes it a bit different from the BBC Bake Off. He seems kinder than Mel or Sue. Sometimes I find Sandi Toksvig a bit patronising and sneering but she was good in this; she reined that in. I love Paul Hollywood anyway 每 my husband is scouse and went to the same school as him so I＊m a fan. My favourite bit from last night was the interchange between Paul and the scouse grandmother Flo. When he said ※I love you Flo§ and she said she loved him back, that was really cute. Rating 3 out of 5 from Mark Tennent, south-east England It was a valiant effort, but I think the show should have stayed where it was. The Channel 4 version lacked a spark; Noel and Sandi are no Mel and Sue and won＊t ever be as they aren＊t that sort of entertainers. I＊m not sure the chemistry is quite right between the two of them.I felt none of the contestants had any oomph to them. Normally there＊s one you feel a warmth towards but that wasn＊t the case, except maybe for the grandmother who made the melon cake.The format is stale. The ad breaks are irritating and intrusive. If the BBC puts up some competition, I doubt I＊ll watch any more Bake Off.5 out of 5 from Emma Hendry, 46, Elgin, ScotlandYou hardly noticed a change in personnel. Noel and Sandi were a surprisingly good combo: he was kind and funny and she was warm and witty. Prue could be Mary＊s slightly younger long-lost sister, and Paul continues to be the one the bakers all want to impress. The bakers themselves showed a wonderful array of skills. The fruit cake challenge proved quite tricky to perfect, however the bonfire cake looked beautiful and Flo＊s cake was apparently delicious. It certainly looked wonderful. The technical mini rolls were fiddly, but the real highlight was the showstopper. Jan＊s ramen noodles cake looked amazing, and the loaf and sandwich cake was so realistic 每 he is a true artist. The champagne bottle with ice cubes was also stunning. I could go on. It did not bother me in the slightest that it was going to Channel 4. I have always loved the Bake Off, but which channel owns the rights is of no importance to me. Rating 4 out of 5 from Mark Bays, 48, LondonThe loss of Mary changed the show and made it colder. The presenters did not make too much difference really. Mel and Sue have been replaced with as close copies as practically possible. Sandi Toksvig immediately fell into the role. Noel Fielding will take time to get there, but the first outing was a good start.Prue Leith is no doubt knowledgeable and experienced, but no one has the warmth and comfort of Mary Berry. Nothing, though, lasts forever and Prue will make the show different. I want to see her baking, to see her love for the job and to really make her part of the team.Rating 3 out of 5 from Anna Gibson, 29, LondonI was surprised by how similar the show was to the BBC version; it felt like they had tried to create the same format, but there was something a bit fake about it. I felt like no one really stood out as having much personality. In terms of the new presenters, I liked Noel, Sandi and Prue, especially Prue. She seemed to offer the same insightful feedback as Mary Berry. The only thing that jarred a bit for me was Noel Fielding＊s voiceover when he talked about the cakes 每 his voice was a bit distracting. The ad breaks were the real downside. Overall it was OK, but I am waiting to see what happens next and will be following the series more before passing too much judgment. 																																											"

"hose who have heard of Emma Reyes, and they are few, know her as a Colombian painter who lived in France for many years. She died in 2003, not famous but remembered as ※mama grande§ to Latin American artists and writers in France and as a marvellous storyteller. She had won a scholarship to study in Paris in 1947, but once there was advised not to copy western art but to look at the ※primitives§ in the Louvre, and to keep to her own artistic heritage, particularly the strong and wayward line of her drawing.Her earliest works, bright scenes of markets and crowds, sombre portraits and dense landscapes, were inspired by the continent she had just left. In the 1950s she travelled, via a job for Unesco in Washington DC, to stay at ＊s workshop in Mexico; she collaborated with him on a mural for the Olympic Stadium and illustrated books for the Latin American People＊s Library. Reyes went to Rome, where 每 the story has it 每 she worked as a taxi driver and ran someone over, before moving to Israel and finally returning to France. Her style developed, too, from the indigenist early approach to experiments in abstraction and geometric compositions, psychedelic florals, ※masques§ and monsters, but she always came back to figuration, and some of her most striking pieces are stark, haunted portraits. She always worked spontaneously. ※My paintings are screams,§ she said. ※Monsters are released from my hand ＃ I do not paint my pictures; I write them.§Reyes＊s career was all the more remarkable given her childhood in Colombia was one of profound poverty, of personal and institutional cruelty and neglect. As a young girl, she lived in a single room in Bogot芍 with her sister Helena, a boy ※whom we called Piojo§ (in fact her half-brother, Eduardo) and a woman ※with a tangle of black hair§ called Mar赤a: their mother, though none of them knew it. Her days were spent on the rubbish dump with other children, or locked in the room. They slept in their clothes, which were the only ones they had.In France, Reyes told stories of her childhood and others pressed her to write them down. When she said she couldn＊t 每 she had been illiterate well into her teens 每 the historian Germ芍n Arciniegas suggested she record them as letters: the first of the 23 she wrote to him, which have been collected as , is dated 28 April 1969. She writes from Paris and tells ※my dear Germ芍n§ that ※Today at noon General de Gaulle left the Elys谷e, his only luggage the eleven million nine hundred forty-three thousand two hundred thirty-three NO votes cast by the Frenchman who have repudiated him.§ It is almost the only mention of the present day in the letters, which continued intermittently (there is a break of 20 years after a falling out) until 1997. They were published in Colombia in 2012 and became an overnight success; this new edition, translated by the novelist Daniel Alarc車n, is the first in English.De Gaulle, Reyes says in her first letter, has reminded her of her oldest memory: a clay figure called General Rebello that she built with the other street children and decorated with rubbish. He was killed, ceremonially buried and pitifully mourned. ※We all followed behind, crying like orphans ＃ in circumstances like the ones in which we lived, one is born knowing what hunger, cold and death mean.§The scenes, never more than a few pages long, portrayed in the letters attest to that. They are written from a child＊s position of ignorance. Reyes＊s mother, only ever referred to as Mrs Mar赤a, disappears and returns; Eduardo is sent to be brought up by nuns, or so Emma and Helena are told, but that doesn＊t make sense to them: ※I didn＊t understand what ＆far from Bogot芍＊ meant§. They are taken to live in Guateque, around 70 miles from Bogot芍, and suddenly there is some money; Mar赤a buys ※a grey dress with many pleats and buttons and washers, black boots that also had many buttons, and a large grey hat with a kind of veil that cinched below her chin§. Her early memories seem photographic 每 they are vivid and discrete, almost disconnected; charged with the child＊s imagination and sense of drama. A friend of Eduardo＊s father, she comes to realise, has arranged for Mar赤a＊s job in a chocolate shop. Is she having an affair with him? It＊s not clear; or not of interest: more striking to Reyes is the shock of seeing her first cow, of hearing music, of discovering a dead dog ※who＊d fallen from the sky§.While some of the letters announce themselves as such, opening with ※My dear Germ芍n§ and ending with ※Kisses for all, Emma§, others have no markers, and the story moves, haltingly, across them. The monotony of ※very long, very sad days§ locked in the house caring for her new baby brother or hiding from Mar赤a in the oven (※the only place she couldn＊t get me§) is interrupted by moments of intense recollection: a surprise basket of plums, the arrival of the first automobile in Guateque, ※a horrific, black monster ＃ its enormous, wide-open eyes were yellowish and so bright they lit up half the plaza. People fell to their knees and began to pray and make the sign of the cross.§A festival bullfight ends in chaos when the bull escapes and rampages through the chocolate shop, and a firework sets the straw roof of the hospital on fire. Hundreds of people die, but in Reyes＊s mind the events seemed connected, as though they were all part of the celebrations. Fear and excitement are very close to each other, and equally incomprehensible.※You must think it strange,§ she writes to Arciniegas, ※that I can tell you in such detail and with such precision what happened so long ago. I agree with you that a child of five who leads a normal life wouldn＊t be able to recount his childhood with this level of accuracy. But we, Helena and I, remember it as if it were today.§ It＊s shocking, despite the child＊s voice of the narrative, to discover partway through that she is still only five or six; that at the abandonment of her second brother, she understands, aged four, that she is ※already capable of feeling that I don＊t want to live§. Not long afterwards, she and Helena are themselves abandoned at a convent, and begin a new life that, for the next 15 years, displaces the old one entirely.The change comes almost halfway through the letters, and it marks a change in her writing, too. Their situation is still bleak: the girls were little more than slaves, working 10-hour days in the convent kitchens or laundry, tormented with stories of divine injustice and bullied by other girls. But the detached voice of the infant Reyes becomes more involved in her own story as she describes the complicated structures and politics of the convent. As well as the cruelties, there are unexpected opportunities and moments of unlooked-for gentleness. She is courted by the one-eyed man who brings milk; when she accidentally discovers the communion wine and drinks until she passes out, a priest rescues her. The convent is famed for its fine needlework, and though bad at her catechism, Reyes becomes adept at embroidering sheets and tablecloths, silk underwear and sleeping gowns ※with stitching down to the feet§.In this fixed and limited existence storytelling had a unique power. The mythology of the church keeps the girls frozen between intense love for the baby Jesus and a hell known ※so intimately we felt we could navigate it with our eyes closed§. It is a world in which a vision of the devil is taken entirely seriously and superstition becomes law. A laywoman who lives among them is fed incessantly to keep the two black marks on her stomach (her ※belt§) from meeting, lest she should die and some terrible evil befall the convent. A new girl convinces the others to give their food to her brother Tarrarrurra, a small porcelain figurine she keeps strapped to her thigh. They do so, entranced by the wonderful stories he reports back about his adventures outside the convent. But eventually stories are not enough, and Reyes 每 always more daring than her sister 每 steals the keys to the front door, and escapes into the world: ※I realised it had been a long time since I was a girl.§ It is here that her letters end, and her real story begins. is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson.To order a copy for ?12.74 (RRP ?14.99) go to  or call 0330 333 6846.

"his month, lucky eight-plus readers can plunge into the green wilds of ＊s marvellous new novel,  (Bloomsbury). Stranded in the Amazon rainforest, Fred, Lila, Max and Con overcome their initial terror to adapt to the uncompromising fierceness and beauty of their surroundings, gradually shedding the constraints of home 每 and discovering much more than they expected. Hannah Horn＊s delicate line drawings encroach, vine-like, on Rundell＊s dangerous, intoxicating pages in this love-song to the natural world and those who find release in it. This is essential reading for lovers of .Also for eight plus comes a Newbery medal-winner by Kelly Barnhill,  (Piccadilly) 每 a poignant, humorous fantasy with glints of Margaret Mahy, Neil Gaiman and Robin McKinley. It features a village that sacrifices its children and a?witch who saves them, a swamp monster who speaks in mellifluous poetry and a?girl growing up perilously powerful, without knowing why. This is a gorgeously stratified and satisfying novel, full of archetypal, bone-deep fairytale resonances.Bestselling  author Robin Stevens turns to homage, meanwhile, in  (Puffin), both a tremendous art-theft whodunnit and a loving tribute to the much-missed author Siobhan Dowd. This sequel to Dowd＊s  scoops up Ted, a rigid thinker with a gift for analysis, his tempestuous sister Kat and Salim, his cousin, with an assured and gentle hand, setting them down in New York City, where Ted and Kat＊s Aunt Gloria is a curator at the Guggenheim art museum. When a Kandinsky is stolen and Gloria is arrested, though, it＊s up to the young detectives to clear her name ... Stevens＊s deft, philosophical writing lends itself perfectly to her continuation of Dowd＊s work.For readers who like a frisson of fear, Pam Smy＊s ominous, hefty hardback,  (David Fickling), is a rule-breaker in the vein of Brian Selznick＊s  每 a skin-crawling story of a derelict house haunted by past cruelties, told almost entirely via illustration, with some help from found texts and tattered ancient diaries. Smy＊s intense chiaroscuro, delicately drawn handmade dolls and spare, evocative detail, with pure black pages marking the division of days, combine to create an unsettling, deeply memorable read.Elsewhere, in picture-books for much younger children, creator Herv谷 Tullet returns with  (Chronicle), an anarchically interactive mixture of white space, coloured dots and reader-supplied sound, with a  feel to its imaginative sparseness. Press the blue dot and say OH 每 get louder or softer, wavery or still 每 add a yellow dot, AH 每 and the delightful mayhem can only end in a rainbow universe of sound.In a departure from previous, playfully epistolary picture-books, Tom Percival takes to the skies with  (Bloomsbury), starring a boy hero who is unremarkable until he grows a pair of wings. Worried that people will think his soaring antics weird, he conceals them beneath a coat 每 but what are others hiding in their turn? This joyous, original paean to individuality is sophisticated but deftly judged; quirky children just starting to sense the invisible burden of peer-group disapproval should find it especially heartening.Meanwhile, , by Pip Jones and Sara Ogilvie (Simon & Schuster), features an inventor girl, a disabled crow, an encouraging granddad and a thumbs-up to resilience. Izzy＊s strange devices don＊t always work as they should 每 but when she designs prosthetic wings for a wounded bird, her grandfather pushes her to persist, despite failure and fury. Jones＊s loping, engaging rhymes and Ogilvie＊s vivacious images evoke both inspiration and frustration.There＊s more from Pip Jones for five-to-eight-year-olds in  (Faber), the turbulent tale of a grandiloquent guinea pig. Disconsolate to have reached the age of three (that＊s 30?in guinea pig years) with nothing to show for it, Handsome sets off to the seaside to achieve world renown, with a gruff budgie named Jeffry for company. Engagingly silly wordplay, bumbling burglars and Adam Stower＊s diverting drawings make for a winningly frivolous formula.Young readers with a yen for Egyptology have a treat in store with  (Bloomsbury), a richly involving non-fiction title from Patricia Cleveland-Peck, interlaid with Isabel Greenberg＊s charismatic illustrations. Moving smoothly from the boy king＊s daily life to the discovery and excavation of his tomb, it＊s packed with accessible, intriguing information.From 360 Degrees is the fascinating , created by Libby Walden, and featuring illustrations from 10 artists, each bringing a unique and appropriate style to their allocated city. From the secrets of London＊s Royal Mail post train to the smoke-signals of the Vatican, the detail hiding beneath the oversized flaps creates a real sense of insider knowledge.For teenagers, MA Bennett reinvigorates the boarding-school thriller with her debut  (Hot Key), set in the eponymous St Aidan the Great School, where tension runs high between the Medievals 每 the aristocratic student elite, who shun modern tech as inimical to their traditions 每 and those less sophisticated pupils dubbed Savages. When scholarship girl Greer receives a cryptic invitation to the head Medieval＊s country house offering ※huntin＊, shootin＊, fishin＊§, she is flattered enough to accept 每 only to discover the quarry isn＊t what she expected. This is a darkly compelling examination of the allure of privilege, and the unscrupulous means by which it preserves itself.More light-heartedly, seasoned collaborators Tom Ellen and Lucy Ivison (, ) return with  (Chicken House), a hilarious, truthful-feeling immersion in the mandatory ※fun§, self-reinvention and stranger-crowded loneliness of freshers＊ week. Narrated by Luke, who is navigating a long-distance break-up, and Phoebe, nursing a long-held crush on Luke, it＊s a messy, cringey, comically evocative no-mance.Finally, from Stripes,  is a wide-ranging and dynamic anthology by 12 black and minority ethnic authors. From Phoebe Roy＊s feather-growing teenage girl to Inua Ellams＊s poetic summary of experience left behind, it deals compellingly with its Ovidian theme of change. With work from familiar names (Nikesh Shukla, Catherine Johnson) and newcomers (Aisha Busby, Mary Florence Bello), there is?considerable variety 每 but never a dud?note.

"arina, the seven-year-old girl around whom ＊s chilling Spanish novella unfolds, has been wounded in an accident that killed her parents, her skin flensed from her ribs ※like a curtain§. She is taken to live in an orphanage 每 ※a very pretty place§, promises her psychologist, ※with other girls§. She does not, however, go alone. She takes with her a wide-eyed doll, also called Marina, which is her constant companion: ※The only one who didn＊t lie. The only one calm, as if halfway through a long life.§Both child-Marina and doll-Marina become the focus of the other girls＊ attention in a manner that is part cruel, part adoring and part uneasily erotic. In time their affectionate but uneasy playfulness becomes a secret night-time game, of a kind of lascivious malice that may well trouble the reader long after the book has been set aside (※Desire was a big knife and we were the handle ＃§). The adults of the orphanage remain peripheral, unable or unwilling to put a restraining hand on the children: the presence most strongly felt is not that of the principal but of a statue of Saint Anne, whose welcoming arms are ※black and inescapable§.Barba inhabits the minds of children with an exactitude that seems to me so uncanny as to be almost sinister 每 as when the girls, while washing, see Marina＊s scar. The effect is of having taken a bite of Eden＊s forbidden fruit: all at once they become aware of themselves as mortal, and just as likely as Marina to be wounded. But the book is by no means without relief, nor is this a cynical exploitation of an atavistic fear of the child: the passages in which the other girls narrate their regard for Marina, in a first person plural voice, have an affecting tenderness. ※Were we forgiving her? Was that what love was?§It is Marina＊s scar, and what it signifies, that eventually unpins the girls from the ordinary playtimes of children. Leslie Jamison, in her essay ※§, writes of wounded women: ※Violence turns them celestial ＃ we can＊t look away. We can＊t stop imagining new ways for them to hurt.§ This might have been the epigraph for the book: Marina is beatified by suffering, but the mere fact of her pain, stitched in scar tissue over her ribcage, is an enticement to more. This is as effective a ghost story as any I have read, but lying behind the shocks is a meditation on language and its power to bind or loosen thought and behaviour. Since Marina and the girls cannot verbalise the intense confusion of their feelings, they resort to expressing them by altogether more direct means. Only when they are plainly told what they have done do they begin to think they have transgressed: ※They put a name on everything. They said, ＆Look what you did.＊ The names scared us. How is it that a thing gets caught inside a name and never comes out again?§Barba＊s use of genre conventions is both affectionate and knowing. All the ghost-story aficionado could ask of an evening＊s reading by the fire is here: a child＊s toy animated by longing and distress, and possibly by something more; an orphanage whose ※classroom, dining room, bathrooms, closets [and] red-haired clown at the door with a chalkboard in his stomach§ seem loaded with a malicious potential energy; the disrupting arrival of a stranger. But he also interrogates the genre, querying the limits of what it means to be haunted and haunting, and of what most affects the reader. The lingering impression is not, necessarily, that we might wake in the night, wondering if an object has moved towards us of its own accord; but that the world contains other and nearer evils that cannot be exorcised or placated.As is ever the case when reading in translation, I wondered how closely Lisa Dillman＊s prose mimicked Barba＊s lexis and cadence in Spanish. From the first it is faintly odd, sometimes affectless, the phrasing occasionally slightly awry; but this is so wholly in keeping with the book＊s uncanny effects and plays so significant a role in its accumulation of cool terror that I can only assume it is a superbly skilful translation playing close attention to Barba＊s original.An afterword from  refers to Barba＊s source material: an episode in a Brazilian orphanage reported in the 60s. Generally I have a ghoulish look at distressing news reports; here I refrained. I was partly unwilling to fracture Barba＊s fragile construction of tenderness and terror, partly too thoroughly unnerved.The novel＊s title recalls the final line of EE Cummings＊s poem, ※Somewhere I Have Never Travelled§ (※nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands§), and I found myself returning to its verses as I pondered the full effects and meaning of the book. It is, yes, about language, wounding, wickedness: but it is also about how fleeting and how vulnerable is the state of childhood innocence 每 that ※nothing which we are to perceive in this world/equals the power of [its] intense fragility§.

"※We all felt that it was time for a teenage girl to be front and centre.§ It＊s weird to hear that now, but it was even weirder to hear it then. My So-Called Life creator Winnie Holzman was one of the few who felt this way in the early 90s. At the time, teen girls who were taught to be seen and not heard had started loudly rocking out to the feminist antics of the riot grrrls, but mainstream culture wasn＊t playing along. The likes of Beverly Hills 90210＊s  and ＊s Kelly Kapowski were all they had for role models, conventional beauties stuck within an equally sparkling entourage. At that point, on television, there was no one like My So-Called Life＊s heroine Angela Chase.Appearing for one season on ABC in the US and on Channel 4 in the UK from 1994 to 1995, My So-Called Life revolved around a 15-year-old girl searching for her identity. Like  before it, MSCL was that rare series to use a teenager as its narrator, but, unlike Kevin Arnold, Angela Chase was a highly unreliable one. ※People say you should be yourself, like yourself is this definite thing,§ she＊d say. With her, the personal was political; Angela＊s revolution was within herself, a rebellion against her former identity 每 the one prescribed by her parents. Despite her attempt at maturity, however, her solipsistic view of the world laid bare her white suburban privilege and her often contradictory views within that.※Trying to do a television show from inside of a person＊s experience was a pretty new thing,§ recalls co-producer Marshall Herskovitz. ※Television was externalised in a very particular way, and having the subjective point of view of this girl that was not afraid to show her pain, to show her terror, that sort of thing was very new on television 每 and, I think, in certain ways ahead of its time.§The seeds of MSCL date back to the 80s when Showtime assigned Herskovitz to write a series about teenagers; he conceived a ※very personal, very internal§ story about a boy and called it Secret/Seventeen. ※It was my interpretation of my own experience of being that age and what it was like to go through all the tectonic changes that your mind and your body go through at that time,§ he recalls.But management changed, and his series was not picked up in the end. So Herskovitz and co-producer  moved on to , a dramedy about the angst of a bunch of delayed adolescents in their 30s. There they approached writer Winnie Holzman about creating their next series, and when Herskovitz mentioned Secret/Seventeen, she ※really sparked to it§, as she had been ruminating about her own adolescence.She started with a diary. Holzman wrote from her own memories of high school 每 Herskovitz says she could conjure them better than anyone he had ever met 每 formulating what would eventually become the voice of MSCL＊s narrator. ※Everything that you love about that show was already there, just in those words that she wrote from this girl＊s point of view,§ says Herskovitz, who adds, ※It＊s not like she was doing herself; what she was doing was [projecting] the sensibility that I think every sensitive introspective person has when they go through adolescence.§ Both he and Zwick read her notes and immediately responded, ※OK, go. You＊ve got a show.＊§With , Holzman was able to mould these words into the shape of Angela Chase. The as-yet-unknown actor was chosen over Alicia Silverstone, as the latter＊s Hollywood beauty would have subverted the series＊ aim 每 to authenticate the teen girl experience. Danes was beautiful one minute, plain the next; her body language expressing what words failed to, her own life informing that of her fictional alter ego. As Brian Krakow (Devon Gummersall), the geek who is crushing on Angela says, ※She＊s not just a fantasy. She＊s got, like, flaws. She＊s real.§Highly attuned to small-screen stereotypes, Holzman was intent on dismantling them. She gave Angela parents (Patty, the breadwinner, Graham, the homebody) who were still themselves in the midst of establishing their identities and discovering their incompatibility with traditional domestic tropes. MSCL was the rare drama that focused on the mundane minutiae of family life (which meant it also appealed to an adult demographic), this sphere often being relegated to the comedy genre. The choice was, in fact, made out of necessity, since, as a minor, Danes＊ hours on set were limited. But the parents were ultimately essential to MSCL＊s impact, because they not only represented our lifelong struggle with identity, they represented where Angela was coming from in the story of where she was going.※Most stories begin with an old order crumbling because some unexpected force has exerted itself,§ Holzman says, via email, ※That, for me, was Rayanne.§ Angela＊s newly acquired friendships with Rayanne Graff (AJ Langer) and Rickie Vasquez (Wilson Cruz) embodied her future, while her ex-best friend Sharon Cherski (Devon Odessa) personified her past. ※I knew I wanted Rayanne to be wild and to lead Angela into challenging new situations,§ Holzman says. The epitome of excess, Rayanne was a physical onslaught 每 all those braids, all those layers, all that volume 每 whose single-parent household and descent into drug-induced near-death was a means for the Chases to betray their suburban condescension and for Holzman to betray her commentary on privileged folk＊s response to socioeconomic divides and the complexities of hierarchical friendships.Then there was Rickie, an effeminate teen 每 ABC found his application of eyeliner more unsettling than anything else 每 of indeterminate race who crushed on boys and at one point found himself homeless. ※I belong nowhere, with no one. I don＊t fit,§ he says in one episode, which is how Holzman conceived him. ※I wanted Rickie to be 每 well, ultimately he identifies as gay, but initially I wanted him to be sexually androgynous 每 not so easily categorised,§ she explains.The character was inspired by Holzman＊s teen peers, but also Jennie Livingston＊s 1990 documentary , which explored the marginalised 每 by race, class, sexuality and gender 每 worlds of New York drag balls. MSCL was the first primetime show to feature not only a recurring gay teen but one who also happened to be a person of colour.And with actor Wilson Cruz coming out in tandem with his character, US LGBT magazine The Advocate dubbed him a ※poster boy for gay youth§. The irony being, however, that Rickie was not meant to be a symbol but simply a part of Angela＊s life, though he turned out to be the part that caused the Chases to face their ambivalence about homosexuality and multiculturalism, not to mention their views on masculinity.MSCL not only flirted with gender fluidity before it became a part of the national conversation, it questioned the parameters of conventional maleness. Jordan Catalano (), the show＊s supposed alpha, was dyslexic with a rocky home life and a certain fragility about him (he didn＊t stand, he leaned, and he was forever using eye drops as though not even his eyes were able to exist in the world without leaning on something). He was socially privileged at school, but was very much the object of Angela＊s gaze, not to mention a step below her in the class hierarchy outside of the classroom.Brian Krakow, meanwhile, may have pined after Angela but he was not without virility, particularly when he was sharing a microscope with a girl he liked. It would be a few years before a guy like this would get the girl in the guise of ＊s Xander, ＊s Dawson and Felicity＊s Noel, Angela preferring, in this case, to choose fantasy over reality. ※Brian is part of her past, so someone she must reject if she＊s going to move into this new experimental identity,§ says Holzman. ※They know each other in a particular way 每 intimately, in some ways 每 and yet, because they are both now struggling with her transformation, neither really knows how to relate to each other any more.§Whether or not its heroine was getting any, My So-Called Life was the rare primetime show that candidly discussed teen sex (according to the , by 1996 only 12% of shows involved adolescent sexual content) 每 not only that, teen girl sex. In Angela＊s words, ※There＊s this dividing line between girls who have had sex, and girls who haven＊t.§ Thus Sharon, the suburban good girl, self-flagellates for enjoying sex with a guy she doesn＊t respect, while Rayanne, the deadbeat, is free to believe ※you don＊t have to, like, be in love to have a good time§, while ultimately feeling empty. And Angela, unable to conceive of copulation without all the losses associated with it, fails to bend to Jordan＊s pressure. As she says early on in the series, ※I don＊t know, maybe I＊d rather have the fantasy than even him.§ Even for Angela, sex is too actual.While authentic adolescence could be heard in the words and seen on the bodies of MSCL＊s characters, the show＊s accoutrements spoke to their reality just as readily. Beverly Hills 90210 had transformed the teen show into a vehicle for marketing fashion and music, but the look and sound of My So-Called Life interacted with the lives within it. Costume designer Patrick R Norris gave each actor a closet, to preserve the realism of repetition, and ensured that Angela＊s clothes did not overpower her internal dialogue, though her progress towards bolder plaid did express her increasing emancipation. The seamlessness of her friendships was depicted in the fluidity of the characters＊ wardrobes, with Angela later on in the series, for instance, sporting the kind of shearling jacket favoured by Jordan.Various characters 每 Brian and Rickie, Angela and Rayanne, Angela＊s younger sister 每 even switched looks in order to explore each other＊s identities. Similarly, alternative bands such as Buffalo Tom performed the characters＊ angst, while a story arc created for singer-songwriter and actor  gave a clear nod to the riot grrrls＊ power of turning the young female experience into art.MSCL＊s clothes and music were so inextricable from its characters that fans used both to express their connection to the show. They wore Doc Martens and listened to the Lemonheads as they read Claire Danes interviews in  and deconstructed the show＊s feminism in . Despite this vibrant following, however, on 15 May 1995, months after the last episode aired, ABC cancelled the series due to its ※far too narrow§ appeal. In response, MSCL fans established the first online campaign to save a show. The self-appointed ※Lifers§ took over ABC boards and, though they failed to save their series, it did land another run on MTV.※Networks didn＊t understand that you could sell to adolescent girls,§ Herskovitz said years later. There was no precedent, he adds now, though he remembers everything changing around the time Claire Danes started working on the . ※All of a sudden, it was like, just boom,§ he says. ※The culture had suddenly discovered teen girls.§The year MSCL was cancelled, The WB became home to a panoply of series that owed their lives to Angela＊s, including Felicity, , One Tree Hill and Buffy. The show＊s influence even reached outside the network to Fox＊s The OC, MTV＊s Daria and NBC＊s . But there remains something unique to MSCL, and even its creators are not immune. Herskovitz says that recently he, Holzman and director Scott Winant were watching the pilot together on the advent of a new DVD release and by the end of it, all three of them were sobbing. ※To look back at this thing that was so pure,§ Herskovitz says, ※that anyone let us do it, that＊s why we were crying.§ 																																											"
"When the second world war started, my mother, Patsy, was 20. She was given the choice of doing war work in a factoen＊s Royal Air Force. She chose the factory so that she could continue living with her family. They lived in a tenement block in the East End of Glasgow.Patsy was assigned to work at a large aircraft factory in Paisley, an hour away by bus. They were understaffed due to the large number of men who had left to join the forces. She was one of the 200 women sent to fill these posts. She was sent on training courses to learn how to use a micrometer and perform certain engineering tasks.The factory carried out planned maintenance routines on aircraft in active service. After 240 hours of flying time, planes were flown to the factory and their instruments removed. It was Patsy＊s job to see if they needed to be replaced. It wasn＊t all hard work. Her first flight was in a large bomber. She was taken up on a short test flight, sitting in the bomb-aimer＊s seat, looking down through a plastic dome.Glasgow was often the target of German bombers. Patsy had many sleepless nights, but one incident really stuck in her mind. During a raid, residents of her neighbourhood saw a parachute falling to earth. They thought it was someone from one of the planes, and went towards it to investigate. It wasn＊t a person, it was a landmine. It exploded shortly before it reached the ground, killing 90 people. At the church services she attended the following Sunday, the priest slowly read out the names of all 90 victims.In 1942, Patsy met her future husband, Stanley Butler, who was an navy engineer. They soon became engaged, and Stanley carried this photograph of Patsy with him until the end of the war.Stanley was chief engineer on the deep-sea rescue tug Prudent, which escorted cargo ship convoys across the North Atlantic. If a ship became damaged or disabled, Stanley and the boarding crew would attempt a repair. If this was not possible, the ship would be towed to Iceland or a British port.My parents were married in April 1945. Their first child, Anne, was born the following year. Even though the war was over, living conditions were difficult. Food was still rationed, and there was a shortage of coal. Patsy and Stanley were living in a rented flat in Glasgow at that time. The room was damp, and they were unable to keep a fire alight all day because there was not much fuel for sale. Patsy was worried about keeping a baby in such unhealthy conditions. Stanley had left the navy by this time, and was looking for a civilian job. Fortunately, he secured employment in Dublin with the Caltex oil company.The Republic of Ireland had remained neutral during the war, and never had food rationing. After six years of shortages, there were no restrictions on the amount of food, drink and fuel that they could buy. It was an enormous treat for my parents 每 like being set free.Sometime in the early 80s, my grandfather was admitted to a large Victorian psychiatric hospital that has since been turned into luxury flats, his senile dementia such that it was no longer possible for him to stay at home with my parents, my brother and me, as he had done for a while. He was a big man, and my slight mother could do nothing to prevent him wandering off around the village, with Grandad cheerily saying he was off to work (he had retired several years previously) and off he would go.When we went to visit him at the hospital, I knew 每 at 13 每 that it wasn＊t the kind of place I would like to go in and see, with its endless, prison-like corridors and mentally disturbed patients, and it was my braver younger brother who would go in to fetch Grandad with my parents while I waited outside.I remember my brother and I playing football in the large grounds outside the main building, listening to my Frankie Goes to Hollywood tape on my new Walkman while the explicit, illicit lyrics (the song was banned by the BBC) swirled around my head (※Relax don＊t do it / When you want to suck to it§). My dad would very rarely play music in the car, and so I would be in my own little bubble, listening to my tape player in the back seat. I can remember feeling guilty while I listened to this song about sex while Grandad drifted in and out of lucidity, sitting on one of the garden benches and watching us play football. One minute he called me by his nickname for me, another minute he was unable to recall who I was at all.And then, a bombshell in the car while my mother and brother led him back to his room. My grandad had called my mother a name that wasn＊t her name, and I＊d asked my dad about it. To my utter astonishment, he casually revealed that my mother was adopted and that this was her original birth name. I wasn＊t genetically related to my grandad at all. I tried to make sense of it and there must have been questions I asked, but I just remember it all adding to the swirling queasiness as sex, identity and psychology fused in my head for ever.Turrur fiskurBoil the potatoes in plenty of salted water and drain. Open the packet of dried fish and place on a plate. Leave the butter on the table so people can tear off pieces of dried fish, swipe it directly through the butter and eat. Serve with the potatoes and brown bread, preferably home-made. Sild (pickled herring) and Danish salami are optional additions if available.Aged four, my mother sailed from the remote Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic to Aberdeen in a fishing trawler. It was just after the second world war and with her were her half-Icelandic, half-Aberdonian father, her Fareoese mother and five older siblings.Aberdeen was grey and bleak after the war, and the Johannesson-Poulsen family stood out in height and accent, with their hand-knitted, woollen Faroese jumpers. My grandfather went into business as a fish merchant, while my  (grandmother) set about learning English and bringing up six children in a foreign country.Trips to Faroe were expensive and complicated. Until ferry travel was introduced via the Smyril line, the only way to get there was a long, uncomfortable trip on a fishing trawler. These visits ended when Mum was 15 and her  died. Mum met my dad and married aged 21. At 25, she had two children, and money and time were too tight to think about going back.Every so often, a family member would go to Faroe or some relations would come down to Aberdeen, bringing the coveted . The fish is cod, and it is wind-dried, with a mild, not overly fishy, smell. The table would be set with the fish, steaming platters of boiled potatoes, home-made brown bread, sometimes Danish salami and if Mum was very lucky, some sild to top her bread. Mum would rip off pieces of fish, swipe through the butter and begin chewing. Although I always enjoyed the festive atmosphere when we had dried fish, as a fussy child, I found chewing it unpleasant. For once, nobody cared if I didn＊t want to eat it 每 all the more for everyone else.I loved it when my grandparents and uncles and aunts came to visit. Growing up hearing people speaking Faroese was something I always associated with home. Mum is now an  herself, and I finally visited in 2015 with my son, my brother, mum and other family members. And yes, this time I really did enjoy the dried fish.																																											"
"Jack Whitehall presents this look at seven decades of Edinburgh＊s splendid festival, and the more eccentric and expansive fringe that has coalesced around it. Interviewees including Alexei Sayle, Shappi Khorsandi, Alan Cumming and Ian McKellen reflect on their own experiences, accurately depicting Edinburgh as a glorious corral of surprises, inspirations, strange encounters, and some of the best and worst entertainment around. More magical domestic transformations with roaming DIY troubleshooter Aidan Keane. The essence of this show is proving that a big budget doesn＊t necessarily guarantee success and, conversely, that you can make a big difference to your home with a small amount of money. Tonight, Reg and Paula are splashing the cash on a dream kitchen while Saul and Amanda aim to work wonders on a shoestring. The wholesale plundering of Ant and Dec＊s Wonky Donkey continues, despite withering notices from viewers, who have compared the show to everything from a Victorian execution to the televisual equivalent of waterboarding. This week, Len is joined by celebs including Gareth Malone, Nina Wadia and his old Strictly mucker Ore Oduba, playing the rhyming quiz opposite retired nurse Carolynne and area manager Craig.  Iolo Williams, rugged but boyishly enthused, strides around Llyn Padarn in Snowdonia, dipping into its slate-quarry history with a look at restored steam engines and a disused gunpowder storage hut. His main focus, however, is the wildlife, kicking off with a rarely seen ring ouzel and moving on to spot wood warblers, pied flycatchers, arctic charrs, lapwings and more. As Iolo himself would say: it＊s a lovely programme, it really is. Manchester＊s Eggs Collective bring their Edinburgh fringe show to TV, with a mix of theatre, slapstick and spot-on observation about a night at the pub. The trio offer a barrage of one-liners covering essential topics such as drinking on antibiotics, substituting a large house white for a pint of Bailey＊s and saving the world with one night out. If R&B-soundtracked fantasy sequences and cheesy puffs are your jam, dive right in. One of the most pleasant aspects of co-watching TV with small children, amid all the ghastly animated tales of canine heroism and suchlike, is CBeebies＊ bedtime stories, and the stars they persuade to read them. Tonight, Tom Hardy pays tribute to his recently deceased pooch Woody on National Dog Day, by reprising his reading of Helen Stephens＊s story about the friendship between a young boy and a scruffy canine. David White＊s career might have been quite different had he followed his Do Not Adjust Your Set co-performers into Python. But then he wouldn＊t have become Sir David Jason, one of Britain＊s best-loved actors. In the first of this three-part trip down memory lane, he meets former collaborators such as Michael Palin and Open All Hours creator Roy Clarke 每 who swears Granville became a ※sexual symbol§ up north. Paul Greengrass＊s account of a real-life Somali pirate hijacking is an unnerving action movie, underpinned by a powerful sense of the global economic forces that separate the haves and have-nots. Ultimately, it focuses on the riveting confrontation between the eponymous captain (Tom Hanks) and the pirates＊ leader (Barkhad Ali), both struggling for control of the cargo ship. In a remote corner of Argentina, 1960, Eva and Enzo are reopening the family hotel, where the first guest is a mysterious German doctor (Alex Brendem邦hl). He is wealthy and charming, but strangely fascinated by the genetic makeup of the couple＊s 12-year-old daughter, and by the news that Eva is pregnant with twins. Meanwhile, the papers are full of the intensifying search for Nazis in hiding＃ Not just any old white suit: eccentric inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a material in his hubble-bubbling apparatus that lasts for ever, never gets dirty, and brings him nothing but trouble. Capitalist bosses Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger are horrified by a product that will put them out of business; the unions are aghast at a creation that could mean the end of their jobs. It sounds serious, but this classic, sharply satirical Ealing comedy will have you in stitches, and Guinness＊s deadpan act is a marvel to behold. Frustrated love is the metaphor for the sick spirit of the patrician Amberson family: young Isabel (Dolores Costello) loves car designer Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) but is prevailed upon to marry one of the more suitable Minafer clan. Fast-forward 20 years 每 now widowed, her chance of happiness is again blocked, this time by her selfish, snobbish son George (Tim Holt), a true Amberson. A magnificent movie, despite the studio-cropped conclusion.

"s generous and fleshed-out as its lead character, 25-year-old aspiring rapper Patricia Dombrowski (Australian actor ), aka Patti Cake$, aka Killa P, this first feature from writer/director/composer Geremy Jasper is a triumphant air punch of a movie. The fact that it is a formulaic underdog story 每 poor, white and podgy, Patti is not obvious rap star material 每 which dutifully hits all the required story beats, matters less than you would imagine. This is what feelgood cinema looks like and it＊s plus-size, trashy and full of attitude.Jasper brings a music video aesthetic of neon, graffiti and bling into a story that regularly trips out into Patti＊s vivid daydreams. But the real strength of the film is in the writing. Not just the characters, but also the complex relationships between them: all are persuasively drawn. In particular, the troubled love that simmers between Patti and her hard-drinking mother (Bridget Everett) is abrasively credible. And Patti＊s rhymes are sharp enough to convince us that she has a chance to make it and catchy enough that you might later have to have them surgically removed from your brain.

"The number of arrests made during the  fell compared with last year＊s event after a controversial crackdown in the run-up to the popular street festival.There were 313 arrests across the two days of the carnival held in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, compared with 454 arrests last year.However, the police action, which included 50 arrests for carrying an offensive weapon, came after an additional 656 arrests made in the three weeks before the event. The crackdown drew criticism from some, including the grime artist : ※How many drugs did you lot seize in the run-up to Glastonbury or we only doing tweets like this for black events?§Discussing the proactive raids, : ※I don＊t really care what we arrest them for, I＊ll be [as] lawfully audacious as I can to get them off the streets.§This year＊s event was set against a backdrop of tension over the treatment of residents of Grenfell Tower, which lies within the borough. Carnivalgoers paused to observe a minute＊s silence for those killed in the blaze that engulfed the building in June.The moment was concluded with a round of applause and cheers from the hundreds of thousands of people celebrating the bank holiday weekend. Firefighters were embraced, congratulated and thanked by carnivalgoers who posed for pictures with them.Officers also seized a number of weapons during the event, including knives, CS spray, batons and a hammer.As of 10pm on Monday, there had been 122 arrests made on Sunday and 191 on Monday, the Met said. The figures included 58 arrests for drug offences, six for sexual offences and 22 public order offences. A total of 28 police officers received injuries across both days.Despite the fall in the number of arrests, Ken Marsh, head of the Metropolitan  Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, condemned the carnival. He said the true number of injured officers would be higher than the figure announced, claiming that his members had been attacked with ※blood, bottles and dangerous ＆liquid＊§.※We want the Metropolitan police service to take responsibility for this. A huge number of officers are getting attacked every year at this event. The service knows this is going to happen and sends officers to this event knowing this is going to happen,§ said Marsh, . However, the  assembly＊s police and crime committee praised the policing operation surrounding the carnival. Its chairman, Steve O＊Connell, said: ※Having previously raised concerns about public safety, we are pleased to see the number of arrests for offences such as drugs and weapon possession have fallen.※There is still more to do to make carnival a safer and better experience for all, and we look forward to hearing how the LNHCET [London Notting Hill Carnival Enterprises Trust], the mayor, and other partners will continue to work towards this, so that carnival＊s success, rather than crime and disorder, becomes the headline story every year§.A group of young people deemed to be at risk of getting caught up in crime and disorder during the Notting Hill carnival were removed from the area and invited to a watersports weekend at a cost of more than ?1,000 each,  last week.Fifteen young people aged from 13 to 17 were selected for the trip, which cost the council ?20,000. The council said the Alternative to Carnival Engagement (ACE) project was an effective way of protecting vulnerable young people from harm.																																											"
"※We will not die secret deaths anymore. We will be citizens. The time has come. The world only spins forward.§These are the words of , in his play Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes. Kushner speaks them by way of the play＊s main character, Prior Walter: a gay cisgendered man living with HIV in a time when those three letters almost certainly meant Aids. Meant death.Of all the moments that make up the eight hours of Angels in America, those 20 words get to the politicised, pointy end of the struggle gay men endured during the western Aids crisis.While more recent collective experiences, like a postal survey on marriage rights, seems more present and urgent for Australian LGBT community, HIV/Aids is by no means over. Globally, one million people each year still die of Aids-related causes and, for the tens of thousands of gay and bisexual men living with or at risk of contracting HIV in Australia, the stigma of the virus still hangs over our collective experience.And, after many years of artistic silence around the experiences of gay men and HIV/Aids, audiences have been revisiting that time across stages and screens.In 2015, Australian actor, writer and activist Timothy Conigrave＊s 1995 Aids memoir, , was turned into a film, based on the wildly successful 2006 play by Tommy Murphy. In the past few years, there has also been documentaries and performance works about the Aids crisis, including the Australian offerings  and . And, following , another opened last week in Melbourne.With the spectre of Aids long since replaced by the realities of long-term living with HIV, at least among gay communities in the western world, one may question why we continually look back to a time in which many of us were dying and most of us were terrified. Has our community not moved on to other, more pressing issues?Holding the Man＊s writer for the stage and screen, Tommy Murphy, recalls that question of relevance being asked of him back when the play made its debut in late 2006.※I recall there was some doubt, when we wrote the play, about whether people would be interested in looking back at the epidemic,§ he says. ※It was even suggested that those stories had been told enough. The response to the play told us otherwise.§Holding the Man is universal in its tale of love against all odds, whereas Angels in America may better be described as ※timeless§ 每 perhaps odd, given its numerous and specific political references to Reagan and the Cold War. For Gary Abrahams, director of the upcoming Melbourne production of Angels, the play goes beyond the spectre of .※It＊s not just an Aids play,§ he says. ※It uses HIV as a catalyst for something much larger 每 to talk about world politics. It＊s a philosophical play, it＊s an ideological play.§Angels in America won the Pulitzer prize for drama in 1993, the year it opened on Broadway. It also won numerous Tony awards and is routinely described as one of the best pieces of western drama to emerge from the 20th century. Kushner＊s writing is relentless 每 as funny as it angry, speaking to themes beyond the Aids crisis that was gripping America and the rest of the world. But it is worthwhile interrogating why contemporary artists wishing to explore HIV/Aids narratives seem so intent on looking back, instead of to the very urgent stories on either side of them. Very, very few of the people dying of Aids-related causes today are white gay men living in New York, San Francisco, or Sydney; the vast majority are in . Where are their stories?In their forthcoming book, Viral Dramaturgies: HIV and Aids in Performance in the Twenty-First Century, Drs Alyson Campbell and Dirk Gindt refer to this era of Aids sentimentality on stage and screen as ※a paradoxical combination of a simultaneous cultural amnesia and nostalgia.§The problem, they argue, is that HIV/Aids-related artwork by ※gay white male urban artists§ is continually revised and revisited 每 repeatedly celebrated, in other words 每 while the creative contributions of other communities equally affected by HIV/Aids are overlooked, changing the way these cultural histories are written. But Campbell and Gindt also argue that these works can counter nostalgia ※through a genuine engagement with the relationship between past and present§.Were you to write the story of Aids in 2017, it would almost certainly not have a white gay man at its centre. Were you to write the story of white gay men in 2017, it would more likely be something akin to Four Weddings, minus the Funeral. Angels is a tale of all the ※sex, death, horror shit§ that Aids represented, as Conigrave describes the epidemic in Holding the Man. While some of us may have moved on from that time, there is still much its stories can teach us.For Angels director Abrahams, the play is that necessary bridge between the past and the present. While the gay men who survived the Aids crisis may be flocking to these nostalgic offerings, Abrahams also observes a sizeable number of ※post-Aids§ gay men who seem unwilling to look back on that time and who even judge it harshly as being too radical and oversexualised. This is a sticking point between ※radical§ and ※respectable§ members of the LGBT [for consistency] community: that to convince the general public that we deserve the same rights, we must put forward a sanitised, consumable version of queer identity. There is as much tension between the arguments for and against this position as there was when Kushner wrote his play. The lengthy dialogue between his characters on this topic is not unlike the seemingly endless comment threads now found online (albeit far better written and much more entertaining). We are still fighting for equal rights as citizens but in recent years the warfare has been as much internal as external.In recent weeks, however, we have seen worrying propaganda from opponents of same-sex marriage, alluding to HIV/Aids as ※proof§ that gay men are somehow undeserving of equal rights, often in the context of associating it with our presumed abilities as parents 每 such as a poster featuring illustrations of gay men literally stamped with the bio-hazard symbol, towering above their unhappy children, or a bilingual pamphlet that was delivered to homes in the Chinese-Australian community urging people to vote ※no§ in the postal survey because gay men are one of the ※main source of HIV/Aids§. In this current era of political heat around LGBT identities and rights, every aspect of our community is under scrutiny. This current moment in Australian queer history suggests it is a time to unite once more, to put aside factional politics in the face of a larger, external threat. It was the Aids crisis that taught many gay men of that era, and their allies, how to stand up, be visible and fight. Abrahams speaks to the galvanisation that happened around HIV and how it has shaped us as a political and social movement.※I wonder if we would have advanced as far without it.§   																																											"
"※It starts when children are young: the moment a child is born, relatives start comparing siblings＊ skin colour. It starts in your own family 每 but people don＊t want to talk about it openly.§Kavitha Emmanuel is the founder of Women of Worth, an Indian NGO that is standing up to bias toward lighter skin. The , launched in 2009, is not ※anti-white§, she says, but about inclusivity 每 beauty beyond colour. It carries celebrity endorsement, most notably from the Bollywood actor Nandita Das, and provides a forum for people to share their personal stories of skin colour bias.The campaign runs media literacy workshops and advocacy programmes in schools to counteract colour bias. Emmanuel says this even occurs in school textbooks, where a picture of a fair-skinned girl might be labelled ※beautiful§ and a darker one ※ugly§.※Some children are really shocked that this affects them so intensely,§ Emmanuel says. ※Some are in tears [during the workshops].§A perfect life from perfect skin 每 but only for those of the right shade 每 is the message and mindset that＊s being passed down. This has spawned a multibillion-dollar industry in cosmetic creams and invasive procedures such as skin bleaching, chemical peels, laser treatments, steroid cocktails, ※whitening§ pills and intravenous injections 每 all with varying effectiveness and health risks. It＊s more than a bias, it＊s a dangerous cultural obsession.Multinational cosmetics brands have found a lucrative market:global spending on skin lightening is projected to triple to $31.2bn (?24bn) by 2024, according to a  by the research firm Global Industry Analysts. The driving force, it says, is ※the still rampant darker skin stigma, and rigid cultural perception that correlates lighter skin tone with beauty and personal success§.※This is not bias. This is racism,§ says Sunil Bhatia, a professor of human development at Connecticut College. Bhatia recently wrote in US News & World Report about .In , these were codified in the caste system, the ancient Hindu classification in which birth determined occupation and social stratum. At the top, Brahmins were priests and intellectuals; at the bottom, outcastes were confined to the least-desired jobs such as latrine cleaners. Bhatia says caste may have been about more than just occupation: the darker you looked, the lower your place in the social hierarchy.Fair skin bias was perpetuated and strongly reinforced by colonialism, not just in India but in dozens of countries ruled by a European power. It＊s the idea that the ruler is fair-skinned, says Emmanuel: ※All around the world, it was a fact that the rich could stay indoors versus the poor who worked outside and were dark-skinned.§Now globalisation is spreading the bias. ※There is an interesting whiteness travelling from the US to shopping malls in other countries, featuring white models,§ Bhatia says. ※You can trace a line from colonialism, post-colonialism and globalisation.§ Western beauty ideals, including fair skin, dominate worldwide. And with these ideals come products to service them. In Nigeria, 77% of the country＊s women use skin-lightening agents; in Togo, 59%. But the largest and fastest-growing markets are in the Asia-Pacific region. In India, a typical supermarket will have a wall of personal care products featuring ※whitening§ moisturiser or ※lightening§ body creams from wellknown brands.Pooja Kannan, 27, from Mumbai, spent years buying cosmetics that promised to lighten her complexion. She bought creams, facewash and soaps for treating ※skin fairness problems§, spending Rs 200每300 every two months 每 equivalent to a week＊s worth of travel to her college . Over four years of use, she says her skin did lighten up a little, but wonders whether that was due to the cream or her taking more care when going out in the sun.Kannan＊s natural skin tone is a healthy light brown, but when she was growing up, her aunts would shake their heads in disappointment over her complexion. A tan would lead some relatives and classmates to admonish her: ※You＊ve turned black,§ they said. In India, where skin tone often defines success, ability to find work or a spouse, such comments matter. Kannan says she felt insecure.※When I was getting dressed up to go out, I would remember what they said and put on more make-up.§ Kannan is also a dancer and felt discriminated in performances too. ※The prettier, skinnier and fairer girls are positioned at the front of the stage,§ she says. ※That gets to you.§Movies, TV programmes and especially adverts reinforced the bias. In 2016, actor Emma Watson (of Harry Potter fame) had to issue a statement saying she would no longer endorse products which ※do not always reflect the diverse beauty of all women§, after criticisms of her earlier appearance in adverts in Asia for Lanc?me＊s Blanc Expert line. (, Lanc?me emphasised the product＊s ※evening§ rather than lightening properties, saying that it ※helps brighten, evens skin tone, and provides a healthy-looking complexion. This kind of product, proposed by every brand, is an essential part of Asian women＊s beauty routines.§)In 2014, the Advertising Standards Council of India banned adverts depicting people with darker skin as inferior, but products are still marketed. Ads for skin-lightening creams still appear in newspapers, on television and on billboards, featuring Bollywood celebrities such as Shah Rukh Khan, John Abraham and Deepika Padukone. In  called out several of his colleagues for endorsing fairness creams. In the Hindustan Times, he wrote: ※Advertising preaches that we would get a better job, a happier marriage and more beautiful children if we were fair. We are conditioned to believe that life would have been easier had we been born fairer.§Skin lightening is not the sole preserve of the modern cosmetics industry. India＊s traditional Ayurveda medical system teaches that pregnant women can improve their foetus＊s complexion by drinking saffron-laced milk and eating oranges, fennel seeds and coconut pieces. Earlier this year, an Ayurvedic practitioner in Kolkata led a session for expectant couples, promising that even dark-skinned, short parents could have tall and fair children.A 2012 study by a women＊s health charity in India found that childless couples often insisted on 每 and paid more for 每 surrogates who were beautiful and fair, even though the woman contributed no genetic material to the baby.But perhaps nowhere is the fair skin preference more ingrained than in newspaper classified adverts seeking a spouse. Along with requirements for the prospective bride or groom＊s caste, religion, profession and education, physical characteristics are listed too. Someone described as ※dusky§ may be skipped in favour of one who is of a ※fair§ complexion.※Potential brides spend a lot of money; it＊s really unlimited in the months before the wedding,§ says Ema Trinidad, a Filipina beautician who runs a spa in Bengaluru. ※I was so surprised when I came here that your chances of getting married depend on your skin colour. We don＊t have that in the Philippines.§The mindset is so normalised that many people accept fairness treatments as a standard part of wedding preparations 每 for men as well as women. When Karthik Panchapakesan got married in 2001, he was intrigued by ads for a ※complete makeover§ and decided to try it out. ※I had never gone to a salon before,§ says the media specialist working in community radio. ※The massage felt really good. Then they put this fruity and flowery white paste all over my forehead, cheeks, nose and chin. They promised it would even out my skin.§Panchapakesan said his eyes started burning after about five minutes, and he got an irritation around his nose as the sweet smell turned to acrid fumes. He suspected it was based on ammonia: ※It was more chemical than horseradish,§ he says. When it was all done, his face looked as if it had been dusted with talcum powder. ※It was not a transformation, it was a deformation.§Most skin-lightening treatments target the skin＊s ability to produce pigment, or melanin, which gives skin, hair and eyes their colour. Everyone has about the same number of cells to make melanin, but how much you actually produce is down to your genes. Having more natural melanin means darker-skinned people tend to develop fewer wrinkles and are less at risk of skin cancer.Skin-lightening creams often aim to interrupt the production of melanin or just improve the general health of the skin. They can contain a natural ingredient such as soy, liquorice or arbutin, sometimes combined with the medical lightening agent hydroquinone (not all creams contain this: hydroquinone is a potentially carcinogenic ingredient, and products containing it are banned or restricted in Ghana, South Africa, the Ivory Coast, Japan, Australia and the European Union, though they are still used illegally).Mercury was also previously found in some lightening creams and soaps, according to the . Mercury suppresses the production of melanin, but can also damage the kidneys and brain if it is absorbed by the skin and accumulates in the body. Other lightening methods include a chemical peel, which removes the top layer of your skin 每 leaving fresher skin exposed to harmful solar radiation and environmental pollutants. Laser treatments offer an even more aggressive approach by breaking up a skin＊s pigmentation, sometimes with damaging results. ※There＊s a pressure on Indian men and women,§ says Dr Sujata Chandrappa, a Bengaluru-based dermatologist. ※They have some role model in their head and they want to get there no matter what. That＊s the wrong concept.§Chandrappa says clients often come in wanting the skin tone of a favourite Bollywood celebrity. ※If their obsession is just with colour, then I will outright tell them I＊m more worried they＊re unnecessarily seeking something they don＊t need. If I encourage them too much, I get the sense that I＊m promoting racism.§Shannah Mendiola spends 3,200 rupees (?40) a month on skin-lightening supplements 每 a lot by local standards, but Mendiola has a well-paying job with a multinational company. Originally from the Philippines but now working in Bengaluru, Mendiola says she has been taking the pills for the past five years, not just for lighter skin but for their antioxidant properties.※I like going to the beach and I feel really dark after a holiday,§ she tells me by email. ※I would always prefer to buy and use skincare products that contain skin-whitening ingredients 每 like my body lotion, face wash and moisturiser. In the Philippines, it＊s always a plus if you are fair.§Mendiola describes herself as  not too fair and not too dark 每 and says her skin returns to its natural colour faster when she uses the pills. ※Having an even skin tone that＊s healthy and glowing gives me more self-confidence when I meet people for work. Why not? Don＊t we all want to look good?§The pills she takes are glutathione, an antioxidant naturally produced by the liver that can protect the skin from UV rays and free radicals, which contribute to skin damage and pigmentation.A more direct form of treatment is glutathione injections. These are commonly used to counteract the side-effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea, hair loss or difficulty in breathing, but their growing popularity for skin lightening has led to official concern.In 2011, the Philippine Food and Drug Administration issued a public warning about an ※alarming increase in the unapproved use of glutathione administered intravenously§. It highlighted adverse effects including skin rashes, thyroid and kidney dysfunction, and even the potentially fatal Stevens每Johnson syndrome, in which the skin peels from the body as if burned.In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration warned of the potentially significant safety risk to consumers:※You＊re essentially injecting an unknown substance into your body 每 you don＊t know what it contains or how it was made.§Nevertheless, there is growing consumer demand. Mendiola has taken two treatments of injectable glutathione, but mostly relies on pills. Dr Mukta Sachdev, a clinical and aesthetic dermatologist in Bengaluru, refuses to administer the injections, despite repeated requests from her patients. ※I practise on evidence-based dermatology, and there＊s not enough literature supporting the use of injectable glutathione.§ On the web, there are many videos showing how to self-inject the substance.※From a medical perspective, it is not possible to lighten skin permanently 每 but you can even it out,§ Sachdev says. In fact, many of her patients are actually seeking treatment for problems with other skin-lightening procedures 每 primarily the use of steroid creams.India＊s pharmaceutical regulator has approved at least 18 different corticosteroids for topical skin use, ranging from mild to super-potent. These usually cost less than ?1.50 a tube, and most pharmacies across the country will dispense them, even without a prescription.People apply them indiscriminately to treat pimples or for fairer skin, but steroid creams take off the protective outer layer of the skin, so it is more exposed to UV rays and environmental pollutants such as smog and cigarette smoke. But more worrying is that they can be addictive, says dermatologist Dr Shyamanta Barua.※The moment the patient stops using the cream, the skin reacts, gets irritated, develops rashes,§ he says. ※So the patient starts the cream again and it＊s a vicious cycle. They become psychologically addicted.§ He thinks users should be counselled as if they were addicted to recreational drugs or alcohol.Furthermore, there are signs that improper steroid prescriptions 每 often in cocktails containing a mix of steroids, antibiotics and antifungals 每 may be fuelling a surge in bugs resistant to normal treatments. Dr Rajetha Damisetty, a cosmetic dermatologist in Hyderabad, talks about one combination containing clobetasol 每 the most potent steroid known to humans, which is used to treat inflammatory skin conditions like eczema 每 mixed with two antibiotics and two antifungals. ※Only India has this crazy combination,§ Damisetty says, adding that the result is a ※nightmare§.Typically, she says, ※around 70每90% of those affected by fungal infections would have used topical steroids for treatment, and they would respond within two weeks. But now we are having to give four times the dosage for eight to 12 weeks. It＊s an epidemic across the entire country.§Campaigners standing up against the world＊s bias towards lighter skin are fighting more than just bad medical practice and consumer habits. They are battling millennia-old preferences for lighter skin. founder Emmanuel is optimistic, however. She believes people are more aware of the issue than ever before, and hopes the next generation will see things differently 每 not just in India, but across the world. In 2016, three students at the University of Texas, Austin, started an Instagram campaign called Unfair & Lovely 每 a play on the name of India＊s most popular fairness cream. The  hashtag invited darker-skinned people to share their photos.In 2013, a young woman in Pakistan, Fatima Lodhi, launched the country＊s first anti-colourism movement, called . Lodhi has written about the prejudice she faced as a child: ※I never got a chance to become a fairy in my school plays because fairies are supposed to be fair-skinned!§ Now, she leads sessions at schools to make students more aware about skin colour discrimination.Attitudes are starting to change among women as they gain greater confidence from education, employment and financial independence outside the home. Emmanuel decribes one Dark is Beautiful session at an all-girls middle school in the southern Indian city of Chennai. A dark-skinned teen 每 ※stunningly beautiful but with deep self-esteem issues§ 每 came to the front. She was weeping because, just that morning, her brother had taunted her about her skin tone.Emmanuel was more surprised, however, when another, lighter-skinned, girl stood up. She said she＊d believed dark was ugly until that moment, but apologised to her classmates with a promise to treat them better.※They all started clapping,§ Emmanuel recalls. ※That＊s a big move for a teenager. She really had the bigness of heart to say something like that.§ 																																											"
"A wall between Mexico and the USA has been under consideration since 1993. Donald Trump has merely garnished the issue with an extra sprinkle of offence by making it a central plank of his presidency and insisting that Mexico pay for it. This film visits the border and finds paranoia, shame and, above all, division. In this, as in so many other things, the president＊s ability to take a difficult situation and make it worse is uncanny. The laughs quite literally don＊t ever start in this new series. Some reliable faces 每 Al Murray, Nish Kumar, Radio 1＊s Clara Amfo, Anneka Rice 每 turn up to subject themselves to a selection of trivia games. There is nothing objectionable about Osman or any of the participants, but when one of the guests on your new show confesses to ※glazing over§ when you are barely five minutes into the broadcast, something of the magic dies a little. Five simple ingredients boshed together to create an amazing dish. That＊s the USP of Saint Oliver＊s current foodie gospel, and he preaches it with unmatched energy, coining new words such as ※sprinklage§ while remaining incapable of picking up a frying pan without spinning it like a football rattle. A Jenga tower of glazed Asian fishcakes and a luscious lamb chop one-pot jamboree are among the items on his plausibly fuss-free menu. If you bridle at people treating Princess Diana＊s death as a major event in their own lives, avoid this mawkish drama. Four unrelated journeys of self-discovery begin at the moment of the Paris crash, resolving with childish simplicity on the day of the funeral; Diana provides the emotional pay-off that the stories are too weak to muster on their own. A film solely about Tamsin Greig and John Gordon Sinclair＊s struggling Glaswegian florists might have had a stronger identity. Dewsbury is among Britain＊s most racially segregated towns. From these different districts, two teenage girls 每 one white British, one Asian Muslim 每 form an arranged friendship in front of a camera crew, their nascent bond followed throughout. An admittedly contrived premise, and this tale of teens embracing their differences is no cure for a Brexit-bruised Britain, but genuinely heartening nonetheless. Davina McCall hosts this new eight-part discussion series talking about ※real life§ and ※modern dilemmas§. No, it doesn＊t sound hugely promising, but this first episode on self-image, body dysmorphia and ※the pursuit of perfection§ works well, as McCall proves adept at creating an intimate space for her guests to open up. Those sharing their experiences include Dr Christian Jessen, who reveals the ※deep, dark secret§ of having suffered from bulimia. Davis, a graduate of standup, Snapchat and talkshow gag-writing, fronts a mix of skits and live bits that, like a friendlier Dave Chappelle, satirises the white view of black America. Davis was brought up near, but not in, the roughest districts of LA, so he blends self-deprecating outsiderdom with his role as an arch tour guide.

She has a face on throughout, but then perhaps you would, too, if everyone kept calling you ※Eureka§.

There is an appealing naivety to this series, which even Dan Snow＊s foghorn voice of authority can＊t dampen. Hong Kong is a place of wealth and opportunity, but getting inside individual lives makes the place seem a bit more divisive and comprehensible.

These range from Wright＊s own classic but stylised house and studio, to the iconic Fallingwater house in Pennsylvania. This series of three hour-long specials from the BBC Natural History Unit will examine the Andes and the Himalayas, but tonight we begin with the Rocky Mountains.

"oyal time should move slowly and by its own laws: creeping, like the flow of chrism from a jar. But 20 ordinary years have jog-trotted by, and it＊s possible to have a grownup conversation with someone who wasn＊t born when Diana died. Her widower is long remarried. Her eldest son, once so like her, shows signs of developing the ponderous looks of Philip, his grand-father. Diana should be as passe as ostrich plumes: one of those royal or quasi-royal women, like Mary of Teck or Wallis Simpson or the last tsarina, whose images fade to sepia and whose bones are white as pearls. Instead, we gossip about her as if she had just left the room. We still debate how in 1981 a sweet-faced, puppy-eyed 20-year-old came to marry into the royal house. Was it a setup from the start? Did she know her fiance loved another woman? Was she complicit, or was she an innocent, garlanded for the slab and the knife?For some people, being dead is only a relative condition; they wreak more than the living do. After their first rigor, they reshape themselves, taking on a flexibility in public discourse. For the anniversary of her death, the princess＊s sons remember her for the TV cameras, and we learn that she was ※fun§ and ※very caring§ and ※a breath of fresh air§. They speak sincerely, but they have no news. Yet there is no bar on saying what you like about her, in defiance of the evidence. Private tapes she made with her voice coach have been shown in a TV documentary, . They were trailed as revealing a princess who is ※candid§ and ※uninhibited§. Yet never has she appeared so self-conscious and recalcitrant. Squirming, twitching, avoiding the camera＊s eye, she describes herself hopefully as ※a rebel§, on the grounds that she liked to do the opposite of everyone else. You want to veil the lens and explain: that is reaction, not rebellion. Throwing a tantrum when thwarted doesn＊t make you a free spirit. Rolling your eyes and shrugging doesn＊t prove you are brave. And because people say ※trust me§, it doesn＊t means they＊ll keep your secrets.Yet royal people exist in a place beyond fact-correction, in a mystical realm with rules that, as individuals, they may not see; Diana consulted psychics to work out what was going on. The perennial demand for them to cut costs and be more ※down to earth§ is futile. They are not people like us, but with better hats. They exist apart from utility, and by virtue of our unexamined and irrational needs. You can＊t write or speak about the princess without explicating and embellishing her myth. She no longer exists as herself, only as what we made of her. Her story is archaic and transpersonal. ※It is as if,§ said the psychotherapist Warren Colman, ※Diana broadcast on an archetypal frequency.§ Though she was not born royal, her ancestors were ancient power-brokers, dug more deeply into these islands than the Windsors. She arrived on the scene in an era of gross self-interest, to distract the nation from the hardness of its own character. As she correctly discerned, ※The British people needed someone to give affection.§ A soft-eyed, fertile blond, she represented conjugal and maternal love, and what other source did we have? Until Tony Blair took office as a fresh-faced Prince Charming we had female leaders, but they were old and their cupboards were bare of food and love: a queen who, even at Diana＊s death, was reluctant to descend from the cold north, and a prime minister formerly known as Maggie Thatcher, Milk Snatcher. had little to do with any actual person. Even at the beginning she was only loosely based on the young woman born Diana Spencer, and once she was engaged to the Prince of Wales she cut adrift from her modest CV. In the recent documentary , her son Harry spoke of her as ※an ordinary 20-year-old§; then checked himself, remembering she was an aristocrat. But in some ways his first thought was right. Like a farmer＊s daughter, Diana married the boy across the hedge 每 she grew up near the queen＊s estate at Sandringham. As the third daughter born to Viscount Althorp she wasperhapsa disappointment. The family＊s previous child, a son, had died within hours of birth, and Spencer and his wife Frances had to try again for an heir. The Jungian analyst Marion Woodman posits that unwanted or superfluous children have difficulty in becoming embodied; they remain airy, available to fate, as if no one has signed them out of the soul store. By Diana＊s cradle 每 where the witches and good fairies do battle 每 stood a friend of the Queen Mother, her maternal grandmother Ruth Fermoy. When Diana was six, Frances left her young family. Fermoy took sides against her daughter and helped Spencer get custody of his four desolate children. Later, promoted to his earldom, he remarried without telling them. Diana is said to have expressed her views by pushing her stepmother downstairs.Diana＊s private education implanted few cultural interests and no sense of their lack. She passed no public exams. But she could write a civil letter in her rounded hand, and since she didn＊t have to earn a living, did it matter? In , she speaks of her sense of destiny. ※I knew ＃ something profound was coming my way ＃ I knew I was different from my friends ＃§ Like Cinderella in the kitchen, she served an apprenticeship in humility, working as an upper-class cleaner, and in a nursery mopping up after other people＊s babies. Then the prince came calling: a mature man, with a history of his own. By her own account, Diana was not clever. Nor was she especially good, in the sense of having a dependable inclination to virtue; she was quixotically loving, not steadily charitable: mutable, not dependable: given to infatuation, prey to impulse. This is not a criticism. Myth does not reject any material. It only asks for a heart of wax. Then it works subtly to shape its subject, mould her to be fit for fate. When people described Diana as a ※fairytale princess§, were they thinking of the cleaned-up versions? Fairytales are not about gauzy frocks and ego gratification. They are about child murder, cannibalism, starvation, deformity, desperate human creatures cast into the form of beasts, or chained by spells, or immured alive in thorns. The caged child is milk-fed, finger felt for plumpness by the witch, and if there is a happy-ever-after, it is usually written on someone＊s skin. In a TV interview before the marriage 每 the ※ghastly interview,§ as Diana called it 每 Charles wondered quizzically, ※whatever ＆in love＊ means§. He has been blamed ever since for destroying the simple faith of a simple maid. But off-camera, Diana was preparing. Her choice of hymn makes the marriage a patriotic duty, like signing up for a war: By Diana＊s later account, the wedding day was ※the worst day of my life§. But at the time 每 July 1981 每 she looked dazed with happiness. Even for republicans there was much to enjoy. A great city . The oily reverence of the commentators with their peculiar word order: ※For the first time through the centre gateway of Admiralty Arch arrives Lady Diana ＃§ Best of all, the outfits: Princess Anne dressed as an Easter egg, wearing a furious scowl. Diana＊s entrance into legend prompted a national gasp, as she tumbled from her coach like a bride in a bag. Her gown unfolded perfectly, like a paper flower. But some palace lackey had erred; the vehicle was too cramped for a tall flouncing lassie and her frock. and behind-the-scenes sweat to transform Cinderella from dust-maid to belle. Fairytales do not describe the day after the wedding, when the young wife lost in the corridors of the palace sees her reflection splinter, and turns in panicked circles looking for a mirror that recognises her. Prince Charles＊s attitude of anxious perplexity seems to have concealed an obtuseness about what the marriage meant to his bride. The usual young woman of the era had a job, sexual experience, friends who stayed within her circle 每 her wedding was simply a big party, and she probably didn＊t even move house. But Diana＊s experience as daughter of a landed family did not prepare her for Buckingham Palace, any more than Sch?nbrunn prepared the teenage Marie Antoinette for Versailles. It was Diana＊s complaint that no one helped her or saw her need. Fermoy had expressed doubts before the marriage. ※Darling, you must understand that their sense of humour and their lifestyle are different ＃§ The bathos is superb. ※Mind how you go,§ say the elders, as they tip off the dragon and chain the virgin to the mossy rock.What would have happened to Diana if she had made the sort of marriage her friends made? You can picture her stabled in the shires with a husband untroubled by brains: furnishing a cold house with good pieces, skiing annually, hosting shoots, stuffing the children off to board: spending more on replenishing the ancestral linen cupboard than on her own back. With not too much face-paint, jacket sleeves too short for her long arms, vital organs shielded by a stout bag bought at a country show, she would have ossified into convention;no one would have suspected her of being a beauty.Like many women in mid-life, she would have lived in a mist of discontent, struggling to define something owing, something that had eluded her. But in her case the ※something§ would have been the throne.Even in childhood photos Diana seems to pose, as if watching her own show. Her gaze flits sideways, as if to check everyone is looking at her. One ※friend§ told a TV crew that as a teenager, ※whenever you saw her alone she would have picked up some trashy romantic novel§. Leave aside the casual denigration of women＊s taste: if Diana imagined herself 每 the least and youngest daughter 每 as magnificent, all-conquering, a queen, she had a means of turning her daydream into fact. Diana claimed that she and the prince met only 13 times before their wedding. Did she keep a note? She lacked self-awareness, but had strong instincts. It must have been child＊s play 每 because she was anxious to please, or because she was crafty 每to seemto share his visions and concerns. An earnest look, a shy silence, job done. Chaste maids were not too plentiful in the 1980s. The prince took advice: snap her up, sir.Diana was no doubt really shy, and certainly unused and unformed: a hollow vessel, able to carry not just heirs but the projections of others. After marriage she had power that she had not sought or imagined. She had expected adulation, but of a private kind: to be adored by her prince, respected and revered by her subjects. She could not have imagined how insatiable the public would be, once demand for her had been ramped up by the media and her own tactics. In her circle there were no solid witnesses to the nature of reality 每 only those who, by virtue of their vocation, were fantasists, exalting sentiment, exploiting the nation＊s infantile needs, equating history with the history of a few titled families. She had a sense of her own fitness to be princess, and unfitness for any other role. But she had no sense of the true history in which she was now embedded, or the strength of the forces she would constellate. At first, she said, she was afraid of the crowds who gathered to adore her. Then she began to feed on them. When Diana became the most famous woman in the world, it is not surprising that less popular members of the Firm were miffed. The queen herself had been a beauty, but may have thought it vulgar to be too interested in one＊s looks. Diana was allowed to interest herself in little else. Her dealings with the press and photographers were not innocent. The images had to be carefully curated 每 her good side, so to speak. There were unacceptable angles. And when an image is created by the lens it can fuzz and slip and blur. Unsure of her boundaries, the princess starved herself, as if her healthy frame could pare away to the elfin proportions of the models and dancers who fascinated her. She threw up her food, hacked at herself with a blade. In  she sneers at her young self 每 her tone contemptuous, punitive. She cannot forgive that girl, naive heroine of a gothic novel 每 whose fate is to be locked in a keep by a man of dubious intentions, and to be practised upon by older women who have secrets she needs to know.  In 1996 the dead marriage was buried. This was not what had been negotiated, in the 13 encounters. The prince resumed his old narrative, with the woman he should have married in the first place. Another story had begun to tell Diana. Cut loose, she opened the doors of her identity and all the dead princesses floated in, those deposed and exiled, beheaded and shot. With them came the screen idols and the spoiled glamour girls 每 Monroe naked and dead, Garbo who wanted to be alone. As we grow up, we aim to be ※self-possessed§, not taken over by others. But as the novelist Ivy Compton Burnett says, ※People have no chance to grow up. A lifetime is not long enough.§Isolated by the pique and indifference of the other royals, neglected, crossed in love and bested by Mrs Parker Bowles, she found ※affinity§, she said, with the rejected. To her credit, she had begun to work actively to lessen the amount of pain in the world. She visited the sick, and stopped just short of claiming the healing touch that custom bestows on the divinely anointed; had she become queen, she would surely have gone about raising the dead. Legend insists she showed the world that it was safe to shake hands with a person with Aids. Even in the unenlightened days of 1987, only the bigoted and ignorant thought casual contact would infect them, but any gesture from Diana was worth years of public education and millions in funding. She hung around with Mother Teresa, and did it while wearing couture; she moved towards suffering, rather than swerving from it. ※When people are dying,§ she said, ※they＊re much more open, more vulnerable, much more real than other people, and I appreciate that.§ Among the weak she recovered her strength 每 transformed from peely-wally puking maid to an Amazon heading to battle. She knew dread diseases would not kill her. Like Joan of Arc, protected by her own magic, she walked unscathed. Campaigning against landmines, she passed through explosive terrain. Her armoured vest was inscribed, ※the HALO Trust§. Her blond head gleamed like a fell invitation, inviting a bolt from the blue. The divorce was a sour one. It is difficult to extract sober truth from the bitching of the sycophants on either side. Diana won the War of the Waleses because she was ruthless, and had better legs. Her withdrawal from public life, dramatically announced, suggested that she would emerge as a new model. Possibly this transformation was under way, but it failed to complete, till death completed it. Instead she behaved like a daffy celebrity, and her fans began to laugh at her attempts to hoover up a hero. What kind of mate fits the bill, if your first has been a future king? The chance of an ordinary life of trial and error was what she had rejected long ago 每 when, as her sisters put it, they printed her face on the souvenir tea towels. But though her sheen was smudged a little by her failures in love, the marks could be polished away. It was possible for the public to hold two views of her simultaneously, and perhaps they were not contradictory: goddesses are not known for propriety. It＊s no use saying to a super-being, ※Keep your hands off my husband.§ She takes and consumes, and spits out the tough bits. By the time of her  interview, late in 1995, Diana had developed a habit of speaking of herself in the third person. Sphinx-like, unsmiling and with  makeup, she presented herself as both a victim and a person of great power, and though she spoke plainly enough, it was with the mysterious air of one forced to communicate in riddles. She was too much for the royal family, she said: wasted on them. She saw nothing good for Charles. ※Who knows what fate will produce?§ It was not a question. In her polite duchessy way, she was cursing him. But the end of royal status had stripped away Diana＊s protection, both practically and mystically. After the  broadcast there was a buzz in the air: a doomy feeling, as if her options were running out. She still played games with the press, but they knew a dirtier game. They spat at her, insulted her to try to draw a reaction. She teased them, and they chased her down, not killing her yet. She is supposed to have feared sinister forces, anticipated that her end was prepared. As every fortune-teller knows, such hints assume precision in retrospect. , a room packed with the invisible presences of angels, devils, ancestors. But now, as many of us don＊t believe in an afterlife, we envisage no final justice, no ultimate meaning, and have no support for our sense of loss when ※positivity§ falters. Perhaps we are baffled by the process of extinction. In recent years, death narratives have attained a popularity they have not held for centuries. Those with a terminal illness scope it out in blogs. This summer the last days of baby Charlie Gard riveted worldwide attention. But what is the point of all this introspection? Even before the funeral, survivors are supposed to flip back to normal. ※Keeping busy§ is the secret,  has advised.Grief is exhausting, as we all know. The bereaved are muddled and tense, they need allowances made. But who knows you are mourning, if there is nothing but a long face to set you apart? No one wants to go back to the elaborate conventions of the Victorians, but they had the merit of tagging the bereaved, marking them out for tenderness. And if your secret was that you felt no sorrow, your clothes did the right thing on your behalf. Now funeral notices specify ※colourful clothing§. The grief-stricken are described as ※depressed§, as if sorrow were a pathology. We pour every effort into cheering ourselves up and releasing balloons. When someone dies, ※he wouldn＊t have wanted to see long faces§, we assure ourselves 每 but we cross our fingers as we say it. What if he did? What if the dead person hoped for us to rend our garments and wail? When Diana died, a crack appeared in a vial of grief, and released a salt ocean. A nation took to the boats. Vast crowds gathered to pool their dismay and sense of shock. As Diana was a collective creation, she was also a collective possession. The mass-mourning offended the taste police. It was gaudy, it was kitsch 每 the rotting flowers in their shrouds, the padded hearts of crimson plastic, the teddy bears and dolls and broken-backed verses. But all these testified to the struggle for self-expression of individuals who were spiritually and imaginatively deprived,who released their own suppressed sorrow in grieving for a woman they did not know. The term ※mass hysteria§ was a facile denigration of a phenomenon that eluded the commentators and their framework of analysis. They did not see the active work the crowds were doing. Mourning is work. It is not simply being sad. It is naming your pain. It is witnessing the sorrow of others, drawing out the shape of loss. It is natural and necessary and there is no healing without it. It is irrelevant to object that Diana alive bore no resemblance to Diana dead. The crowds were not deluded about what they had lost. They were not mourning something perfect, but something that was unfinished. There was speculation that Diana might have been pregnant when she died. Was something of startling interest evolving beneath her skin 每 another way of living? The question was left hanging. Her death released subterranean doubts and fear. Even those who scorn conspiracy theories asked, what exactly is an accident? Why, on the last night of her life, did Diana go below ground to reach her destination? She need not have gone that way. But she didn＊t choose 每 she was driven. Her gods wanted her: she had been out too late. From her first emergence in public, sun shining through her skirt, Diana was exploited, for money, for thrills, for laughs. She was not a saint, or a rebel who needs our posthumous assistance 每 she was a young woman of scant personal resources who believed she was basking with dolphins when she was foundering among sharks. But as a phenomenon, she was bigger than all of us: self-renewing as the seasons, always desired and never possessed. She was the White Goddess evoked by Robert Graves, the slender being with the hook nose and startling blue eyes; the being he describes as a shape-shifter, a virgin but also a vixen, a hag, mermaid, weasel. She was Thomas Wyatt＊s white deer, fleeing into the forest darkness. She was the creature ※painted and damned and young and fair§, whom the poet Stevie Smith described: In the TV broadcast last month, Prince William said, ※We won＊t be doing this again. We won＊t speak openly or publicly about her again ＃§ When her broken body was laid to rest on a private island, it was a conscious and perhaps superfluous attempt to embed her in national myth. No commemorative scheme has proved equal or, you might think, necessary. She is like John Keats, but more photogenic: ※Here lies one whose name was writ in water.§ If Diana is present now, it is in what flows and is mutable, what waxes and wanes, what cannot be fixed, measured, confined, is not time-bound and so renders anniversaries obsolete: and therefore, possibly, not dead at all, but slid into the Alma tunnel to re-emerge in the autumn of 1997, collar turned up, long feet like blades carving through the rain.

"his week, I listened to a?podcast I＊d been putting off for the longest time. The title isn＊t exactly alluring, to be honest.

Think Jackanory, but in a twisted alternate universe. It is mortifying, awful, stupefying and completely hilarious.

My confident answer? ※Her name＊s Mum.§ As?we get older, there are inklings, of course, that our parents were people before they decided to enhance their lives by creating us.

Finding out, as Morton did, that your dad has an obsession with breasts.

"Maybe you＊re frustrated 每 or delighted 每 that the Edinburgh festival is over and you didn＊t see a thing. Either way, fringe comedy can＊t be so easily avoided. Not so long ago, only a handful of festival acts went on to tour or perform substantial runs elsewhere. Now, several dozen take to the touring circuit, and many more tip up at London＊s Soho theatre 每 a perpetual Edinburgh fringe-on-Thames.

Bishop brings a notebook on stage and tells us he＊ll be ticking and crossing off the try-out jokes that do and don＊t work. But that＊s just patter: his set doesn＊t feel raw, the gags go unticked and uncrossed. The show, which delivers precisely what you＊d expect from Bishop, is strung around three significant experiences he＊s had in the last year: turning 50, his sons leaving home, and having a health scare. Each prompts uncontroversial but warmly funny reflections on how things are different now to back then, how he and his wife are getting on, and what a humble showbiz star he is. There＊s a long anecdote (with a too-convenient-to-be-true punchline) about blagging tickets to a U2 gig for him and his lifelong mates, which de-glamorises his own celebrity while leaving the cult of celebrity in general, and Bono＊s in particular, intact. After the meeting-Bono story comes the meeting-the-Queen story, but after that, things get relatable, as Bishop starts contrasting modernity (Tinder, nut allergies, Channel 4＊s Naked Attraction) with the 1970s. ※Do you know what  used to do?§ is the motif, as Bishop shows us how he first chatted up his wife, or (good routine, this one) how hard it used to be to start a car. His belief that things were better back then is entirely uncritical, but it＊s possible to be lulled by the easy sway of Bishop＊s comedy into not minding a jot. If Bishop offers the sound of the 70s, American comic  is the shock of the new, a standup over-sharer in the 21st-century mould, albeit with a perspective entirely her own. Her new show Unf*ckable 每 staged in Edinburgh on the top floor of a double-decker bus 每 traces her long journey to sexual self-confidence. It starts, as she did, innocently, sharing get-to-know-you observations of British behaviour and tales of recent cat ownership. There＊s a choice joke about why felines of yore threw in their lot with humans, whom they identified as ※good at hunting, bad at self-esteem§. But the meat of the show describes Burch＊s stint as ※a virgin dominatrix§ in Manhattan, enacting others＊ fantasies before she＊d cultivated any of her own. With stories as lurid as this, Burch doesn＊t have to work hard for laughs, while a later sexual harassment anecdote treads water for a while before getting to its alarming point. The timid protagonist of her stories is barely discernible in the extravagant personality on stage. But Burch fashions big laughs from this standup sexual bildungsroman, and some of the jokes (when asked to play a slavemaster to her client＊s slave: ※This might be the only reparations I＊m getting!§) are smart as her old whip., like Burch, is Soho-bound. His show Problematic 每 like its award-nominated predecessor 每 is politically engaged and examines whether PC is a good or bad thing. The show is thoughtful, smart and tells both good jokes and a morbidly engaging story of  with far-right Aussie politician David Oldfield. But on this occasion I found Ballard too loud (forever whooping and hollering ※come on!§ after his punchlines) and self-regarding. ※Unclench, Edinburgh!§, he shouted at us, implying 每 with little foundation 每 that his material had shocked us into silence. Quoting all the jokes, meanwhile, from a Roast Battle he waged two years ago against Jimmy Carr felt self-satisfied  second-hand. The show would (and maybe will) be much improved were Ballard to dial down the truculence and trust the material. In the meantime, a lighter touch is on display in ＊ show Laid, which won her the comedy festival＊s best newcomer award. An extended metaphor for anxieties about fertility and maternity disguised as a clown show (or is it vice versa?), Laid dramatises the life cycle of an egg, which hatches into Palamides, who lays several more throughout the show, each time asking: ※Should I raise my egg, or eat it?§ Directed by ex-comedy award champ and sexy clown , Palamides ropes her audience into the show, and into compromising positions, just as he once did. She＊s less terrifying, but no less compelling, as she chirrups her faux-perky lines in a Judy Garland trill, keeping the domesticity show on the road as everywhere eggs are cracking. It paints a striking 每 if ridiculous 每 picture of the fear of having, keeping and losing children. And its repeating tableau of Palamides both sobbing over and eating her offspring omelette is rich and strange. The fringe is over, but images like these aren＊t shaken off so easily.																																											"

"There can be no argument as to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, the 1974 horror film about a group of teenagers who fall into the clutches of a psychopathic family, being one of the most pervasively disquieting films ever made. Its uniquely rotten, insidious flavour is the result of macabre production design, degraded cinematography, clammy lighting and a sophisticated and abrasive use of sound. Like ＊s Night of the Living Dead and ＊s The Last House on the Left, the film used horror to express the discontentment of a country reeling from Vietnam and widespread social unrest. Fans included Ridley Scott (※It shocked the hell out of me§), , who bought his own print, and , director of The Exorcist, who said it ※transcended the [horror] genre§.Its writer-director, , who has died aged 74, was already working on a story about young people in peril when he found himself one weekend in the hardware department of a busy store while trying to locate the exit. ※I looked down and there was a rack of chain saws in front of me for sale. I said, ＆if I start the saw, those people would just part. They would get out of my way.＊§ So was born a movie 每 and a character, Leatherface, the chain saw-wielding brute wearing a mask of human skin 每 that would become a benchmark in horror and a thorn in the side of film censors everywhere.Ten local authorities in Britain showed the film with an X rating after the BBFC (British Board of Film Censors, as it was known until 1984) refused to issue a certificate in 1975 on the grounds that the picture exemplified ※the pornography of terror§, though when that body finally relented in 1999, it noted that ※§. Indeed, Hooper＊s greatest achievement is to have created an atmosphere of extreme dread and distress chiefly through insinuation.It will be some small compensation for audiences terrified by the film that it was even more hellish to work on than it was to watch. The stench of animal bones and carcasses in the stifling heat caused cast and crew members to throw up. There were accidents and injuries (※Everyone had got a ding on the head or a cut to this or that,§ noted Hooper) while the clutch had to be removed from the chain saw itself after an actor fell while operating it. Hooper engineered divisions among his cast to create tension and refused to let them see Leatherface until their first encounter with him on camera. ※That was the heaviest set I＊ve ever been on,§ the director said. ※It was miserable really.§Tobe was born in Austin, Texas, the son of Lois (nee Crosby) and Norman Hooper: he claimed his mother went into labour in the cinema.  in San Angelo. After studying film at the University of Texas he worked as a documentary cameraman and a college professor.He made his feature debut with Eggshells (1969), a partly improvised psychedelic drama described by Hooper as ※§, and directed The Song Is Love (1970), a documentary about the folk trio . Hooper then co-wrote The Texas Chain Saw Massacre with , who had starred in Eggshells.He remained in the horror genre for Eaten Alive (1976), about a killer who feeds his victims to his pet alligator; a well-regarded TV adaptation of Stephen King＊s vampire novel Salem＊s Lot (1979), starring James Mason and David Soul; and The Funhouse (1981), in which teenagers hiding out at a carnival overnight are preyed on by a killer. He directed Poltergeist (1982), written by Steven Spielberg, but spent many years defending the work as his own following an LA Times article headlined Poltergeist: Whose Film Is It? in which Spielberg was quoted as saying: ※Tobe isn＊t what you＊d call a take-charge sort of guy. He＊s just not a strong presence on a movie set.§ Spielberg published an open letter of apology, though this did not lay the matter to rest.Hooper said that Hollywood stopped calling in the wake of the Poltergeist rumours. He turned to the producers Cannon Films to make Lifeforce (1985) and Invaders from Mars (1986), camp science-fiction horror movies from which no one emerged with distinction, as well as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (also 1986). For this attempt to continue the story with a rowdier and more satirical tone, Hooper hired , co-writer of Paris, Texas, who advised him that they would need to find the right sort of victims. Once again, it was a shopping trip that provided inspiration. ※I saw all these yuppies buying piles of things, seven sweaters at a time,§ said Carson. ※I called Tobe up and said, ＆I＊ve found the victims.＊§ The picture was no match for Cannon Films, which was reportedly more brutal in its cutting even than Leatherface himself.From then on he worked mainly in television directing episodes of Tales from the Crypt and The Equaliser, and a segment of the 1993 portmanteau TV film Body Bags. His final film, Djinn (2013), a horror story set in the United Arab Emirates, attracted scathing reviews.Hooper was married and divorced twice. He is survived by his son, William Tony. Willard Tobe Hooper, writer and director, born 25 January 1943; died 26 August 2017 This article was amended on 17 September 2017. Hooper＊s first name was Willard, rather than William, and he is survived by one son, William Tony Hooper, not two, William and Tony, as originally stated. 																																											"
"s a reformist who wrote well-constructed plays,  is very much out of fashion. To mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, the Finborough has, however, revived this little-known play from 1922 and, while it may not be gold-standard Galsworthy, it is more radical than it first seems.The action takes place in the north London home of the upper middle-class March family. Geoffrey, the breadwinner, is a novelist forever railing at the sins of the coalition government. His son, Johnny, is a war-haunted poet who attacks the spiritually bankrupt society around him. The family＊s values are put to the test when they are asked to employ their window cleaner＊s daughter Faith, reprieved from hanging but lately imprisoned for smothering her two-day-old daughter, as a parlourmaid. Only Geoffrey＊s guarded wife opposes the idea, seeing the prospective maid as a source of trouble, and her doubts seem to be confirmed when Johnny starts to put rather too much hope in Faith. The play has some obvious flaws: the philosophical window cleaner, quoting Hegel and Nietzsche, seems too Shavian to be true and there is a rush of incident towards the end. But, for all the dubious symbolism and dated slang, Galsworthy raises serious issues including the inequity of the law and the perennial battle between idealists and pragmatists. When the Marches＊ cook says, ※We＊ve all got feelings,§ and Faith replies, ※Not below three hundred a year,§ Galsworthy even foreshadows ＊s equation of money and morality in . I＊m sure would not disavow the play＊s conclusion that it is patronising to try and help people without also caring for them as human beings.Geoffrey Beevers＊ solidly reliable production is very well cast. David Shelley and Carolyn Backhouse as the senior Marches admirably capture the deep fissures within an enlightened family. Duncan Moore as their son Johnny has the guilt-ridden look of a man who has survived the trenches. Vincent Brimble and Charlotte Brimble, father and daughter in real life, unsurprisingly suggest a natural bond between the aphoristic window cleaner and his resilient offspring. As with most plays of the 1920s, you have to accept a measure of contrivance, but Galsworthy emerges as a sharp critic of the kind of woolly liberalism he was often thought to embody.

"When Caroline blags an invite to her hero Charles Dickens＊s dinner party, William also pretends to be a fan and goes along, too. Andrew Scott plays Dickens brilliantly as a doom-filled fop lapping up compliments while knocking back the sauce. Elsewhere, Florence Nightingale wants the surgeons to clean their instruments as she assists in the case of a woman with a haemorrhoid ※perhaps the size of a Christmas walnut§. Excellent fun. The MasterChef franchise has shown us that cooking well often means a person with sleeve tattoos and a past they＊d rather not talk about perspiring over a sous vide pork loin. This is more of a family affair, however, where the competition element is mainly taking place between Rosemary Shrager and Giorgio Locatelli (who will be the most condescending?). Anyway, first up it＊s the ?10 supper round. Curry or sprout pizza? Well, exactly. In the penultimate episode of this gripping four-parter centred on a nurse masquerading as a doctor, Cath (incoming Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker) is called back home to be with her dying father, while her dreamboat new boyfriend Dr Andy makes an uncomfortable discovery back in Edinburgh. The confrontation that follows is brilliantly subtle and squirm-worthy. More? A near catastrophe in A&E exposes a shocking truth.

Final instalment of Professor Richard Clay＊s fascinating three-part search for that state of transcendental perfection, which, despite mountainous evidence to the contrary, some insist remains within reach of human society. In tonight＊s episode, Clay wonders whether the thrills and satisfactions of artistic expression count as a utopia, discussing epiphany and escape with Steve?Reich and A Guy Called Gerald, among others.

"hat could be riper for satire than morning television? It＊s not just the highly caffeinated personalities, but the little details 每 the interminably long infomercials, the two-chord muzak looping endlessly between segments, the conveyor belt of experts.The comedians behind Get Krack!n 每 Kate McCartney and Kate McLennan 每 have developed a grudging respect for the genre in the process of lampooning it. It started the minute they first stepped into their regulation TV-host high heels and onto the blisteringly bright set.※Morning TV sets are quite aggressive,§ McCartney explains, ※so ours is like an obstacle course. We made all the steps different sizes. Everything＊s just a bit off. And then there are the outfits we would never wear in real life.§※Shapewear made me so angry all the time,§ McLennan interjects.※Awkward§ has long been the main ingredient of the Kates＊ oeuvre, throughout their combined history of acting, stand-up and writing for TV sketch shows. In particular, they home in on their own awkward attempts to conform to the feminine ideal.Their first real hit was, which clocked up more than 9m views on YouTube. Its premise of two out-of-work actor mates, cobbling together a web-series cooking show, was the perfect vehicle for sending up our obsessions with paleo diets, quitting sugar and the Thermomix.What made The Katering Show all the more fun was that the lines between fact and fiction were blurred. The real-life McCartney and McLennan were making the show on as slender a budget as their fictional counterparts; in fact, the fancy kitchen they filmed in was borrowed via AirBnB. (※Our rating is in the toilet now,§ says McLennan darkly. ※Apparently Tupperware went missing.§)In between bright and breezy cooking instructions, the Kates made plenty of bitter observations on the TV industry that had spat them out. When McLennan pondered the meteoric success of Chris Lilley, it was a jibe at McCartney, who had appeared in The Big Bite with the comedian and failed to reach the same dizzying heights. ※When I saw that line I just sat and stared at it for two minutes,§ McCartney says dryly.The ABC came on board for the second season, hosting it on iView. This ongoing relationship has meant a bigger budget and team for Get Krack!n, as well as a primetime slot. This time, the Kates dramatise their anxiety around getting a bigger profile, through the scenario of scoring a morning TV show.McLennan＊s alter ego, a highly strung overachiever, seems the perfect fit for the breakneck speed of morning TV, but the pressure threatens to send her loopy. By contrast, the fact that their slot is at the humbling hour of 3am (cue hilarious crosses to an empty newsroom chair or entirely dark street-scene window), means that her reliably dour foil, McCartney, is literally falling asleep on the job.The real-life Kates are true to their characters: good mates who occasionally have each other in their sniper sights. When McLennan discusses McCartney＊s relative lack of acting experience, she adds sweetly: ※It works better to have you as a counter to my character, anyway.§※Right, because I have a less impressive range,§ says McCartney flatly.※It＊s more just someone needs to keep it moving and someone has to say the boring bits.§Yet the Kates admire the respectful friendships behind comedy duos such as Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, and Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.※We check in on each other,§ says McLennan, ※and we don＊t throw each other under the bus.§Back in 2007, McCartney had been working as a background artist at an animation company. The lead project was children＊s show Wakkaville, for which McLennan provided one of the voices. It wasn＊t the greatest introduction. ※In order to animate the film, you have to repeat the dialogue over and over again,§ McCartney recalls. ※She was playing a really annoying kid.§The two resisted corresponding until 2011. ※We had mutual friends and so we had the usual aversion when people said: ＆You two should meet each other＊,§ recalls McLennan.※I remember meeting you in a pub and you weren＊t very nice to me,§ McCartney offers.They caved in after hitting it off on Twitter. ※So we drank a bottle of wine and poured out all these stories about how people had fucked us over for the previous 10 years,§ McLennan says. She＊d just come from a stint on Ben Elton＊s Live from Planet Earth, which was cancelled after three episodes, but knew that she would flourish with her own material 每 if only she could get a platform.They decided they could work together, forming the production company Lead Balloon and, as McCartney says: ※The moment we started to work together, things started happening.§Now both 37, the Kates have a young daughter each. McCartney may deadpan that ※since I had a kid, my heart＊s cracked open and I don＊t know how to close it again§, but motherhood hasn＊t hijacked the jokes. While The Katering Show had a Yummy Mummies episode, they insist that was ※just so we could get that out of the way§.Still, if there＊s an overarching theme in Get Krack!n, it seems to be deconstructing culture＊s dumbing-down of women and encouraging critical thinking. There are rambles about the patriarchy between bouts of sunny presenter-speak, and biting acknowledgement that this is a world in which it＊s OK for the Daily Mail to publish articles .Get Krack!n has its own experts 每 or ※Kracksperts§ 每 extolling the virtues of, say, turmeric, with zero scientific evidence, and guest cameos include Sam Neill, Kat Stewart and Rove McManus. The real Kates＊ concerns about world affairs also seep into the picture, with visual gags as well as verbal, such as a doomsday clock hanging beneath clocks showing London, LA and Tokyo time on the studio wall.※We wanted to question why people are distracting themselves with rubbish,§ McLennan says, ※although ＃ every day we do look at the call sheet and think, ah great, there＊s a wombat in today§.It＊s difficult to know where the Kates＊ meta take on the industry will transport them next. Reality TV hosts? The doyennes of current affairs?※At least we＊re not writing from the perspective of not being able to pay our car registration at the moment,§ says McLennan with relief.※At the ,§ says McCartney.   premieres on ABC 1 on 30 August at 9:30pm.

"When you＊re scrolling through your Facebook news feed and you see a headline like ※Pope Francis Declares Abortion Forgivable§, do you think it＊s legitimate?What about: ※Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses  for President§? Would you immediately know if it was a breaking story, fake news or satire? How?Since the US presidential election campaign in 2016, fake news 每 and we don＊t accept Trump＊s definition of fake news as anything he disagrees with 每 has become a real problem. It＊s a problem for news organisations and for aggregators like Google and Facebook, who stand accused of spreading and legitimising it.But it＊s also become a problem for one of the oldest sources of fake news: . Launched in 1988 as a print publication, the Onion is now a digital-only media company that publishes the Onion and sister website  每 their answer to viral sites like BuzzFeed and Upworthy 每 and its alt-right parody channel, . The Onion, which calls itself ※America＊s finest news source§, has a team of paid writers and editors who imitate the style of respectable newspapers like the New York Times to lambast politics and society at large; to make us smile and make us think.One of the founding editors, Scott Dikkers, expressed his frustration with the confusion between fake news and satire when he spoke to university students in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, earlier this year.※A lot of people now think satire and fake news are the same thing,§ .※It＊s satire. It＊s totally different from fake news, and it bothers me when those fake news organisations are basically out there printing lies or propaganda [and] label themselves satire.§The key here is deception. Technically the Onion produces fake news but it＊s for laughs 每 not to intentionally deceive readers, or to promote misinformation for ideological reasons, or to generate advertising revenue.When a fake news site based in Russia sends out a story like ※WikiLeaks confirms Hillary sold weapons to Isis ＃ Then drops another bombshell§, they are doing it to deliberately deceive 每 and they＊re counting on the fact that many will see the headline and scroll past it before the lack of credibility registers.The managing editor of the Onion, Marnie Shure, says that if an Onion article is taken as fact, then it has failed. ※The thing I like to emphasise is this: we work far too hard crafting our jokes for them to be taken as fact,§ she tells Guardian Australia ahead of a trip to Sydney for the Antidote ideas festival. ※If someone doesn＊t recognise the joke we＊re making, then that＊s a whole lot of labour lost. We aim never to trick people but rather to train them to see the world as we see it. In a world infested by ＆fake news＊, the intention [and subsequent execution] is everything.§Shure, who has spent almost her entire career at the Onion in various roles, says the concept of fake news and society＊s response to it is ever evolving 每 and since the 2016 US election, that evolution has accelerated.※The 2016 election illuminated that, while we absolutely intend for our publication to be considered a joke and to be recognised as such, there are countless outlets that were outright attempting to deceive their audiences with entirely fabricated stories,§ she says.※Facebook sought to crack down on the latter but we have been inextricably tied to those outlets＊ intentional deceptions. It makes it more important than ever for us to only publish what we can stand behind with our full support.§Facebook＊s struggle to contain fake news was under the spotlight this week in Sydney, when the social media network＊s executives  to explain what they were doing to prevent the spread of fake news.Facebook says it is responding to the threat of fake news by analysing the behaviour of the sites and cutting off their lifeblood 每 advertising revenue 每 but politicians remain unimpressed by the progress so far. It＊s not just fake news that has muddied the waters for the Onion. The election of Trump has given writers of satire additional challenges. When the president of the United States is tweeting nonsense and the White House has become a circus, is there still room for the Onion?News stories coming out of this administration are so outlandish they are more likely than ever to attract the well-worn Twitter hashtag  than ever before.※What we do becomes even more essential when its targets are this clownish,§ Shure answers. ※I＊d argue that the world right now is farcical, not satirical. The satire comes in when you can speak truth to that reigning circus sideshow. Our maxim is ＆afflict the comfortable, comfort the afflicted＊. That＊s certainly not something that anyone in the Trump administration is attempting to do.§Shure＊s writers, who are more likely to have a comedy background than a journalistic one, have had to find ※creative ways to write around him§, she says. ※In addition to commenting on him, it＊s important to comment on the fact that Trump does not exist in a vacuum. ※He is surrounded by family members and cabinet members and constituents, all of whom are facilitating the current political landscape in some way. So we aim to have a mix of coverage that leaves no one blameless.§  Marnie Shure is speaking at , held at the Sydney Opera House on 2-3 September.																																											"
"he gaunt and blackened ruin of , where 80 people died in the fire of 14 June, could be seen from many places on the route of the annual Notting Hill carnival parade in London on Sunday. In the middle of the chaotic, noisy hedonism of , hundreds of volunteers were on the streets from soon after dawn till long after dusk, urging the revellers to wear something green as a mark of  for those who died and the hundreds made homeless. The ragged and inspiring response to the Grenfell tragedy in the streets of north Kensington gives us a glimpse of what society really means in practice. It is profoundly disconnected from conventional politics and all the better for that.Conventional politics failed the tower before the blaze and in the chaotic, shameful  as well. Conventional politics represented the tyranny of the smug, the people for whom house prices were a store of wealth and pensions, not an insuperable barrier to a life a little less insecure. Conventional politics tried to lock out the angry survivors from council meetings, and had for years paid huge salaries to  who failed completely when the hour of crisis came. Many were people who seemed to believe in nothing much except self-advancement according to the rules.The prayers, the songs, the release of doves and the conscription of the colour green to the cause all mark a different kind of politics, one conducted on the basis of emotion and a knowledge of injustice. The spine of this kind of resistance was religious. Whatever some may think of their beliefs 每 whatever they may think of each other＊s beliefs 每 it was the churches and the mosques of the surrounding communities that first stepped up and have continued with efficient, self-sacrificial zeal to help their neighbours. The families of Grenfell seem to have trusted their religious representatives far more than they trusted their political ones 每 and who can blame them?Nor can any one party or leader claim their allegiance now. It would certainly have to be earned. Faith groups and other community-based organisations can claim it because they are, after all, entirely voluntary. Those that no one believes in just wither away as the mass membership of political parties once did. Unlike the clicktivism of internet-based movements, the community organisations, faith-based and otherwise, have earned their legitimacy methodically and over time. They did not abandon the poor just because there were no votes in them.In an almost forgotten time before austerity,  talked up the idea of the big society. That was widely, and as it turned out rightly, derided as a way of coating with nostalgia the decay of the welfare state. Yet what we have seen in and around the tower provides a glimpse of what the big society might actually mean. It is an awkward beast to tame. It can＊t do without government. It can＊t replace conventional politics entirely, but it doesn＊t do what the government wants. It does not have leaders with whom deals can be struck, except in small piecemeal ways. A society that takes account of the marginalised and angry will not be miraculously delivered from conflict as a result. But it will be fairer, more just and less uneasy with itself. That 每 as well as all the concrete help that still is needed 每 would be something worth growing from the ashes.																																											"
"Authorities are investigating the death of a man who ran through cordons of security officers into a massive fire at the Burning Man festival.Aaron Joel Mitchell, 41, broke through a two-layer security perimeter during the Man Burn ceremony in which a giant wooden effigy was set on fire late on Saturday night.Jerry Allen, the sheriff of Pershing county in Nevada, estimated there were about 50,000 people present when the festival＊s crew of firefighters pulled Mitchell out of the blaze. He was airlifted to the UC Davis hospital burn centre in California, but died on Sunday morning. The sheriff said doctors confirmed Mitchell was not under the influence of alcohol, but a toxicology report is pending.※We don＊t know if it was intentional on his part or if it was just kind of induced by drugs. We＊re not sure of that yet,§ Allen said.Mitchell was a US citizen who had a home in Oklahoma but apparently was living in Switzerland with his wife, the sheriff＊s office said.Burning Man said in a statement that it had cancelled some scheduled fires on Sunday but would go ahead with the 8pm temple burn, another signature event that signals the end of the nine-day festival. More than 70,000 people are attending the art and music celebration in the Black Rock desert, about 100 miles (160km) north of Reno.Organisers, who were offering counselling on site, said in a statement: ※Now is a time for closeness, contact and community. Trauma needs processing. Promote calls, hugs, self-care, check-ins, and sleep.§The festival culminates with the burning of a towering 12m (40ft) effigy made of wood, a symbol of rebirth, which usually happens the Saturday before the Labor Day holiday. It is followed by the burning of the temple on Sunday and the festivities wrap up on Monday.Attempts to rescue Mitchell were hampered because part of the structure was falling while emergency staff were trying to reach him, the sheriff＊s office said. ※Rescuers had to leave him to allow the structure to fall and provide for rescuer safety before they could go back into the flames to extract Aaron from the debris,§ the sheriff＊s office said in a statement.Investigators were having difficulties getting information because festivalgoers were leaving the site, the law enforcement agency said.Attendees have tried before to run into the flames while the man is burning and there have been reported injuries from people walking over the hot coals to try to get a piece of the spectacle as a token. Allen said the organisers had tried to address the problem with a human-chain of security staff and this was the first time someone had broken through.※People try to run into the fire as part of their spiritual portion of Burning Man,§ Allen said. ※The significance of the man burning, it＊s just kind of a rebirth, they burn the man to the ground, a new chapter has started. It＊s part of their tenets of radical self-expression.§Burning Man 每 known for its eclectic artwork, offbeat theme camps, concerts and other entertainment 每 began in San Francisco before moving to Nevada in 1990. Over the years as the event grew in popularity, deaths and crime have been reported, ranging from car crashes to drug use.In 2014, a man in Utah died after jumping into a huge ceremonial bonfire at a similar event. It was investigated as a suicide.																																											"
"he Lifetime movie is the hallmark of a celebrity life lived to the full. These made-for-TV classics are packed with unusual casting, smirk-inducing one-liners and a good dose of high camp. And wigs.

Because LiLo is more like Liz McDonald than Liz Taylor.It is the film that launched a thousand very niche drinking games. But for a tale that＊s packed with drama, affairs, marriage, divorce, fights and an overdose, Liz & Dick doesn＊t half drag. The action is undeniably sexy at times, but ultimately laughable. When Lohan＊s gravelly voice and perfectly applied eyeliner are the two most interesting things about a film, you know you＊re in trouble for the next hour and a half.Liz: ※I need a ring. A big ring.§A pair of low-slung trousers does not an  make: Alexandra Shipp brought nothing of ※Baby Girl§ to the role. The casting was bad across the board: as for Chattrisse Dolabaille＊s Missy Elliott, it＊s as if they plonked a baseball cap on a passing stranger.Nope. It＊s far too slow-moving, with Shipp pumping out most un-Aaliyah-like cover versions, due to the glaring lack of music rights. How can you have a proper Aaliyah movie without Try Again? Songs aside, let＊s not forget that R Kelly married Aaliyah when she was 15. It＊s an impossible task for a made-for-TV movie to make their relationship seem anything less than wrong, no matter how many ※toot tooooots§ or ※beep beeps§ R gave the world to make up for it.Aaliyah: ※Eighteen feels like an eternity from now,§ she tells  in a dubious attempt to romance him. At 15. Eurgh.Lex Scott Davis makes a lovable ingenue and her eyeroll at the suggestion of recording plodding megaballad Unbreak My Heart is on point.How could a film about Braxton binning off her sisters for a record contract, getting a massive bouquet from , having her card declined and being diagnosed with lupus fail to bring the soapy feels? She felt the guilt, she felt the bankruptcy, she felt it all, but Braxton comes across as a true survivor.Fake LA Reid: ※I＊m sure  felt bad when he left the Jackson Five.§It＊s like being in the 90s, Screech＊s hair and all.Extra points go to a Lifetime Movie soundtracked by Bell Biv DeVoe＊s Poison. There were groupies, there were drugs, but 每 more shockingly 每 the cast signed actual belly buttons. If you don＊t want to even think about Screech getting stoned then look away now, because the whole thing is based on Dustin ※Screech§ Diamond＊s tell-all memoir Behind the Bell. So it＊s only right that he got his first kiss with Tori Spelling 每 and all the glory.Fake TV exec: ※The network didn＊t kill us, but the hormones might.§Wobbling blond bombshell Agnes Bruckner does her best as  每 if indeed her best is to be loaded up with prosthetics and teetering around pneumatically. Cleavage like hers is made, not born.It takes a bold woman to practise her pole-dancing moves in a children＊s playground, but that＊s what took lil＊ Vickie Lynn from zero to, er, expert writher in a cowboy hat. Then she wooed octogenarian J Howard Marshall with the words: ※Where are you goin＊, handsome?§ She, er, made him feel like he was 75 again. Although her story is portrayed as beyond sleazy, she certainly got an angelic send-off.Anna Nicole: ※I＊ll be buried as celebrity and international balls-to-the-wall party girl Anna Nicole Smith, but I was born Vickie Lynn Hogan.§Crazy-shirted MJ impersonator Navi received mixed reviews for his shamones, ※he-heees§ and oddly British accent. who loves Bobby Brown, fried chicken and privacy.Jacko＊s bodyguard: ※He doesn＊t want to be the King of Pop. He just wants to be Mike, a normal American dad.§Fake Brittany Amanda Fuller morphs from a collagen-heavy Annie to Bridget Jones, looking nothing like the troubled Hollywood star. Pity poor Sherilyn Fenn, who has to play her mum. Whoever was casting this movie made one trip to Bad Blonde Wigs R Us too many, and crowned  with the very worst. and it shows. Surely there should be a prize for anyone who can understand anything Brittany says once she starts crying. And she has a lot to cry about: being hounded by paparazzi; falling out with her childhood friends when she discovered kale; and romancing Ashton Kutcher＊s terrible haircut. Her death scene is tastelessly done, with Brittany unconvincingly coughing her way through an overdose when her actual cause of death was pneumonia.Brittany: ※They＊re finally seeing me for my inner blonde.§Not exactly. Natasha Bassett＊s Louisiana accent is as slippery as Britney＊s I＊m A Slave 4 U snake., as she goes from not-that-innocent teen to fully fledged pop star with a sex tape. There are, of course, unsavoury moments, from ※Pinky＊s§ shedding of her highly publicised virginity to ※Stinky§ (that＊s Justin Timberlake for the uninitiated) to her Vegas wedding to Kevin ※Meat Pole§ Federline. But what really resonates in Britters＊ story is the real sadness when she struggles as a mother in the constant spotlight.Britney: ※I have, like, zero boobies.§Total. , all smize and scrunch-dried hairdo, while Mark Rolston makes music executive Clive Davis his own. ※Stay away from yellow,§ he warns Whit. ※It makes you look like a canary.§ Whitney wisecracks her way though the movie, bringing warmth and sass.Director Angela Bassett turned in the most watchable Lifetime Movie ever. Whitney＊s a wisecracking minx who leads a thrusting Bobby Brown from beer to drugs, ticklefights him in a limo and provides him with shedloads of hot lovin＊. They go shopping on Rodeo Drive, they bond over a video of Irene Cara in Sparkle and at one point he declares: ※They just don＊t know how to handle you. Not like Bobby Brown would.§ If that isn＊t a beautiful love story, what is? Like The Bodyguard, the action ends at I Will Always Love You.Bobby Brown: ※Here you go, baby. I make lurve and make eggs.§																																											"
"What is Darren Aronofsky＊s new movie Mother! about? He doesn＊t want to tell you. Or rather, he wants to tell you that he doesn＊t want to tell you. In recent interviews Aronofsky has insisted he wants to keep the details of the film secret, before going on to describe it as ※a cruise missile shooting into a wall§, ※a very intense ride§, with ※home-invasion elements§ and other such hints, just in case you thought it might be a sequel to .※Secrecy§ is a pretty elastic term when it comes to the movies. Many a film-maker has become obsessive about keeping everything under wraps 每 usually the type whose movies hinge on grand mysteries and twists. It＊s standard practice to swear casts to silence and guard scripts as if they＊re nuclear codes.  one page of information about Interstellar when he commissioned him to do the score, for example. Someone who worked on James Cameron＊s Avatar told me the non-disclosure agreement was the size of a telephone book, and contained the phrase ※in this universe or any other§ 每 and they probably weren＊t even allowed to disclose that.But at the same time, they want us to know about the movie, don＊t they? So ※secrecy§ has become part of the marketing strategy. Years ahead of release, we dutifully follow the trail of clues: an on-set Instagram here, a cryptic fansite interview there, a 30-second teaser trailer, maybe some preview footage 每 each giving away a precisely calibrated amount of new information to keep us speculating and salivating. Often such snippets spoil the movie＊s surprises entirely. Often there wasn＊t much to spoil anyway. The promotion has become the real mystery thriller; the eventual movie is merely a summing up of the case.This is probably all Alfred Hitchcock＊s fault. He knew the suspense game began long before the movie＊s release. He bought up all the copies of the novel on which Psycho was based, so nobody would know the plot twists. He informed viewers that ※no one＃ BUT NO ONE＃ will be admitted to the theatre after the start of each performance§, and warned them not to give away Psycho＊s secrets. For good measure, though, Hitchcock also recorded a six-minute prologue, touring the movie＊s locations like a squeamish estate agent. ※They＊ve cleaned all this up now,§ he says, inspecting Janet Leigh＊s bathroom. Yet Psycho still delivered the promised shock.Let＊s hope  does too, because Aronofsky＊s comments and the latest trailer already give away far too much.																																											"
"n 2008, Winnie M Li was raped twice while on a walk through Colin Glen Forest Park in Belfast. Li was 29; her attacker was just 15. He pleaded guilty before the case could go to trial and was jailed for eight years. In her work as a film producer, Li had recently seen one of her projects,  nominated for an Oscar. A few days after she was assaulted, she attended the premiere of another,  starring . Her bruises were visible through her gown.Li suffered post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression following the attack, and she was unable to keep up her career. But she didn＊t stay silent. She told the Irish Sun: ※One of the most damaging things, apart from the crime itself, is keeping it to yourself.§ She set up , a four-day event with art, music and discussion of sexual assault, that ran in 2015, and wrote her first novel, Dark Chapter.The book closely maps Li＊s experience. In spare, direct prose it gives a first-person account of an attack on a Taiwanese-American called Vivian as she walks near Belfast. This is not an easy book to read. The assault is brutal and degrading. Vivian does what she has to do ※to survive§ and we are made to see and feel it all.The aftermath is also addressed with impressive clarity. First there is the realisation of what has happened: ※He said he was 16, and again she wants to vomit. She just had muddy, unasked-for-sex with a 16-year-old.§ Then there are the police interviews, medical examinations 每 ※bright fluorescent lights and grey-green walls§ 每 frightening procedures to guard against AIDS and test for infections.There are also months and years coming to terms with what happened, floating, as Li describes it, on the ※grey surface§ of a lake, wanting to stay inside, hide under the duvet, frightened of the world. In a deviation from Li＊s experience, Vivian＊s attacker pleads not guilty and a trial follows. This too is a tense, dramatic reading experience. Defence lawyers attempt to humiliate Vivian, question her conduct and undermine her experience. The rage we feel as readers is compounded by the knowledge that this is often what happens in real-life sexual assault cases.The writing feels defiant and urgent 每 but it＊s only half of the book. In a move that＊s possibly even braver than recreating her personal trauma, Li attempts to get inside the mind of her rapist, explain his thought processes and explore his emotions. There＊s a dual narrative from the point of view of Johnny, a 15-year-old Irish traveller, which runs in parallel with Vivian＊s, relating the same events and even trying to explain them sympathetically. Sometimes, this is effective. There is no doubt that Johnny has had a brutal life and the story is full of queasy moments of empathy, for his rage and feeling lost in an indifferent world.However, this narrative strand is also problematic. Li has had to take a considerable imaginative leap to get into the head of this young ※pervert§ and she doesn＊t always clear the distance. His thoughts about his ※hard-on§ and ※beaours§ (the Irish slang word he uses to refer to attractive women) don＊t always ring true. The attempts at dialect and rendering the speech patterns of the Travellers never flow as easily as those living in Vivian＊s privileged world. In her acknowledgements, Li is careful to say that she ※does not intend for my novel (inspired as it is by my own lived experience) to portray an entire community nor to malign it§. She also makes sure to show some of the hardships and prejudices Travellers face. Even so, all of the male Travellers we meet in this story are violent criminals, petty thieves and sexual predators. Johnny himself feels like ※an evocation of a type of man§, as . He also feels like a representative of a community, one in which all ※the lads§ are out to get what they ※want§ from ※tourist girls§. All of Johnny＊s male friends and relatives are, at best, complicit in his crime and it＊s often implied they are committing similar outrages. It creates the sense that an entire race might be preying on women.Some allowances must be made for the fact that these ideas about sex are relayed through Johnny＊s warped mind, and also because Li herself has suffered so much and is retelling her lived experience. Even so, it sometimes feels as if there is a dangerous lack of attention to the presentation of highly sensitive material. There＊s no reason to think this unpleasantness is intentional 每 but it is a misstep in such a didactic book. The overall message remains important and it is generally conveyed with skill and emotional force. But I have reservations.																																											"
"High-profile figures in the arts world have called on Russian authorities to drop a criminal investigation into a theatre director.A  penned by Thomas Ostermeier, the director of Schaub邦hne theatre in Berlin, and the playwright Marius von Mayenburg calls on Moscow＊s public prosecutor to drop ※flimsy§ and ※politically motivated§ charges against  over allegations of embezzling government funds.※The impression that Serebrennikov＊s arrest is sending to the west is of a government scared of criticism,§ Ostermeier said. ※And if you can＊t stand criticism, that＊s usually a sign of weakness.§The petition has been signed by the actors Cate Blanchett and Nina Hoss, director Simon McBurney, artist Sophie Calle, novelist Elfriede Jelinek and playwrights David Harrower and , among others.The Russian arts world has also rallied behind the director, with dozens of leading actors and directors calling for the charges to be dropped, or at least for Serebrennikov to be released on bail.Serebrennikov＊s supporters have included figures who are usually apolitical or loyal to the Russian authorities. Even Vladimir Putin＊s cultural adviser, Nikolai Tolstoy, called the arrest a ※shameful episode§.However, Russia＊s conservative culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, has denied any political subtext to the arrest: ※This was not a political order. It also has nothing to do with Serebrennikov＊s art. There are some people who like it and there are a very large number of people who don＊t, but nobody here is targeting him as an artist,§ he said in an interview with Russian channel NTV.Moscow＊s state prosecutor accuses Serebrennikov, 47, of having embezzled the equivalent of more than $1.1m (?850,000) of government funds between 2011 and 2014. Serebrennikov＊s supporters say the trial is being used as a political tool to silence a director whose productions have openly criticised political conditions in .※The allegations fit the usual pattern by which unwanted artists are brought to a fall in Russia 每 not by censorship but under the pretext of easily spun charges of financial misconduct,§ said Ostermeier, who has known and worked with Serebrennikov for more than 15 years.The director has described the case against him and his former colleagues as ※absurd and schizophrenic§, and insisted all the government money had been spent on theatre productions. In one Facebook post, he referred to a production of A Midsummer Night＊s Dream, which was performed more than 15 times and nominated for awards. ※Now the investigators tell us that it doesn＊t exist and never did,§ he wrote.Serebrennikov is under house arrest until 19 October, during which he must wear an ankle tag, is not allowed to use the internet and is only permitted to see close family members. On 22 October he was due to direct a production of Hansel and Gretel at Stuttgart State Opera. The theatre said the production would go ahead in spite of the trial, thanks to a team the Russian director would send over to Germany.																																											"
"It is tempting to wonder if there has ever been a superhero team more mishandled on the big screen than the . On the face of it, Marvel＊s awesome foursome are less frumpy and pass谷 than , more recognisable to the general public than ＃ say ＃ , and have a collective backstory that＊s almost as absurdly cosmic as the . Yet somehow all of the above are thriving in multiplexes, while Reed Richards and co are an enduring Hollywood disappointment. If blame is to be laid anywhere, it should probably be placed at the door of 20th Century Fox, the studio that bought the big screen rights to Fantastic Four way back in the 1990s, and has held onto them ever since despite all available evidence suggesting that it hasn＊t got a clue what to do with the superhero team. In fact, the history of the franchise points to one knee-jerk decision after another, a pattern that shows no sign of letting up if  are to be believed. that the new version of Fantastic Four will be a kid-centric movie similar in tone to Pixar＊s  and focused on Franklin and Valeria, the children of Reed Richards (Mister Fantastic) and Susan Storm. The other two members of the Four, Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) and Ben Grimm (The Thing), will be featured but not in central roles. The blog＊s latest suggestion is that the new project might be based on Mark Millar＊s unpublished Kindergarten Heroes comic, about a gang of toddler superheroes, which Fox optioned in 2013. Of course, there is absolutely nothing wrong with identifying a market for comic book stories aimed at the very young. We live in an era in which parents taking their kids to see a movie about Captain America and Iron Man are likely to have to shield their little ones＊ peepers during the excruciating scene , or the denouement in which . Meanwhile, , The Incredibles and  have proven that there is a place for meta-tastic animated superhero flicks that appeal to all ages.The problem here is not the idea of Kindergarten Heroes coming to the big screen, it＊s that Fox reportedly want to bundle up its rights to  as part of the package. Apart from being contemptuous of Marvel＊s longest running superhero team, the idea of focusing a movie on their offspring 每 even if a tale centred on the preposterously powerful Franklin Richards is tantalising 每 ignores the fact that the studio has yet to get the original quartet right on the big screen.The duo of noughties movies 每  and  每 which starred Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards and Jessica Alba as Sue Storm, are best remembered for their TV-movie quality and the dull interplay between its four main heroes. Perhaps Fox decided those films＊ failure to pick up critical traction resulted from the safety-first approach adopted by director Tim Story, because it then appointed up-and-coming film-maker Josh Trank () to oversee a dark and gritty reboot. Unfortunately, the result, 2015＊s  (also known as Fant4stic) is now remembered as one of the most infamous box office turkeys of the decade, with Trank even disowning the film prior to its opening.In the wake of this repeated maladministration, there is only one obvious way forward for the Fantastic Four to establish their rightful place among the highest plinths of the big screen comic book pantheon, and that is for the quartet to be absorbed into the Marvel Cinematic Universe 每  after the relative mediocrity of the wallcrawler＊s last few Sony movies. The parallels are obvious: audiences would no more pay to see another film in which the Fantastic Four gain mysterious powers after a trip into space than they would have parted with their hard-earned cash for yet another Spidey origin story featuring the death of Uncle Ben and Peter Parker beating up Flash Thompson. Bringing the webslinger into the MCU avoided the need to bore us with a slightly shifted version of the same old origins story, and it＊s not hard to imagine a similar trick working for Richards and team.Instead, Fox seem determined to go an entirely different route, one that would conveniently allow the studio to keep full control of the property it bought the rights to all those years ago. Yet the concept goes against all received thinking in this arena, which is that spin-offs work best when the original property being bounced off is so popular that there is genuine demand for more stories set in the same universe. The Fantastic Four certainly doesn＊t fall into this category. In Hollywood terms, it＊s as if someone decided to make a spin-off to  centred on the character played by Julia Roberts.By skipping a generation, Fox would essentially be giving up on ever making the definitive Fantastic Four movie that fans have been waiting for since . Evidence suggests this will really not be a Fantastic Four film, but rather a movie tagged to the Fantastic Four brand for commercial reasons. And that, surely, will represent the studio finally admitting that it simply does not know what to do with these storied comic book titans.																																											"

"ot long ago, most of us had never heard of Kate McLennan and Kate McCartney; now we can barely imagine Australian comedy without them. The two Kates are best known as , in which they mock assemble a range of dodgy dishes 每 from paleo bone-water to placenta-based lasagne (plasagne).Now, McLennan and McCartney ditch the orange aprons and expand to a full-length, half hour TV format in the uproariously entertaining Get Krack!n, face-planting into the milieu of early morning breakfast television programs. In this case,  early morning. The titular show-within-a-show kicks off at 3am, an hour usually reserved 每 as McLennan puts it 每 ※for pissing with your eyes closed§.Good comedy is difficult to learn and harder to teach: sometimes it＊s simply a matter of opening a door in an awkward way, as the two butterfingered hosts do very well when they step onto their Ikea showroom-looking set. They address the cameras 每 McLennan with a Cheshire grin, McCartney a half-arsed smirk 每 to explain that the following 30 minutes will take them out of the kitchen and into other areas of the house. Because ※we don＊t just not know about food, we not know about everything§.The core joke runs twofold: 1) that they not know how to host a breakfast TV program, and 2) that it is unreasonably early, meaning everybody is prone to make mistakes or at least be off their A-game. This manifests in various ways 每 from the hosts＊ frazzled, capricious behaviour, to the many typos that appear in captions and a news ticker at the bottom of the screen. An early sketch has McLennan and McCartney working familiar material, preparing to slow cook the ※dude food§ that is pulled pork.The satire arrives in full swing in the second half of episode one (the first two form the extent of this review) when the Kates begin taking potshots at the wellness industry 每 a subject  from the Guardian＊s own Brigid Delaney. When resident ※health krackspert§ Dr Mariam Margoylesles (played note-perfectly by Candy Bowers) arrives on the couch to explain, with accompanying ※verified medical footage§, how turmeric can cure depression, cancer, autism and in fact every ailment known to humankind, I was laughing so hard my eyes started watering.Get Krack!n retools some of the editing and aesthetic techniques deployed in The Katering Show. A sudden, unexpected cut, for example, abandons a person mid-sentence, their mouth presumably still moving somewhere off-frame. This is how Katering＊s  began, and how the first episode of Krack!n (involving an amusing cameo from Sam Neill) concludes.There are regular swipes at the patriarchy, and sarcasm-steeped unpacking of male abuse culture. In a beyond-gallows-humour segment in episode two, a newsreader rattles off the day＊s headlines: ※In the news, a woman was shot in the face by a man. Another woman was killed by a man. In other news, a woman has been murdered. A woman has been stabbed. A woman has been thrown off a bridge whilst being stabbed.§The revolving-guests nature of breakfast TV means any type of character can be airdropped in at any time 每 thus endless potential for sudden lurches in tempo, from outrageous physical comedy to pointy, caustic humour. In one sketch, an Asian beauty expert opens up to the two Kates about her deep-seated insecurities, ※borne of funny insults like ＆wake up Jeff!＊§Working this kind of laugh-as-your-stomach-turns comedy is dangerous turf for anybody, but the two Kates pull it off marvellously: flippant delivery with a burning aftertaste. Credit also to the director Hayden Guppy, taking a major step up from his previous outing 每 last year＊s sapless milk-and-water sex-ed doco, .Get Krack!n is a show of 每 and for 每 the times. Even the smallest casting decisions (including live crosses lasting only a few seconds) have been surveyed through the lens of diversity and cast accordingly, though not necessarily predictably. Thus the appearance of A.B. Original＊s Adam Briggs as the supposed ※weather girl§. There＊s also the style of the women themselves: a cosmopolitan, middle-class, feminist shtick, without the flaky hucksterism of a Kath & Kim or the class-oriented burlesque. They constantly mock privilege, with a clear understanding that they＊re pissing from inside the tent.The new series also has currency in this era of budget cuts at Aunty, and conversation around content quotas for local programming in the age of streaming service providers. The intimation being that if cards aren＊t played in the right way, on either of these fronts, we may get more and more content that means less and less 每 like Get Krack!n.The show within the show, that is 每 not McLennan and McCartney＊s hysterically funny new series. As far as that is concerned: more, please. A thousand times more. 																																											"
"As season seven of  has worn on, it has become a commonplace to note that the show＊s hitherto subtle manoeuvres have been replaced with something more abrupt. Principals are brought together with clanging expedience; deaths that would once have been show-stopping, or at least episode-ending, instead simply herald an ad break; time flies, and so do ravens, at such speed and with such internet-era reliability that I keep expecting someone to set up an out-of-castle auto-bird before they hit the road. The story is getting bigger, yes. But it is not at all clear that it is getting better.In feature-length finale The Dragon and the Wolf that tendency reached its apotheosis. At Westeros＊ version of the Yalta conference in King＊s Landing, we were allowed the deep satisfaction of seeing Cersei and Daenerys meet, and the pleasure of a dizzying number of smaller reunions on the sidelines 每 Bronn and Podrick, Bronn and Tyrion, Theon and Euron, Jaime and Brienne, Brienne and the Hound, and the Hound and the Mountain. I＊m probably forgetting tons. These little, dopamine-providing pairings, each slightly recalling the witless fancy-that of  or a moderately successful pop act getting back together, mostly feel like they bring resolutions rather than new possibilities. And most of the conversations they entail are expository synonyms for, ＆so, we meet again＊. Still, it＊s hard to complain: there is a lot of ground to be cleared before this story comes to an end, and I would prefer Pod and his gonzo mentor to have the chance for a quick pint than not.What about Cersei, though? The queen might be mad, but she＊s surely not a moron. One important feature of Machiavellianism is that sometimes the expedient thing also happens to be the right thing; unhinged dictators tend to retain their grip on the logic of self-preservation, a lesson that this show has relentlessly hammered home. And yet here she is, the mother of (dead) Lannisters, even as she caresses her pregnant belly and shows an otherworldly awareness of the dangers of fetal alcohol syndrome, concluding that she would rather stick one on her enemies than survive. Family First, that＊s Cersei＊s motto 每 except when the risk to her family is posed by an army of the dead who would turn her last and unborn child into an infant zombie.And so, instead of heading north, she will enlist the support of the show＊s own mercenaries and masters of the universe at the Iron Bank to bankroll her bonkers betrayal. For me, this decision was the moment that Game Of Thrones stretched disbelief past all possible suspension 每 and yet, here I still am, perplexingly enthralled; here, if you are reading this, you still are, too. We are invested now, and there is no backing out. Like the Iron Bank＊s real world analogues, something deeply unhealthy but oddly sustaining has happened to this story: it has become too big to fail.This isn＊t even anyone＊s fault, really. It＊s mostly a symptom of vaulting ambition, and Game Of Thrones still goes wrong better than most TV shows succeed. And so we must prop it up, and take our returns where we can get them. When another pair of poster-children for incest consummate what looks like being a tragic love, or when a dead dragon spectacularly brings down the border wall (if it gets rebuilt, will Jon declare that he intends to make the White Walkers pay for it?), the merits of the show＊s sweeping grandeur reassert themselves. As the first snows fall in the south, and those icy bastards trudge towards Winterfell, I cannot claim that I am willing to toss it all away 每 or that I don＊t still love it. But as it stands, I fear that the last series will stand not as the multiplication of the story＊s greatness, but its echo.																																											"
"he second Bourne film, the fourth Hunger Games movie, an indie flick about a teen assassin and one of the highest-grossing instalments in the Marvel cinematic universe. If that were the IMDb page of an actor, you would think they were on their way to the big time. But the CV in question belongs not to a person, but a tunnel in Berlin.Since doubling as the exterior of a Moscow airport in 2004＊s , the distinctive orange-tiled walls and pillars of the Messedamm underpass have been seen in Joe Wright＊s  in 2011, 2015＊s , last year＊s  and Charlize Theron spy thriller , released earlier this month.These are no fleeting cameos, either. The underpass is the scene of the lengthy fight between Eric Bana＊s Erik Heller and four CIA agents in Hanna, while it bookends Katniss and her fellow rebels＊ sewer escape from Panem in Mockingjay 每 Part 2. Black Panther＊s breathless chase of Bucky, Falcon and Captain America takes place in the tunnel (although this time it was doubling for Budapest, Hungary), culminating in their arrest on the exact same spot, in the tunnel＊s open-air section, where Charlize Theron＊s Lorraine is also dragged from the wreckage of a crashed car in Atomic Blonde.Markus Bensch is the location manager for Berlin-based Studio Babelsberg. If the Messedamm underpass appears in a film, it is because he suggested it.※I always warn directors that it has been in these films, but they like the location and they are not dissuaded,§ he says. ※It makes it look as if we only have two locations here in Berlin; the underpass and .§Often, he says, when he shows a location such as the underpass to a director, the script is rewritten to accommodate it. The fight scene in Hanna, for example, was adjusted to use the underpass, while the film＊s showdown ending was altered so it could be shot in the creepy abandoned amusement park Bensch found.Messedamm underpass may well be the most-widely used non-landmark location in film, run close only by Berlin＊s Kraftwerk Mitte, a former power station-turned-nightclub also used in The Hunger Games 每 it is the scene of Katniss＊s archery training.But filming locations have a shelf life. Things already seem as if they are slowing down, although only last month the second series of , a US series starring Richard Armitage, shot there, suggesting we haven＊t seen the last of those orange walls just yet.※Locations such as these have a busy spell and then no one will film there for four or five years,§ says Bensch. ※It＊s the same with cities as a whole. Some places are just in fashion and then they are left alone until the industry decides to go there all over again.§Anyone planning to use the tunnel, however, will have to seek permission from its current occupiers. The underpass sits beneath the Internationales Congress Centrum, an aluminium-skinned former conference centre, home to 600 refugees since December 2015.The spot of Captain America＊s arrest and Atomic Blonde＊s car crash? That is now used by the refugees as a basketball court.																																											"
" couldn＊t deal with it at all. I said things like, if you want to starve yourself, starve yourself! I just thought it was a fad, a stupid lifestyle thing, a teenager being crass. I never for a moment thought it was a mental illness.§So journalist and news presenter Mark Austin explained his reaction to his daughter Maddy＊s descent into anorexia nervosa, a condition that nearly killed her. It was one of several moments of brutal honesty in last night＊s  (Channel 4), in which the Austin family used their story as the basis for a programme that sought to dispel the misapprehensions under which Mark had laboured, and to argue for better NHS treatment for sufferers of the disease.And what a disease; what suffering. Maddy, a keen runner specialising in the 800m, fell victim to it under the pressure of trialling for county and national races and applying for university. ※It all got too much ＃ I suppose I didn＊t have another way of showing that I wasn＊t OK.§ She was diagnosed in December 2012, by which time she had become very withdrawn and was having ※horrible thoughts. I genuinely felt my family and friends would be better off without me.§※I was,§ says her mother Catherine, an A&E doctor helpless in the face of a non-physical illness, ※just losing her.§Maddy and Mark travel to Nottingham to meet Rachel, whose daughter Naomi (not her real name) has been hospitalised five times since she was diagnosed two years ago. She is currently in a private facility paid for by the NHS in Edinburgh. Rachel makes the 600-mile round trip to see her as often as she can, and cries all the way to the airport on the way home. ※One time ＃ I willed the taxi to crash. But I＊ve got to pull myself together because I＊ve got two other daughters.§Naomi can＊t be in a hospital or under outpatient care nearer home 每 as she and her family long for her to be and which would surely aid her recovery 每 because there simply aren＊t the facilities there. Because there isn＊t the money. Because. Maybe because there isn＊t enough money for anything. Maybe because Mark＊s old belief that starving yourself is an affectation that shouldn＊t be indulged runs deep among those who allocate beds and funding for these things. Maybe because anorexia is a (primarily) privileged, (primarily) female thing?Whatever the reason or reasons, it ended in tragedy for the Stafford family. They moved from Leicester to Norfolk with their anorexic daughter Lydia and discovered there was nothing like the support she had been getting back home. After the overstretched mental health crisis team spoke to her on the phone instead of making their scheduled visit, Lydia killed herself. Four years on, her grieving mother is now anorexic herself.Enter the lesser-spotted secretary of state for health Jeremy Hunt. Why is treatment such a lottery, asks Mark. Where is the revolution in treatment for under-18s, that three years ago the government promised a ?150m injection of cash would produce? And is he aware that according to research by eating disorder charity Beat, 70% of the commissioning groups that have control of this non-ringfenced sum are spending some or all of it on other things, including, in at least one case, an IT system?Hunt blinked and swallowed increasingly drily. His eyes darted about seeking an exit that didn＊t materialise. It was never a promise they could fix things overnight, apparently. They wanted to be able to make the promise to do better. Gasp. Croak.In the meantime, our young people turn their misery in on themselves and, with nothing else to eat, choke on it.Everything about (BBC2) 每 the music, the slow-motion footage, the schmaltzy tone of the film-maker＊s voice as she narrated events or interviewed her subjects 每 suggested we were supposed to find this story of nonagenarian runners unbearably moving and uplifting in equal parts. Perhaps because of this, or perhaps because I found the main subject, 97-year-old sprinter Charles Eugster, nowhere near as charming as Selah Hennessy seemed to, I did not. Rather than drilling down into the runners＊ motivations, the film seemed too content to treat them like a version of Doctor Johnson＊s dog, simply pointing a camera at ancient frames coming down the track and marvelling not that it was done well but done at all. It may be true, but it doesn＊t make for a riveting hour. Jog on.																																											"

"ew shows are seemingly more exclusive than this.  plays the great Dane in a  production designed to .Since it runs for three weeks in a 160-seat auditorium and , you might expect it to have an air of chi-chi privilege. Yet the first performance had none of the air-kissing ballyhoo one associates with first nights. If anything, the occasion was remarkable for the traditionalism of Branagh＊s production, the romanticism of Hiddleston＊s Hamlet and the rapt concentration of the audience.Hiddleston, as we know from past performances, is an accomplished Shakespearean actor. His  was marked by a reckless impetuosity and his  by a quiet grace. Both elements are present in this modern-dress Hamlet. But, if I had to pick out Hiddleston＊s key quality, it would be his ability to combine a sweet sadness with an incandescent fury. He suggests a fierce intellect gnawed by intense melancholy and yet subject to bouts of intemperate rage.The grief is there from the start. The first thing we see in this production is Hiddleston＊s Hamlet sitting at a piano and softly singing to himself ※And will he not come again?§: the refrain that Ophelia later applies to her dead dad here becomes Hamlet＊s lament for his own father. Emotion is never far from the surface in this performance. When Polonius takes his leave of Hamlet and the prince says there＊s nothing he＊d more willingly part with ※except my life§, Hiddleston＊s sardonic jest turns into a well of unstoppable tears.It is not, however, a sentimental performance. You notice the self-obsession in this Hamlet who constantly emphasises the first person singular. There is also a genuine fury which he seems to have inherited from his father. Hiddleston bangs tables and pummels cushions in rage at his failure to achieve revenge. And when he does finally think he has accomplished the task, by thrusting a dagger through a door that seems to conceal Claudius, Hiddleston leaps about on an ecstatic high only to learn he has murdered the wrong man. There is a genuine danger to this Hamlet as well as a delicacy of soul.If I dub Branagh＊s production ※traditional§, it is because it ultimately gives us a vision of Hamlet as a man likely, had he been put on, ※to have proved most royal§. But the production, played by a cast of 10, has its quirky features. James Cotterill＊s design, with its white sofas and tall windows, stresses the domestic rather than the political aspect of the play. Sean Foley plays Polonius less as a crafty statesman than as a conscious joker who hands out a packet of contraceptives to his departing son.Hamlet＊s stalwart friend also here becomes Horatia but, although the role is excellently played by Caroline Martin, I started to wonder if their spiritual closeness implied sexual intimacy.Branagh, who has himself played Hamlet many times and also directed it for the movies, clearly understands the play inside out and gets a range of subtle performances. One of the best comes from Nicholas Farrell, whose Claudius starts as a wholly plausible, persuasive head of state and then slowly reveals his moral turpitude: I loved the moment when he inquired, in astonishment, ※From Hamlet?§ as letters arrived from his supposedly murdered nephew. Kathryn Wilder is a striking Ophelia forcing people at gunpoint into mourning her dead father. And Ansu Kabia plays a sonorous Ghost, a rhetorical Player King and a rapping gravedigger with equal aplomb.In one way, it is sad that this production will be seen by so few people. But its purpose is to raise money in a good cause rather than to embellish reputations. And, even if it rarely shocks one into new awareness, it has clarity, swiftness and, in the person of Hiddleston, a compelling Hamlet with a genuine nobility of soul.

"ollywood film-making is all about big bets, and somewhere along the way, enough reasonable people convinced themselves that a period drama full of corsets, ruffs and tavern wenches set against the 17th-century Dutch tulip market was going to be a hit. But now that Justin Chadwick＊s much-delayed adaptation of Deborah Moggach＊s novel has finally been released, we must look to the words Alicia Vikander＊s love-and-economics-struck Sophia Sandvoort says during her darkest moment: ※The fever has broken.§Tulip Fever isn＊t a disaster. The first half is actually fairly decent, occasionally threatening to be good. It follows Vikander＊s Sophia from her life in a convent to her loveless marriage with the benign dope and peppercorn magnate Cornelis (Christoph Waltz). All Cornelis wants in life is a son and heir, and the montage of the Sandvoorts＊ attempts at conception rivals The Right Stuff＊s collage of failed rocket launches. As melancholy consolation, Cornelis hires a local artist (a future Dutch master?) to paint a dual portrait, so there will be at least some legacy.In the book, I＊m sure there are smoldering passages that express how Sophia and the artist Jan Van Loos instantly fall in love, but since Jan is played by Dane DeHaan, who has all the vitality of a bowl of oatmeal left in the rain, we have to take this on faith.While Sophia and Jan are making eyes at one another, something is blossoming in the taverns of Amsterdam. Tulipomania is rattling the coffers of commoners and wealthy alike, creating history＊s first great futures exchange and (spoiler alert?) devastating bubble economies. Along for the ride are the Sandvoorts＊ vivacious maid, Maria (Holliday Grainger), and her fishmonger lover, William (Jack O＊Connell), who hopes to grow his fortunes.The setting is all very interesting (and the art direction looks nice) but at about the halfway mark, the potential quickly shrivels. Sophia visits Jan in his artist＊s garret holding some tulips, ostensibly for him to scrutinize for their portrait. But just as she crosses the threshold, the petals open up. Everybody got that?Tulip Fever＊s second half is a harvest of stupidity, with mistaken identities, overheard conversations, characters conveniently swept away by circumstance and  as a combination prostitute/commodities trader who shouts ※see ye later in the tavern!§ as she drips out of her dress. It＊s as if three full seasons of Days of Our Lives were shipped to the Netherlands and crammed into 45 minutes. Complications arise when Maria finds herself in the family way, but Sophia and Jan concoct a ludicrous plan that could, potentially, make everyone＊s dreams come true.We aren＊t always privy to a film＊s backstage drama ahead of the fact, but even if Tulip Fever weren＊t one of the more notorious delayed movies of recent years it would still be quite evident that this was recut into oblivion. After Jan tries to steal tulip bulbs from Sophia＊s old nunnery, he approaches the abbess (a pipe-smoking gardening and finance whiz played by Judi Dench) and says: ※I＊d like to a get a foot in the tulip business.§ Five minutes later, this libertine painter is sighing: ※If only I were liquid!§ Soon thereafter, two characters try to calm Sophia, telling her: ※You＊re in our house.§ We＊ve never seen them before.  shows up and rides a donkey.There are, indeed, some sparks in this movie. The Vikander/DeHaan romance is a dud no matter how well it＊s lit, but the ※downstairs§ passion between Grainger and O＊Connell has a degree of realism and eroticism. Eigil Bryld＊s cinematography is crisp and colorful. And Christoph Waltz＊s not-quite villain is a very unique and tender performance. Catch these moments as they bloom, though, because the whole thing quickly dries out.																																											"
"wo non-fiction books about death impressed the critics this month. Robert McCrum＊s  is ※proof, yet again, that death makes for lively reading§, wrote  in the Spectator; ※witty, companionable and compulsively readable ＃ [bringing] evidence that however bleak, however short the time left, it is never too late to be surprised by joy§. The Sunday Times＊s  admitted that it ※might sound pretty dismal, but McCrum＊s investigative spirit takes hold of the narrative and keeps pathos at bay ＃ this is a brave book§, and even (like McCrum, a stroke survivor), who ※worried that [the book] might be unremittingly bleak§, was ※encouraged and fortified§ in the Mail on Sunday. In the New Statesman, found it a ※beautifully contemplative account of what it means to be dying, as we all are, in the midst of life ＃ There is not a single story that he tells, no matter how grave, that is not made joyous by the fine attention of his writing and its judicious and intelligent use of quotation and literary and scientific material.§Reviewers were equally moved by Maggie O＊Farrell＊s , a memoir of her 17 brushes with death 每 from childhood illness to an encounter with a murderer on a remote hilltop. ※Each chapter is an accomplished piece of memoir-writing in its own right. The cumulative effect is extraordinary and I felt my understanding of what it means to be a human and a mother grew,§ wrote  in the Times. ※Where other writers may be playing with paper, O＊Farrell takes up a bow and arrow and aims at the human heart.§ It was ※ingenious and original ＃ a rich celebration of every breath O＊Farrell＊s taken§, according to  in the Independent and ※extraordinary ＃ uncomfortable and compelling 每 a page-turner ＃ fluent, poised and packed with colourful details§ according to  in the Observer. In the Irish Times,  hailed it as ※electric ＃ [it] should be read by everyone working with sick children ＃ By stripping herself of the storytelling apparatus of her novels 每 or perhaps by applying that storytelling apparatus directly to her life 每 O＊Farrell has arrived at something more affecting: wise, terrifying, vital and important.§＊s ninth collection, , did not disappoint. The Observer＊s  praised his ※considerable facility for voice§ while the Daily Mail＊s  enjoyed the characters＊ ※interior dialogues, recited in a brilliantly realised Scottish vernacular§. ※Some of them are bleak, but not all; there are some moments of joy,§ wrote the Scotsman＊s . ※Kelman has always been a true and honest writer, which is why he is one of the fairly few who really matter.§ In the Irish Independent, the collection＊s darkness was a strength. ※These little nuggets are more like philosophical essays about what it means to be alive. Or, seen from another angle, what it means to be on a slow road to death,§ wrote . ※Kelman＊s vision of the world is bleak 每 but redemption is forthcoming ＃ Uncompromising in vision, and yet strangely adaptable in style and content, Kelman＊s harsh tales of dirty realism have sympathy for how suffering is a central component of the human condition. This collection shows a writer who is still at the top of his game, brimming with creativity, vitality and artistic integrity.§																																											"
"t was around 2am and I was asleep, in London, the first time Michael Jackson called me. He told me how much he admired my film  and asked if it would be possible for me to direct a music video in which he could ※turn into a monster.§ I explained to him that London was eight hours ahead of LA. I said I would call him when I got back to LA in a couple of weeks. Then I went back to sleep.We spoke on the phone four or five times before I returned to California. Michael told me he wanted me to make a music video for the song , and that in the video he wanted to go through the same kind of transformation from a two-legged man into a four-legged beast that was in An American Werewolf in London. 每 who won the first-ever Academy Award for best makeup for An American Werewolf in London 每 and I showed Michael movie books filled with photographs of monsters. We soon discovered that he hadn＊t seen many horror movies. He found most of the pictures ※too scary§. We came to the conclusion that if Michael was going to dance, it would be a hell of a lot easier for his monster to have two legs instead of four. I was adamant that whatever he was going to turn into, he couldn＊t be too hideous or unattractive. Scary 每 yes; creepy 每 yes; but NOT ugly. I ultimately suggested that Michael turn into a Wolfman like the one in . Hence the 1950s setting in Thriller＊s ※movie within the movie§.＊Rick eventually came up with his elegant ※WereCat§ design for Michael＊s monster. It was Michael＊s suggestion that we include zombies.I hoped that Michael would go along with my plan to make a proper two-reeler (a cinema-release short) and not just a ※needle-drop§ rock video. He loved the idea of making Thriller a real motion picture event that could play in cinemas all over the world. So we created a budget that reflected our ambitious production, much bigger than anything spent on a music video before. The problem was Michael＊s record company had no interest in another video from the Thriller album. The album had been No 1 for more than a year and the company thought it had peaked. Michael put me on the phone to the president of CBS Records, , and I had never heard such profanity at such volume. Michael asked, ※What did Walter say?§ I told him ※Walter said ＆no＊.§Mike volunteered to pay for the film himself, but we decided to make a 45-minute making-of film that 每 added to Thriller＊s 15-minute running time 每 meant we had an hour of film we could sell to television and so finance our production. This was an elegant concept 每 except no television network wanted it. To them, Thriller was last year＊s news. Even MTV, which had had great success with Billie Jean and Beat It, the first two videos from Thriller, turned us down. (MTV never had to pay for videos because they were considered by record companies to be marketing costs.) But Showtime, then a new pay cable channel, agreed to pay half the budget, and MTV suddenly changed its mind, justifying the expenditure as a ※motion picture§, not a video.We were ready to make our movie. I asked my wife, , to design the costumes. She created that red leather jacket for Michael to wear. It became as iconic as the leather jacket she had earlier designed for Indiana Jones. Michael brought in choreographer Michael Peters, with whom he had worked on Beat It; people are still dancing to the moves the two Michaels created for Thriller. The making-of film 每 directed by 每 documented just what a brilliant performer Michael was, and we added what material we could: an 8mm home movie of young Michael dancing, which was found in a closet at his parent＊s house, footage from the Ed Sullivan Show, and Michael＊s legendary performance at the Motown 25th anniversary special. Watching The Making of Thriller now, after three decades, one thing is clear: Michael looks so happy.The earth-shattering success of Michael Jackson＊s Thriller was a surprise to everyone but Michael. My memories of him are naturally shaded by his tragic end. But I recall the Michael I collaborated with in 1983, and that Michael was joyous, hard-working, relaxed and determined to do his best. And Michael＊s best was truly fantastic. The restored version of Thriller and The Making of Thriller has its world premiere at the  on 3 September.																																											"
"n a week where up increasingly seems like down and purple is apparently orange (with Prince＊s sister having made an incendiary claim ), there is something reassuring about the sight of a crushed hard drive. To be more specific, the sight of a hard drive once housed in Terry Pratchett＊s computer, and thought to contain up to 10 unfinished novels, being, in accordance with the late author＊s wishes. We were left with the author＊s final, perhaps greatest, creative statement: that there should be no room in this world for substandard art.With news of ITV＊s autumn schedule dropping on the same day, it feels like a waste of a good six-and-a-half tonne steamroller for such destruction to be restricted to the creative works of the deceased. Efforts may be wasted on attempts to eradicate season 76 of The X Factor: it feels as if this curiously resilient singing contest will outlast us all, the only hint of human life 1,000 years from now consisting of a defibrillated painter-decorator singing Maroon 5 in a bombed-out conference room for the benefit of an animatronic approximation of Nicole Scherzinger. But could  每 ※Eight 21st-century lads are to be transported back to the Roman empire to see if they can cut it as gladiators§ 每 provide a good test subject?In the name of managed expectations, please understand that  has not spent its Love Island ad revenue perfecting the art of time travel. This show is pretend. It＊s also, necessarily, presented with tongue in cheek. This primetime ※modern geezers in the time of Caesar§ romp was described by executive producer Ben Kelly using the following words: ※The Romans gave us roads, viaducts and basic sanitation but Bromans may prove to be their greatest legacy.§Fair enough, but let us turn this on its head: let＊s mix it with Pratchett＊s own greatest legacy, and tune in on launch night to watch TV executives competing to prevent the destruction of tapes containing Bromans＊ first series. Then we will see how much they really believe in what they＊re selling.																																											"

"n 2010, LCD Soundsystem were in the process of booking a tour in support of their third album, . It was to ; evidence of how the band＊s career had unexpectedly flourished. Five years on from their debut album, their fusion of dance music, electronic and post-punk, combined with acerbic lyrics, had turned them into one of the US＊s most acclaimed and influential bands. They had been garlanded with critical praise, and were recipients of multiple Grammy nominations and album-of-the-year awards. They were authors of All My Friends, a song that frontman James Murphy claims to have felt ※embarrassed by, I thought it was too poppy, almost cloying§, but which .Not an inconsiderable achievement, especially if you believe Murphy＊s line that he only began making music in his own right because his relationship with the , the band he was producing, had collapsed, leaving him with nothing to do. He says he was so mortified by the thought of getting on to a stage and singing that it took ※a bottle of whisky to do a show§. ※Singing＊s my nightmare,§ he says, blithely. ※I was a singing guitar player as a kid and I found it really embarrassing, so I stopped singing and became a drummer. I mean, who does that? I don＊t want to be the singing guitar player who writes all the music 每 I want to play drums and become an engineer.§But, despite all the band＊s achievements, the gig＊s promoter didn＊t think that they could fill out Madison Square Garden, and suggested they get a big-name support band in to boost ticket sales: ※They were like: ＆Well, we＊re concerned that it＊s a big room.＊ So I went, ＆Fuck it, it＊s our last show. We＊re not selling out.＊ I＊ve always thought there＊s a lot of power in being flippant if you＊re willing to carry it through. It＊s like, if two people have guns pointing at each other and the first person doesn＊t care if they live or die, the other one should put the gun down.§Some have interpreted this story as LCD Soundsystem announcing they were splitting up purely in order to sell tickets to a big show, but Murphy says, flippant or not, the more he thought about it, the more ending the band made sense. For one thing, he had been predicting their demise from the start: their debut single Losing My Edge, written when Murphy was 32, was about feeling too old to be involved in music; even when the band took off, he . He was also 每 literally 每 sick of touring. ※I was probably sick seven months of every year, with bronchial infections, sinus infections, stuff I＊d caught on a plane ＃ [I was a] germ factory, low on sleep, probably hungover, taking antibiotics that were like battlefield drugs ＃ like: ＆I don＊t know if he＊s going to get gangrene and lose the lower half of his body, let＊s just give him this because we don＊t have an operating table here,＊ drugs. I was just like a fucking joke. My wife said: ＆You＊re just going to die, I don＊t even know why I married you.＊§As a former punk from suburban New Jersey, who had sought advice from the notoriously anti-corporate producer and musician Steve Albini when setting up his first studio, Murphy was uncomfortable with something about the way LCD Soundsystem＊s career was heading. ※We were set up, especially in America, to make a similar record to our last one, and just be way bigger. And that made me deeply sad. It just kind of sickened me. It＊s playing a game, like pro wrestling. You know who＊s going to win. And I felt as if I would have to fuck up, make a record that＊s like 每 ＆Fuck you, everybody＊ 每 which is so artificial when artists do that, when they forcefully destroy themselves. So it seemed like the most beautiful and honest thing to do was to just not do it.§And so,  ended with what Murphy describes as ※a perfect swan-dive§: the Madison Square Garden show spawned both a documentary, Shut Up and Play the Hits, and a three-hour, five-CD live album. Murphy was free to indulge himself in a bewildering panoply of other interests. He acted in, and directed, films. He opened a wine bar and drove New York＊s transit authority to distraction by endlessly petitioning them to change the sound made by the city＊s subway turnstiles to ※a beautiful electronic symphony§: ※We＊ve heard from him and have told him many times we cannot do it,§ said a weary-sounding official in 2015. With Soulwax, he launched Despacio, a mobile DJ sound system that certainly offers testament to Murphy＊s fabled obsession with sound quality, if not his financial acumen. The system is so big that transporting it from venue to venue is ※like moving an army§. The costs involved means it loses money every time they use it. ※I also got gout,§ he adds, saying he now handles the condition by not drinking spirits or beer and ※not drinking any wine that＊s not natural§.There was just one problem with all of this, gout notwithstanding. Murphy started writing music again. Worse, it ※sounded like LCD Soundsystem§, which obviously presented a dilemma. ※The options were: the music I＊m making just won＊t be released, which seemed really arbitrary, weird and forced; I＊m going to have a new pseudonym, a fake, also just absurd; or I＊m going to make a solo record, which means I couldn＊t play with my friends who were in LCD if I was going to play live.§ He laughs. ※Which would make me feel like Sting, or something: ＆I don＊t want to play with Stewart and Andy any more, so I＊ve got to play jazz.＊ It all felt so shit.§He (Murphy was supposed to be working on Bowie＊s final album, Blackstar, of which more later). Bowie told him if the idea of reuniting the band made him uncomfortable, then he should do it because being uncomfortable would make him work hard. ※I didn＊t imagine David Bowie ever felt uncomfortable,§ he shrugs. ※Because, of course, I＊m thinking that David Bowie＊s experience of being David Bowie is the same as I would imagine myself having, which would be: ＆Fuck everybody else, I＊m David fucking Bowie.＊ But that wasn＊t his experience at all. He was David Jones, and he＊d done nothing but make himself uncomfortable for his entire career.§Bowie＊s advice seemed to settle it, which explains why Murphy is currently tucking into a plate of upmarket bacon and eggs outside an upmarket east London restaurant and talking about LCD Soundsystem＊s fourth studio album, American Dream, of which he is justifiably proud. ※I knew we were going to have to be significantly better than we ever were, for anyone to say we were even half as good as we used to be,§ he says. ※The only advantage we had is that there are no photos of us all skinny and unstoppable and handsome 每 we were always middle-aged.§Murphy is affable and endearingly geeky company. By his own admission, there are certain topics, including recording equipment and organic wine, that it＊s best not to bring up in interviews because once he starts talking about them, he finds it difficult to stop. But it＊s hard to avoid the feeling that an intriguing mass of contradictions bubble just below the surface. He says he＊s no longer conflicted about LCD＊s return 每 ※my wife thinks it＊s OK, the other band members think it＊s OK, Bowie thought it was OK, so fuck everybody!§ 每 but he is clearly bothered by the negative reactions of some fans. ※I underestimated how upset people who really liked the band would be,§ he nods. ※I was someone who grew up obsessed with bands, how they were and how they treated one another, and how they treated fans. You know, it mattered to me when Lol Tolhurst left the Cure. I was heartbroken. They＊re the people I＊ve always aimed the band at, and they＊re the ones who were hurt, some of them. , that they really identified with it. So I was sorry. I felt sad about that.§He says he is no longer beset by the kind of fears about irrelevance that fuelled Losing My Edge 每 ※I kept saying, ＆I＊ll do it until I feel like it＊s embarrassing to do,＊ but it＊s not embarrassing to do. I play festivals. We are not an embarrassment§ 每 but you can＊t help noticing that the subject of age keeps cropping up in American Dream＊s lyrics: ※This is what＊s happening and it＊s freaking you out,§ he barks at one point, ※I＊ve heard it 每 it sounds like the 90s.§※Well, it＊s not going to become less of a theme because I＊m not going to miraculously somehow get younger, and the world is not going to fetishise youth less ＃ but I don＊t feel old because I＊m not trying to make grime, I＊m not making trap music. There are scenes that are interesting, but they＊re so removed from me culturally that I don＊t feel, ＆Uh-oh.＊§He says he loved Lizzy Goodman＊s oral history of the 00s New York music scene, Meet Me in the Bathroom, kissing his fingers like a chef tasting a particularly sumptuous meal when its name is mentioned 每 which comes as something of a surprise. The book features a lovely description of Murphy＊s MDMA-fuelled Damascene conversion from uptight indie rocker to dance-music fan in a Manhattan club. (※I watched his life completely change in that moment,§ says DJ and producer David Holmes, ※and it was beautiful.§) But elsewhere it doesn＊t offer the most flattering portrayal of him. At one juncture, a former associate describes him flatly as ※a complete cunt§: if no one else goes that far, a lot of interviewees seem keen to suggest that behind Murphy＊s exterior (it seems to be a legal requirement for every journalist who meets him to describe him as cuddly or resembling a teddy bear) lurks a difficult, calculating control freak. Well, he shrugs, they＊re probably right. ※I have a very toxic combination of being completely determined, inflexible, controlling and being totally shy, guilty at hurting anyone＊s feelings, hypersensitive to other people＊s needs, and it＊s just paralysing.§That was the problem with working on Blackstar, he says. He originally contacted Bowie, whom he had met while working with Arcade Fire, with the idea of making an album ※with just the two of us in a room, together§, but by then Bowie＊s sessions with Tony Visconti and Donny McCaslin＊s jazz combo were under way. He went along, but couldn＊t work out what to do. ※I feel like I＊d possibly been brought in to play some kind of Brian Eno role and that is so far from what I am. Eno is, I think, open, manipulative and confident. I＊m shy and self-directed and controlling. I have to micromanage.§In the end, after playing percussion on one track and suggesting a chord change on another, he quietly slipped away. ※I thought, well, I just had a moment where there＊s this Bowie song and I suggested the chord change.

"he first time I saw , it was on television with his partner . This was in the late 40s when TV was just beginning 每 the medium was new and so were Martin and Lewis. We were used to comedy ※teams§ such as , the straight man who fed the lines to the comedian, which grew out of vaudeville. Martin and Lewis took it all to another level. Martin himself was funny, and he was also smooth, romantic, and he sang. They got into a groove and Lewis would take off into pure anarchy. Pretty soon, they were stars of the big screen as well 每 they started in the My Friend Irma pictures and then they became the main attraction: 14 pictures beginning with  in 1950 and ending with  in 1956. And at some point in the early 50s 每 I don＊t recall the year 每 I saw them live at the Paramount theatre in New York. and  were directed by Frank Tashlin, who had come out of Leon Schlesinger＊s legendary animation unit at Warner Brothers and developed a new kind of movie comedy in the 50s. His pictures were as visually inventive as Schlesinger＊s  and just as liberating, because absolutely everything was fair game. After Martin and Lewis split 每 we didn＊t really know why at the time 每 Tashlin directed most of Lewis＊s first solo pictures, from  in 1958 to  in 1963.In 1960, Lewis did something interesting 每 he started directing his own pictures, with , in which he played an attendant at a Miami hotel who doesn＊t say a word until the end of the picture. In order to get a sense of himself in the frame of his own picture, he used a very early version of what has become a standard tool of directing: the .In 1971, Lewis published a book called . The title seems absolutely right to me. When you watch  or  or my favourite, , you＊re watching the work of someone who is using every single aesthetic element of the cinema, sometimes to the point of making film?making itself into a gag. Lewis definitely learned a lot from Tashlin, but as a director I think he was temperamentally closer to the French director/performer . In fact, the amazing ※dollhouse§ set for the women＊s boarding house in , which took up two soundstages at Paramount, reminds me of the elaborate airport set for Tati＊s . Both pictures stretch the possibilities of time, space, sound and colour to their limits, well beyond what we were used to seeing in most comedies. In certain sequences from , you feel like you＊re deep within the mind of Lewis＊s character, a caretaker at the boarding house 每 for instance, the amazing moment when he  to find a bat lady hanging from a ceiling, who backs him into a wall that gives way to a gleaming white set against a painted blue sky, where Harry James and his orchestra suddenly materialise.In the early 80s, I got the chance to work with Jerry on . By that time, he had become a legend in movies and on the late night television talk show circuit, which was a world unto itself 每 one that I loved and that I was paying homage to in the picture. It was a world in which professionals such as  and  and regular guests like  and Jerry used all of their performing skills, the sense of timing and rhythm that they＊d honed throughout the years to the finest point, to create a feeling of relaxation and intimacy with their audiences. We were looking at the other side of the equation, namely the people in the audience who took the intimacy literally, and the very thin line between love and hatred that could develop when they learned that it was all just a beautiful illusion. I remember Jerry telling us many stories about his own experiences, one of which we incorporated into the picture.Jerry Langford was an uncomfortable role for him to play, because he was skirting the edges of his own life in absolutely every scene. Sometimes it went beyond that: he was wearing his own clothes, he was playing scenes where he was often expressing his own feelings about showbusiness and celebrity, and at times you didn＊t know if you were seeing Jerry Langford or . And through it all he was, needless to say, a consummate professional. It was a remarkable and moving experience to watch him at work, improvising with Bob De Niro and the other actors and with his old friend Freddie de Cordova 每 I felt like I was watching a virtuoso pianist at the keyboard. And he knew his way around live television so well that I asked him to direct some of the actual on-air sequences for The Jerry Langford Show.I started out in movies in the late 60s, working independently, and I initially thought of making movies as something that you did with friends, the people you always knew were going to be there no matter what 每 that was the spirit I＊d grown accustomed to. I＊d made some big-scale pictures and I＊d worked with many actors and artists you could call ※professional§, but I still felt like I didn＊t belong to the world of Hollywood movie-making. When we started , we were shooting at night, which is always difficult, and we were finding our way in. And there were delays. We had scheduled Jerry to come in, but then we hadn＊t reached his scenes, so he was basically sitting in his trailer and waiting for us to be ready for him. On the third night, he asked to see me in his trailer. I sat down, he looked me in the eye, and he spoke very quietly but firmly. ※Look, I＊m a professional,§ he said. ※So when you tell me to be here at 9pm, I＊m going to be here. You＊re paying for my time. All I ask is if you find that by two o＊clock in the morning you＊re not going to need me, just let me know.§ I already had a great deal of respect for Jerry, but at that moment it deepened. It was a moment of clarity for me, because it helped me to realise that you could work with people who weren＊t friends, people who came from different worlds who perceived the work differently. Jerry taught me that being a professional was a serious matter.We got to be good friends, and we saw each other fairly often over the years. A couple of years ago, we did a . He had been through some serious health problems but he was still coming out, still out there 每 the consummate professional. Someone asked him what he thought was the most important thing he＊d learned in all of his years at work. ※If I＊m working on a picture and I＊m not enjoying it, then I know there＊s something wrong.§ It surprised me that he responded that way at his age. It sounds very simple, but it＊s absolutely essential. Making a movie is tough work. It can be punishing. So you need to enjoy it, every aspect of it. The good and the bad. You need to have that personal connection.The last time I saw Jerry was at a New York Friars Club event. He was wearing that red blazer, he was 91 years old, and he was still out there. He had, by that time, surpassed legendary status. He had become something like an immortal. It sounds corny, but it＊s true. We planned to get together after that, but the last time he was supposed to visit I was told ahead of time that he wasn＊t going to be making it. Jerry was cancelling a gig, and that＊s how I knew that the end had really come. As I said, he was a true professional who took the greatest pride in his work, whether it was making a movie or doing an interview or hosting a gathering. Seeing him and listening to him was always a source of renewal for me. And in my memory, it always will be.																																											"
"The UK＊s first interfaith charity shop is opening in the most unlikely of locations: the Selfridges department store on Oxford Street in .The pop-up shop, opening on Thursday, is curated by the filmmaker, artist and author  for Artangel, which is known for staging bold and inventive art in unusual places.Despite its upmarket location, it will be like any other charity shop, full of donated secondhand goods available at low prices. July also chose to make it the UK＊s first interfaith charity shop, working mainly with Islamic Relief but also with the Jewish charity Norwood, the London Buddhist Centre and the Spitalfields Crypt Trust.For July, who grew up in California and lives in LA, the project is a celebration of charity shops in the UK. ※Every faith, every disability, every cause has a charity shop and that just doesn＊t exist anywhere else in the world,§ she said. ※There＊s something that feels very hopeful about them.§During her wanderings down London high streets over the years, July had always been struck by the religious tolerance these shops represented. ※Islamic Relief stuck out to me because that just would not exist in the US,§ she said. ※Besides the fact there isn＊t the same Muslim population, it would just be seen as too scary.§July had been thinking about the project before Donald Trump instigated his travel ban in the US, prohibiting people from six Muslim-majority countries from entering. But the ban made her confront the way Muslims, and even the word Islam, are treated in America. Yet concerns that she did not have ※the right§ to bring religion, and interfaith cooperation, into the  project led July to consult religious leaders from a variety of faiths. She said: ※I actually talked to a scholar of Islam, and he told me that if you have to be an expert on something to defend it, then that just ruins the whole point of it.§The shop is as much a curated art piece as a functioning retail venue and it has July＊s distinctive style, with the offbeat and sometimes bizarre tone that infuses her films and books.July is known for setting up the feminist film archive Joanie 4 Jackie, so it is perhaps unsurprising that all the books and films sold in the charity shop will be written or made only by women. Only ※really blingy or really practical§ shoes will be allowed and only certain types of pleats. Clothes for premature babies and useful items such as children＊s winter coats will be in abundance. July said she was interested in the impact of bursting the Selfridges bubble of luxury, with a blouse priced at ?3 just metres away from one selling for ?3,000.The Artangel project has been five years in the works and came together as July finished writing her new film, which she will make next year. Unlike her two previous feature films 每 Me and You and Everyone We Know (2005) and The Future (2011) 每 she will only direct and not star in it. The film will focus on two women, one in her 20s and the other in her 60s.July said there was something very appealing about people encountering the charity shop without thinking it a precious piece of art, inaccessible and untouchable. ※What＊s nice is that it is inherently participatory. You apply your taste, you choose things, sometimes you take off all your clothes and put on strangers＊ clothes in this case, and there＊s a transaction when you buy something,§ July said. ※So that＊s seductive, because it means all different kinds of people feel comfortable.§																																											"
"What an episode. I might have been a bit up and down about some of the creative decisions this season, but they largely paid off for this supersized, expertly paced and deeply satisfying finale, which allowed every storyline the time it needed to breathe while still providing the ultimate spectacle of The Wall falling to the Night King and his ice dragon. Almost more important than even that cataclysmic moment was the confirmation that viewers have long been waiting for: Jon Snow＊s real name is Aegon Targaryen and, given that Robert＊s rebellion was, as Bran pointed out, based on a lie, he＊s also the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. It remains to be seen both how his newly acquired Aunty Daenerys feels about that (although of course the Targaryens have always prided themselves on their close family relationships), and whether by the end of the series there will actually be an Iron Throne to sit on. The relationship between dragon and wolf, both past and present, might have been at the heart of this episode, but its emotional heft came from the way it probed a number of different relationships, some of which 每 such as Brienne＊s anguished cry of ※fuck loyalty§ managed to do a great deal of emotional work in a small amount of time. In comparison to last week＊s episode, where a number of the conversations felt forced and carelessly written, tonight was full of moments of genuine power, from Jon＊s brief chat with Theon 每 ※You＊re a Greyjoy and a Stark§ 每 to Jaime＊s bleak realisation that his sister had lied one final, devastating time, promising help that she had no intention of giving, and agreeing to a meeting with Daenerys and her followers that was never more than a hollow farce, given that the Golden Company were already paid for and Euron in on the plot. Best of all though was Cersei＊s meeting with Tyrion: a tense confrontation layered over with past lies and bitter regrets, and beautifully acted by Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey. He admitted that he mourned the deaths of her younger children, even as she could not quite bring herself to have her little brother struck once and for all from her path. Cersei＊s inability to rid herself of either of her troublesome brothers might have struck some as slightly unbelievable (this is, after all, the woman Tyrion described as ※the most murderous in Westeros§). But on the other hand, Jaime is her twin, part of her and the father of her children 每 and when it came to it she was never going to bring herself to give the order for his death. As for Tyrion, it served her better perhaps to lie to him, to make him think that he＊d finally won a point against her and gained her support even as she knew that the opposite was true. But I also think he too remains her brother, however much despised. The episode＊s other great confrontation came at Winterfell, where it transpired that Sansa, Arya and Bran had also been plotting (I knew there was more to that meeting at the Weirwood Tree than we were told). Littlefinger, snared in a trap of his own making, died crawling and begging for his life in another very well-handled scene, which culminated in Arya, the executioner to her sister＊s ruler, slitting his throat with the very dagger that started all the trouble back in season one. But the real joy came afterwards, as Sansa and Arya looked over the snowy ramparts of Winterfell and made common cause. They might not have always been the best of friends or closest of sisters 每 they might still have issues festering from that childhood that was so abruptly sundered 每 but after all the bloodshed and suffering and betrayal and loss, they are family. And as Sansa noted, if the Starks know anything it＊s that the pack survives.That comment served to highlight the major recurring theme of this episode: family. Jon, who considers himself a Stark, is also a Targaryen, and the words he uttered to Theon may yet come back to haunt him. Daenerys, who has no family, believes she has found a soulmate in Jon 每 but his being family makes this a more complicated journey than she understands. Theon, after seasons of despair and suffering, was finally able to turn his loss into an advantage, winning a brutal fight thanks to his ability to withstand pain, and a literal lack of balls. Yet his real strength came from his determination to save the sister who had never given up on him. Meanwhile, even as the Starks stuck together, the Lannisters fell apart 每 and the lingering shot of Jaime standing alone as the snow drifted down suggests that Cersei＊s decision will have serious repercussions for her brothers as well. One Wight displayed, and then summarily chopped to bits. One brutal beating of Theon Greyjoy ending in a surprise victory for Theon. The deserved death of Lord Petyr Baelish, who finally ran out of people to lie to; and the destruction of The Wall by the Night King and his forces, possibly resulting in the deaths of any one unfortunate enough to be at East Watch. The coming together of the dragon and the wolf on a gently swaying and candlelit boat. A moment which sadly seems likely to be forever sullied by Sam＊s news about Jon＊s parentage, which he and Bran, rather queasily for the audience, discussed just as the deed was occurring. Oh Sam, there＊s cock blocking and then there＊s cock blocking (as I＊m sure either Bronn or Tormund would point out). So, farewell then Lord Littlefinger of the wandering accent. Of late your accent didn＊t really wander at all, but your time had still come. Aidan Gillen meanwhile heads to Peaky Blinders, where I look forward to seeing him try and plot against Tommy Shelby. 																																											"
"ollowing excellent solo projects, Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland return to their duo Hype Williams, whose cut-up dub songcraft has been one of the most compelling voices in the European underground this decade. Or do they?  says they＊re no longer involved, but the pair are known for their inveterate fibbing. Either way, there＊s none of Blunt＊s deadpan chat and only a couple of (possibly Copeland-delivered) female vocals, a shame as some of the tracks are pleasingly punchdrunk trip-hop instrumentals that cry out for a top line, however meandering.You could imagine ,  or even Kanye West doing their most freewheeling work over something like Leimert. But the pair＊s samples are arresting, lurching into tracks like a drunken houseguest, whether it＊s a phone call about a shady boyfriend or bleak lines recited from Jim Cartwright＊s play Road 每 the result is a fugged, fractious collage. As ever, the most beautiful moments are often the most fleeting, such as Sweet Chin Musik, 30 seconds of synths straining as if through a frost-rimed window.

"＊m as lucky as the moon, on a starry night in June,§ sings Sundf?r on her album＊s acoustic opener. It＊s a misleadingly cutesy start. After 2015＊s disco-infused prog record , the Norwegian songwriter and producer is having her  moment. Inspired by travels around varied political and social landscapes, from North Korea to the Amazon rainforest, there are trickling water sounds, wiry bleeps and animal peeps throughout. Sundf?r is startlingly back-to-basics at times 每 there are even schmaltzy ballad tones 每 but frequently her straightforward songs derail brilliantly.The sombre Good Luck Bad Luck is like an Adele song, if Adele sung about oil spills to the sound of smoky, late-night jazz. Music for People in Trouble is an art installation-like interlude, while folk song The Sound of War declares that ※chaos remains§ and ends with a moody, cinematic soundscape. Another triumph for Sundf?r, who delivers complex, maudlin subjects with lightness and majesty.																																											"
"ho?n Dale-Jones＊s greengrocer father was a devotee of Margaret Thatcher and believed in taking responsibility for yourself. His paternal grandmother, Phyllis, believed in community, and fell out with her son over politics. They are now buried side by side in the local graveyard. Dale-Jones grew up torn between the two and was obsessed by the BBC series . So at the age of 10 he decided to rob the local bank.Forty years on, he is still wondering about the inequalities in our society. When we hear statistics such as the fact that there are , we are also outraged for a moment, before we go back to what we were doing. Dale-Jones links our feelings of helplessness to something bigger: we have bought into the narrative of capitalism that keeps us in thrall to the interests of the banks and big business.He talks about seeing his name and image on a poster outside a theatre, something he had always longed for, only to feel dissatisfied. Maybe it＊s the same kind of dissatisfaction that keeps those who earn more than ?100,000 . So Dale-Jones made a piece of art and protested outside a bank with a placard, asking people whether they wanted to join him in robbing the bank. He got arrested for civil disobedience.Or did he? It doesn＊t really matter whether he did or he didn＊t 每 or whether the 10-year-old Dale-Jones did try to be a miniature Robin Hood. After all, the Robin Hood story is itself a myth. This a storytelling show that teasingly plays with fact and fiction as its suggests that we all have the agency to change our own narrative. It＊s not quite as smartly crafted as Dale-Jones＊ last piece, , which cleverly explored what we really value, but it is engaging and thoughtful as it gnaws away at inequality of opportunities and the widening gap between rich and poor, and asks whether art really can change the world.

"ess an action movie, more a direct breach of the Geneva conventions,  is a wannabe Bond knock-off with water on the brain.  stars as John Stratton, member of an elite band of commandos called the Special Boat Service. Their skills involve causing international incidents, exchanging casual banter while wearing wetsuits and holding their breath for a really long time.The acting is chiselled and stubbly 每 most of the characters look as if they are more interested in launching their own range of personal grooming products than in the weapon of mass uninterest that is the plot. Two performances stand out:  is utterly bizarre as a salty sea dog who lives on a Thames barge and quotes limericks and Connie Nielsen is staggeringly bad as Stratton＊s boss. She sounds like a drunk person trying to do a posh accent to get out of being breathalysed. A career low.																																											"

"eath is a whisper in the Anglo-Saxon world,§ writes  in . ※We don＊t want to see the sick, smell the decay of wizened flesh, feel the coldness of the corpse, or hear the cry of keening women. We don＊t want to intrude on the dying because we don＊t want to look at the mirror of our own death. Why have we lost our way with?death?§That question echoes through what is a long meditation on death, dying and our attitudes to mortality 每 our own and others＊. As its perhaps extravagant title suggests, it is also a celebration of the traditional Irish way of mourning the dead 每 the three-day wake with open coffin, a constant stream of reverent visitors, and endless cups of tea and triangular sandwiches.Toolis, an Irishman who has lived and worked in London for most of his adult life, contrasts this often transformative ritual with what he sees as the sense of collective denial that marks the Anglo-Saxon way of death. To the outsider, it does indeed often seem that the English regard death as another one of life＊s myriad inconveniences, something to be dealt with as efficiently and with as little fuss as possible. Unless, of course it concerns a pet.Toolis is angry about this cold-shouldering of death. For him, death has tended to be up close and personal. He worked for a time as a foreign correspondent on the frontline of various conflicts. In a chapter called ※Fragments§, he recalls the dead he encountered in famine-ridden Sudan, at an Aids hospital in Malawi, and among the many instances of human ※collateral damage§ that  residents have endured from Israeli bombardments. It was there, exploring a half-demolished house, that he had a brutal epiphany of sorts about his trade, and about himself. He came upon what he thought was ※a bundle of rags in grey dust§, but which turned out to be the body of a child. ※I felt ashamed, a ghoulish voyeur. Exposed. What could I offer in return for this death? A few words or paragraphs printed.§ Brooding on the plane home, he came to another realisation: ※that the fragments of things that I saw and experienced could never teach me how to live with death in my own ordinary life§.That ordinary life, though, is marked by death also, as every ordinary life is sooner or later. The book begins in the family house in Dookinella, County Mayo, as his father approaches death: ※I was standing in the same whitewashed room where my mother, Mary Gallagher, had given birth to my brother, standing too among the watchers and where Sonny now lay dying.§ Having been summoned from London, he finds himself both an insider and an outsider?每 ※struggling to understand what the watchers see or wanted in Sonny＊s death§. This is the exile＊s dilemma in extremis: the sense of not?belonging accompanied by the sudden, deep realisation of what has?been lost along the way, without even realising it.Another chapter, perhaps the most deeply affecting, concerns his older brother Bernard＊s death from leukaemia. During Bernard＊s treatment, Toolis became his brother＊s bone marrow donor, his potential saviour. ※Except,§ he writes, ※it did not happen that way.§ He describes his brother＊s death as ※a hand grenade of rage and grief and love that went off, blasting outwards, everyone falling back, pushing us away from each other. A wound.§These more intensely personal encounters with death and the tidal pull of capsizing grief are the moments that resonated most with me, not least because they bring home the state of utter incredulity 每 and unpreparedness 每 that a death unleashes in those close to the deceased.In , Joan Didion described the sense of unreality that attended the sudden death of her husband: ※There was a level on which I believed that what had happened remained reversible.§ With that, too, came an anger of which she had never known herself capable. Didion＊s rage was directed at a society that had left her utterly unprepared for the great unmooring that is grief, and Toolis, too, has written a broadside?against that collective denial.?But his book is much more than that. In its alternating shifts of focus, from the intimately personal to the more journalistically detached 每 if the word really applies here 每 it lays bare the desperate numbness that accompanies that denial. In its place, Toolis posits an acceptance of the inevitable which, while it does not banish the pain of grief, invests it?with?a resignation and a grace that is, in essence, healing and somehow life-affirming.His final chapter, ※How to Love, Live and Die§, is a prescription for facing death: attend a wake, he advises the uninitiated, ※take your kids along too if you can§. Be with the dead, he counsels; look on them, speak to them,?touch them, take your time to say?farewell to them.These are words wrought from hard-won experience, yet I suspect they will fall on deaf ears in a culture geared ever more towards a kind of frantic collective escapism in the face of age as well as mortality. Time and time again, while reading I was reminded of ＊s great poem, Funeral Rites, which opens:I shouldered a kind of manhoodstepping in to lift the coffinsof dead relations. They had been laid outin tainted rooms,their eyelids glistening,their dough-white handsshackled in rosary beads.As Toolis helps lower his father＊s coffin into the ground, he writes of his own coming-to-terms with death: ※I know what I had missed in failing to bind the wound of Bernard＊s death and in all my death-wandering worlds. The only way to take the weight of my own mortality was through offering to take the weight of others＊.§? by Kevin Toolis is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson (?16.99).

"e have much to thank Annie the Ant for. Leafing through her first novel (written at the age of six or seven),  noted drily 每 with Atwood, it is always drily 每 that the beginning of her story about Annie＊s journey from egg to ant was very boring. ※But I learned something about the art of narrative. Which is not to make it so boring at the beginning.§Before she even hit double figures, the daughter of an entomologist and a housewife was already at the larval stage of what would become a 70-year (and counting) writing career that has granted her every literary prize and critical accolade under the sun and gifted the world a 每 so far, so gloriously 每 endless stream of dense, subtle, allusive, brilliant, visionary and always addictively readable books.Last night, the career and the books were limned and lauded in an edition of  produced and presented as ever by Alan Yentob. In  (BBC1) there was, alas, precious little of the woman herself. It was a fine primer for the rest. We heard about her homeschooled childhood in the backwoods of Canada, the sudden change to a city high school, the strangeness of which 每 to young ※Peggy Nature§, as she was known at summer camp 每 would later form the basis of Cat＊s Eye (※Lord of the Flies for girls§) and her rise as a poet, novelist and critic.This happened first in Canada, where she was instrumental in establishing and describing her country＊s national literary identity, and then, with the publication of bestsellers such as The Handmaid＊s Tale, around the world. This book, of course, is having a particular moment in the cultural sun, with  resonating particularly well 每 if that＊s the word 每 in the Trumpocene era. ※She always understood the way power can go wrong,§ noted fellow novelist . ※She checks the power structure in everything she writes.§ ※Having been born in 1939,§ said Atwood, after footage of the president＊s early speeches, ※I never believe it can＊t happen here.§But there was little that a viewer keen enough on Atwood to settle down in front of an hour-long documentary about her wouldn＊t have already known. There were tantalising clips from old interviews and the 1984 film , by Michael Rubbo (which is available in its entirety on YouTube should you wish to see Atwood talking at length about herself and her individual books), which showcased her keen, searching intelligence, as well as much long quotation from her books, poems and essays 每 all apposite, but feeling a lot like padding with so little contemporary interview material.Still, there were great moments, such as when she explained that she never intended or claimed to be a feminist writer. When she began to describe the world around her in her writing, she became popular with the movement because ※the women in my novels suffer, because most of the women I talk to seem to have suffered§. It is this sense of organic development in an Atwood novel, rather than of writing to or within the imposed constraints of an external ideology, to which, I hazard, we devotees most respond. But we have the books. In a documentary, it＊s more of her we need.Channel 5＊s  was both more fascinating than any programme about four people locked in four featureless portable buildings for five days and less histrionic than any stunt-based documentary by Channel 5 had any right to be. It really was simple. Three volunteers 每 Lloyd, Charmayne, Lucie 每 and presenter George Lamb were shorn of their phones, watches and any other communicative connection to the outside world, put in solitary confinement, and told they could press the big red button by the door if they reached a point where they couldn＊t stand their own company any more.Charmayne lasted four and a half hours, and was replaced by Sarah, who was soon literally sick with anxiety and borderline hallucinatory by the end, and George had to come out after 23 hours. The rest made it, but only Lucie thrived on it, using the time to reflect on a bad year and decide what the future should hold. It didn＊t dig deep, but it stayed sober and didn＊t obscure the process or the conclusions with extraneous nonsense. It was about, as Sarah 每 in the neatest summary of anything, anywhere so far this year 每 put it in their debriefing interviews afterwards, ※how you choose to use your mind§. Social media addict Lloyd swore he would see his family more and ※not be the pig-ignorant idiot I was ＃ trying to keep an image up for complete strangers who won＊t give a damn how I feel.§ He answered his phone during the interview, but ＃ baby steps, Lloyd. Baby steps.																																											"
"he US is embroiled in the most intense examination of white supremacy for at least two generations. As the hand-wringing and hashtagging has ensued in the aftermath of the ※§ rally in , the death of counter-protester  and President Donald Trump＊s implicit validation of white supremacist and white nationalist groups, it is clear that the nation does not understand race, or more specifically anti-black racism any better than it did two generations ago.As corporate media pundits and elected officials have tried to pivot between righteous condemnation and a desire not to offend white people, the?moment has become yet another indictment of US education and what might be described as a wilful ignorance of American history. I can＊t say whether Ibram X Kendi＊s  will offend most white people (though I＊m willing to bet it will offend some), but he damn sure names white supremacy for what it is.Kendi, a professor of history and international relations at American University, Washington DC, subtitles his book ※the definitive history of racist ideas§, and while some might quibble with such a description, his research is exhaustive and his conclusions will surprise many. He structures his book around five historical guides, who are both usual and unusual suspects: 17th-century Puritan minister Cotton Mather, , 19th-century abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, author and activist WEB Du Bois and 1960s radical Angela Davis.The title of the book is drawn from a speech given in the US Senate in 1860 by Mississippi senator Jefferson Davis, who announced that the ※inequality of the white and black races§ was ※stamped from the beginning§. (In mid-August, a Jefferson Davis memorial was literally ※tarred and feathered§, with all the intended ironies, in Arizona.) Kendi＊s central project is an exploration of the racial disparities and inequities that have been, and are still, seemingly systemic in American life.Any accounting for such disparities within the racial state revolves around two fundamental though contentious questions, each identified with a different camp. The first is: what are ※the blacks§ doing wrong? The second is: what are ※we§ doing to ※the blacks§? Kendi identifies these two camps as ※segregationists§, those who have ※blamed Black people themselves for the racial disparities§; and ※assimilationists§, those who have argued that ※Black people  racial discrimination were to blame§.  also narrates how a third camp 每 anti-racists 每 has positioned itself against both. Segregationists attract the most criticism; the differently problematic assimilationists have usually managed to roll under the radar. ※So many prominent Americans,§ he writes, ※many of whom we celebrate for their progressive ideas and activism, many of whom had very good intentions, subscribed to assimilationist thinking that has also served up racist beliefs about Black inferiority.§Of these assimilationists 每 among them Abraham Lincoln 每 Kendi writes that we have remembered their ※glorious struggle against racial discrimination, and tucked away their inglorious partial blaming of inferior Black behaviour for racial disparities ... as such, assimilationists constantly encourage Black adoption of White cultural traits and/or physical ideals.§ Such was the case with Garrison, who was editor of the 19th-century abolitionist newspaper the Liberator and a founder of the American Anti-Slavery . Black subscribers ※were the early lifeblood§ of the Liberator, but Garrison shared a view with German journalist Henry Villard that ※nothing else could be expected ＃ from creatures who had been purposely kept in the conditions of brutes§.The complexity of these dynamics can be also discerned in the sentiments of President Theodore Roosevelt, who was for a time considered a ※friend of the Negro§. Kendi suggests that Roosevelt, in response to the increase in the number of anti-black lynchings in the first decade of the 20th century, believed that ※when Black criminality ceased, lynching would cease§. Black criminality would cease, he thought, ※through the buttressing of early Historically Black Colleges and Universities like Hampton and Tuskegee§. Roosevelt and his fellow ※Friends of the Negro§ probably would have been appalled at the ways that ※black criminality§ or rather ※civil disobedience§ would gestate on those very HBCU campuses and disrupt Jim Crow segregation.Readers might find that Kendi spends a little too much time with Mather 每 a noted witch whisperer 每 and his merry band of Puritans. But the author is interested in the ways that new technology 每 the printing press and a very old version of ※fake news§ 每 animated these Puritans＊ beliefs that ※the ＆providence of God＊ sent Africans into slavery and over to Christian America to have the capacity to learn from their masters§.What the Puritans most desired was order; and blackness refused at every turn. Kendi notes the multi-bind of race that was fundamental to the establishment of the republic, where the pursuit of black freedom was literally a criminal act: if blacks ※did not clamour for freedom, then their obedience showed they were naturally beasts of burden. If they nonviolently resisted enslavement, they were brutalised. If they killed for their freedom, they were barbaric murderers.§ Enslaved Africans were going to be civilised, even if it killed them; it very often did.There were Puritanical echoes in the rhetoric of President Richard Nixon in the late 1960s, as he confronted the growing rebellion of a black-led coalition of youth, activists, artists and conscientious objectors 每 embodied in  and the Black Panthers 每 with his mantra of returning ※law and order§ to the republic. As Kendi insinuates, Nixon was sounding mightily like Roosevelt, too, when he quipped to a crowd of 30,000 Texans that the supreme court had ※gone too far in strengthening the criminal forces§ 每 in other words, passing civil rights legislation.Nixon was faced with the same question that dogged both segregationists and assimilationists before him: what happens when the mission to ※civilise§ is no longer viable? One answer was prison. In two generations, mass incarceration went from being a conspiracy theory to a fact of US politics; its critics such as  and  have produced award-winning books and documentaries. And in that same period Davis went from being ※America＊s Most Wanted§ to being one of the principal voices contesting the emergence of the ※prison industrial complex§. closes as it should, with the era of Barack Obama. Kendi rightly suggests the limits of a black presidency when he writes: ※If anti-racist Blacks could vote for racist Democrats as the ＆lesser of two evils＊, then surely racist Whites could look at the Republican ticket and vote for Obama as the ＆lesser of two evils＊.§ Obama presided over new killing fields for black bodies, as race became a live issue once more 每 and over the largest expression of mass protest witnessed by young Americans since the apex of the black liberation struggles of the 1960s.In concluding, Kendi cautions that ※protesting against racist power§ is not enough: ※An anti-racist America can only be guaranteed if principled anti-racists are in power, and anti-racist policies become the law of the land.§ This book＊s ultimately hopeful analysis doesn＊t seem to hold sway at this moment, as the president, and much of the population, defends memorials that historians agree were put in place as symbols of white supremacy. But the struggle over these symbols might finally represent a slow recognition that something has changed, and perhaps it＊s now the white supremacists who need to be ※assimilated§ into an anti-racist future that is still beyond the nation＊s grasp.Mark Anthony Neal＊s  is published by NYU.  by Ibram X Kendi is published by Bodley Head.

"tory strands intertwine like vines in this engaging family drama about three siblings who inherit their family＊s winery in Burgundy. Jean (Pio Marma?) returns from Australia, leaving his wife, son and vineyard to visit the dying father whose influence he fled 10 years earlier. His sister, Juliette (Ana Girardot), now runs the wine business but as a woman she struggles to be taken seriously; the youngest brother, J谷r谷mie (Fran?ois Civil), is browbeaten by an overbearing father-in-law. Wine flows through the veins of all three; the episodic storytelling has something of the rambling, well-lubricated quality of a bar-room anecdote. Very watchable, but perhaps lacking in real drama, this is an easy-drinking vintage of a movie that won＊t challenge the palate of the audience.																																											"
"Still goes off every time. I don＊t think it＊ll ever get old: it has aged beautifully, like a fine wine.This is the sickest remix of anything anyone has done for a while. We never really do rewinds but if we did we＊d probably never get past this tune.This has just come out, so there＊s definitely a chance it＊ll happen.

So many of the words are different and it was really embarrassing.I＊d play this at any wedding. All-time classic.																																											"
"In 1943, a 12-year-old boy actor stunned Broadway audiences with his portrayal of a German youth indoctrinated into nazism. Brought to the US by an unsuspecting uncle, he soon threatens the family, then the whole community.The play was Tomorrow, the World!; the actor, Skip (then Skippy) Homeier, whom I admired from a young age, and who has died aged 86. In 1944, he revisited the role for the Hollywood film version. It would define much of his subsequent career, with villains and neurotics filling his early CV.Born George Vincent Homeier in Chicago, he was still a child when his parents, Ruth Francher and George Homeier, moved to New York. There, aged six, young Skippy began working in radio.In his 20s he lacked the boy next door appeal of a Tab Hunter, but shone in meaty character roles 每 the town bully in The Gunfighter (1950), the edgy marine in Halls of Montezuma (1951), the albino hitman of Cry Vengeance (1954)., in particular, became his stock in trade. Among them, Ten Wanted Men with Randolph Scott (1955); Stranger at My Door; Thunder Over Arizona; and The Burning Hills (all 1956); two more with Scott 每 The Tall T (1957) and Comanche Station (1960); and two with America＊s war hero Audie Murphy 每 Showdown (1960) and Bullet for a Badman (1964).By now a regular face on TV, Skip featured in hit shows including Wanted: Dead or Alive, The Virginian and Rawhide. In 1960, he took the lead in the detective series Dan Raven. Set on West Hollywood＊s Sunset Strip, the show was abandoned after 13 episodes owing to competition from the more famous 77 Sunset Strip and Rawhide, both playing on the same night.Unexpected cult status came, following roles in the original Star Trek series as the Nazi-like Melakon in Patterns of Force (1968), then the insane Dr Sevrin in The Way to Eden (1969). Another significant role was as Judge Charles Older in Helter Skelter, a 1976 TV movie about the Charles Manson murders.Later cinema films included The Greatest (1977), with Muhammad Ali, and Quell & Co (1982), after which Skip retired, aged only 50. For years Trekkies urged him to appear at conventions, but Skip declined all offers.I met him several times in 1956 when he was filming in London, and was impressed by his modest, friendly manner, so unlike the roles for which he was best known to film fans.His wife Della Sharman, whom he married in 1963, survives him, as do his two sons, Peter and Michael, from his marriage in 1951 to Nancy Van Noorden Field, which ended in divorce.

"t＊s not a book launch.§ Bill Drummond＊s first five words may come as no surprise to anyone who＊s followed his and Jimmy Cauty＊s inventively abstruse creative partnership since their 1987 appearance as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, the band who＊d later storm the charts as .For the purposes of writing , 2023, which is either impenetrable or terrible or both, they＊re now the JAMs again, sitting side by side in an independent Liverpool bookshop having arrived at midnight in a customised ice-cream van: a) blaring out the KLF＊s ; and b) with a coffin in the back. This comes ahead of Welcome to the Dark Ages, a ?100-a-head, 400-capacity three-day event drawing on themes from the book and the duo＊s 30-year history. They＊re rubber-stamping books instead of signing them, because of course they are.We look at each other for a split second. In a dismal feat of fansplaining I suggest that surely this is all, indeed, the launch of a book. ※This is not a book launch, OK?§  cheerily reiterates. ※All right? It＊s not!§ I ask what we＊re all doing here; Bill executes a sarcastically elaborate shrug.  barely looks up from his rubber-stamping, but clarifies: ※It＊s a book launch.§The following morning I bump into Jimmy outside the Dead Perch Lounge, the event＊s base over the next three days. He seems genuinely chuffed at the hysteria surrounding last night＊s ※boyband arrival§. This has all been 23 years in the making, he adds, ※but in terms of driving up and down to , it＊s taken about nine months. That planning was actually the event for me; this is just the aftermath.§ I ask if there will be any mild peril over the coming days. ※I＊m actually worried about whether there will be enough.§Attendees are called in turn and assigned roles, as the event starts to take shape. There will be gravediggers and people nominated as strong swimmers; some of us are told we＊ll need to sign waiver forms. Many roles (like mine 每 stealing a traffic cone) are ※teetering on the edge of legality§. Other attendees are inducted into a band called Badger Kull, an imaginary group whose assigned super-fans are instructed are to make fanzines, post endlessly on social media, moan about Badger Kull selling out then get excited when the band announce a comeback. Later I meet ticket holder Vicky Pearson, who went straight from the role assignment to a tattoo parlour and now has a Badger Kull tattoo on her wrist. She wasn＊t even assigned super-fan role. ※I＊ve got a family party on Saturday,§ she notes. ※It will be difficult to explain. I＊m sure they＊ll smile, nod and support my choices.§Smiling, nodding and supporting choices forms part of Wednesday night＊s main event: a hearing based on roughly the 140th most interesting thing Drummond and Cauty ever did: . Tonight marks the end of a self-imposed 23-year moratorium on discussing their motivation. Suggestions are put forward by five guest speakers 每 artist  kicks it off with some chat about neolithic ancient rites, while economist  describes the act as ※quantitative tightening§. The most persuasive argument is put forward by the band＊s PR Mick Houghton. ※They were both having breakdowns,§ he says. ※They wanted to eclipse their history.§In a shambolic voting session, the audience decides it was all down to ※a deep historical tradition of weirdness§. Cauty and Drummond appear on stage in order to face this verdict but one heckle leads to unplanned discussion on whether they＊ll destroy their ice-cream van (Cauty: ※We＊re not blowing it up, we＊ve only just had it MOT＊d§) and when asked for their response to the vote they seem lost for words. ※Whatever,§ Cauty announces. ※I don＊t know what to say,§ Drummond adds. ※Just say ＆whatever＊,§ Cauty advises him. ※Whatever,§ Drummond says.They leave the stage to cheers 〞 this is not exactly the world＊s toughest audience 〞 but one of the biggest cheers of the night had come earlier, when Deller attempted to contextualise the money burning＊s supposed artistic value. ※There＊s no greater artwork,§ he announced, ※than a great pop record.§We won＊t know for another two days whether Badger Kull can hope to substantiate that claim. But there＊s a ritual involving that coffin to get through first, and don＊t bet against at least one exploding ice-cream van.																																											"
"t＊s hard to pinpoint the best thing the BBC did on Twitter yesterday. On the one hand, they declared the humongously exciting return of the League of Gentlemen: back for three new episodes to mark 20 years since they made their debut as a radio show. But on the other, there＊s the tweet their press office sent to their counterparts at Dave. ※Hello @DaveChannel§, they said. ※Would you like to buy some pegs Dave?§From the very first TV episode of the League of Gentlemen, it was clear you were watching something utterly unique. Not only has the phrase: ※a local shop for local people§ gone down in the national consciousness as an impossibly perfect description of the grudging service offered in certain parts of small-town Britain. The accompanying moment where Mark Gatiss enquires about the price of the snowglobes, only to be met by a wailing, piggy-snouted Steve Pemberton screeching about ※the precious things!§ occurs five minutes into the show＊s debut. In less time than it takes to make a cup of tea, the League of Gentlemen had seared a catchphrase into the nation＊s psyche. Really, it shouldn＊t have worked. Sections of the show seemed intended to scare the audience out of their wits. As well as overt horror references 每 Edward and Tubbs lift dialogue straight from the Wicker Man, the local ice-cream van blares the bit of Mike Oldfield＊s Tubular Bells that＊s used in the Exorcist 每 their Christmas special appeared determined to send viewers to bed with nightmares. Their parting shot for leaving fans with a feeling of fuzzy yuletide cheer? The town＊s vicar having a flashback to being a small girl, weeping and wailing as she witnessed the kidnap of her mother 每 before Papa Lazarou violently abducts her. But it＊s the blend of the absurd and the brutal that carries it off. For all the knuckle-clenching discomfit of Papa Lazarou＊s appearance, it＊s the daftness of the fact he calls everyone ※Dave§ that renders him funny. Despite Tubbs and Edward murdering travellers in borderline demonic sex games, they have a pathetic air that makes them hard to despise. And lest we forget, it all takes place in a town named after Roy Chubby Brown. It＊s hard to think of another sitcom so phenomenally well acted, either. At one point, Pemberton, Shearsmith and Gatiss . The comedy comes entirely from the fact that their gigantic performances ramp up the tension until it＊s surely the most stately piece of dramatic interplay to ever feature the words ※Ginsters pasties§. So nuanced are Pemberton＊s performances as Job Centre worker Pauline that she goes from being a bullying, malevolent jobsworth to one of the most endearing characters via the sweet friendship she develops with the terminally dense Mickey. It sounds a weird thing to say of a show that＊s so batshit ludicrous, but it was a genuine, dramatic tour de force.And what a legacy it＊s had. Without the League of Gentlemen giving Gatiss a break, we may never have had Sherlock and the phenomenon of Cumberbatch. Without it making the leap from BBC sitcom to its own film, we may not have had the likes of the brilliant Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa (let＊s gloss over Mrs Brown＊s Boys D＊Movie). We may not have had Tom Hardy spending the whole of recent BBC series Taboo sounding so Papa Lazarou that he might be about to start selling pegs. And when it finally returns after a 15-year break, what next for the show? Anything it wants, frankly. Let＊s hope what it wants is to keep going and going.																																											"
"ome dodgy acting and iffy line-readings put a downer on this action thriller with a very topical slant. It＊s about a new civil war 每 with Texas leading a secessionist movement 每 heralded by an all-out invasion of Bushwick in Brooklyn, New York.Brittany Snow plays Lucy, a college student visiting her grandmother who is terrified to find herself in a war zone. There is only one person who can protect her: a huge combat veteran called Stupe (Dave Bautista), who has a painful backstory. There is something interestingly surreal about the  visuals created here in a quasi-continuous single take. But the political dimension of the movie is referred to very fleetingly, in just a few lines of dialogue. Other than that it is a standard-issue combat movie, with the arbitrary narrative device of an ※evacuation area§ that the principals need to reach. And sadly the acting and dialogue needed a little work.																																											"
"Adelaide＊s Orana was awarded restaurant of the year by Gourmet Traveller magazine on Wednesday night 每 the first time in 20 years that the coveted title has been won outside Sydney and Melbourne.Led by 41-year-old Glasgow-born owner and chef Jock Zonfrillo, the 10-table restaurant opened in 2013 and has become globally known for its dedication to native Australian ingredients and culture 每 expressed through both its menu and its non-profit organisation , which Zonfrillo describes as the ※backbone§ of the business. ※I wanted to make a change for Indigenous people and for their culture and for their standard of living and, to me, all I know is food,§ he told Guardian Australia.The restaurant sits above its , on Rundle Street in Adelaide. $175 will get you a degustation of about 18 dishes, which could include puffed kangaroo tendon, emu with mulberry and mountain pepper, crocodile consomm谷 or buffalo curd with fermented bunya nut and beetroot.Zonfrillo has travelled to, and spent time with, Indigenous communities around the country and was once described by the late restaurant critic AA Gill as ※the Mad Max of foraging§ 每 he lists sugar lerps, sweet and sour leaves and green ants among his favourite native ingredients.But he describes the Orana Foundation as his raison d＊那tre: a non-profit venture that works with Indigenous communities to preserve and promote Indigenous food and culture and share skills training and employment opportunities. ※I certainly didn＊t open Orana to become restaurant of the year or whatever,§ he said. ※It was more about starting the foundation. We couldn＊t start the foundation until we could actually display it 每 here＊s what it looks like, here＊s what it tastes like, here are the positive changes we can make through it.§Zonfrillo＊s passion was born from a chance meeting with an Indigenous busker in Circular Quay; the pair spent four hours talking about Indigenous food and culture. ※It was a conversation that changed my life. It changed me as a person and it changed the way I cook,§ he said from the stage. ※And his parting words to me were, ＆Whatever you do, give back more than you take＊ 每 and really that＊s been the backbone of everything that we do.§The foundation won a  in December and in June  to continue its work researching, cultivating and championing Indigenous food and its fair trade. They hope to use the money to build their current arsenal of 700 Indigenous Australian ingredients into an  of 1000. They also want to set up a research and development facility, to analyse the taste and nutritional content of ingredients, and hub of skills training and development to support Indigenous Australians.The Gourmet Traveller awards, the country＊s longest running restaurant prize, were held at Chin Chin Sydney 每 the Sydney iteration of the Melbourne Asian fusion eatery, which will open to the public in late September.

"Hundreds of people gathered in central Moscow to protest outside a courtroom as a prominent Russian theatre director was placed under house arrest before a fraud trial that his supporters say is politically motivated.Kirill Serebrennikov＊s lawyer argued on Wednesday that his client should be released on bail, but the judge ruled there was a risk he would seek to influence other witnesses or destroy evidence. ※I am an honest man,§ Serebrennikov, who denies the charges, told the court. ※I have nothing apart from  and work in Russian culture.§, amid accusations he embezzled 68m roubles (?900,000), sent shockwaves through Russia＊s artistic community and has raised fears of a crackdown on cultural freedoms. ※I am upset, angry and depressed,§ Irina Prokhorova, a prominent editor and publisher, told reporters after the judge＊s decision. ※This is reminiscent of the sad examples from our past. It＊s an obvious message to creative people and intellectual society: this is what will happen to everyone who does not submit.§ There were chaotic scenes earlier on Wednesday at Moscow＊s Basmanny court as journalists and Serebrennikov supporters tried to gain access to the hearing. Shouts of ※freedom§ and ※shame§ by protesters outside the building floated into the courtroom, making much of the proceedings inaudible. Police arrested several demonstrators, including Margarita Solomonitsa, who was holding a sign outside the courtroom that read: ※Give us our director back.§ She was led away by police officers as she was speaking to journalists. ※I have great respect for Kirill Serebrennikov and am sure he is a very honest person,§ Solomonitsa said before she was detained. ※What is happening to him is outside the law.§ Serebrennikov said he should be granted bail because he had cooperated fully with the police investigation, which has been under way for months. A total of 34 prominent Russian directors, artists and singers, including the director of Russia＊s Bolshoi theatre, pledged they would guarantee Serebrennikov＊s bail payment.But the judge sided with the prosecutors, ruling Serebrennikov should stay under house arrest until 19 October. The director will only be able to attend rehearsals with the permission of investigators.The charges in the case relate to a period between 2011 and 2014 when a theatre studio led by Serebrennikov received significant government funding. Investigators have alleged he was part of a criminal group that stole the money.Serebrennikov dismissed the allegations on Wednesday. ※We did a big and bright project for the country, for the motherland, that was famous all over the world and became a starting platform for many young artists,§ he said.Leading figures in Russia＊s cultural world have said the charges are politically motivated, fuelled by conservative anger at the Gogol Centre, Serebrennikov＊s progressive theatre in Moscow, which attracts a devoted liberal audience. Since its foundation, the Gogol Centre has tackled themes including the role of religion, high-level corruption and sexuality in a series of critically acclaimed productions. The Russian culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, described Serebrennikov＊s situation on Wednesday as ※sad§ and ※deeply regrettable§, according to the news agency Interfax.The criminal investigation in which Serebrennikov has become entangled shows no sign of ending. Several former colleagues of the director have also been detained. Police said late on Tuesday they had issued an arrest warrant for Ekaterina Voronova, a producer who worked with Serebrennikov on a staging of A Midsummer Night＊s Dream. Voronova＊s current whereabouts is unknown.Russian media reported on Wednesday that the shooting of Summer, a film directed by Serebrennikov about the Soviet rock star Viktor Tsoi, had been indefinitely suspended. It is not clear whether Small Tragedies, a Serebrennikov play due to premiere at the Gogol Centre next month, will go ahead. Nikita Kukushkin, an actor at the Gogol Centre who attended the hearing, said the theatre would try to work as normal. ※If Kirill Serebrennikov was here he would tell us to rehearse,§ he said.

"＊ll say this for Marvel film culture: its commitment to franchise maintenance and integration has significantly reduced the letdown factor of inevitable sequels. To say two films have been drawn with the same stencil is perhaps the wrong analogy for (Disney, 12): rather, this loosey-goosey, eye-searingly spangly new instalment of ※Star-Lord§ romping has been drawn by a restless, fanciful child with no hand on the template.That＊s a good thing. Even when its silliness tilts toward outright obnoxiousness, this remains the most characterful series in Marvel＊s empire, actively delighting in the broad banter, why-not cameos and extra-extra-extra-snazzy action spectacle it splashes all over the screen. , what actually happens between gags is practically incidental, as a cosmically grizzled Kurt Russell arrives on the scene to blow the mind of Chris Pratt＊s dudeish space warrior with news of his past. Yeah, yeah, whatever, we say; just give us more popping octopus fights and random, upbeat intrusions of 70s dad-rock. We aren＊t disappointed. Here＊s a blockbuster franchise that demands precious little of its audience, yet gives abundantly in return.Sticking in a cheerfully loopy register, we move on to (Studiocanal, 15), writer-actor Julian Barratt＊s bumptious, meta-upon-meta send-up of 1980s British TV procedurals. The title refers to the ludicrously psychic fictitious detective played, all too long ago, by washed-up, egotistical ham Richard Thorncroft. Whether Barratt is more cringeingly hilarious as the actor or his creation is a close-run thing. His obtuse deadpanning is a thing of versatile comic beauty. The film itself, which sees Thorncroft drafted into a real-life serial killer hunt for reasons that more capable seniors swiftly regret, is less spry with its shtick, stretching a few running jokes until they no longer twang. Still, it＊s affable, mischievous nonsense.Would that anyone or anything could be described as playful in (Entertainment One, 12), a mealy historical love triangle set in the looming shadows of the Armenian genocide. It＊s a backdrop that dictates a tone of tight-jawed dourness, yet the film＊s engagement with history is on the skimpy side. Even the usually electric Oscar Isaac seems sluggish, weighed down with portent and a hummus-thick accent.Also scarcely cracking a smile, though to much more enticing dark effect, is  (Arrow, 15). A richly strange, darting psychodrama from British newcomer Gareth Tunley, it moves from spiralled thriller mechanics to more Lynch-inspired experimental imaginings as a mentally troubled cop (the fine Tom Meeten) faces the possibility of supernatural interference in a perplexing murder case 每 or not, as scene after scene second-guesses what has gone before.I was never going to make it dry-eyed through Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal＊s documentary  (Dogwoof, 15), and it duly got me good, though this despairing emotional autopsy didn＊t quite go for the jabs at the heart I expected. Rather than a simple elegy for a ruined talent, the film rather boldly reframes Whitney Houston＊s story as one of thwarted queer identity, centred on her conflicted allegiance to toxic husband, Bobby Brown, and protective childhood friend Robyn Crawford. The film makes a convincing case for the greater intimacy of the two women＊s relationship, though Broomfield isn＊t on full provocateur duty here; it＊s a mostly melancholic inquiry.Finally, popping up  after hitting cinemas last year and skipping a DVD release, Anne Fontaine＊s  (15) deserves greater exposure. Stately, disciplined but never dour, this study of a collective crisis of faith, set in a post-second world war Polish convent plagued by decidedly non-immaculate pregnancies, handles potentially lurid material with a rigorously questioning, subtly spiritual intelligence. It would make a fine companion piece to , though feel just as free to pair it with  as a kind of cinematic detox.																																											"
"elebrities are often accused of lacking self-awareness. And no one＊s been on the receiving end of that criticism more than . Despite a lengthy catalogue of hits in which she plays scorned exes and lovelorn balladeers, the country singer turned pop superstar has been seen less as a victim than as a purveyor of victimhood, using her prodigious songwriting talents and natural affability to become a megaphone for perceived injustice.So what does Taylor Swift do to prove to us she＊s aware of this narrative (the one, of course, from which she＊d like to be excluded)?Release a music video 每 for her new single, Look What You Made Me Do 每 that＊s practically boiling over with meta-commentary and self-referential detail, from an ongoing visual snake motif to a tombstone that  reads ※Taylor Swift＊s reputation§. Yes, it＊s painfully on-the-nose, but Swift＊s brand hasn＊t exactly been built on subtlety.Look What You Made Me Do 每 or LWYMMD, as its Twitter hashtag dictates 每 is well on its way to smashing streaming records, but the song hasn＊t been as well received by critics. Continuing in the tradition of her last album, 1989, which marked Swift＊s official evolution into pop music behemoth, it largely abandons that which made her a household name 每 singable melodies; sharp, specific lyricism; grand tales of romantic enchantment 每 in favor of radio-engineered pop and glib proclamations of vengeance. Near the end of the song, she answers a phone call; someone＊s asking to speak with Taylor Swift. ※She can＊t come to the phone right now,§ Swift 2.0 says. Why? ※Because she＊s dead.§ In the battle between Swifts, my allegiance is with the deceased version, a shrewd chronicler of young-adult courtship and seasoned, starry-eyed songwriter. So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red. But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation. The music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night＊s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that＊s mostly eluded her. The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it＊s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyonc谷 dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes. But it doesn＊t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images. And if the images could talk, they might say, ※I know what you think of me§, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: ※I＊m a messy bitch who lives for drama.§But still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded. A connoisseur of the tongue-in-cheek (remember the capitalized letters in her lyric booklets that spelled out clues about a song＊s subject?), it begins with a zombified T-Swift digging her own grave.Get it? The Old Swift is dead, dunzo, resigned to the graveyard of pop culture history. First, we see the aforementioned tombstone, where Swift＊s reputation lies, but also a second one, reading ※Nils Sjoberg§, the pseudonym Swift used as a co-writer on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris＊s song, This Is What You Came For, a collaboration widely assumed to have contributed to their breakup. Swift＊s writing credit was supposed to be kept secret, but when her team revealed that she had, in fact, written the Harris-Rihanna hit, her ex went on a tweetstorm about how Swift was looking for ※someone new to try and bury§. So she buried the fictitious Mr Sjoberg.In the next shot, Swift luxuriates in a tub of diamonds, where there sits a single dollar bill, a possible reference to the symbolic dollar she earned in last month＊s sexual assault case against the radio DJ who groped her in 2013. Internet conspiracists, too, ran with this as a visual reference to Melania Trump, who could be seen forking diamond necklaces like spaghetti in a Vanity Fair spread last year. But those were the same people insistent that Swift, who kept mum during last year＊s presidential campaigns, is a closeted Trump supporter. That the election coincided with Swift＊s period of self-imposed exile did little to get her back in the public＊s good graces; but diamonds, unlike gilded toilet seats, do not a Trump reference make. This next one is a dead giveaway: Swift sits atop a throne as dozens of snakes slither at her feet. One even serves her what we can only assume is the kind Kim Kardashian dished out when she released audio of Swift, who publicly disputed Kanye West＊s lyric about her in Famous, appearing to sign off on those same lyrics in a phone conversation with West. Afterwards, Swift＊s reputation as a snake in sheep＊s clothing took off; Kardashian helped further that image by tweeting a bunch of snake emojis on international snake day. More than a year later, it seems Swift＊s ready to embrace the title: ahead of the single＊s release, she dropped cryptic reptilian teaser videos. And now, the snake has shed her skin. There＊s also an inscription on Swift＊s gold throne that reads ※Et Tu Brute§, the Latin phrase used in William Shakespeare＊s Julius Caesar when Caesar is being assassinated by his friend Brutus. It＊s a far cry from the Swift of yesteryear, whose Shakespeare references were more Romeo and Juliet than Julius Caesar. But she＊s dead, remember?It was at the 2016 Grammys, when 1989 beat Kendrick Lamar＊s To Pimp a Butterfly for album of the year, that Swift first began to truly test the public＊s patience. That was also where she publicly rebuked West＊s lyric about her in her acceptance speech.So in the next shot, as the chorus begins, Swift rams a shiny gold car into a storefront where paparazzo are lurking. She opens the door, a cheetah in tow, to show off none other than her Grammy award. She proceeds to display and caress it in one of the video＊s most bewildering moments.Swift＊s love of cats is well documented. Here, she＊s surrounded by stacks of cash and a Girl Squad of masked felines, wielding a baseball bat and a sweater that says ※Blind for Love§. In the next scene, the masked marauders can be seen robbing a music streaming company. Swift, if you remember, boycotted Spotify for years due to its dismal compensation of artists. She also wrote an open letter to Apple Music in 2014 arguing on behalf of increased artists compensation and then took to Tumblr, in June 2015, blasting Apple＊s decision to give users three-month free trials. And now she＊s back to rob them, cat imagery to boot.Swift first assembled her Girl Squad in the music video for Bad Blood, supposedly a shot at rival . She then spent her 1989 world tour parading her besties around in different cities, throwing parties for her supermodel coterie and bringing them to red carpets. This didn＊t work out great for Swift, adding to the perception that she surrounds herself only with similarly alpine, Aryan beauties such as Karlie Kloss, Martha Hunt and Gigi Hadid.But she you think thatalright? So here＊s a factory of fembots united like the sentient hosts of Westworld. Swift stands before them in leather and latex, the ringleader of scorned Girl Squads the world over.This next still made waves for its apparent resemblance to a shot from Beyonc谷＊s Formation video. But the real hidden gem is the backup dancers＊ belly shirts, which read ※I Heart TS§. Tom Hiddleston, one of Swift＊s ex-boyfriends, was caught in a similar shirt when splashing around the beaches of Rhode Island with Swift. All of which seems to suggest that Swift surrounds herself only with those who emblazon their love for her on T-shirts. , she＊s commenting on the fact that you  she does that.As we get closer to the finale, we see Swift standing before a bunch of former Swifts: the lovesick high-schooler from the You Belong With Me music video, the one in a silver flapper dress who was interrupted on the VMA stage by , the innocent, bespectacled one wearing pajamas, the one dressed as a white swan from the Shake It Off music video. They claw at her feet, aching to be resurrected. But Swift 2.0, wearing a black shirt that says ※Rep§, banishes them all and declares the ※old Taylor§ dead.This segues into the video＊s utterly cringeworthy dance break which, for all I know, is more Swift meta-commentary on how bad of a dancer everyone thinks she is (an, , reputation corroborated by all the times awards show cameras have panned awkwardly to Swift in the audience during a performance, writhing around like the inflatable tube men at gas stations). Finally, the Swifts both old and new assemble before an airplane, where the word ※reputation§ appears again. Here, Swift on Swift reaches its thematic apex: Zombie Swift tells You Belong With Me Swift to ※stop making that surprised face, it＊s so annoying§. White Swan Swift adds: ※You can＊t possible be that surprised all the time§. Top-hat Swift tells Cowboy Boots Swift that she＊s ※so fake§. Cowboy Boots Swift bursts into tears. ※There she goes, playing the victim again,§ responds another Swift, wearing spiked leather. Leopard-clad Swift holds up her phone and announces she＊s ※getting receipts§ 每 and that she＊ll ※edit them§ too, a reference to Swift＊s belief that Kardashian artfully edited that incriminating audio of her. And finally, 2009 VMAs Swift, holding her Moonman, announces she would ※very much like to be excluded from this narrative§.And with that 每 as old Swifts expire and a new one is born 每 the narrative lives to see another day.
