A leading global expert on oil disasters has said the response to  in offshore drilling planned for the Great Australian Bight by BP is an early warning sign of problems that could potentially lead to disasters.Bob Bea, an emeritus professor and founder of the center for catastrophic risk management at Berkeley, said what , its subcontractor Diamond Offshore Drilling and the Australian regulator had said in response to concerns about faulty bolts was  very alarming .Bea has investigated major oil disasters around the world including the Exxon Valdez oil spill and BP s Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. He helped establish the field of  forensic engineering  and has worked in dozens of countries, including Australia.He told the Guardian the process surrounding BP s  high risk  application to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight lacked adequate transparency, proper regulatory processes had not been followed and that responses from the companies involved were  inadequate  and  very alarming .Bea said the way BP referred questions about the equipment failures to its subcontractor   which were then referred to the contractor s equipment manufacturer   revealed a lack of responsibility being taken by BP and  a pervasive lack of effective engagement .On Monday,  its drilling operations in the Great Australian Bight using critical items of equipment   huge  connector bolts    that have been failing since 2003. The US regulator said the fault appeared to be  systemic  and something that has been  .Brian Salerno, the head of US Regulator the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said it was  that the faulty bolts had not caused a major oil spill yet, and that it was .In response to Guardian queries, BP said:  BP has verified with its contractor, Diamond Offshore Drilling, that the bolts have been changed out in accordance with the product information. The US regulator issued guidance that some types of subsea bolts can be subject to hydrogen embrittlement and should be changed to other types that are not subject to the concern. Our drilling contractor has done this. BP has independently verified that it has done this.  It said the bolts it would use were known to be free of the problem worrying the US regulator. However Salerno has said his agency is  to identify the cause of the failures and  it will take some time before the bolt problem is solved .The US regulator has convened a taskforce of 17 agency partners, including Nasa, to try to fix the problem. The Australian regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema), said it had made sure one particular type of bolt was not being used in Australia but could not point to any action it had taken on the wider problem. BP referred any specific questions about the drilling to its contractor that would be conducting the drilling, Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. It in turn told the Guardian it was  reviewing all equipment and systems , and referred the Guardian to its equipment manufacturer. The responses you have received are not adequate,  Bea told the Guardian, describing Diamond Offshore s response in particular as  very alarming . I have not seen any evidence that supports its contention that  we are taking all the necessary precautionary steps to deliver a safe and successful drilling program ,  he said.Bea said the issue needed to be treated more seriously by the regulator National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema), BP, as well as its contractors. I think there is ample evidence that elevated attention needs to be paid to the proposed  high risk  operations that are being proposed [in the Great Australian Bight],  Bea said, describing the current approach to the operation as  hope for the best . The responses you are receiving are an  early warning  of the types of challenges   problems   that can lead to   disasters,  he said.Bea said the fact that Nopsema wasn t going to make public any of the conditions BP would be held to meant it wasn t following proper regulatory procedures.He said that process required transparency,  so that the four groups of people (public, industry, governments, environment representatives) are involved in an effective  collaboration  to  get it right . Bea said any company that was proposing to use high-strength bolts in critical equipment   like in the Great Australian Bight Operation   should be required by the regulator to prove to both the government and the public that they were safe. This will require they produce valid test data on the bolts and associated equipment to be used in the specified operational and environmental conditions and that this use will produce a tolerable risk of catastrophic failure,  he said.Bea started his career working on offshore rigs in the 1960s and moved into academia in the 1998. He has worked in dozens of countries, including Australia on the north-west shelf, the Timor Sea, and the Bass Strait. Bea has worked on several investigations of major disasters, and led an .A Senate committee that was examining the plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight decided on Thursday to further investigate the matter, with at least two more hearings before it submits its report.In earlier hearings lawyers from the Environmental Defenders Offices of Australia told senators the assessment of BP s plans had been . Stuart Smith, the chief executive of Nopsema, told the inquiry that releasing documents like environmental plans or safety cases that companies produce  could influence the nature of the information that companies provide and therefore diminish our capability to make an assessment .BP has already had its environmental plans for drilling in the Bight rejected twice by Nopsema but the documents have not been released, so the reasons for rejection are unknown.Nopsema usually only allows environmental plans to be resubmitted twice but BP has split its application into two separate proposals to submit afresh.A decision on the new application is expected on Monday.BP has also not released oil-spill modelling for its operations in the Great Australian Bight, but  by the Wilderness Society has shown even a relatively small  low-flow  oil spill from one of BP s wells in the Bight could impact the entire southern coast of Australia, as well as Tasmania.
