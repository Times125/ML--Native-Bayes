Following the Senate's release of their version of the health care bill on Thursday, protesters organized outside of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office to voice their opinion against the legislation. The protesters staged a sit-in, which they called a "die-in," and chanted "No cuts to Medicaid! Save our liberty!" outside the door of the Kentucky GOP senator. Many of those participating in the sit-in were disabled, and one protester held a sign reading "Capping Medicaid = death 4 disabled." Police officers forcibly removed and arrested a few of the protesters, physically carrying them out of the hallway in the Capitol building where the demonstration took place. The Senate's health care measure would effectively repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid after its passage during the Obama administration. The new health care bill, titled the "Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017," would cut back the expansion of Medicaid, a program that provides health care to millions of low-income Americans. McConnell hopes to bring the bill to a vote next week before Congress leaves for a week-long July 4 recess.
