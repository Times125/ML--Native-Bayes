"he  governor, Mark Carney, needs to look no further than the pay of his own staff to figure out why 每 when he believes we＊re on the verge of a pay boom 每 most people＊s wage rises are stuck in first gear. The Bank  last week with low-paid staff that had become so toxic inside Threadneedle Street that even the pink-jacketed, top-hatted front-of-house greeters had joined their colleagues in the maintenance section and other blue-collar roles by downing tools.Carney had offered a 1% pay rise in line with the public sector pay cap. He took a tough line, even though the Bank is not seen as part of the public sector. And he held the line with only a few minor concessions. A little extra money was promised to a handful of the very lowest paid, a little extra holiday entitlement was also part of the modest package, and there was a pledge to include the union in future pay talks from the start.The 1% pay cap remains in place. And why wouldn＊t it when fewer than 100 of the Bank＊s 4,000 employees felt aggrieved enough to go on strike? They were angry enough to protest for three days before the dispute ran out of steam.A longer strike was never on the cards; it is a sad fact that workers have such little power in Britain today. The railway workers might use their muscle should they embark on a winter of disputes over driverless trains, but elsewhere workers face draconian employment laws that make them among the most flexible in the world when it comes to how and when they work. That＊s not how the Bank reads the broader economy. It disregards the dispute under its nose and believes that 3%-plus pay growth is around the corner. Listening to the speeches of some policymakers, anyone would think that with unemployment at a 40-year low of 4.4% in June, the workers would have taken their dispute to the wire and, without a more generous offer, quit for a better job elsewhere.The Bank＊s argument is that full employment, if not already here, is just around the corner. . Employers are crying out for people and are poised to rip up their pay rates in favour of more generous salaries to secure the staff they need. With inflation expected to rise towards 3%, from 2.6% in July, workers need to see their pay packets following suit.In this scenario, a combination of few available workers and price rises in the shops will put huge pressure on employers to pay higher wages or risk unfilled vacancies.It is a message the monetary policy committee (MPC) is likely to repeat on Thursday when it makes its next judgment on the economy. The committee will most likely hold the base interest rate at 0.25% with the strong hint that a rise is imminent now that the labour market is tight and vacancies are rising.The Bank is not alone. Several City economists conclude that wages are about to jump now that the high level of vacancies is out of sync with the low level of unemployment.Kalum Pickering at Berenberg bank said: ※We expect that by the end of the year, and certainly by the beginning of 2018, providing sterling doesn＊t take another major leg down, real wages will be rising again.§To back up his point, wages across the economy have already started to rise from 1.6% per year at the beginning of the year to 2.1% in the latest figures. It will take a surge in wage rates to get past 3% to meet Pickering＊s forecast of inflation-busting pay rises, but as he points out, three months of improving pay growth shows it is going in the right direction.Yet, given the Bank of England strike＊s outcome, the central bank and its supporters in the City, at least as far as its analysis is concerned, seem completely out of touch. They seem to ignore the fact that the job market is stratified and regional and the answer to a chronic labour shortage is not necessarily higher pay.In the construction industry a shortage of specialist staff, which cannot be met by the current pool of skilled workers, has forced building firms to delay projects. Anecdotal evidence is that employers are not willing to take a cut in margins and customers are unwilling to pay more, so projects are mothballed.The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, which regularly talks to human resources directors across the private and public sectors, says the bottom end of the labour market continues to have a plentiful supply of workers. Its last survey showed there were an average of 24 applications for each low-skilled job, 19 candidates for every medium-skilled vacancy and eight for each high-skilled post. One factor was the continued influx of EU workers.It said: ※EU net migration levels remain well above post-enlargement average levels due to a continued strong supply of EU15 and Bulgarian and Romanian nationals. Initial fears that  would have a material impact on employers＊ ability to fill vacancies therefore seem to be somewhat premature.§Then there is the government＊s continuation of austerity, which will have the effect of making low income households even more desperate for a job, and when they have one, ask for longer hours just to make ends meet.Maybe Bank officials comfort themselves with the news that  with their own low-paid staff. But again it was just a smattering of staff who felt able to confront the restaurant chain 每 in line with the real trend, and not the Bank＊s fantasy projections, McDonald＊s has so far felt little anxiety about workers quitting for higher pay elsewhere.So the flexible market for labour remains firmly in place and pay increases are a pipe dream for most. It＊s why the archbishop of Canterbury joined the  to say, among other things, that trade unions needed more support.※We are failing those who will grow up into a world where the gap between the richest and poorest parts of the country is significant and destabilising,§ Justin Welby said.The Bank, to maintain the obvious respect it still commands with Britons, could more helpfully give a more accurate picture of the economy. For this to happen, Carney and his fellow committee members need to get out more."															
"＆Sometimes you get the impression that the British are talking to themselves,§ said the outgoing French ambassador, Sylvie Bermann, on the  programme last week.There have been suggestions that the French are rubbing their hands and doing their best to lure as much business as they can from the City of London to Paris.My own impression, however, is that the French, and most other of our fellow Europeans, are saddened and not a little mystified by the sight of a nation whose leaders give every impression of rushing headlong to the cliff edge.Of course they want to take advantage of this weird situation. But it is a natural consequence of self-harming decisions made in this country, not in continental Europe.There was a similar air of puzzlement at the annual meeting of the Ambrosetti Forum which I attended last weekend in the beautiful surroundings of the Villa d＊Este on Lake Como. The Ambrosetti Forum has been described as the Italian version of the World Economic Forum in Davos, but it is a more civilised and less pretentious event.Nor was it just about Brexit 每 although it was a distorted version of what the EU＊s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said at the forum that  in the Britain that talks to itself.I can tell you, I was there when  was speaking. He did not, as widely reported, say in belligerent tones that the British needed to be taught a lesson. His general tone was one of regret, but not hostility. The future of the EU itself was far more important than Brexit, but Brexit had ※extremely serious and important consequences, which should not be underestimated§. Not?unreasonably, he said that ※these have not been explained properly to the British people§.As for the endless ※debate§ about the exit bill, he pointed out that there wasn＊t one. The UK had undertaken in 2014 to pay its 14% share of ※all our [EU] expenses§ for the next seven years. As the  : ※The EU commission ＃ is clearly right that the UK should pay its share of budget commitments that have already been signed off, and agree in principle to cover pension?liabilities.§Barnier emphasised: there was no exit bill, no punishment. It wasn＊t blackmail. It＊s fact.A few days later, in response to some distorted reporting on the BBC, Barnier tweeted that  was an ※occasion to explain single market benefits to all countries §.That was earlier in the week. Some of my anti-Brexit friends are worried that, while definitely winning in exchanges with our benighted government, Barnier must not make the mistake of overplaying his hand. The fear is that there could be a reaction in this country.While on Lake Como I met a Dutch couple who told me that when, the day after the referendum, they went to a Coldplay concert in Amsterdam, proceedings began with lead singer Chris Martin apologising to the audience for the referendum result! The result was bad enough, but the way our so-called leaders accepted ※the will of the people§ amazes me.Yet, on returning to London last week I wondered whether there were not just a glimmer of hope, amid the outcry caused by the leak of the government＊s immigration proposals, and the chaos around the so-called repeal bill, that more of our parliamentarians are waking up to the damaging absurdity of Brexit.They made a mockery of their own sovereignty when, ignoring the wisdom of Edmund Burke, they acted as delegates after the referendum vote, not representatives with their own minds and judgment, and voted to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, thereby setting out on the road to ruin.As the French president, Emmanuel Macron, stated in June, in spite of everything, the door to continued EU membership remains open.The ridiculous thing is that there are enough problems in the British economy and British society without the added self-inflicted damage from Brexit 每 a first taste, of course, being the collapse of the pound, which has hit British holidaymakers forcibly this?summer.On the economy in general, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in a report coordinated by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, is surely right to claim that  and requires ※fundamental reform§.But he and his colleagues also go on to say that reform is required on the scale of the 1940s and 1980s. I concur about the 1940s but I should like to remind the archbishop that much of the economic injustice that he so rightly laments dates from the more rampant elements of Thatcherism in the 1980s.Finally, all praise to John Le Carr谷 for reminding us that his famous fictional character George Smiley dreamed of a united Europe, and not the Brexit that le Carr谷 and so many of us detest."															
" is to force a Commons vote on scrapping the 1% public sector pay cap.On Sunday, the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, called on Tory MPs to join his party in backing moves to end the ※unfair§ cap with a motion to be debated on Wednesday. Any vote on Labour＊s motion will be non-binding on the government.The opposition is seeking to capitalise on Conservative support for public sector workers to receive a pay increase and Theresa May＊s lack of a majority to pressure her to take action sooner than previously hinted.The announcement of the motion comes after a former top Treasury official labelled the cap unsustainable in the long term.Nicholas Macpherson, who spent a decade as permanent secretary to the Treasury until 2016, said any failure to properly cost the lifting of the 1% cap would leave the deficit unacceptably high.May and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, would have to decide either to cut spending or hike taxes to pay for it, Lord Macpherson said.Ashworth told Sky News＊s Sunday with Niall Paterson: ※What the government needs to do is understand the concerns of the people who work in our National Health Service and wider public services and get rid of this pay cap. ※We keep getting briefings in newspapers and suggestions that the government is sympathetic and wants to do something, and ＆Oh, it＊s terrible and we accept that but let＊s see where we get to＊. ※We＊re bringing a vote to the House of Commons on Wednesday and those Conservative members of parliament who have sincerely said they believe the pay cap should go, we＊re calling on them to vote with us, and I＊m calling on your viewers to lobby those Conservative members of parliament and let me know what they say. ※We can put an end to the pay cap on Wednesday for the NHS staff if they vote with us.§ Asked if Labour would support a union-backed general strike, Ashworth replied: ※People go on strike for industrial reasons. They don＊t go on strike for political reasons and ＃ the Labour party supports people who take industrial action. ※But we don＊t want it to get to that stage. We don＊t want to see a strike. We don＊t want to see nurses going on strike and wider public servants going on strike. ※The way to avoid that is for the government to understand the concerns of public sector workers and get rid of this unfair pay cap.§The defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, said last week that the government fully understood that public sector workers have taken their ※share of the pain§ of deficit reduction and signalled that the chancellor was looking at the issue.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said if public sector pay were to rise in line with inflation for the next three or four years it would cost the public purse between ?6bn and ?7bn more than if the cap were retained.Commenting on the speculation, Macpherson told BBC Radio 4＊s Westminster Hour: ※Generally pay caps aren＊t sustainable in the long term.※So the government does need to find a way of getting off this policy.§The Treasury is due to send out letters within weeks setting out the remit for public sector pay review bodies for next year＊s pay round, and Hammond is under pressure to allow them greater flexibility to recommend more generous rises."															
"t was a glorious September morning. But I was in a ruminative mood, walking towards Westminster＊s Church House for the unveiling of another damning account of Britain＊s economy. It was the launch of the interim report from the Institute of Public Policy＊s (IPPR) economic commission. is one of the best I＊ve read and yet I was wondering how its unanswerable assessment of our economy and the need for systemic reform has so little purchase on the national debate.I made similar arguments in my book  20 years ago and have attended many such launches ever since, often graced by bishops and some daring business executives prepared to break cover and speak out. It＊s the same story of underinvestment; a woeful track record on R&D; overemphasis on high, short-term profits; an incredibly poor record on productivity and stagnating real wages. On almost every international comparison, Britain fares badly, with a desperately weak export sector overfocused on financial services and a few manufacturing industries.Many aspects 每 the structure of our companies, the priorities of finance, the skills of our workforce, the creaking infrastructure, the weakness of the tax base 每 need to be addressed because the failures are interlinked. We have an economic muddle rather than an economic model, declares the IPPR commission. Yet for all the self-evident truth in the report, my fear is that little will change. After all, both Churchill and Keynes said nearly a century ago that finance was too proud and industry too humble 每 the heart of the IPPR＊s diagnosis. We＊re still saying it today.The IPPR commissioners gamely argue that the problems are becoming so acute that the years ahead 每 as in the 1930s and 70s 每 will see a paradigm shift. I am not so sure. For all the failures, I doubt they will trigger popular demand for system change unless we can create political and cultural forces much better at articulating what needs to be done and then doing it. There hasn＊t been a reframing of the way capitalist institutions work since the 1930s and 40s. The change in the 1970s was a shift to the right, still firmly in control of the national narrative, and now running the rightwing coup that is .There are multiple reasons for the right＊s hegemony. Part is cultural. Jacob Rees-Mogg is a twerp, his views are rooted in prejudice rather than evidence and he is no ally of the mass of the British. But too many English instinctively genuflect to that lazy ※gentlemanly§ superiority. So when he and his ilk dismiss the case for system change as ※ socialist engineering§ and instead lay the blame on welfare, European regulations (without being able to name any) and the moral bankruptcy of liberals who indulge everything from the work-shy to soft criminal sentences, they get an undeserved hearing.But, surely, the great banks, investment houses and mighty companies can＊t be that flawed? Our extravagantly paid managerial class can＊t be so incompetent? Instead, we are tempted by the easy option of understanding failure and decline on this scale in terms of individual moral failings for which we are being punished. The benefit cheats in the flats opposite or the migrants allowed to crowd in a safe house, snapping up jobs on zero-hour contracts. Then there＊s soft liberalism with its pernicious indulgent views.Powerful rightwing newspapers that foreground the same stories about welfare cheats and immigration while relentlessly attacking liberal institutions 每 the BBC, the NHS, the EU 每 reinforce these reflex reactions. They would never endorse or champion the IPPR＊s powerful analysis. And the written word, even from a tawdry biased media, retains disproportionate cultural force.Too few figures at the top of our society speak out either in defence of Enlightenment values or at the evident crisis before their eyes. They fear being struck off the lists for non-executive directorships and public appointments by making criticisms that could help the dread forces of Labourism. Not to mention lost invitations to the ritziest of parties.In this respect, Britain has echoes of other declining nations over the centuries 每 Venice in the 16th century, Spain in the 18th, Austria-Hungary and France in the 19th. All knew full well that their political, economic and social systems had become dysfunctional, but reform was impossible. Too many at the top had stakes in the old order, reinforced, as in today＊s Britain, by being at the apex of the social pyramid.This makes Labour＊s political challenge all the more difficult. It is the outsider party, so that even when it holds office it feels like an unwelcome and short-term occupant. System change needs allies from within prepared to provide the ammunition to support telling criticism and make common cause in reform.But Labour＊s leadership often finds itself in a bind. Either it so craves legitimacy, like Blair and Brown, that it does not want to embrace criticism of the status quo, so it threatens and does nothing. Or it so disregards forces it openly despises 每 see Corbyn and McDonnell 每 that it can recruit few or no business and financial allies. But the task of system change requires coaxing insider allies to burn their conservative boats and make common cause for the national good. You need Blair＊s persuasiveness and Corbyn＊s conviction 每 an impossible combination? Otherwise, the left mouths intent, but with little evidence or substance to back its proposals, which is disabling it even if it wins office.Perhaps Brexit is changing these dynamics. The right is managing a cockup of such epic proportions that some in the Tory elite are beginning to dissociate themselves from a brand that is becoming as toxic and emblematic of failure as the Romanovs and Hapsburgs. Tory newspapers are so biased that their influence is slipping.I know of one British ex-ambassador who flaunts his Labour party membership as a badge of pride at every prestigious event he attends; he was once seen as a loopy eccentric but now others are now wondering if he is not right. Most businesses and their lobby organisations will find it hard to fault what the IPPR argues, and a wide cross-section of people have signed up as commissioners. has won it many admirers and its manifesto signalled a welcome awareness of both the direction and systemic nature of necessary change.These are but straws in the wind, but they foretell how Brexit may be the trigger to breaking the Conservative hegemony and perhaps even reshaping the balance of power between finance and industry. If so maybe my worries are misplaced and any successor walking into Dean＊s Yard in 20 years＊ time will be attending the launch of a report discussing a country on the economic rise 每 and leading the EU. Here＊s hoping."															
" new study  examining the impacts of tax cuts has found that while lowering tax rates for the rich will stimulate the economy, it does so at the great cost of increased inequality.Most damningly, it finds the benefits of tax cuts targeted at the wealthiest 25% 每 such as the one the Turnbull government brought in last year 每 are far too weak to raise the welfare of the majority of the population and also never pay for themselves. Last year, the government made great talk of the need for a tax cut for those earning more than $80,000. The threshold for the 37% rate was raised to $87,000 to ensure 每 as the prime minister  at the time that ※middle-income Australians, those that are on average full-time earnings, which as you know is nudging $80,000, don＊t move into the second top tax bracket§.But as I , those on $80,000 earned roughly 1.5 times the current median taxable income of $55,000, putting them above what would be considered ※middle class§. Such income earners were also around the top 25% of those with a taxable income and in the top 14% of all adults.This year, the only income-tax cut delivered was similarly targeted at high-income earners 每 in this case the very high. The end of the deficit levy, which delivered a 2% tax cut to those earning more than $180,000, combined with the 0.5% increase in the Medicare levy, , while those earning above that amount received a tax cut. And this is important because of the new IMF study 每 tax cuts aimed at the top 25% improve growth but reduce the welfare of most of the population, and tax cuts targeted at middle-income earners reduce inequality and can actually raise the size of the middle class. The study also rather sharply slaps down the biggest furphy put forward by many who advocate tax cuts to stimulate growth 每 that they will pay for themselves through stronger growth and, thus, more tax revenue. The idea of self-funding tax cuts got a big run in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan. He argued that his policies, which slashed the top tax rate in the US from 70% to 26%, would pay for themselves through increased growth. They didn＊t.In 2006, a  found that the tax cuts caused revenue to fall in real terms and was only partially made up by other tax increases that Reagan introduced. But the myth of tax cuts paying for themselves remains. The current US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin,  that economic growth would pay for Donald Trump＊s tax cuts;  Liberal senator James Paterson told the Senate that ※the revenue collected from individuals after the tax rates were cut [by Reagan] in fact increased rather than decreased§.The IMF study, which modelled the impacts of tax cuts on a US-style economy, found that any income-tax cut 每 whether targeted at middle or high-income households 每 reduced tax revenue. The study＊s authors noted that personal income-tax cuts stimulated growth but the supply-side effects, such as increased employment and wages, ※are never large enough to offset the revenue loss from lower marginal tax rates§.Or as they succinctly conclude: ※tax cuts do not pay for themselves§.The study, however, finds that tax cuts do generate growth. This is not uncontroversial 每 giving people money either through direct or indirect payments or a tax cut will generally lead to them spending more money and thus increase economic growth. The issue is how to pay for the tax cuts and what impact they will have on the economy. The study looked at two types of tax cuts 每 one for middle-income earners and the other for those in the top 25% income bracket. It found that both improved economic growth, but more growth resulted from the high-income tax cuts. If you stopped reading there, you would miss the crucial aspect. While a high-income tax cut generates more growth than one directed at middle-income earners, that growth delivers very skewed benefits. The study found that in an economy such as the US or Australia, the high-income tax cut would lead to increased spending on goods and services, which in turn could improve wages for those lower-income earners who provided those goods, but it would also cause prices to rise and would need to be paid for by either other tax increases or cuts to government spending. The total impact, even when you accounted for policies that tried to ※protect the poor§ to reduce the impact of other tax increases and spending cuts, was ※a significant decline in consumption of low and middle- income households, and a significant reduction of the middle class§.So you get strong economic growth, but you reduce the size of the middle class and increase inequality. Damningly, the study＊s authors conclude of the high-income tax cut that ※the ＆trickle-down＊ effects§ are ※insufficient to raise the welfare of the bulk of the population§.On the other hand, they find that a tax cut targeted at middle-income earners, while generating less overall growth, ※reduces income inequality and polarisation by moving people from lower income households back into the middle class§.The study estimates that a tax cut targeted at middle-income earners can increase the size of the middle class by about 4% and reduce inequality,  itis paid for by raising consumption taxes such as the GST. In the past, the belief has been that you need to sacrifice equality for economic growth. Numerous , however, have found that reducing inequality improves economic growth in the long term. The IMF study gives the issue an even more precise examination. Rather than talking in general economic terms, it looks at the specific impact of taxation policy. And it shows that governments that choose high-income tax cuts are choosing economic growth for the few and reduced welfare for the many. "															
															
"In the weeks that followed their disastrous election result, a delegation of Tory MPs marched to Downing Street with a clear message for the prime minister and her team. After years of austerity,  was running out, and some positivity was needed.The MPs went away from the meeting convinced they had secured an end to the public sector pay cap that would mark a loosening of spending cuts that they could use to show their constituents that the government was listening.Yet while Theresa May and her chancellor, , are preparing to make a gesture to selected public servants, the years of salami slicing mean that, quite apart from Brexit, there are now myriad issues that ministers fear could erupt into full-blown political crises.It is why some Tories are now concerned that, far from staging a political recovery in the autumn, the party may do well to dodge a winter of discontent that would provoke renewed anger among voters and make the once-distant prospect of prime minister Jeremy Corbyn more likely.The spinning plates most in danger of crashing to the floor include not just public sector pay, but forthcoming welfare cuts, the increasingly  of a new benefits system, local government funding and an NHS heading into an early winter crisis.※The next three to four months are possibly going to be the rockiest so far 每 with Brexit uncertainty affecting some of these domestic issues,§ said one minister. ※These are choppy waters to navigate between now and New Year＊s Eve.※The question is what concessions can be made in the budget consistent with our reputation for sound money and balancing the books. The threat of prime minister Corbyn is the only glue that is holding the Tory party together.§The immediate threat is coming from the unions, some of whom are threatening strikes should the government attempt to reward some public sector workers rather than others.Major unions are already warning ministers not to be selective about which public servants deserve a raise. A survey by the public services union Unison of nearly 11,000 employees, including paramedics, teaching assistants, hospital porters and police staff, found that more than two in five (43%) described their standard of living as worse than a year ago, and a quarter (26%) said they owed more money than they did 12 months ago.※Enough is enough,§ said Dave Prentis, Unison＊s general secretary. ※The pay cap must end, not this autumn or next year, but now. The government cannot pick and choose who should benefit. Everyone working in the , schools and higher education, local government and the police service is long overdue a rise.§Meanwhile, a coming welfare squeeze 每 combined with the new universal credit system of administering a series of benefits 每 is also threatening to unravel. Some Tories who rebelled over past attempts to cut tax credits still have concerns. ※The problem with universal credit is the so-called taper rate [the amount of benefits a claimant loses for each pound they earn] 每 it is at 63p in the pound, meaning some are paying an effective 63% rate of tax on extra money they earn,§ said Stephen McPartland, one of the leading Tory campaigners on the issue. ※I would like to see the chancellor look at this again in the budget.§There is an even more pressing issue emerging over the way universal credit is being administered. From October, the number of job centres introducing the new benefit is set to increase from five to 50 a month. However, highly respected Citizens Advice has taken the extreme move of calling for a pause of the rollout amid signs that delayed payments are pushing recipients into debt.In an analysis of more than 50,000 cases published last Monday, it found that claimants are 14% more likely to have problems with pressing debts if they are on universal credit compared with the benefits it is replacing. A fifth of recipients on universal credit are not being paid in full within six weeks.Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions select committee, said: ※The idea of making people wait six weeks, and sometimes longer, for their benefit to be paid is made to look increasingly questionable by each bleak new piece of evidence on universal credit. People who are already hard up simply cannot cope that long without an income.※I＊ve pleaded with the government for a Christmas truce 每 a postponement of the full rollout of universal credit in Birkenhead [the Labour MP＊s constituency] 每 otherwise the system will push families into destitution over the festive?period.§Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said universal credit remained ※deeply flawed§, adding: ※If government doesn＊t fix these problems, its expansion is a disaster waiting to happen.§A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the organisation＊s analysis was not representative. ※The vast majority of claimants are comfortable managing their money, and for anyone who needs extra help we have budgeting advice and benefit advances,§ she said.Also in the precarious policy mix is evidence that the NHS may face an early winter crisis. , NHS Providers, which represents 229 of the 233 NHS trusts in England, said that the health service was on course for disaster unless an extra ?350m was found for extra beds and staff.It all adds up to a very long queue outside the chancellor＊s door as he draws up one of the most challenging budgets in recent years. While the uncertainty over Brexit means he instinctively wants to take a conservative approach, political pressures to turn on the spending taps are?growing.Ending austerity comes with a hefty price tag of ?33bn a year, according to the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies. It says that, among other things, allowing public sector pay to rise in line with pay in the private sector until 2020 would cost ?9.7bn by 2021-22. Unfreezing benefits would cost ?3.6bn, while reversing the cuts to work allowances in universal credit would cost about ?3.2bn. Allowing departmental spending to rise in line with economic growth would cost ?12.3bn.※Hammond has indicated that he has listened to the message in the election, but has also indicated he remains wedded to the idea of balancing the books by the middle of the next decade,§ said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ※At the moment he is on course to slightly undershoot his public finance target for 2017-18. That could give him some wiggle room, but not much.§Hammond is still said to be in cautious mode, but sympathetic to aiming any budget help at the young. Cancelling the forthcoming rise in student debt interest is one option.Some senior Tories see the mounting threats as part of a wider lack of vision from their party that needs to be addressed urgently. Grant Shapps, the former party chairman, said: ※Winning elections involves having both positive achievements and a positive message. It is vital that in this party conference and budget season we grasp the opportunity to show that there is no party in Britain more aspirational for the future of the British people than Conservatives.§"															
"A previously muted British business establishment is now in full cry over Brexit. The leak last week of proposals to restrict the ability of  nationals to live and work in the UK were described as ※catastrophic§ by one employers＊ group. Voices from housebuilding to aerospace, farming and hotels raised concerns over the plans, which signalled a hard Brexit is very much on the cards.The warning of catastrophe came from the British Hospitality Association, while the National Farmers Union said the  would cause ※massive disruption to the entire food supply chain§. The reaction was also fuelled by the government＊s refusal to disown the plans, alongside its apparent support of a hard Brexit agenda. We answer the key questions raised by the leak, including the potential consequences for the UK economy.The document, entitled the Border, Immigration and Citizenship System After the UK Leaves the EU,  by limiting them to a maximum residency of two years. Meanwhile ※high-skilled occupations§ would be granted permits to work for a longer period of three to five years.Plans to scrap EU rules on the rights of extended family members to reside in the UK would mean that the current system, which has ※virtually no limits§, according to the document, was replaced by one that would determine ※family members as direct family members only, plus durable partners§.EU nationals would be required to travel on a passport and not a national ID card. They would also have to apply for a biometric residence permit, which may include a fingerprint, after they had stayed for between three and six months.In defiance of the EU＊s free-movement directive, residence permits would not be granted to jobseekers. Instead, a specific ※income threshold§ would be introduced for ※self-sufficient§ migrants. Employers would also be heavily involved in policing the new system. They would need to carry out ※right to work§ checks. If they failed in this duty, criminal sanctions against the organisation and its bosses should be expected, the document says.The most common reason given by business leaders for allowing migrants the freedom to roam is a belief that they are the lifeblood of any developed economy. This is especially true in the US, where the business magazine  constantly reminds its readers that major companies 每 including 40% of its Fortune 500 list 每 were .In the last 20 years it has become increasingly common in the UK for the engines of technological change to be fired by migrants. One in six new hires between 2009 and 2015 in the British tech industry were EU citizens, according to the trade body techUK.But immigrants also fill the gaps in low-paid sectors where few Brits are willing to work. Last week employers voiced their dismay at restrictions on both the skilled and unskilled. Farmers were joined by all the major business lobby groups, which want more of an open-door policy than the government＊s interpretation of the EU referendum vote appears to allow.Peter Gowers, chief executive of the hotel chain Travelodge, said: ※Even if the hotel industry recruited virtually every person on the unemployment register there wouldn＊t be enough people to fill all the roles needed in the 10 years following . That＊s particularly the case in London.§The rapid reduction in net migration to below 100,000 new arrivals to the UK each year 每 a Conservative party pledge before the election 每 could knock 3.1% off GDP by 2025 and lower tax receipts by ?32.7bn, according to the Centre for  and Business Research.This week, Theresa May repeated the pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, which means non-EU migrants, who have consistently arrived each year in larger numbers that EU migrants, would also face a much tougher test. This would have an even bigger impact on GDP growth.Paul Johnson, head of the thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says EU migrants have also been good for the public finances. On average immigrants from the EU are better educated, younger and more likely to be in work than native Britons. Young people in work contribute, on average, much more in taxes than they take out in benefits and public service spending.He wrote in a blog: ※A large part of what government does is to take money from young workers and give it to pensioners. Without high net immigration the public finances would be in a worse state. If we were significantly to reduce the number of EU migrants, we would have to borrow more, raise taxes or spend less.§Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader and former business secretary, says nine studies into the impact of migrant labour crossed his desk between 2010 and 2015. In each case they were left to gather dust in the Home Office, he says, blaming May for their disappearance.The studies seen by Cable showed that migrants rarely supplanted UK-born workers, and went instead into expanding industries where UK-born workers were in short supply.A  was among those to reject a causal link between the arrival of migrant workers and the unemployment of UK-born workers. Where it allowed more room for debate was on pay. In some instances pay was depressed by migrant workers, but not by much, it said. Johnson＊s IFS shared this view.There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that doesn＊t show up in the studies to suggest that competition for work from migrants locked out UK-born workers and drove down rates of pay. Those who cite this argument range from architects in central London to agricultural workers in Lincolnshire.Many Vote Leave campaigners believe a crackdown on migrants would force companies to train UK-born workers for jobs that in recent years they recruited ※oven-ready§ foreign workers to perform. But many of the jobs in hospitality depend on people working long hours for low pay. A fear among hotel and restaurant owners is that if they increase the pay bill and add in the cost of training, customers will refuse to shoulder the higher costs and they will go out of business.Last month the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD) said employers saw little incentive to offer big pay rises because they are receiving an average of 24 applications for each low-skilled job. The CIPD said this would change after Brexit. Plenty of City economists believe a reduction in migrants would eventually feed through into higher pay. The question is whether the vacancies remain advertised when the economy is suffering and businesses rein in recruitment.Industries with skills shortages would have to move quickly to train their staff and new recruits. They should also introduce automation and robotic technology to overcome labour shortages and raise levels of productivity.Punam Birly, who advises companies on immigration at the consultancy group KPMG, says most countries operate similar immigration systems to that proposed in the Home Office leak and still manage to prosper.So once the uncertainty is out of the way, the UK should find a method for letting EU migrants stay for longer than is the case in the hard Brexit proposals. Then firms could implement investment plans that had been put on hold and reap the benefits. But the key is not repeat the mistakes of pre-credit crunch Britain, when the UK＊s productivity gains were largely snaffled by businesses and their shareholders."															
"Britain＊s efforts to expand trade in goods beyond the European Union＊s border took a knock in July after official figures showed the UK＊s deficit with the rest of the world widened following a drop in exports.The deficit in the trade in goods with non-EU countries widened by ?2.4bn while exports to the EU grew to cut the trade gap by ?1.3bn. The figures were released as a new report from thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said economic growth shows signs of accelerating in the UK, albeit still at a slower pace than in recent years.Analysts had expected the fall in the pound to give a significant boost to exports with the EU and beyond, but the trend since last year＊s Brexit vote has shown only a , despite the higher cost, leaving only a marginal improvement in the net trade position.Overall, UK exports of goods and services edged down 0.2% month on month in July and were up just 0.6% from one quarter to the next. At the same time the  as the fall in sterling fails to lift exports as much as expected. The Office for National Statistics added to the gloomy economic news with data showing that the manufacturing sector remained ※subdued§ in July and the  in new orders in the three months to the end of June, especially in the housebuilding sector., though this only meant reducing the loss of production of 0.6% in June to 0.1% in July. The ONS said a flurry of new car models helped the motor industry recover ground lost earlier in the year.The news came as the second of the UK＊s new generation of aircraft carriers, HMS Prince of Wales, was officially named in a ceremony at Rosyth Naval Dockyard on Friday. Liam Fox, the trade secretary, said 90% of the suppliers for the construction of the ?3bn boat and its sister ship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, were based in the UK. Set against the positive picture for manufacturing, there was worse news for the construction sector. Output dipped by 1.2% in July, the fourth consecutive month of contraction, while new orders fell to the lowest level since 2014 following an 8% slump. In a damaging development for the government, housing orders were down almost 10% on a year ago with public housing the worst affected.Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, described the trade, construction and manufacturing data as a ※mixed bag§ that showed the upbeat signals from some manufacturing industry surveys was starting to register in official data, though the trade and construction data ※point to a UK economy still struggling to break out of sluggish growth§.ONS senior statistician Kate Davies said: ※Manufacturing remains relatively subdued since the start of the year, though July showed the first significant monthly growth of 2017, with car production increasing partly thanks to new models rolling off the production lines. The usual period of summer maintenance of North Sea oil platforms also failed to materialise for a second month running. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers＊ trade body, said there was some good news from the export figures, which revealed ※robust numbers on manufactured exports§.She said: ※Double-digit year-on-year growth is carrying through to the start of the second half of the year. But the need to import materials and components at the same rate means the overall deficit isn＊t budging.§Industrial production appears to be helping to bolster GDP growth after the worst start to the year since 2012. The economy is expected to have grown by 0.4% in the three months to the end of August, according to NIESR. While that＊s still below the long run trend of about 0.6%, it＊s an improvement on the three months to the end of July, when the economy grew by just 0.2%. The mixed signals on the economy add to the conundrum facing interest rate setters at the Bank of England as they prepare to meet on Thursday. Rising inflation, hitting 2.6% in July and expected to head higher over the coming months, would usually be enough for Threadneedle Street .But weak growth and the stuttering  talks will probably convince them to stay put, according to economists. Philip Shaw, of City bank Investec, said the monetary policy committee will probably keep rates steady until 2019, while a rate hike this year is ※very unlikely§."															
" has left in its wake upended lives and enormous property damage, . But the storm that pummelled the Texas coast for the better part of a week also raises deep questions about the United States＊ economic system and politics.It is ironic, of course, that an event so related to climate change would occur in a state that is home to so many climate-change deniers 每 and where the economy depends so heavily on the fossil fuels that drive global warming. Of course, no particular climate event can be directly related to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But scientists have long predicted that such increases would boost not only average temperatures, but also weather variability 每 and especially the occurrence of extreme events such as Harvey. As , ※There is evidence that some extremes have changed as a result of anthropogenic influences, including increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.§ Astrophysicist Adam Frank : ※Greater warmth means more moisture in the air which means stronger precipitation.§To be sure, Houston and Texas could not have done much by themselves about the increase in greenhouse gases, though they could have taken a more active role in pushing for strong climate policies. But local and state authorities could have done a far better job preparing for such events, which hit the area with some frequency.In responding to the hurricane 每 and in funding some of the repair 每 everyone turns to government, just as they did in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis. Again, it is ironic that this is now occurring in a part of the country where government and collective action are so frequently rebuked. It was no less ironic when the titans of US banking, having preached the neoliberal gospel of downsizing government and eliminating regulations that proscribed some of their most dangerous and antisocial activities, turned to government in their moment of need.There is an obvious lesson to be learned from such episodes: markets on their own are incapable of providing the protection that societies need. When markets fail, as they often do, collective action becomes imperative.And, as with financial crises, there is a need for preventive collective action to mitigate the impact of climate change. That means ensuring that buildings and infrastructure are constructed to withstand extreme events, and are not located in areas that are most vulnerable to severe damage. It also means protecting environmental systems, particularly wetlands, which can play an important role in absorbing the impact of storms. It means eliminating the risk that a natural disaster could lead to the discharge of dangerous chemicals, as happened in Houston. And it means having in place adequate response plans, including for evacuation.Effective government investments and strong regulations are needed to ensure each of these outcomes, regardless of the prevailing political culture in Texas and elsewhere. Without adequate regulations, individuals and firms have no incentive to take adequate precautions, because they know that much of the cost of extreme events will be borne by others. Without adequate planning and regulation, including of the environment, flooding will be worse. Without disaster planning and adequate funding, any city can be caught in the dilemma in which Houston found itself: if it does not order an evacuation, many will die; but if it does order an evacuation, people will die in the ensuing chaos, and snarled traffic will prevent people from getting out.America and the world are paying a high price for devotion to the extreme anti-government ideology embraced by  and his Republican party. The world is paying, because cumulative US greenhouse-gas emissions are greater than those from any other country; even today, the US is one of the world＊s leaders in  greenhouse-gas emissions. But America is paying a high price as well: other countries, even poor developing countries, such as Haiti and Ecuador, seem to have learned (often at great expense and only after some huge calamities) how to manage natural disasters better.After the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the shutdown of much of New York City by Sandy in 2012, and now the devastation wrought on Texas by Harvey, the US can and should do better. It has the resources and skills to analyse these complex events and their consequences, and to formulate and implement regulations and investment programmes that mitigate the adverse effects on lives and property.What America doesn＊t have is a coherent view of government by those on the right, who, working with special interests that benefit from their extreme policies, continue to speak out of both sides of their mouth. Before a crisis, they resist regulations and oppose government investment and planning; afterwards, they demand 每 and receive 每 billions of dollars to compensate them for their losses, even those that could easily have been prevented. One can only hope that America, and other countries, will not need more natural persuasion before taking to heart the lessons of ."															
"The immigration strategy discussed in the leaked Home Office document could be as beneficial to British workers as the Black Death (, 6 September). My limited historical knowledge tells me that when the working population was decimated as the bubonic plague spread throughout Britain (and Europe), employers suddenly had to start treating the people working for them decently, even paying them enough to live on.Of course, the document fails to address the impact their proposals will have on every area of economic activity across the whole country: no more cheap crop harvesters, nurses, carers, shop assistants, road cleaners, office workers, taxi and bus drivers etc. Nor does it even think about the massive impact that having to pay people real wages will have on business finances across the whole economy.But that last comment shows it could bring an end to the real cause of the Brexit anger: the fact that wages have stagnated for the longest period in 150 years (, 6 September). Many Tories will again rejoice that they have at last taken us back to the 60s 每 the 1860s that is. In respect of the rights of EU citizens post-Brexit, it＊s often said that EU immigrants provide a major contribution to the economy and society. Is it not the case, then, that non-EU immigrants also provide a great contribution, usually under more financially adverse conditions? What is scandalous is the inequity of the present (pre-Brexit) immigration system. Pretty much all of the measures in the leaked document (including 每 yes 每 digital fingerprinting) have at some stage been part of my own immigration process, as a skilled non-EU migrant to the UK. Prior to my successful citizenship application, I paid UK taxes for seven years without the right to claim any form of benefit, while supporting a minor. Without exception, our passports have been checked on entry to the UK. None of this has been a problem: these are reasonable measures borne with a good humour by those of us who want to work in the great environment of the UK. If similar measures can be applied to all, that is only to be applauded. It is striking to note UK government proposals to end EU free movement rights as soon as the UK leaves the bloc in 2019. New rules would require EU nationals to seek permission before taking up a job, making employers recruit locally first. The impact of such a policy on Scotland will be devastating and it is no wonder that a plethora of major organisations have lined up to roundly condemn these proposals.There is clear evidence that Scotland＊s future economic health, key services such as the NHS, the strength of our key institutions such as our universities and our future public finances depend on the maintenance of the ability of EU nationals to work and study freely in Scotland. While the number of pensioners in Scotland is expected to rise by 28% over the next 25 years, worker numbers are only increasing by 1%. We therefore face an ageing population, but only marginal growth in the working-age population. Scotland needs immigrants to balance this out and these reckless proposals will?be absolutely devastating.In the run up to the EU referendum, senior figures in the leave campaign, such as Michael Gove, promised increased powers over immigration would come to Scotland should the UK vote to leave the EU. These pledges, like many others that were made in that campaign, have been predictably quickly forgotten.Scotland desperately need an immigration system that caters to the challenges we as a nation face, not one that shuts the door to much-needed talent. If there is any political morality at all, it is lower-skilled foreign workers whom the UK ought to be offering home to. High-skilled workers, by contrast, are a precious resource in their own countries, and it is these people whom we should say no to. Our long-standing policy of stripping emerging economies of the people they most need has benefited the first world at the expense of the developing world. It has also sustained our failure over the long term to encourage, train and reward our own employees properly, and it is a policy we should stop at once.  I trust the migration advisory committee, in providing evidence to underpin a new immigration policy, will ask UK citizens living in the other 27 countries of the EU, and in particular their family members, whether they would welcome the same ※plan§ being applied to them post-Brexit by the EU27. Mass immigration is only a benefit to those in control of large businesses that benefit from it. The general public suffers competition and depressed wages. If a company cannot survive without a constant flow of immigrants, it shouldn＊t be allowed to survive. If that means Londoners＊ refined sensibilities are hurt then so be it! "															
"Britain is locked into a ※low growth trajectory§ that will see GDP growth dip next year while the eurozone shrugs off  to stretch ahead, according to a leading business group.The British Chambers of Commerce said  and the failure of exporters to capitalise on the low pound meant the UK was ※treading water§.In the latest downbeat view of Britain＊s prospects as the  date nears, the BCC cut its growth rate forecast for 2018 to 1.2% from 1.3%. The prediction for 2019 was also lowered, to 1.4% from 1.5%. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank confirmed eurozone growth forecasts of 1.8% for 2018 and 1.7% for 2019 as the economic recovery of the single currency bloc continues.Adam Marshall, the BCC＊s director general, said: ※While some businesses report strong trading conditions, the UK economy as a whole is treading water, and there is no sign on the horizon of a return to healthier levels of growth.§Marshall said the outlook for 2017 was slightly healthier than previously thought, with a rise in the growth forecast from 1.5% to 1.6%, driven by a moderately stronger outlook for consumer spending growth in 2017. But he said the prospect of inflation returning to 3% by the end of the year and the likelihood that it would stay above wages growth throughout 2018 meant the current strength of consumer spending would falter.※Our forecast suggests that the hoped-for rebalancing of the UK economy towards investment and export is unlikely to materialise in the medium term. The rising upfront cost of doing business in the UK, the uncertainty around Brexit, and the constraints created by skills gaps and shoddy infrastructure collectively outweigh any benefit arising from the recent depreciation of sterling,§ he said.The situation could turn around, said Marshall, if No10 can hammer out  and the Treasury ※pulls out the stops§ to support business growth in the autumn budget with a series of commitments to infrastructure spending and extra public investment.In the meantime, export growth is being offset by the strength of demand for imports, despite the higher price of goods from abroad.Modest export growth of 3.1% this year is expected to slow to 2.9% in 2018 and 2.8% in 2019 while its import growth forecasts have been upgraded to 2.9% in 2017 from 2.5%, to 1.5% in 2018 from 1.3%, and to 2% in 2019 from 1.8%.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC, said: ※The changes to our growth forecast suggest that the UK economy is likely to remain on a low-growth trajectory.※It is increasingly clear that the post-EU referendum slide in the value of sterling has done more harm than good. Inflation is being driven by the sizable increases in the cost of imported raw materials over the past year, and is expected to remain a drag on consumer spending over the near term, with pay growth not expected to outpace price growth until 2019.※While the outlook for UK exporters is for modest growth, imports are expected to grow at a faster rate than we previously forecast, with little evidence that consumers or firms are switching away from imports towards domestic alternatives despite their rising cost. ※Although there remains considerable uncertainty over the UK＊s growth prospects, the risks to our current outlook are to the downside. On Brexit, our forecast implicitly assumes a relatively smooth exit from the EU. A more sudden departure would be likely to trigger a far more marked weakening in economic conditions.§The European Central Bank revised up its forecast for eurozone growth in 2017, to 2.2% from a previous forecast of 1.9%, which would be the strongest rate of annual growth in the single currency bloc in a decade.Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, said the 2017 growth forecast had been revised up because the economy had been stronger-than-expected in the first half of the year and was continuing to perform well.※Economic expansion, which accelerated more than expected in the first half of 2017, continues to be solid and broad-based across countries and sectors,§ he said at a press conference in Frankfurt, after the Bank announced its decision to leave interest rates and quantitative easing unchanged."															
															
"Most defences of development aid are, well, too defensive (, 21 April). What is classed as ※aid§ is more properly described as a small repayment towards the much greater sums we extract from poor countries. We free-ride on their education systems, especially by importing health workers. We extract raw materials under trade terms that systematically disadvantage them. We boost our corporate profits (some of which find their way into tax revenues) by exploiting their cut-price labour, exporting carbon emissions as a bonus. Our banks launder the proceeds of corruption among their elites (and again our treasuries benefit 每 at least some of the time). Our industrial fishing fleets decimate their waters. The list is endless. And all this before even considering historical factors such as colonial looting, slavery and past greenhouse gas emissions (now contributing to the very environmental and food crises which some of our ※aid§ then attempts to ameliorate). It＊s not a question of ※generosity§; it＊s a question of justice."															
"Rising prices and stagnant wage growth have resulted in the first fall in living standards in two and a half years, according to official figures. from the Office for National Statistics showed that regular pay in the UK in February was 1.9% higher than a year earlier and is running below the 2.3% increase in prices.Despite a fresh fall in unemployment and record job vacancies, economists expect the squeeze on real inflation-adjusted wages to intensify over the coming months as the weak pound affects the cost of living.The ONS reported a 39,000 increase in employment in the three months to February, while unemployment fell by 45,000 to 1.56m. The jobless rate remained unchanged at 4.7% 每 its joint lowest since 1975 每 and job vacancies stood at 767,000.Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, said: ※This is yet another strong set of figures, with unemployment at a rate that hasn＊t been beaten since the 1970s and more vacancies than ever before. More people are finding full-time jobs and average wages have grown yet again, meaning more families have the security of a regular wage.§But unions took a different view. Frances O＊Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: ※Pay packets are taking a hammering from rising inflation and falling wage growth. We now need urgent action to stop another living standards crisis. Working people will want to know when Theresa May is going to do something to help.※We need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better paid jobs. And it＊s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting midwives, teachers and other public servants.§The GMB union described the figures as ※disturbing§.The last time regular pay growth was weaker than headline inflation was in August 2014, when wages were growing by 1.2% while inflation was 1.5%. including bonuses was 2.9% higher in February than a year earlier, but the figure was flattered by City bonuses, which are usually handed out between December and April.In the three months to February regular wages rose 2.2%, marking the weakest pay growth since 2014, while earnings including bonuses rose 2.3%.This means households have even less money to spend, after seeing a rise in the prices of  over recent months as the slide in the pound since the Brexit referendum pushes up the cost of imported goods.The Resolution Foundation said 40% of the workforce were affected by falling real wages. Stephen Clarke, an economist at the thinktank, said: ※Britain＊s brief pay recovery has come to an end; 40% of the workforce are experiencing shrinking pay packets, according to the latest figures, in sectors ranging from accommodation to finance and the public sector. Many more will join them in the coming months as inflation continues to rise.※While the ＆national living wage＊ is protecting the lowest earners from this squeeze, boosting wages across the rest of the economy is the big living-standards challenge of this parliament.§It also means household spending, the main driver behind economic growth, is likely to slow in coming months.Martin Beck, a senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, said:This is bad news for consumer spending, a sector which is already showing signs of running out of steam. Granted, the apparent tightness of the jobs market may see pay growth suddenly break out significantly to the upside. But with pay remaining so unresponsive for so long, the chances of this happening look slim.§ Investec economist Chris Hare noted that despite continued employment growth, only 30,000 jobs were added to the economy in the six months to February, over the previous six months 每 the slowest pace of growth seen since mid-2013.Labour＊s shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, said: ※While we welcome the fall in unemployment, today＊s figures show the government＊s abysmal record on living standards is getting even worse. Real wages are now stagnating under the Tories and working families are worse off as a result.※The government has also failed to close the employment gap faced by women, disabled people and ethnic minority groups, who are all less likely to be in work. Labour will stand up for all working people. We will introduce a real living wage of ?10 per hour and reverse cuts to in-work support that could see some families worse off by ?2,600 a year.§"															
"Households in the UK are increasingly relying on borrowed money with one in four people seeking a loan applying for at least half of their annual income, according to new figures that will add to worries about Britain＊s mounting personal debt burden.The latest evidence of a rise in borrowing to fund new car purchases, holidays and to help clear older debts follows a . Banks, credit card companies and car loan providers could be dicing with a ※spiral of complacency§, the Bank＊s director for financial stability said on Monday.To analyse the rise in demand for debt, price comparison company MoneySuperMarket looked at 3m loan inquiries made on its site from January 2015 to March 2017 and found the average sum sought had increased by 3.5% in that time. It was now around ?8,958, compared with ?8,650 in 2015.The site found car and wedding loan values had increased by 6.6% and 8.4%, respectively.More than a quarter (28%) of inquiries were for loans that were equal to at least half of the person＊s annual income. Almost 10% of personal loan inquiries were from people hoping to borrow more than their annual income. Typically, those people wanted to borrow 131% of their earnings, the equivalent to an average ?5,058 above their annual salary of ?16,360.The analysis named Corby in the east Midlands as Britain＊s personal loans capital with borrowers there making more personal loan inquires than any other place in the UK. There were 75.5 inquiries per 1,000 residents, which was 47% higher than the UK average.Those in Halton in north-west England made the second highest number of inquiries, followed by Flintshire in Wales, Knowsley near Liverpool and Falkirk in Scotland. Londoners made the fewest inquiries, according to the MoneySuperMarket figures.The site said the most popular reason cited for taking out a loan was to buy a car. These made up 38% of inquiries. Consolidating personal debts was the second most common reason, accounting for 24% of all searches.Borrowers looking to improve their home made up a fifth of personal loan searches, hoping to take out ?10,357 on average. Holidaymakers accounted for 3% of searches. Those looking for a loan to fund their wedding made up just under 3% and typically hoped to borrow ?7,461 每 an 8.4% rise from 2015.The Bank of England has intensified  over recent months while keeping interest rates at a record low of 0.25%. Bank director Alex Brazier used his  to highlight a rise in household borrowing on credit cards, via car purchase schemes and using personal loans. Over the past year, household incomes have grown by just 1.5% but outstanding car loans, credit card balances and personal loans have risen by 10%, he said. He highlighted the rapid rise in personal contract purchase PCP plans 每 under which a car is in effect leased. Over the last decade, the number of cars bought this way has increased from one in five to four in five, Brazier said.Anti-poverty campaigners have warned that households are also turning to loans to make ends meet as . An analysis by the TUC in May warned that . The trades union group found the average unsecured debt per household 每 which excludes mortgages 每 stood at ?13,200 last year, only ?100 below the record reached in 2007."															
"ne of the reasons that economic growth is desirable is that it makes people more pleasant to be around. When we feel our wallets getting fatter, we tend to be more generous to those around us. This doesn＊t mean that rich people are nicer than poorer people. But a given individual is usually better to be around when their financial situation is improving 每 they might buy a couple of rounds at the pub, say 每 than when it＊s stagnating.What is true of people is also true of societies, as Benjamin Friedman has . Citizens of a growing economy are less violent to each other and more hospitable to immigrants. Which brings me to the extraordinary outbreak of venom in Australia recently. As Antoun Issa , the sheer tonnage of undisguised hatred in the media of late is as extraordinary as it is worrying. And while it＊s easy to dismiss the comments of those such as Rowan Dean or Prue MacSween as attention-seeking, it would be focusing too much on the supply of racist material and not enough on the demand for it. One reason I suspect is that we do not feel like they＊re getting any richer, and we＊re looking around for people to blame. Australians are indeed, on some economic measures, getting noticeably . One explanation is that we haven＊t quite worked off the hangover from the mining boom: as the economist Ross Garnaut , the end of the boom has led to stagnant incomes and a restless electorate. In addition, , unions that used to fight for wage increases have become weak. However, other people have taken to blaming Australia＊s high immigration rates for the slide. Leith van Onselen, for example, on the Bolt Report  that Victoria, which has seen the highest immigration rates in Australia, has seen the lowest per capita income increase in the country since the global financial crisis. Isn＊t that evidence that immigrants are lowering our living standards? The problem forVan Onselen is that he＊s got his economics wrong, and he＊s measuring the wrong thing. Changes in gross state product per capita 每 the indicator they＊re using 每 can＊t tell you anything about the impact of immigration on living standards. It＊s like comparing oranges in 2009 with a mix of apples and oranges in 2016. Let＊s call one group of people the ※original§ group 每 people who were already here in 2009 每 and the other the ※immigrant§ group, who＊ve moved here since then. Van Onselen compares the living standards of the ※originals§ in 2009 with the living standards of  originals and immigrants in 2016. This tells us nothing. What we want to measure is the change in the living standards of ※originals§ from 2009 to 2016 (and, if you like, the change for immigrants, but this would mean finding out what those were in their country of origin). This is much harder to measure, but there is some evidence to suggest that if you did the analysis properly, it would change Van Onselen＊s conclusions. Data from the 2016 census shows that income for recently arrived immigrants in Melbourne is on average substantially lower than it is for Australian-born residents. This means that the recent arrivals will ※drag down§ the average, even if they＊re better off than they were before moving to Australia, and even if they＊ve had no impact on the living standards of those who were already living in Melbourne. The academic literature supports the idea that immigration is not likely to make non-immigrants any poorer. Studies suggest that, on average, immigration has  impact on wages. On employment it＊s much the same: the  of research is that, statistically, immigrants either create more jobs than they ※take§, or that they have no impact on jobs at all.Of course, there is one other legitimate concern people have: that immigrants are straining Australia＊s limited resources. Our cities feel crowded and our natural resources are under pressure. But this is almost entirely Australia＊s own fault. We keep on spending billions of public and private dollars on white elephants like the Adelaide-Darwin rail line because we＊re too lazy to do the analysis required to allocate infrastructure money efficiently, or because politicians ignore analysis when it＊s done. We are , and an economically sensible scheme to reduce carbon emissions was abolished after one of the most deceitful political campaigns in Australian history. In other words, we are as a nation wasting our own resources through sheer political laziness and incompetence.Punishing aspiring immigrants for this would be like burning a bunch of $100 notes and then complaining that we didn＊t have enough money to give to charity. Blaming them for our problems also feeds the kind of doltish hysteria that we＊ve seen directed at high-profile immigrants recently. The economy may be turning sour, but that doesn＊t mean we have to as well. "															
"hree months before the start of the biggest financial crisis since the Wall Street Crash, the International Monetary Fund  Sure, there were risks, said the IMF, but these seemed less threatening in April 2007 than six months previously.The IMF was not, of course, the only organisation that failed to spot economic armageddon coming 每 merely the one with the highest number of PhDs on the books. But if the fund＊s patchy past record means all its forecasts should be treated with caution, its  looks perfectly reasonable.Official data for the state of the British economy in the first three months of this year were not available in April when the fund produced its half-yearly World Economic Outlook, but it assumed something stronger than the 0.2% expansion that was eventually announced. Even if the second, third and fourth quarters live up to the IMF＊s expectations, the weaker first quarter arithmetically feeds through into growth for 2017 as a whole of 1.7% rather than 2%.Although Wednesday＊s first estimate of second-quarter growth will show an improvement on the first quarter, it is clear that the UK economy was not going gangbusters in spring either. It looks likely that the UK posted growth of 0.3% or 0.4%, suggesting that the economy expanded at an annualised rate of 1% in the first half of 2017. A further IMF downgrade to about 1.5% in the autumn looks probable unless the stronger growth the IMF sees in the eurozone and the bigger emerging markets is sustained and leads to higher demand for UK exports.The IMF thinks the global economy is on the up, but is still hedging its bets. It is concerned that China is sustaining growth through a credit bubble. It is worried about Donald Trump launching a trade war. It fears that overvalued financial markets could be heading for a fall. Such caution is perhaps a decade too late, but understandable. The IMF has no desire to be caught with its trousers down a second time. So much for the idea that easyJet and , after a tricky 2016, were about to enjoy sunny trading conditions this year. That theory has been running for months, which is why the loss of altitude in share prices since last Thursday has been severe. EasyJet＊s shares have lost a 10th of their value and Ryanair＊s 5%.Monday＊s culprit was the Irish carrier＊s . A similar tale was heard at easyJet last week. The group upgraded its profit forecast for the year after a strong Easter, but reported ※continuing high market growth§ in capacity, especially in Spain and Portugal, putting pressure on prices.In one sense, this development is not surprising. It is easier for smaller rivals to buy new aircraft and add new routes when fuel prices are low. Nor does this year＊s experience dent the wisdom of  and Ryanair adding capacity themselves; they＊re market leaders and, if they see a long-term opportunity on a new route, they should chase it.But both easyJet and Ryanair may have been guilty of over-hyping the thought that rivals can＊t live with the pace they＊re setting. All that talk about rivals that struggle with ※high cost bases§ and ※inadequate financial resources§ 每 two lines from easyJet＊s full-year results last autumn 每 now ring a little hollow. Thankfully for flyers, those rivals are still capable of being irritating by surviving. ※Nothing can break the momentum you have established, and certainly not rumours,§ said  chief executive Pascal Soriot in a ※Dear all§ email to staff at the end of last week.No doubt the dispatch improved spirits, as well as the share price, but it pointedly avoided the central question of whether Soriot held discussions about joining Israeli outfit Teva Pharmaceuticals. He＊s clearly staying at AstraZeneca, but the quickest way to kill the gossip outright would be state that the Teva tale was 100% nonsense.Soriot will get another chance on Thursday, when he fields questions on AstraZeneca＊s half-year results. A clear answer would be preferable to the elaborate argument that commenting on speculation can create ※downstream consquences that may be difficult to manage§. Not commenting also has consequences: staff assume the boss＊s head was turned, even if only briefly. "															
"The  has told banks, credit card companies and car loan providers that they risk fresh action against reckless lending as it warned of a looming ※spiral of complacency§ about mounting consumer debt.In its toughest warning yet about the possibility of a rerun of the financial crisis that devastated the economy 10 years ago, Threadneedle Street admitted it was alarmed about the increase in the amount of money being borrowed on easy terms over the past year.※Household debt 每 like most things that are good in moderation 每 can be dangerous in excess§,  ※Dangerous to borrowers, lenders and, most importantly from our perspective, everyone else in the economy.§Brazier＊s said there were ※classic signs§ of lenders thinking the risks were lower following a prolonged period of good economic performance and low losses on loans., but Brazier＊s comments marked a ratcheting up of Threadneedle Street＊s rhetoric.※Lenders have been the lucky beneficiaries of the benign way the economy has evolved. In expanding the supply of credit, they may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of credit cards and loans in benign conditions,§ Brazier said., a period when the Bank expected growth to fall sharply.Over the past year, Brazier said, household incomes had grown by just 1.5% but outstanding car loans, credit card balances and personal loans had risen by 10%. He added that terms and conditions on credit cards and personal loans had become easier. The average advertised length of 0% credit card balance transfers had doubled to close to 30 months, while advertised interest rates on ?10,000 personal loans had fallen from 8% to around 3.8%, even though official interest rates had barely changed.The past decade has seen the number of cars bought with a personal contract purchase (PCP) plan 每 under which the car is effectively leased 每 increase from one in five to four in five. Companies risk losing money if used car prices fall and Brazier said banks involved and the shareholders of car companies would ※want to think very carefully about the risks§.He added that developments in mortgage debt had been much less striking than those in consumer debt and car finance, with lending for home loans up by just 3% over the past year. ※But even here there are some tentative signs of boundaries being pushed,§ he said.Strong competition for business was resulting in more lending at higher loan-to-income (LTI) multiples, with the share at an LTI above 4 increasing from 19% to 26% over the past two years. ※Lenders have not entered, but they may be dicing with the spiral of complacency,§ Brazier said, noting that as credit became cheaper it was taken up more widely and was serviced more easily.※The spiral continues, and borrowers rack up more and more debt. Lending standards can go from responsible to reckless very quickly. The sorry fact is that as lenders think the risks they face are falling, the risks they 每 and the wider economy 每 face are actually growing,§ Brazier said.The Bank director said banks and building societies were being supervised and had to prove to the regulator that they had safeguards in place against entering the spiral of complacency. Lenders were also being regularly stress tested to ensure that they could deal with very severe recessions without cutting back on their lending.In addition, the Bank had forced lenders to hold more capital in order to make them more resilient to losses on their loans.※By September we will have assessed whether the rapid growth has created any gap in the line. If it has, we＊ll plug it,§ Brazier said.Brazier said the defence lines did ※not eliminate the risks that borrowers and lenders take on when entering into a loan§ but that they ※safeguard everyone else 每 the wider economy 每 from collateral damage. They mean there＊s every prospect that we can make the economy a safer place than it has been in the past and that we can stop watching endless repeats of Debt Strikes Back.§His speech came just a fortnight before the 10th anniversary of the start of the global financial crisis in August 2007.※Ten years ago, an unsafe financial system caused financial crisis and economic disaster§, he said. ※The western banking system had expanded rapidly. Banks 每 and their regulators 每 had been blind to the basic fact that more debt meant greater risk of loss. ※Complacency gave way to crisis. Companies and households were unable to refinance their debts. The result was economic disaster. In this country alone, close to a million jobs were lost and more than 100,000 businesses failed. Too much debt made the financial system, and the economy, unsafe. Too many people paid the price when those risks materialised.§ "															
															
"ecord low wages growth has led the ALP and unions to believe that voters are willing for governments to take a more hands-on approach than has been the case since the Keating government introduced enterprise bargaining in the early 1990s. And, somewhat ironically, the very system of enterprise bargaining looks set to become a major political battleground.Last week, as the latest release of the  showed another record low in wages growth, the Department of Employment figures  showed much the same.In the March quarter, the average annual wage increase within the 761 agreements signed was just 2.7% 每 the lowest growth recorded since December 1991.The wage growth in EBAs is not directly comparable with the wage price index because the index looks back over the past year, whereas the annual growth in the EBA is an average over the length of the EBA (usually about three years) 每 so it is more of a forward-looking measure.EBAs are also much more likely to be negotiated by unions than are most workers＊ wages. , only about 15% of all workers are members of a trade union, but about 88% of the nearly two million workers operating under an EBA are under one negotiated by a union.Those covered by union-negotiated EBAs also generally have higher wage increases than the non-union ones:So it is not surprising that EBAs have had higher annual wage growth than the overall wage price index. But it is noticeable that the gap between the two measures has recently increased.And the news looking ahead is not good either. Since September 2012, the average wage growth of EBAs agreed each quarter has been below the average for all current EBAs except for one quarter 每 suggesting the overall average will continue to fall, and there is little sign of improvement:But what is more striking about the latest figures is not the low wage growth (hardly unexpected) but the decline in the number of people covered by EBAs.In the past four years the number of private sector workers covered by EBAs has dropped by 25%. In December 2013 there were 1.954m private sector workers operating under EBAs 每 in March this year it was 1.475m:The biggest drop has occurred in the retail trade sector, but it has occurred generally across all industries. There are 36% fewer EBAs in operation now than there were four years ago 每 and while there has been some drop in the public sector, overwhelmingly the decline has come from the private sector:It has led to a situation where there has been a sharp increase in the number of workers operating under an award 每 up from 10% in 2010 to now 24%:This area will be the main industrial relations battlefield at the next election, and one of the major issues is the increase in EBA terminations during the bargaining of a new agreement.This issue has arisen since the Fair Work Commission＊s decision to terminate the Aurizon EBA in April 2015. That decision drastically changed the nature of the EBA 每 from being based on the assumption it would be ongoing until renegotiated; to being able to be terminated during the bargaining process and threatening to put workers back on award rate conditions.The ALP＊s employment spokesperson, Brenan O＊Connor,  to the Sydney Institute  in which he pledged to end the ability of employers to follow this ※nuclear option§.It is a stance echoed by the president of the ACTU, Ged Kearney, who argues that ※cancelling agreements is a new form of industrial blackmail§ and that ※the precedent set by the Fair Work Commission＊s ruling on Aurizon is being exploited by companies which now use termination of agreements as a bargaining tool§.There certainly has been an increase in the number of EBAs terminated. The Department of Employment, in its submission to the Senate inquiry into ※Incidence of, and trends in, corporate avoidance of the Fair Work Act 2009§ found that there had been an increase in terminations, but that up until that time (mid-2016) most had involved a small numbers of workers:However, the issue is a live one 每 in the past week, Unilever have sought to terminate the EBA for its Street Ice Cream factory workers in western Sydney.On the employers＊ side,  has argued that the increase in terminations is not evidence that the enterprise bargaining system is broken. It argues that, despite the high-profile terminations ※each year, on average, 17,000 enterprise agreements are approved by the commission§.But the data released last week show that there has been a sharp drop in the approvals of new EBAs since 2012:The ACTU also notes that since 2014 only 8.5% of the agreements terminated were made during the WorkChoices era, ※whereas the remainder were those underwritten by a requirement to not disadvantage employees compared to the award (26.3%) or ensure employees were better off overall compared to the award (65.2%)§. Ged Kearney argues that ※employers should not be able to hold the threat of termination of agreements over workers＊ heads. It＊s converting the bargaining system into a tool to cut pay and living standards when it was supposed to be about improving people＊s lives§Pointedly, she says of this practice, ※it must end§.That employer groups seem more happy with the current enterprise bargaining system than unions probably gives a good indicator of how it is being used. And after a quarter of a century during which the ALP, for the most part, has been wary of taking an overly interventionist approach to IR, it appears that (as with their thinking on negative gearing) they believe the time is ripe for a shift in policy.With workers now almost resigned to low wage growth, the belief that a hands-off approach to IR is the best for the economy 每 and workers 每 might be ready to be challenged."															
"hings have moved on in the civil service since the days of Yes Minister. Back then senior civil servants remained the soul of discretion even after retirement. When , Sir Humphrey Appleby, he does it over lunch at a Pall Mall club.Lord Macpherson, until recently the Treasury＊s top mandarin, has some advice for the current government: it＊s time to move on from quantitative easing, the scheme that has been pumping electronic money into the economy since early 2009.Not for Macpherson a quiet word over an agreeable bottle of claret. Instead, : ever bigger doses are needed to get a high.Did Macpherson say this when he was working for Alastair Darling, who originally gave the , or George Osborne, who said the economy needed more of it? We won＊t know that until the records of the Great Recession and its aftermath are released in a couple of decades, but if he did the warning was not heeded.The best that can be said for QE is that it helped prevent an even deeper slump in the winter of 2008-09 but was of less importance than the re-capitalisation of the banks and the deep, co-ordinated cuts in interest rates from central banks.There were also better ways to boost demand. To an extent QE merely compensated for the fiscal austerity announced by Osborne (and strongly supported by Macpherson). What＊s more, much of the extra money swilling around the economy found its way into speculation rather than into remedying the economy＊s structural weaknesses. Rich people benefited because the value of their homes and share portfolios went up; poor people suffered because commodity prices also went up, raising food and fuel prices.So Macpherson is right. QE was never particularly effective, was always fundamentally inequitable and has been left in place for too long. Central banks know this, which is why the US Federal Reserve will soon starting selling bonds and why the financial markets will be all agog for any hints from  about when the European Central Bank might do the same.The issue is not whether central banks should wean themselves off QE but whether they can do so without bringing to an end the tepid recovery in the global economy. Macpherson＊s tweet was in response to a warning by Rupert Harrison, Osborne＊s chief economic adviser, that the ECB risked a ※car crash§ if it abandoned QE too quickly. When you are hooked it can awfully hard to kick the habit.In the past couple of months Donald Trump has tried and , threatened North Korea with war,  and lost the confidence of those running America＊s big corporations. Since this catalogue of misfortune seems to have had zero impact on Wall Street, it is worth contemplating what might shake the markets out of their complacency. How about the government running out of money and repudiating its debts? The US Treasury hit the borrowing limit set by Congress in March and has since been unable to issue any new debt. It has been making ends meet since by running down its reserves but you can only live off fat for so long and the cash will be used up by mid-October.On the assumption that the US won＊t want to leave it until a minute to midnight to sort things out, the debt ceiling will need to be raised within the next few weeks. That＊s cutting things fine, especially since some Republicans in the  are insisting that raising the ceiling should be contingent on public spending cuts and that will mean a real struggle to get the necessary bipartisan support in the Senate.There are two ways the issue could be resolved. Trump could use his authority to prod Congress into raising the ceiling. Or a run on shares caused by fears of a default could concentrate minds. Given that Trump has no authority, the latter is favourite."															
"nce a customer has barked their order into the microphone at the Popeyes drive-thru on Prospect Avenue, Kansas City, the clock starts. Staff have a company-mandated 180 seconds to take the order, cook the order, bag the order and deliver it to the drive-thru window.The restaurant is on ※short shift§ at the moment, which means it has about half the usual staff, so Fran Marion often has to do all those jobs herself. On the day we met, she estimates she processed 187 orders 每 roughly one every two minutes. Those orders grossed about $950 for the company. Marion went home with $76.Despite working six days a week, Marion, 37, a single mother of two, can＊t make ends meet on the $9.50 an hour she gets at Popeyes (no apostrophe 每 founder Al Copeland joked he was too poor to afford one). A fast food worker for 22 years, Marion has almost always had a second job. Until recently, she had been working 9am-4pm at Popeyes, without a break, then crossing town to a janitorial job at Bartle Hall, the convention center, where she would work from 5pm to 1.30am for $11 an hour. She didn＊t take breaks there either, although they were allowed.※I was so tired,§ she says. ※If I took a break I would go to sleep, so I would work straight through,§ she says.Even with those two jobs, Marion was unable to save 每 and when disaster struck she found it impossible to cope financially. Last month, the city condemned the house she rented 每 the landlord had refused to fix faulty wiring and the leaking roof 每 and she was made homeless.Her children, Ravyn, 15, and Rashad, 14, are now living with a friend, two bus rides away. Because of the time and distance, Marion hasn＊t seen them in a week. She and her dog Hershey, a goofy milk-chocolate colored pitbull, are sleeping at the apartment of fellow fast food worker, Bridget Hughes: Marion on the sofa, Hershey on the balcony.It＊s a downtrodden two-bedroom apartment in a sketchy neighborhood. Sex workers stake out the busier street corners; many of the houses are boarded up or burnt out. The detritus of drug addiction litters the streets.While she tries to save for a deposit on a new home, Marion is sharing with Bridget＊s husband, Demetrius, and their four children. ※Not having a home, honestly, you guys, it makes me feel like I am a failure. Like I have let my kids down,§ says Marion, sitting among the plastic bags that hold her life. The rest of her family＊s belongings are stored in a van downstairs, a van she can＊t drive because she hasn＊t got the money to get it insured.After she quit her janitorial job, hoping to find something more flexible so she could see more of her children, Marion started interviewing for a second job in fast food. ※I have always needed two jobs. You basically need two jobs to survive working on low wages,§ she says. Working so hard for so little security makes her feel ※like I am getting nowhere,§ she says. ※My family is not benefiting. I＊m working so hard to come home, and still I have to decide whether I am going to put food on the table or am I going to pay the light bill, or pay rent.※It makes me feel like a peasant. In a way it＊s slavery. It＊s economic slavery.§Unsurprisingly, Marion seems depressed. She looks down when she talks, raising her big, sad eyes only when she has finished. But her whole face lights up when she talks about her kids. ※They are my world,§ she says. ※[They] brighten up my soul.§ She worries that all this pressure is bad for her 每 self-diagnosed 每 high blood pressure. Like  other Americans, she doesn＊t have health insurance. She hasn＊t seen a doctor in her adult working life.Bridget and Demetrius are hardly doing better. She earns $9 an hour at Wendy＊s, Demetrius makes $9.50 an hour working at a gas station. Rent and bills, including childcare, come to about $800 a month, and they are barely scraping by, living paycheck to paycheck. Hughes says she has missed her children＊s graduations, doctors＊ appointments. She tears up as she explains how economic necessity meant she was forced to return to work two weeks after she last gave birth, and had to give up breastfeeding.ut Marion and Hughes are fighters, figureheads in what some see as the next wave of the civil rights movement. The pair are leading voices in , the local chapter of the union-backed Fight for $15 movement, which is campaigning for a nationwide increase in the minimum wage. And they are determined to make a difference.The Fight for $15 movement is probably the most high profile, and successful, labor movement in the US, and has successfully pushed for local raises in the minimum wage across the country, mostly in Democratic strongholds. Trump comfortably won  in 2016, although the major cities 每 Kansas City, St Louis and Columbia 每 voted Democrat. But the pair are confident that by coming together, the millions of Americans working low wage jobs can effect change even now.※It＊s not just us, it＊s all across America,§ says Hughes. She says she felt ※invisible§ before the Fight for $15 movement.On 14 April 2015, campaigners held what was then the  by low-wage workers in US history. About 60,000 workers took to the streets in cities across the country calling for an increase in the minimum wage.When protesters came to Marion＊s restaurant, she says most of the staff moved to the back of the restaurant to distance themselves from the activists while her corporate boss ※smirked and laughed§ as they read their demands and said what they needed. ※I looked at him and I thought, ＆You don＊t have these worries＊,§ she says. ※How can you laugh at someone else＊s pain? And I am going through the same thing. That＊s when I joined the Fight for $15.※There is wave. There is momentum. I think that with all of working together, we will win $15 in the end,§ she says.It＊s been almost a decade since the Great Recession, and America has witnessed a record 82 months of month-on-month jobs growth. The national unemployment rate now stands at a 4.3%,  But month after month, it is the low-wage sectors 每 fast food, retail, healthcare 每 that have added new jobs. Wage growth has barely kept pace with inflation. The national minimum wage ($7.25) was Across the US, 58 million people earn less than $15 an hour; 41 million earn less than $12. In Missouri, Kansas City and St Louis councils recently passed local ordinances that would have increased the minimum wage 每 to $13 an hour by 2023 in .But backed by local and national business interests, Missouri＊s governor, Eric Greitens 每 a bestselling author, former Navy Seal and a rising Republican star 每 has moved to roll back the increases, arguing businesses can＊t afford raises and will leave. ※Liberals say these laws help people,§ Greitens said in a . ※They don＊t. They hurt them.§Not so, says David Cooper, senior economic analyst at the Economics Policy Institute. ※We have  on this and it all concludes that increases in the minimum wage have had negligible impact on jobs growth,§ he says. The academic debate is currently about whether that impact is a small gain in growth or a small drop. Either way, he says, a small rise in the minimum wage has an outsized impact on low wage workers. A $1 an hour rise from the current minimum of $7.25 would give the average low wage worker $2,000 more a year, says Cooper. ※That is a huge injection of income,§ he says.The intense lobbying against an increase is ※simply a device to keep wages as low as possible so that employers can capture as much profit as they can§, he says. Polls show that the majority of Americans are in favor of an increase. At least 40 cities and states around the country will raise their minimum wages in 2017, thanks largely to ballot measures. Those measures will deliver raises of around $4,000 a year for more than one-third of the workforce in states like New York and California, according to the National Employment Law Project.But Greitens is not alone in fighting back, helped by a study of the impact of Seattle＊s minimum wage hike by the University of Washington, which seemed to suggest higher wages had translated to fewer jobs. That the methodology of that study has been heavily criticized (※§, according to Josh Hoxie, director of the Project on Opportunity and Taxation at the  ) and stands in contrast to piles of studies that found the opposite hasn＊t negated its popularity with anti-wage hikers.arion isn＊t in it for the politics. She is in it for the money, money that means one thing for her: getting her family back together and giving them a secure life. We pick her up at Popeyes and drive to a pleasant Kansas City suburb. Cicadas thrum as she beams strolling from the car to hug her daughter Rayven and goddaughter Shi＊ Ann.Shi＊ Ann, in her rainbow hued ※LOVE§ T-shirt (the ※O§ is a butterfly), plays with princess flip-flops and squirms, giggling in Marion＊s arms. ※Princesses don＊t put their fingers in their mouths,§ laughs Marion. I ask Rayven how it is living without her mum. The idyll is over. Tears fill her eyes. Marion goes inside so we can＊t see her cry. Later, Marion says Rayven wants to leave school at 16 and get a job in fast food to help out. Ideally, her mum wants her to go to college but nothing is ideal for the Marion family at present.After the visit, we drive back into the city to All Souls Unitarian church where Marion and Hughes are set to address a panel of academics, union leaders and others. The neighborhood is a world away from their own. A giant Louise Bourgeois spider menaces a manicured lawn at the Kemper art museum close by. The two women are unintimidated. They hold the room with ease as they talk about their fight with humor and a confidence that things will change.Guests ask why they don＊t go back to school, get higher paid jobs. Hughes has a college degree but as the daughter of a low wage worker said she could only afford community college. Employers saw her degree as ※worthless§, and she ended up $13,000 in debt. She did have a job in a tax office but lost it only to find that thanks to Missouri＊s business-friendly rules, she was barred from working for another tax office by a non-compete agreement. (Fast food franchisor Jimmy John＊s imposed a similar agreement on its workers but last year after a public backlash.) Barred from tax office work, Hughes said fast food was all she could find.Marion says the argument that fast food workers should leave for other, better paid, jobs misses the point. People like fast food. The companies that make it make fortunes. ※We are the foot soldiers for these billion-dollar companies. We are the ones doing the work and bringing the money,§ she says.※At the top of America, when it comes to Trump and them, their goal is to keep us down,§ she says. ※Between these billion-dollar companies and Trump, it＊s a power trip.§They can afford to pay more and, she believes, eventually they will. ※We are still coming. No war has been won over night and we are not giving up.§More than that, she likes working in fast food. ※I love it. I＊m good at it. Just like Martin Luther King said, ＆If you are going to be a road sweeper, be the best damn sweeper there is＊,§ she says. ※I don＊t know. It＊s just this society is all messed up.§"															
"Household spending has fallen at the fastest rate in almost four years as rising prices have made consumers less willing to splash out on furniture, clothing and trips out.Spending fell by 0.3% between April and June compared with the same period a year earlier, the biggest drop since the third quarter of 2013, according to Visa＊s consumer spending index.The report provides the latest evidence that cash-strapped consumers are more reluctant to spend money on non-essential items as . Spending on household goods fell 3.4% in June compared with a year earlier, while recreation and culture spending dropped for the first time in four years, down 1.2%. Clothing and footwear spending was down 0.5%.※June data provides further evidence that an increase in the cost of living, coupled with slowing wage growth, are beginning to squeeze household disposable income,§ said Kevin Jenkins, UK and Ireland managing director at Visa.※It＊s clear that inflation is beginning to affect shopping habits, with consumers diverting their spending to essentials. Spend on food and drink grew by nearly 2%, while household goods suffered from a substantial drop as consumers cut back on big-ticket furniture and homewares.§Official figures to be published on Wednesday are expected to show that wage growth including bonuses slowed to 1.8% year-on-year in the three months to May, from 2.1% in the three months to April. It would be the slowest rate of growth since the beginning of 2016, and would widen the gap between pay growth and inflation, which stands at 2.9%.Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, said there was little sign of a pickup in wage growth in the coming months, intensifying the squeeze on household finances. She said that the weak outlook for pay was likely to discourage the from raising interest rates for the time being.※The lack of upward momentum in pay growth, in several economies including the UK and US, has been a central talking point of late as policymakers debate the cause of this and what this implies for the stance of monetary policy,§ she said. ※In the UK context, we suspect the lack of pay growth will help the MPC [monetary policy committee] delay any normalisation until Brexit uncertainties facing the UK economy have died down.§ The Visa report is the latest sign that consumers are growing more reluctant to commit to big spending decisions. according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, ending five years of solid growth.There are also signs that housing market demand is cooling, with , to ?218,390."															
" hung parliament. Inflation going up but growth slowing. A divided nation ill at ease with itself. Welcome back to the 1970s, like now a time when Britain was forced to take a long, painful look at itself.Make no mistake, this is a good thing. Whether you are in favour of hard Brexit, soft Brexit, clean Brexit or no Brexit, it should be clear that there is something fundamentally wrong with the economy. The same old problems keep surfacing: too small an industrial base; too much debt; too great a geographical divide between the rich south and the rest of the country; too many poorly paid low-productivity jobs. Ministers boast about the underlying strength of the economy but reach for the wrong 1970s David Bowie reference when they suggest everything is hunky dory. It＊s more a case of always crashing in the same car.In the 1970s, both left and right were agreed that the economy required fundamental changes. The Conservatives had Thatcherism, a blast of the free market designed to shake Britain out of what was seen as corporatist complacency; Labour had the Alternative Economic Strategy built around nationalisation, planning agreements between state and industry, and reflation behind tariff walls.Thatcherism won that battle and not since has there been the desire to do anything remotely as radical. In the 1980s, it was possible for Britain to convince itself that the financial sector could fill the hole left by the decline of manufacturing. But the big bang in the City was not the solution. In the 1990s, the economy had a purple patch when the big devaluation of sterling after departure from the exchange rate mechanism coincided with strong world growth following the collapse of communism. But globalisation too proved no panacea.By the 2000s, Britain＊s economic model involved attracting hot money into the City of London, which kept the pound nice and strong. An overvalued exchange rate meant that cheap imports from emerging markets such as China became even cheaper. Inflation was duly tamed, which meant that the Bank of England could keep interest rates low. The availability of easy-terms credit encouraged people to load up on debt in order to buy houses, which rose sharply in value, making people feel richer even though they weren＊t really. This approach crashed and burned in the crisis of 2007-08, which should have been the time for a rethink. Regrettably, the bad old habits proved hard to break.Halfway through the 2010 parliament, David Cameron and George Osborne had a problem. They had arrived in office promising a different economic model that would be less dependent on private and public debt, and the result was that taxes were raised and public spending was cut to rid Britain of its budgetary incontinence. Businesses would be encouraged to invest by the commitment to reduce the budget deficit, while the Bank of England＊s easy money regime would ensure that the economy kept growing at a reasonable pace.Things didn＊t work out as planned and the reason they didn＊t was that Cameron and Osborne failed to understand just how structurally weak the economy was. They assumed that it wouldn＊t really matter if consumer spending was flat and the housing market a bit depressed because growth would pick up elsewhere 每 in manufacturing, exports and investment 每 to compensate.But there was no rebalancing. Without the consumer and the housing market, it was not a case of different growth, it was a case of no growth. Fearful of losing the 2015 election, steps were taken to get the housing market moving. Five years on, Theresa May and Philip Hammond have the same problem. Consumers are being squeezed by higher inflation and have already run down their savings. Activity in the housing market has stalled because the mini-boom set off by Cameron and Osborne has run its course. Across large parts of the country, property has become unaffordable. But, as in 2012, there is scant evidence of the other bits of the economy picking up the baton. Surveys of manufacturing have been strong in recent months but  Exports were up in the latest quarter but not by nearly as much as the government might have hoped given the fall in the value of sterling. As ever, UK manufacturers are finding it hard to resist the temptation to take advantage of a cheaper pound to raise prices rather than to secure bigger market share.So that＊s the position. Rightly, the Bank of England is getting a bit concerned about the levels of personal debt that it has helped to generate by almost a decade of ultra-low interest rates and copious amount of quantitative easing. Geographically sundered, Britain is in the curious position of simultaneously having the problems both of a developed country and a developing country: overheating in London and the south-east, the need to nurture growth in the rest of the country.These deep-seated issues require structural change, which is why industrial policy is back in vogue. The government＊s on the subject was published in January and set out 10 areas for attention, including upgrading infrastructure, encouraging inward investment and skills, and cultivating world-leading sectors.But as a new report to be published on Monday points out, the vast majority of the actions detailed in the green paper were things the government was already doing or were modest initiatives already in the pipeline.The one notable exception, according to a , has been investing in science, research and technology. Here, there has been some new money: Hammond announced almost ?5bn of funding for R&D for the period up until 2020-21.But as the report details, the R&D spending is being targeted at a narrow range of sectors 每 healthcare and medicine, robotics and artificial intelligence, batteries, self-driving vehicles, materials for the future, and satellites and space technology.This approach 每 picking winners by any other name 每 has the attraction of being at the cutting edge of change. The downside, Forthergill, Gore and Wells note, is that these sectors account for employment in only a tiny fragment (around 1% of the economy) and 10% of jobs in manufacturing.What＊s more, the money will be heavily channelled to those parts of the country that are rich in R&D centres: an arc to the immediate north, west and south of London. The report concludes, rightly, that the government＊s focus is too narrow to provide a basis for the revival of British industry. It will be great for Cambridge, which has twice as many scientific research and development jobs as the whole of the Midlands, and more than Scotland and Wales combined. For the bits of the country that really require help, it will be a god-awful small affair."															
"June shone a little brighter for Donald Trump＊s plans to make America great again. After several months of disappointing jobs growth, US hiring picked up steam again. But beneath the surface there＊s a problem for the president: the  appears to be running out of gas.On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the US had  in June, comfortably beating expectations. But, once again, most of those jobs were in low-paying industries, and wages are barely keeping pace with inflation. Manufacturing languished while food services and healthcare led the pack.The numbers were the latest in a strange series of figures coming out about the US that point to an economy that seems almost becalmed, with every positive economic point countered by its opposing force: a strong job market and rising consumer confidence, but lower automotive and retail sales and low overall consumer spending.The most worrying number for Trump is arguably GDP. The growth in gross domestic product 每 the broadest measure of US economic health 每 is sluggish, to say the least. And Trump,  assumes he will double the rate of growth, has gone all out, promising that his business acumen will soon change that.※I really believe it,§ Trump said in an interview with  in April. ※We＊re saying 3% but I say 4 over the next few years. And I say there＊s no reason we shouldn＊t be able to get at some point into the future to 5 and above.§So far, the numbers aren＊t supporting him. The US economy grew 1.6% in 2016, its worst performance since 2011, and this year is hardly off to a roaring start. The commerce department released its third 每 and final 每 estimate of GDP growth for the first quarter last month, and it came in at a measly 1.4%.This in an economy where, as the president has been keen to highlight, stock markets are at record highs, there is close to full employment, the oil price remains low and inflation is under control.Arguably the US is still in Obama＊s economy 每 but that argument won＊t hold forever. And while Trump will no doubt continue to blame his predecessor for this era of slow growth, economists are not convinced he can do much to change it.Gus Faucher, the chief economist at PNC Bank, said the likelihood of returning to the years of 3-4% growth any time soon looks increasingly unlikely. US GDP has not exceeded 3% per annum for a record-breaking 11 years. ※Economic growth under President Trump looks a lot like economic growth under President Obama,§ said Faucher.With the unemployment rate at a 16-year low after 81 consecutive months of growth, goosing a little extra gas out of the economy would mean adding more workers. Labor markets have tightened, and Faucher said the data, and his anecdotal experience, suggests employers are struggling to find skilled workers. ※There＊s a real shortage of people with the right skills out there,§ said Faucher. Immigration would be one way around that problem. ※But that doesn＊t seem very likely,§ he said.Another potential boost for business 每 Trump＊s planned tax reform 每 is stalled in Congress, and his plans for massive infrastructure spending are also likely to face political headwinds, and in any case could be a mixed blessing. While huge investment in much needed improvements to America＊s road, rail and airport network would boost productivity in the long run, in a tight labor market it would pitch business against federally funded projects for skilled workers. ※The time to do these kinds of projects is in an era of higher unemployment,§ said Faucher.A recently published report by  on the future of work also undermined many of Trump＊s claims over employment and a promised 4% GDP growth.America is getting old and will not have the workforce to support major growth. By 2024, nearly 25% of the workforce is projected to be 55 or older (more than twice the share in 1994). Many of those workers, the Shift commission found, may be staying in the workforce not because they want to, but because they have to. Nearly 30% of respondents 55 and over claimed to have zero retirement savings, and 26% had $50,000 or less.Numbers are tricky, and the world of work has changed, making it hard for many to see the good news in the jobs report and other economic statistics, said Roy Bahat, head of Bloomberg Beta and co-chair of the Shift Commission. ※We have a disconnect between the economic statistics and the facts and feelings about what people are going through,§ he said.For those 每 like Trump 每 pinning their hopes on a return to higher growth, there may be even worse news. According to Princeton economist Robert Gordon, there is evidence that the US has taken growth for granted and that a unique, 250-year-old period of growth is over.In his book The Rise and Fall of American Growth, Gordon argues the kind of rapid economic growth currently considered normal, and expected to continue forever, was in fact a one-time-only event.Gordon argues the impact of technology can not compare with the impact of the first industrial revolution, which brought steam engines and railroads, and the second, which brought us electricity, the internal combustion engine, running water and indoor toilets, to name a few of its society-shaking changes.The first two industrial revolutions took about 100 years to filter through society. By contrast, the benefits of the technological/digital age ran out of steam in decades, and have failed to support the sort of growth rates we had come to expect as ※normal§.But, , perhaps higher growth rates never were normal. There was ※virtually no economic growth before 1750, suggesting that the rapid progress made over the past 250 years could well be a unique episode in human history rather than a guarantee of endless future advance at the same rate.§※Yes, we are ＆gigantically＊ ahead of where our counterparts were in 1870, but our progress has slowed, and we face stronger barriers to continued growth than were faced by our ancestors a century or two ago,§ he writes."															
"rguments for the Bank of England to raise interest rates are many and growing. It＊s why an increasing number of Threadneedle Street policymakers have voted for a rise and even the governor Mark Carney has felt the need to hint that an .Top of the list is the business cycle. This esoteric term is often used in economic circles to describe the natural lifespan of an economic boom, or at least consistent expansion.The concern is that this period is just what its proponents say it is 每 natural 每 and is nearing its end. Any attempt to delay this process is just storing up trouble for the future.The most immediate analogy is the 2008 financial crash. It can be argued that the natural business cycle was coming to an end in 2003. The economy was slowing as many important industries paused for breath after a good eight years of expansion. Gordon Brown, being a good Keynesian, had promised to end boom and bust. To this end, he opened the public spending taps and gave the economy a modest boost. In response, UK plc sailed on.Without going into too much of the history, he missed the fact that more of the boost to borrowing was coming from the banks 每 as were his tax receipts 每 so when the economy was hit sideways by the US sub-prime disaster, the UK suffered more than most 每 and more than it would have done if some of the excesses had been weeded out by a milder slowdown five years earlier.The Bank of England is worried that the UK stands in the foothills of the same debt mountain. Public spending is under pressure to ameliorate the worst of an economic slowdown while the banks, still wedded to a bonus culture that spurs reckless lending, are shovelling money out of the door in any way they can. At the moment that means unfeasibly . Who knows what they＊ll be up to tomorrow? To those who worry about unstable financial markets, what this situation needs is calming down.Regulators are trying to keep a check on the finance industry＊s worst excesses with . Last week the Bank of England demanded that lenders re-examine the worst-case scenarios they use when lending to businesses and individuals, amid fears that banks are basing their decisions on a benign economic environment lasting forever.Regulators have their uses, say the supporters of higher interest rates, but there is nothing the banks understand better than a hike in the cost of borrowing: they must pass it on and it must prevent the flakiest customers from accessing credit. More than that, there would be a cleansing of the stock of debt. This means that many of the firms and individuals who have borrowed large sums and are so broke they struggle to pay the interest on their loans would be exposed.Next on the list is the exodus of migrant workers as they return to their home nations across the Channel. This movement of people is expected to raise pay rates for the domestic population and feed through into higher prices. With inflation already at 2.9%, the thinking goes that the effect of the weaker pound on import costs, although waning in the second half of the year, will be superseded by higher wages as a spur for inflation. To calm down wage-induced inflation, what could be better than higher interest rates?If a central bank policymaker subscribes to these arguments, they might see themselves voting in August to reverse the emergency interest rate cut made last year 每 the one made in response to the panicky aftermath of the  vote. Two more rises could follow in 2018, should the expected inflationary pressures stay in place., one of the three policymakers to vote for a rise at the monetary policy committee＊s meeting last month, qualified his call for a rise when he told the : ※If rates do go up, it will be in the context of the economy doing OK and unemployment being low and probably falling.§And there lies the problem. The economy is  and the main measure of economic activity, GDP, is likely to slump in the second half of the year.Saunders says the Brexit negotiations are no constraint on MPC decision-making. But the uncertainty created by the Brexit talks is a key reason his colleagues will reject a rise. This is the kind of denial of realpolitik that we have come to expect from some  officials: everyone can see it is just too risky to increase the cost of credit when David Davis is in the middle of a tense arm-wrestle with Michel Barnier.The atmosphere is already heavy with doubt and uncertainty. Inevitably, a rate rise in this context would be seen as irresponsible.Next year, the economic situation will be the same or worse. And in the years after Brexit, wages growth will remain stuck in first gear, while big businesses scan the EU for cheap locations to build their next factory. So when will interest rates rise? Not for a very long time."															
" has waded into the escalating cabinet row over public-sector pay, throwing his weight behind calls for the 1% ceiling on wage rises to be lifted for austerity-weary workers including nurses and teachers.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has come under increasing pressure to  since the general election deprived Theresa May of her majority. Johnson is the latest cabinet heavyweight to demand a change of direction.※The foreign secretary supports the idea of public-sector workers getting a better pay deal and believes the findings of the pay review bodies should be respected,§ a senior government source told the Guardian.His intervention follows , the environment secretary 每 whose entry into the Conservative leadership race last summer thwarted Johnson＊s own bid 每 and from, and the  in extra schools funding. It is fresh evidence that collective cabinet responsibility, which usually keeps major disagreements between senior ministers behind closed doors, has all but collapsed since the Conservatives＊ majority was wiped out in last month＊s general election.Amid the calls for the pay cap to be lifted, the Treasury has been keen to stress that any extra spending would have to be made up from tax rises or spending cuts elsewhere.Johnson believes the message on doorsteps was that pay and public services are pressing issues, a view shared by an increasingly vocal group of Tory backbenchers, including South Cambridgeshire＊s MP, Heidi Allen, the former GP Sarah Wollaston and the MP for Plymouth Moor View, Johnny Mercer. Downing Street appeared to hint at a change of heart over the controversial policy last Wednesday, acknowledging that the public were ※weary§ after seven years of cuts. But with the autumn budget still months away, the chancellor is refusing to have his hands tied and later the same day, May＊s official spokesman repeatedly insisted that ※the policy has not changed§.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: ※It＊s clear that cabinet ministers are panicking but if they really wanted to show that they understood the concerns of public sector workers they would say now [that] they＊re getting rid of the cap and allowing the pay-review bodies to come out with a fair pay settlement.§The eight independent public sector pay review bodies offer recommendations to the government. But their findings are shaped by wider government policy, which since 2015 has been a 1% ceiling on increases in the wage bill, introduced by George Osborne and due to continue until 2019-20.Gove told the BBC＊s Andrew Marr Show: ※They take account of that but they also take account of other questions. These pay review bodies have been set up to ensure that we can have authoritative advice on what is required in order to ensure that the public services on which we rely are effectively staffed and that people within them are effectively supported.§The , published in March, warned of ※significant supply shortages in a number of staff groups and geographical areas§ and ※widespread concerns about recruitment, retention and motivation that are shared by employers and staff§.The most recent , published last July, found that ※recruitment and retention pressures have become more acute, creating a challenging climate for schools§.The  (IFS), a thinktank that analyses tax and spending policies, is also warning of increasing strain. ※Recruitment and retention problems are emerging in the public sector following successive years of public pay restraint. The government＊s current plan of 1% increases for the next two years risks exacerbating recruitment problems 每 and ultimately reducing the quality of public services,§ said the IFS＊s Jonathan Cribb.Labour sought to capitalise on the government＊s discomfort over public-sector pay by tabling an amendment to last week＊s Queen＊s speech calling for the cap to be scrapped.Conservative MPs voted with the government but many subsequently expressed their disquiet. Mercer made a video message for his constituents, reassuring them that he hadn＊t ※had a lobotomy§ and would put pressure on the government privately over the issue.Johnson does not think easing the constraints on public-sector pay would have to mean ditching the government＊s commitment to balancing the books. ※He strongly believes the rises can be done in a responsible way and without causing fiscal pressures,§ the source said. Greg Hands, a former chief secretary to the Treasury and now a minister in Liam Fox＊s international trade department, defended the pay cap on Sunday, saying it had helped protect jobs, and stressed the need for ※budget discipline§.※It＊s very important to recognise what we have on public-sector pay. Actually by having that cap in place we have saved around 200,000 public-sector jobs,§ he said on the BBC＊s Sunday Politics. ※There＊s no change in government policy. We must live within our means. And that is the right thing to do.§Cribb, of the IFS, said: ※Higher public-sector pay rises would require significant extra resources for government departments to pay for the higher wage costs, unless departments make cuts elsewhere.§In the run-up to the general election, the IFS said Labour＊s policy of scrapping the cap would cost government departments and local government ?6.3bn per year compared to the government＊s plans 每 increasing to ?9.2bn per year by 2021每22.Johnson＊s majority in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency was cut in half 每 to just over 5,000 每 at the general election and he is the target of an ※unseat Boris§ campaign by Labour activists, as the party seeks to capitalise on Conservative disarray and gear up for an early general election.He denied laying the groundwork for a potential leadership bid in the immediate aftermath of the general election, describing reports that he hoped to topple the prime minister as ※tripe§.But with centrist Tories casting around for a champion and few Conservative MPs believing May can take them into another election 每 whenever it comes 每 Johnson is widely believed to harbour leadership ambitions."															
"estminster magistrates court will be the venue on Monday for the opening chapter in what is expected to be a landmark case arising from the 2008 financial crash. The former Barclays chief executive  and three of his former colleagues 每 Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath 每 are the first senior bankers to face criminal charges arising out of the crisis, and are due to appear in court in the afternoon.The four are charged with offences following a five-year investigation into the events surrounding the ?11.8bn emergency fundraising conducted by the bank in 2008 that allowed it to avoid a bailout by the taxpayer.The decision to charge the four came after a series of postponements and amid plans in the Conservative manifesto for the Serious Fraud Office to be abolished 每 a threat that now appears to have been dropped after it did not feature in the Queen＊s speech, which sets out the government＊s agenda for the coming?year. raised billions from Qatar in 2008 to avoid a bailout. The charges related to two advisory services agreements entered into with Qatar Holding, an investment vehicle for the gulf state, in June and October 2008.The four men and the bank are charged with ※conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in relation to a fundraising in June 2008§. In the event of conviction, the offences carry a maximum prison sentence of 10?years and a fine for the bank.The general election threw up all sorts of unwelcome surprises for Theresa May at the beginning of last month. What effect this latest stormy period in British politics will have on the economy will emerge to some extent this week, with the release of the purchasing managers＊ index (PMI) data on the services and manufacturing sectors. As the general election did not have the same effect as the EU referendum just over a year ago, there is not likely to have been as sharp a decline, but analysts at Investec think there will still be a?drop.※We suspect that the election outcome will not have led to a steep drop in the PMIs in the way we saw immediately after the 2016 Brexit vote, but a more modest decline,§ said its preview of the figures.Later in the week, official figures on construction output, trade and manufacturing output for May will be released, which will give further indicators on the state of the economy. A ※less than robust§ run of data could dissuade the Bank of England from raising rates over the coming months, according to Investec.It has been a difficult year for Bovis Homes. And a difficult one for some of its customers. The chairman of the housebuilder admitted in May that it had , cutting corners to meet targets, and that hundreds had been affected.Amid complaints of poorly built homes, the company set aside ?7m for repairs earlier this year and faced accusations that it was pressuring customers to move into unfinished homes. Chief executive David Ritchie resigned shortly after a profit warning in December and was replaced by Greg Fitzgerald, the former chief executive of Galliford Try.This week will give an indication of how the company is currently faring with the release of a trading update on Thursday. Since the problems at the company have been highlighted, the majority of its staff have been retrained. But on the  Victims group on Facebook, there have been claims that buyers are again being pressurised into moving into incomplete homes 每 a claim which the company has denied. There is clearly some confidence in the higher ranks as to its future, however, as Fitzgerald was reported to have spent ?2m buying shares in June. This comes after Fitzgerald and his wife spent ?1.4m buying stock earlier this year."															
"A  policymaker has heaped further pressure on Mark Carney, the governor, with a warning that the central bank＊s policymakers have failed to spot an inflationary spiral that needs to be choked off with an immediate increase in interest rates.In the same week that Andy Haldane, the chief economist, said he was  before the end of the year, Kristin Forbes, an outgoing member of the monetary policy committee, used her valedictory speech to say the governor and a majority of the other MPC rate-setters were wrong to believe inflation would peak soon and then retreat, allowing rates to stay low.Speaking at the London Business School, the US academic said: ※This is not an economy that is too weak to support an increase in interest rates. Instead, it appears to be an economy that is ＆overstimulated＊ and where monetary policy has been set too loosely,§ she said.Forbes, one of four external members of the MPC, has voted at the past three committee meetings for an increase in the base rate from 0.25%. She said internal Bank research showed inflation would persist while the economy was ※clearly outperforming§ by every measure except wages growth., she was joined by fellow external members Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty in voting for rates to be increased. "															
". Next month will mark the 10th anniversary of the last time the technocrats of Threadneedle Street raised the official cost of borrowing, but the chances of an interest rate rise are higher than they have been for some while. Mark Carney, the Bank＊s governor, thinks the time is not yet ripe for a tightening of policy.  to voice concerns about the negative impact of higher inflation on consumer spending and the uncertain effects of Brexit negotiations on the economy. But three of the eight members of the Bank＊s monetary policy committee took a different view, and they were almost joined by a fourth, the Old Lady＊s chief economist, Andy Haldane, who said the time was fast approaching when he would vote for an increase. , not just because he has hitherto been seen as one of the MPC＊s most prominent ※doves§, nor because his intervention came little more than 24 hours after that of his boss. Rather, it was because the bombshell was dropped at the end of a speech that seemed to argue the opposite.For years, the Bank of England has been trying to find the answer to a puzzle: ? Britain currently has its lowest jobless rate since the mid-1970s, but there has been no sign of an acceleration in earnings growth. Quite the contrary, in fact. At least part of the answer, according to Haldane＊s analysis, stems from structural changes in the labour market: a decline in union membership; more self-employment; more zero-hours contracts and more part-time and temporary work. The clock has been turned back not one century but three, so that the world of work in 2017 bears more than a . There were no trade unions. Most people were self-employed or worked in a small business. The Uber drivers of that era were the agricultural workers hired only when there were cows to be milked or crops to be harvested. In those pre-industrial days, the relationship between wages and unemployment was strikingly similar to the one seen since the recession of 2008.The thrust of Mr Haldane＊s argument is that workers in an increasingly casualised, de-unionised and atomised labour market find it hard to chisel more money out of their employers even when unemployment is falling and their living standards are being eroded by inflation. If all this is true 每 which it is 每 then Mr Carney＊s wait-and-see approach to interest rate rises makes sense. The only genuine reason for the Bank to be alarmed about inflation running at 2.9% would be if there was the prospect of workers securing compensatory pay awards and setting off a good old-fashioned wage-price spiral. Not only is there no sign of this happening, tightening policy now could hit the economy when it looks vulnerable on three fronts: from a slowdown in consumption; from political turmoil; and from Brexit uncertainty.It would be a different story were the government prepared to boost the economy with higher public spending or lower taxes, and there is a strong case for changing the mix?of macroeconomic policy so that monetary policy (interest rates and quantitative easing) takes less of the strain and fiscal policy (taxes and spending) plays a bigger role. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the current mix of ultra-loose monetary policy and over-tight fiscal policy needs to be changed. Chucking copious amounts of cheap money at the UK economy has not led to strong and sustainable growth: . But until the chancellor decides it?is time to add substance to the government＊s end-to-austerity rhetoric, the Bank of England is the only game in town. Mr?Carney is right to be cautious."															
"he economy is looking wobbly. . A week after the general election Britain lacks an effective government. Is this the ?Well, three members of the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee think it is 每 the first time there has been a triumvirate in favour of dearer borrowing costs in six years.Kristin Forbes, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders 每 the trio who voted for a quarter-point increase in interest rates to 0.5% 每 have a case, . Inflation stands at 2.9%, well above the government＊s 2% target and higher than the Bank anticipated in its May inflation report. Inflation is heading above 3%, at which point the Bank＊s governor, Mark Carney, will have to write an explanatory letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond.The continued fall in unemployment also meant a tighter labour market and, although the weak pound has put the brakes on consumer spending by making imports dearer, the other side of the coin is that a more competitive currency is helping exports and encouraging businesses to invest.The MPC hawks made the point that the Bank cut rates by a quarter-point to boost the economy after the shock result of the EU referendum last summer, and that given the better than anticipated growth and employment performance since there was now an argument for removing that part of the emergency stimulus package.Even so, there are three reasons why interest rates are unlikely to go up any time soon. The first is that it was the last MPC meeting for one of the hawks,Forbes, whose three-year term ends at the end of the month.The second is that we have been here before. On frequent occasions since the rates were cut to their then record low of 0.5% in early 2009 there has been a dissenting faction on the MPC calling for higher rates. Eventually, either the weakness of the economy or the weakness of inflation 每 and sometimes both 每 has forced them to back off.The third is that the state of the economy favours the five MPC doves. Households are spending less, the housing market is weak, new car registrations have plunged and wage growth has fallen back, even though more people are in jobs.On balance, the arguments in favour of leaving rates where they are look more compelling than the arguments for raising them. No question, though, that the announcement of the 5-3 vote took the City by surprise and led to a stronger pound 每 if only briefly 每 on the foreign exchanges. What the Bank would really like would be a situation where the threat of higher rates leads to a firmer currency, lower import prices and weaker inflation. That would obviate the need for an actual rate increase. "															
"Average UK rents have fallen for the first time in more than seven years, with  seeing the biggest decline, according to new data.The slowdown in the rental sector mirrors a similar picture in the , with figures showing that property prices have fallen for the third month in a row.The average monthly rent on a new tenancy that started in May was ?901, which was down 0.3% on the May 2016 figure of ?904, according to the latest rental index from HomeLet, which provides services to landlords and letting agents. It is the first such fall recorded by the company since December 2009.However, the typical new rent in London has fallen by 3% in a year. The weaker market in the capital has seen average rents fall from ?1,572 a month in July 2016 to ?1,502 in May. That means new tenants in London are typically paying ?70 a month less than their counterparts last summer.Four other regions of the UK saw rents on new tenancies fall during May. The north-east of England, the south-east, Scotland, and Yorkshire and Humberside experienced falls ranging from 2.3% to 0.6%.Martin Totty, HomeLet＊s chief executive, said its figures suggested that landlords ※are now facing a difficult balancing act between ensuring rents are affordable for tenants in a low real wage growth environment while covering their own rising costs§.The  show that in England alone 4.3m households are renting privately.In April, the lettings agency Your Move said London had seen  over the previous 12 months, reflecting the fact that many people looking for rental properties had switched their focus away from the capital.Some commentators have suggested that tenant demand has been falling, particularly in London, , while others have said a weaker sales market had prompted some homeowners to let out their homes rather than putting them up for sale. On 1 June, Nationwide said house prices had , for the first time since the height of the financial crisis in 2009. Its monthly house price index showed that the average price of a home fell by 0.2% between April and May, to ?208,711."															
"The prospect of a revived EU-US trade deal is in ※deep freeze§, according to Brussels sources, undermining reports that the EU has been inching ahead of the UK in the race for an arrangement with Washington.Neither  nor European officials raised the possible resumption of talks during the US president＊s visit to Brussels last month, EU sources said. Documents relating to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, known as TTIP, had now been locked in a filing cabinet and the code to open it had been lost, one diplomat joked.It was reported in April that the UK had fallen behind in the queue to strike a trade deal with Trump＊s administration. According to the Times, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, had convinced Trump that talks on a US-EU agreement would be simpler than he thought. This had led to a ※realisation§ that a trade deal with the EU 每 allowing the tariff-free exchange of services and goods 每 would be more important to US interests than a post-Brexit deal with Theresa May, it was reported. Talks over  stalled last year amid opposition from within the EU, including sceptical comments from France＊s then trade minister and the German vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel.However, a meeting between Trump the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the European council president, Donald Tusk, two weeks ago offered the EU scant evidence of any such willingness, according to EU sources. ※It didn＊t come up,§ one EU diplomat said. ※It＊s maybe not entirely dead but it is in deep freeze§. The source said that the completion of an EU-Japan trade deal was nevertheless imminent, and would provide significant economic gains. The development may offer Downing Street some fresh hope that the UK stands a better chance of engaging with Washington than Brussels does. May has appeared less inclined to criticise the White House for its recent policy tacks 每 including leaving the Paris climate agreement 每 suggesting that the prime minister believes the UK stands a chance of forging an accord with the US administration if it avoids upsetting the president.In Brussels, though, there is a high degree of scepticism about the UK＊s chances of getting a deal. ※Trump would have to be taught what trade means first,§ one EU diplomat said. The source added that it was questionable whether the UK had the expertise to engage with the US administration on a trade deal. ※A UK-US trade deal would probably take 10 to 15 years anyway§, the diplomat said. The UK＊s attitude to the coming  negotiations had given EU diplomats little evidence of such a capacity, the source added. ※Theresa May keeps saying she the chief negotiator. Is she really going to spend six days a week in Brussels negotiating?※If it is David Davis, fine. If it is Olly Robins [permanent secretary of the Department for Exiting the European Union] then fine, he knows the files, although maybe less the economic ones. We need to know who we are negotiating with ... I don＊t think they have a plan.§The warnings of a freeze in trade talks come despite upbeat comments in April from the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. He said before Trump＊s first foreign tour that the US was ※open§ to resuming negotiations with Brussels. ※Clearly at some point we need to do something with Europe,§ Ross said in an interview with the Financial Times. ※It seems a little weird that a car being shipped from Mexico to  pays no tariff as they have a bilateral [agreement with the EU] and a car being shipped from the US pays the full tariff.§"															
"he creative industries haven＊t had much of a look-in during this Brexit election. As far as I＊m aware, culture secretary Karen Bradley hasn＊t been allowed out during the campaign to talk about them. ※Britain＊s arts and culture are world-beating and are at the heart of the regeneration of modern Britain,§ says the Conservative manifesto, politely; but the proposal to  the immigration skills charge will do nothing but damage a sector that thrives on international talent.The Labour manifesto, which is altogether more concrete about what can be achieved, refers to the creative industries as ※a source of national pride§, and promises to ※put creativity back at the heart of the curriculum§. This stops short of a pledge to add an arts element to the  每 as the subset of GCSEs given special status by the government is now known 每 but is still welcome.It would also reverse one of the biggest disasters of the past seven years. In 2015, the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan, advised teenagers  which she said would ※hold them back for the rest of their lives§. She was putting her mouth where the money already wasn＊t. , the number of drama teachers in English state schools fell by 14%. The number of design and technology teachers fell by 15%. Entries for GSCEs in arts and creative subjects fell by 8% in 2016 alone.Meanwhile, the prospectuses of private schools compete for fee-paying parents with ever more lavish music and drama facilities. If you pay for your children＊s education, you＊re assumed to want them to be introduced to worlds that are being slowly withdrawn from those in the state sector.※We want to build an economy that works for everyone not just the privileged few,§ said arts minister Matt Hancock in a speech to the creative industries last September. ※No one should be excluded from any of your industries because of their accent, their gender or their postcode.§ When he＊s finished wagging his finger he might ask himself why the wrong postcode denies you an education that only the privileged few can afford. ※Talent knows no boundaries,§ he said, and I agree. But talent needs the building block of a decent education in the arts.It＊s the accelerated move away from creative subjects in state schools that will hold teenagers back for the rest of their lives. And that＊s not just because it will deny so many of them the opportunity to work in the creative industries. The Israeli writer Yuval Noah Harari has suggested that artificial intelligence will, over the next few decades,  in more and more jobs. It must surely be time for politicians to confront this.Harari imagines ※the useless class§ finding meaning in life by playing virtual reality games. My own experience is that the most significant consequence of the digital revolution for the performing arts is not that it has driven audiences away to computer games, or even that it has opened the door to digital distribution of live performance, but that it has led to a resurgence of the real thing. The instant availability of everything you want at the click of a mouse turns out not to include the thing you want most of all: human contact. You want to be there when it happens.If you deprive schools of the resources to introduce kids to what＊s on offer, you＊re not just making it harder for them to consume the arts. You＊re taking from them the possibility of participation in something that may, in future decades, be the focus of their lives. In a post-work world, creativity will not be reserved for those who create to earn a living. It could be what gives us purpose.For the present, everyone seems to agree that the cultural economy needs rebalancing away from the south east. My colleagues in the London performing arts have decided not to contest the idea that funds should be diverted away from the capital. I have no skin in the funding game any longer: the , which I＊m opening in October with my producing partner Nick Starr, is an entirely commercial venture, and will never trouble the Arts Council with an application for support.But I want the theatre to be properly funded, whether it＊s in London, Leeds or Manchester. The commercial theatre is only a part of an interconnected arts scene where talent is vibrant and audience demand is growing: ticket sales in London are up 25% over the past 15 years. It＊s irrational to cut back public investment in a sector which Britain can be genuinely proud of, and which promises not just economic benefit but a vision of a future in which humans are liberated by technology. If there＊s an issue with London＊s hegemony, the answer isn＊t to punish  butto invest confidently in arts and arts education throughout the country."															
															
"It did not take long in the current election campaign for the Conservatives to trot out the old myth of Labour being the party of high taxation while the Tories are ※tax cutters by instinct§ (, 4 May).It may be true to say the Tories favour unfair cuts in direct taxation, but this certainly cannot be said of their less progressive and equitable ※instinct§ of increasing indirect taxation. Let＊s not forget it was  who raised VAT from 8% to 15% only weeks after denying there were any plans to do so during the 1979 election campaign, and it was George Osborne who raised it from 17.5% to 20% following similar denials in 2010.Thatcher was fond of saying that  would spend until it ran out of other people＊s money. However, looking at taxation as a proportion of GDP since 1979 shows that under Thatcher and Major (1979-97), on average the annual total tax burden was 35.23% of GDP. The total tax burden under Cameron and May since 2010 has similarly averaged 35.2%, while under Blair and Brown it averaged 35.1%, slightly less than the Tories.Similarly, under the Thatcher and Major governments, spend averaged 43.5% of GDP and since 2010 has averaged 43.1%. Over the 13 years of the last Labour government spend averaged 39.5% of GDP.So, far from Labour being the tax and spend party it is the Tories who have taxed at a higher rate than Labour and spent at a higher rate than Labour over the past 38 years. Paul Mason＊s call for a radical progressive tax policy (, 5 May) is welcome. He＊s also right that the beneficiaries of Labour＊s tax-and-spend policies can＊t be limited to ※the poor§. However, he ignores the extent to which people in poverty have suffered under the Conservatives and to which their numbers are likely to increase on current policies. His list of priorities includes pensions but not working-age benefits.Likewise, all the talk has been about the future of the pensions triple-lock without any mention of the current freeze of most working-age benefits (affecting many in paid work as well as out of work). This is one of many damaging benefit cuts, imposed by the Tories, the more so as inflation rises post-Brexit. At least there was a promise of no more such cuts in the present parliament. But that parliament is no more, making social security vulnerable once again. At a minimum the Conservatives must be challenged to renew that pledge as well as lift the benefit freeze immediately to help avert potentially the worst increase in poverty and inequality since the Thatcher years. Paul Mason is surely right to say that the money to save the NHS and schools has to come from new taxes. There seems to have been remarkably little publicity for the announcement that the questionably named financial watchdog NHS Improvement is considering borrowing billions of pounds from private investment companies. The agency hopes that hedge funds could pay for new buildings, equipment and IT. This sounds awfully like another step towards privatisation. Apparently the rationale is that this move would make the most of low interest rates. Why should any payment of interest be contemplated when the sums could be raised interest-free by government? Labour should be shouting at every opportunity that if people want a properly funded  (and education system)there is only one way to vote. There is one area of taxation that bothers me. I am 80 next month and for the past few years I have needed the expertise of the NHS, which will no doubt continue for the rest of my life. During my working lifetime, when I was fit and healthy, I paid national insurance but now I am exempt from doing so because of my age. Why? Surely all pensioners not on benefits should continue with a flat rate payment.As we keep being told that there are more and more of us and we are the ones using the system, surely we should be sharing the cost if we can afford it? Also, a new Labour government should make sure that it is hypothecated. I?have been told that very few people of my generation vote Labour, so I cannot see that this would adversely affect the party＊s election success.Furthermore, why has there always been a ceiling on national insurance payments? At the moment it is too low to stand beneath it. Thomas Piketty is not the only person to advocate tax reforms. In a global economy no one country can impose taxes unilaterally. It simply leads to money disappearing thanks to the absence of monetary controls, the financial sector and the use of tax havens, which our own governments sponsors. A few ultra rich can never provide enough taxes. But we need a fairer system. Of course we should introduce the Tobin tax to raise taxes from the one sector that can afford it. But outlawing tax avoidance and tax havens (believed to be sitting on $13tn) so everyone pays their fair share is necessary if our democratic societies are to survive. We should also cap the outrageous earnings in corporate and financial boardrooms and in sport which are not justified and stop allowing them tax breaks as well. All this needs a new breed of politicians who look at the future rather than work for the financial and corporate sector. Theresa May promises not to increase VAT, but signals rises in national insurance and income tax (, 1 May). Although VAT is called a regressive tax because the poor spend more of their income than the rich, at least we all pay it equally. Not so the other taxes.For the rich, income tax is optional 每?they can shelter their income offshore in trusts or take it from their companies as dividends, taxed at a lower rate than earned income, or as capital gains such as share options, taxed a much lower rate. And the rich pay national insurance at 2% on taxable income above ?45,000 instead of the 12% that lower-paid ※working families§ pay. Then there are companies whose staff are self-employed, who don＊t pay the employer rate of 13.8% that proper employers pay, and the self-employed themselves whose complaints about paying more caused such a stir recently.We could hope Mrs May will fix these?inequalities, but I＊m not rushing to call the accountant."															
"he row brewing over  plays into a wider debate about incomes and wealth in old age and how, as a society, we adapt to the escalating costs of improved life expectancy, increasing care costs and, crucially, property prices.It is becoming clear that the answer for many people is to take the Italian approach. In addition to eating pizza and pasta, they do everything to avoid paying higher taxes and hoard whatever assets they have accumulated.Protecting the family＊s finances becomes a priority as the state vanishes from the scene. And a family is no longer the traditional British nuclear family, but one that resembles the Italian extended family, where grandparents and parents feel obliged to provide more than just a good start in life for the youngest members. They must also dig deep to provide financial support, possibly for as long as they are alive.This trend lies behind the Tory promise to raise the inheritance tax threshold for couples to ?1m by 2020. It can also be seen when wealthy pensioners argue that the government should maintain the state pension as a universal benefit and even continue paying the winter fuel allowance.House prices play an important role. No one should want house prices to rise at double or treble the rate of earnings growth to reach affordability levels that effectively mean homes in places with decent jobs are out of reach for most people. The latest figures show the UK housing market is currently matching average . These are worrying times for financial regulators.Yet there is almost an audible cheer down every British street when a house or flat sells for more than the previous one. Similarly, headlines predicting a downturn can spark panic. That＊s the case in the suburbs of Burnley as much as in Guildford＊s more well-to-do avenues. Property is something to hang on to and maximise. Pay as little stamp duty or capital gains tax as you can. Make sure the proceeds are recycled to provide a leg-up for your own offspring.Even those who hate the tyranny of rising house prices feel unable to play by an older set of socialistic rules when it feels like everyone else is looking after number one.It is against this backdrop, one where baby boomers, whatever their background and income level, are hoarding their money and assets as best they can, that the debate over the triple lock plays out. at the need to ditch many of the tax and benefit promises made by the Tories before the 2015 election in the autumn statement last year. It was Hammond who was first to say the triple lock on pensions 每 which links the basic state pension to whichever is the higher of earnings growth, inflation or 2.5% 每 needs to be rethought. Since then, Theresa May has dodged questions about the triple lock, revealing her sympathy for a review.Hammond and May can see that the economy is weakening, following a squeeze on disposable incomes from higher inflation and stagnant wages growth. The knock-on effect to lower tax receipts is going to put pressure on the government＊s finances and the chancellor will need to raise money to keep his deficit reduction plan on track.On the surface, scrapping the third element of the triple lock, the guarantee of a 2.5% annual rise in the state pension, merely fits into this broad tax and benefit grab by the Treasury.The message is that pensioners must join the rest of society as austerity?bites.Labour, which has promised to maintain the triple lock, and pensioner groups argue that those on the lowest incomes will be the worst affected.That＊s true, especially when the government＊s cuts in the real value of the state second pension, and the move to a flat-rate pension, are taken into account.However, campaigning for a universal benefit also feathers the nests of the better off. And why should today＊s workers make sure pensions increase at a faster rate than their own pay, especially when it leads to greater income inequality among the old? And yes, income inequality is growing among the country＊s 12 million pensioners.A spokesman for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Paris-based thinktank, said last week that .An alternative would be to design an income tax system specifically for the country＊s 12 million pensioners; one that increases the tax burden for the third who have more than enough money to enjoy their retirement. Or, at least, charge the 1.1 million retirees who are still working national insurance.Unfortunately, all these proposals meet with the same cry from the boomers. ※We must save to pay for our own care and support our children.§ So it＊s impossible to shift the dial in favour of all the young while the state refuses to look after the elderly in care, and build enough homes for those on low and middle incomes to bring down prices. Only then will wealthy boomers stop taking more out than they put in and hoarding it."															
"Britain＊s economy cooled considerably in the first three months of the year as higher inflation put a squeeze on disposable incomes, official figures are expected to show this week.The economy shrugged off the shock of the Brexit vote last June and has been surprisingly resilient, with growth rates of 0.5% in the third quarter of 2016 and 0.7% in the final quarter. But in a turn of fortunes, City economists are forecasting a tough year ahead, with a sharp slowdown in growth to 0.4% between January and March. This would be the weakest performance since the first quarter of 2016, when the economy grew by 0.2%. The  is due to publish its initial estimate for first quarter GDP on Friday.Brexit and the health of the economy will form a central part of the general election campaign waged in the run-up to the snap poll on 8 June. The work and pensions minister, Damian Green, said on Sunday that the Conservative party＊s election manifesto would focus on the Brexit negotiations and domestic concerns such as strengthening the economy.The negative effects of sterling＊s slide since the EU referendum appear to be outweighing the positive effects 每 . The weaker pound has raised the cost of imported materials and . This meant that  for the first time in two and a half years, even though unemployment continues to drop and vacancies are at record levels.Howard Archer, the chief European and UK economist at consultancy IHS Markit, said: ※Following the likely marked first quarter slowdown, we suspect that 2017 will become even more challenging for the UK economy 每 and particularly for consumers as their purchasing power is squeezed harder still.§He expects GDP growth to be limited to 1.6% this year, with inflation rising to 3% by the end of the year. Economists do not expect the general election to change the economic outlook for this year 每 assuming the Conservatives are re-elected with an increased majority.Consumer spending has been strong and the main driver of UK economic growth, but economic surveys and the latest retail sales figures  at the beginning of this year as shoppers felt the pinch from rising prices. Retail sales, which account for about a third of household spending, , the biggest quarterly fall in seven years.Confidence among consumers weakened in the first quarter, according to the latest Deloitte consumer tracker, which polled 3,000 people in mid-March. It dipped to -7% from -6% in the fourth quarter. Four of the six measures that make up the confidence index recorded negative movements, with inflation rising and discretionary spending falling. People＊s confidence in their own disposable income remaining at current levels fell by three percentage points to -17% in the quarter, its lowest level in more than two years. Spending on essential items remained strong at 12%, but spending on discretionary items returned to negative territory, falling by four percentage points to -4%.Ben Perkins, the head of consumer research at Deloitte, said: ※With less disposable income, consumers will have to consider whether to trade down, buy less or borrow more. Consumers are already showing signs of moving away from making major purchases and this is a trend that is likely to continue.§Chris Hare, UK economist at Investec, said: ※While the weaker pound is probably beginning to provide some boost to net exports, the negative impact on household spending power via higher imported inflation is beginning to bite discernibly. Indeed, the inflation squeeze is material: as an average over the quarter, CPI inflation climbed to 2.1% year-on-year in the first quarter versus 1.2% in the fourth quarter.§Other countries will also release preliminary estimates for GDP at the start of the year on Friday. The US, the world＊s largest economy, is likely to have slowed sharply to an annualised growth rate of about 1% in the first quarter. France is forecast to have grown at a 0.4% quarterly rate, similar to the UK, while Spain is expected to have maintained stronger growth, of 0.6%.The International Monetary Fund last week , which would make it the second fastest-growing advanced economy after the US. The Washington-based institution said it would take longer than expected for the negative effects of the Brexit vote to materialise. It expects growth to slow to 1.5% next year, a touch slower than previously forecast."															
"hen the International Monetary Fund met for its spring meeting in Washington 10 years ago the global economy was booming. The world was experiencing the strongest period of sustained growth since the late 1960s and early 1970s and the There was a bit of concern about the rip-roaring US housing market, but no suggestion that a crisis in the sub-prime mortgage market would be the catalyst for the biggest recession since the 1930s. Even when the trickle of foreclosures turned into a flood the assumption was that it was merely a localised problem that would soon be sorted out. Only when the entire global financial system froze up a year later did everything become horribly clear.The IMF meeting of the past few days was supposed to be about how the global economy has at last emerged into the light from its long dark tunnel. , the fund＊s managing director, radiated optimism. . The impression was given that everything is back under control.The reality is somewhat different. There will be no return to the world as it was in the spring of 2007 for many years, if ever. It was a moment when many trends peaked. Firstly, it represented peak America. The years leading up to 2007 had been dominated by a particular view of the world. Some called it the Washington consensus. Some called it the advent of a unipolar world, in which the US emerged victorious after its cold war struggle with the Soviet Union. Francis Fukuyama called it the end of history. Whatever the nomenclature, the basic idea was the same: the US creed of free markets and free trade would lead not just to better economic performance but to the spread of the values that underpinned western capitalism.The US remains an economic and military superpower, but it was the Chinese and not the American economy that hauled the world out of recession in 2008-09. American attempts to prevent China setting up an Asian infrastructure bank failed. When Donald Trump wanted to get tough with North Korea he had to  The period between 1990 and 2007 when the US was unchallenged is over.Secondly, 2007 was peak growth. It is now apparent that the period of rapid expansion in the early 2000s was only possible because the financial system was out of control and households were taking on record amounts of debt. Banks were lending money that could only be paid back if asset prices kept on rising. They had insufficient capital to cope if 每 as was inevitable 每 the loans started to go bad. The decade since has seen so-called de-leveraging, more restrained lending backed up by bigger capital buffers and tougher regulation.To the extent that growth has been picking up over the past 18 months it is because interest rates have been kept at record lows for such a long time. Borrowing has never been cheaper and lenders have started to forget just how tough life was back in 2008. Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist and head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, noted in a recent that ※no region of the world is currently growing as fast as it was before 2008, and none should expect to. In 2007, at the peak of the pre-crisis boom, the economies of 65 countries 每 including a number of large ones, such as Argentina, China, India, Nigeria, Russia and Vietnam 每 grew at annual rates of 7% or more. Today, just six economies are growing at that rate, and most of those are in small countries such as C?te d＊Ivoire and Laos.§ In other words, there should be no desire to return to the pre-2007 growth because that would suggest another colossal bust was just around the corner. It should be a cause for concern, not celebration, that China＊s recent growth has relied so heavily on a credit binge that has financed infrastructure that is not really needed and factories that don＊t make a profit. Central banks and finance ministries have used conventional and unconventional policies over the past decade which have succeeded in preventing a second Great Depression. But they have not even got close to returning to the pre-2007 growth rates.Thirdly, the sub-prime crisis marked peak globalisation. From that moment, there was never any realistic chance of concluding the multilateral trade talks begun in Doha in 2001. Moreover, while publicly opposing protectionism, rich and poor countries alike have been putting up barriers to trade. As Lagarde noted last week, there have been  Trump is at least upfront about his ※America first§ strategy.But it is not just trade. Free movement of capital was a key component of globalisation in the 1990s and early 2000s, but these peaked at the time of the recession and have fallen back sharply as a percentage of world GDP.Finally, the crisis represented peak democracy. Although there is not the remotest possibility of a return to the pre-2007 growth rates, there is an expectation that there will be and anger that the governments that were in power at the time of the crash are incapable of delivering it. The reason for the discontent, perhaps, is that for the lucky few life is as sweet now as it was then. Giving a lecture at the IMF meetings, Raghuram Rajan, until recently the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said the forces that were causing so much anger 每 automation and trade 每 had been at work for several decades but were now much more powerful because the global financial crisis had ※delegitimised the system§.Rajan said: ※The global elite didn＊t foresee the crisis and they didn＊t prevent it, they didn＊t take us out of it. Who paid the price? The people on main street. The bankers were helping themselves to big bonuses within a couple of years. The global elite knew how to look after themselves.§Populist leaders have tapped into this discontent and there is now a cult of the strong leader. Trump in the United States, Vladimir Putin in Russia, Recep Tayyip Erdo?an in Turkey, Narendra Modi in India all fall into this category, but there are many others. Liberal democracy is firmly on the back foot. There has been an increase in the number of people who like the idea of a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections.Trump＊s strongman pitch is that he can make America great again. The plan involves doubling the US growth rate and returning it to its pre-2007 trend. This is not remotely feasible and eventually the American public will realise as much. At that point a fifth peak will be reached: peak anger."															
"Ted Howard looks out on a group of people drinking tea from styrofoam cups at Preston town hall on a Monday afternoon in March. The social entrepreneur and author from , Ohio, is the special guest at the city＊s monthly social forum. ※What＊s happening in this community is historic 每 it blows my mind,§ he tells the city councillors and local business owners. ※We＊re working out how to build an inclusive economy.§Howard＊s infectious enthusiasm has made him the de facto spokesperson for ※§, a way of tackling inequality by ensuring the economic development of a place is shared more equally among its residents.To do this, Howard harnessed the co-operative model, in which an enterprise is jointly owned and operated by members for their mutual benefit. In Cleveland, he helped set up worker co-operatives to supply local institutions 每 such as hospitals, councils and universities 每 in order to keep profit localised. Redirecting local spending for community wealth through the use of worker co-operatives has now become known as ※§ 每 and cities around the world suffering the negative effects of globalisation are looking to it to help them recover.This grassroots economic development approach originated in the Basque region of Spain, where the , a federation of worker co-operatives that now employs more than 74,000 people in finance, retail and other sectors, was set up in 1956, based around the ideals of social responsibility and participation.Howard and his organisation, , applied the idea in Cleveland by establishing the worker-owned  in 2008, in collaboration with the city government and the Cleveland Foundation, the world＊s first community foundation, which dates from 1914. An  and energy business were set up as co-operatives to serve the biggest spenders in the city. , a co-operative urban farm, followed in 2012. When Evergreen Cooperatives began, Cleveland badly needed change. Its population had shrunk by more than  due to the decline of manufacturing jobs in the city. In 2007, Cleveland＊s poverty rate : , a much higher proportion than the US national average of . While Cleveland voted for Hillary Clinton in last year＊s election, 70% of  voters chose Donald Trump, who appealed to the disaffection of workers feeling the impact of deindustrialisation.Many US and UK cities are waking up to the power of service-based anchors as local employers and earners as manufacturing jobs move overseas. In the US, universities . Nonprofit hospitals have annual revenues of . Redirecting that money locally could have a profound effect, the Democracy Collaborative argues.In Cleveland, the Evergreen laundry and energy company are now profitable and the urban farm is getting there. They collectively employ around 150 people, many with barriers to employment such as criminal convictions or low education. The plan is to increase the number of employees to at least 1,000.The laundry was established in Glenville, one of the poorest parts of Cleveland, where adult unemployment was around  and higher still for those who had been in prison. Evergreen was about more than just giving these people jobs. ※A job is not enough. For people to stay out of poverty they need to be able to acquire assets,§ Howard explains.Around half of Evergreen workers own a stake in their company. They are eligible for pension payments, profit sharing and even help buying a home.Claudia Oates, who works in sales and marketing for the laundry, tells the story of one worker-owner of the laundry and his wife, who works at the greenhouse, who got a home under the Evergreen housing programme. ※The people here are good, they just need a second chance,§ she says.It was different when she started at Evergreen in 2011. ※At that time, they were losing customers,§ Oates remembers. But the laundry turned a corner with contracts from major institutions such as University Hospitals, and was  by the second quarter of 2014.※Before, we were owners in name, but now we are learning how to really be worker-owners, with quarterly statements, profit-sharing and looking at how to reinvest our money,§ Oates says.Other US cities are learning from Cleveland about how to make co-operatives competitive as they implement their own iterations of the model. The mayor of , New York, commissioned the Democracy Collaborative to look into whether the model could work there. In Denver, Colorado, nonprofit funding has gone towards setting up worker-owned co-operatives for veterans and low-income families to grow food.Council leader Peter Rankin believed Preston could also benefit from these ideas. ※We have a government that states this country is doing well economically 每 but we know as people in the community that＊s not true,§ he says.  voted leave in the EU referendum, like every other district in Lancashire. It sent a clear signal that a new approach is desired. ※For too long we said social policy is separate from economic policy,§ Rankin adds. ※The inclusive economy＊s time has come.§Preston council committed to a co-operative initiative for economic development in 2011, but the following year invited Howard to talk about the Cleveland model, as inspiration for how the UK city could match the co-operative approach with a way of building localised wealth. Howard had never heard of Preston before he was invited to visit in 2012. At the time, the city was in the depths of austerity and suffering from entrenched inequality, with a life expectancy of 66 in some areas and 82 in others. One in three schoolchildren lived in poverty. On top of this, the council has had its hands tied by , and its community engagement team has been cut from 30 people to around 10.※The system wasn＊t working,§ says  每 and the driving force behind many of the recent transformations at the council. ※Something had to change.§So in 2013, the council employed a thinktank, the Centre for Local Economic Strategies (CLES), to help identify 12 large institutions anchored to Preston, including the city and the county council, the university, the police and the hospital. It looked at redirecting the ?1.2bn total annual spending power of these anchors to local businesses. Preston city council has since spent an additional ?4m locally, . Preston, like any city, has its own particular challenges that mean a straight transplant of the Cleveland model is impossible. So CLES adapted it. Rather than creating co-operatives from scratch, Neil McInroy, CLES chief executive, says they sought existing business that could win contracts, such as a ?600,000 printing contract tendered by the constabulary and a ?1.6m council food budget, which was broken into lots and awarded to farmers in the region.After Brexit, it may become even easier for public institutions to pick local suppliers over international ones, without the European procurement law that requires contracts to be tendered widely. But other centralised services, such as the police and NHS, will still be tied to national systems for procurement. Then there＊s funding. Cleveland＊s Evergreen Co-operative Laundry was set up with $5.8m in part from the city council and the Cleveland Foundation. Setting up co-ops could be more difficult in the UK, which has weaker city governments, less availability of philanthropic capital and the looming shadow of austerity. Peter Rankin is aware of these limitations. The council is looking at setting up a local bank to provide loans to small businesses and becoming a municipal energy provider. Rankin sees the developments so far as a part of a wider programme of getting wealth to remain local that includes attracting outside investment from corporations that may take their profits elsewhere.Julian Manley, a research fellow at the University of Central Lancashire, is in the process of establishing the Preston Co-operative Network. He is working on a curriculum that educates undergraduates about co-operatives and connects them to , the university business hub, where they can get support setting up their own. ※We have growing interest from the university in supporting this network through educating students to have skills to fill gaps,§ Manley says.The Preston Co-operative Network already includes Link, the UK＊s first educational psychologists＊ co-operative and the beginnings of a local food co-op. Kay Johnson, director of the Lancashire and Region Dietary and Education Resource, is piloting an open food network to connect growers directly with local people in disadvantaged areas, where there is often little access to fresh produce. ※The co-op model means that as the the project scales we can create jobs at the hubs,§ Johnson says. She has joined forces with Neil Hickson, who runs a community farm in nearby Burscough. ※People in cities are the hardest ones to reach,§ Hickson says. ※For us, taking a vegetable box to central Preston might not be worth it, but if there was a food hub it might be worthwhile 每 not profitable, but economically viable.§By creating an education system that promotes co-operatives and networks to support them, Preston, like Cleveland, is aiming for systemic change. While they realise this may take decades, there are already some signs it is paying off. Preston had the joint-second biggest improvement in its position on the . In 2016 it was  to live and work. The changes are profound enough that the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has used Preston as an example of how Labour councils can cope with hefty budget cuts.The day after the social forum in Preston, Howard, Brown and Manley speak at a roundtable hosted by Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow cities minister, at the Houses of Parliament, to try to develop thinking about how co-ops and anchor institutions can work together.※There＊s a real need in local government to understand what the benefits of investment are,§ says Meg Hillier, MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, at the event. ※The danger is that it gets easier for procurement officials to deal with big companies.§McInroy says Preston will be seen as an early adopter as other councils catch on. CLES has already worked with Manchester city council to increase its direct spend to the local economy from 51.5% in 2008-09 to 73.6% in 2015-16. It has now started work with Birmingham city council.Howard sees Preston as the most comprehensive, holistic application of the Cleveland model yet. ※They＊re creating an ecosystem of change that will be the engine for a new, fairer economy.§ From his community farm in Burscough, Hickson agrees. ※I feel like I＊m involved in a new movement that＊s building,§ he says."															
"For all those shoppers who feel chocolate bars, cartons of drink, toilet rolls and countless other products have been getting smaller, now comes official confirmation. A grand total of 2,529 products tracked by the Office for National Statistics have decreased in size over the past five years. In an analysis of the phenomenon known as ※shrinkflation§, the ONS explored whether these dwindling portions are making life more expensive. The theory goes: if a chocolate bar gets smaller but the price stays the same, that is a form of inflation because you are paying more for each bite.The issue has regularly made headlines over the last year following the decline in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote.

Only 614 products increased in size, including crisps and hand-rolling tobacco, following  requiring pouches to contain a minimum of 30g of tobacco.The ONS assures the public it catches this form of inflation because its  always check the size of an item as well as the price when they are gathering information for each month＊s inflation figures. Using its data, the ONS has now summed up recent size changes, highlighting food as particularly prone to shrinkage. But it is only in the very sweetest sub-category of ※sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery§ that downsizing is having a noticeable effect on the official inflation figures.James Brown, a partner at the firm Simon-Kucher, which advises companies on pricing strategies, said the downsizing made sense. ※You don＊t say: ＆I want to consume 120g of chocolate.＊ We say: ＆I want a chocolate bar that costs 75p or less＊,§ he said.※Shrinkflation is actually quite a successful tactic because a lot of shoppers are more sensitive to a price change than to a weight change.§With manufacturers facing higher costs for energy, ingredients, transport and packaging costs, he predicted more shrinkflation to come. Summing up its findings, the ONS said: ※No, you＊re not imagining it 每 some of your favourite sweets really are shrinking. In November 2016, Toblerone chocolate bars reduced in size by about 10%, provoking outrage online. And Maltesers, M&Ms and Minstrels have gone the same way.※But it＊s not just chocolate bars. Over the last few years, journalists have found examples of ,  getting smaller without getting any cheaper.§When the ONS looked at the data from the last five years, it found that ※lots of the items we recorded had reduced in size or weight 每 mostly in the ＆food and drink＊ category§.But it said there was ※no discernable effect§ on inflation because food and drink was a relatively small part of the basket of goods and services that is tracked to gauge overall changes in the cost of living.But the ONS said that so far there was no evidence that the Brexit vote was to blame for size changes, and pointed out that shrinkflation pre-dated the EU referendum.The statisticians said most chocolate makers had blamed the need to downsize their products on rising raw material costs. But it pointed out that the European import price of sugar had been slowly falling since the middle of 2014. In March 2017 it reached its lowest level since records began in 1991.Similarly, the statisticians said the price of cocoa had reached a five-year high in December 2015 as a result of droughts in the three biggest cocoa-exporting countries, but it had fallen sharply over the last year.The ONS added: ※Our analysis doesn＊t show a noticeable change following the referendum that would point towards a Brexit effect.§The figure of 2,529 shrinking products was taken from all the quotes recorded by collectors and the ONS said there could be some double counting if the same item was tracked by several people.Mark Jones, a food and drink solicitor at Gordons law firm, warned shrinkflation could intensify in the years ahead.※We will probably see a ＆double whammy＊ after Brexit as inflation, labour shortages and tariffs could all mean pack sizes decrease and prices rise,§ he said."															
"The pound slumped to three-decade lows against the US dollar after the  vote over worries about the UK economy＊s long-term prospects outside the EU. Over the past month, sterling has edged up slightly against the US currency. This is partly because some investors have brought forward expectations of when the Bank of England will raise interest rates from an all-time low of 0.25%, but it is also because the dollar has weakened against a range of currencies. Compared with the night of the referendum in June last year, the pound is still down about 13% against the dollar and around 14% down against the euro.The FTSE 100 index of shares in big companies plunged the day after the referendum but quickly recovered and ended 2016 at a record high. That rise was driven in part by the pound＊s weakness which helps the many companies in the index that report in dollars and those blue chip companies with a large proportion of foreign earnings. While the FTSE 100 has not surpassed the record high achieved in early June, the index is up over the last month and is now around 18% above its level on the night of the Brexit vote. The FTSE 250 index of midcaps is up about 14% from its level on 23 June 2016.Lower than forecastInflation has risen rapidly since the EU referendum as the sharp drop in the value of the pound pushes up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Last month, however, inflation fell unexpectedly and for the first time in nine months to 2.6%, down from a four-year high of 2.9% in May. The fall was mainly driven by lower fuel prices, reflecting weaker oil prices and providing some respite for cash-strapped consumers. But household budgets are still under pressure from falling real pay, as inflation outpaces wage growth of 1.8%.Policymakers are hoping that stronger exports and business investment will help to offset a downturn in consumer spending. The latest official trade figures showed that exports did rise in May, by 2.5%, but imports rose by an even bigger 4.8%. That meant the deficit in trade in goods with the rest of the world widened more than expected, to ?11.86bn in May from ?10.6bn in April. When services such as banking and legal work were included, the deficit widened by ?1bn to ?3.1bn, reflecting an increase in imports.UK firms had a tougher time in June than was expected, with business activity growing at its weakest pace for four months. Growth slowed in all three key areas of manufacturing, construction and services according to the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers＊ indices (PMIs). Growth in services, Britain＊s biggest sector, was particularly weak, as consumer-facing businesses including hotels and restaurants were hit by the squeeze on household incomes. The PMIs are tracked for early clues on official GDP figures, and the authors of the reports said that despite weakness in June, the second quarter overall was on track to beat 0.2% growth in the first quarter.A slowing economy, rising inflation and a decline in corporation tax receipts meant the UK borrowed more than expected in June, with the country＊s budget deficit rising to ?6.9bn 每 almost 50% higher than in the same month last year. Higher inflation, which followed sterling＊s slump after the Brexit vote, pushed up the cost of financing the portion of government debt linked to rising prices. Lower GDP growth in the first quarter put pressure on tax receipts while a bigger than expected contribution to the EU budget added to the ?2bn of extra borrowing. After the first three months of the financial year, borrowing was up almost 9% compared with the first quarter of last year.Household budgets have come under pressure from a fall in real pay, as prices rise faster than wages. That trend continued, according to the latest data, which showed average earnings including bonuses (shown above) rose 1.8% in the three months to May, year on year. That was in line with expectations, but a slowdown compared with 2.1% growth in the three months to April. Adjusting for inflation, pay fell by 0.7% over the period, the biggest drop since the summer of 2014. Real pay fell despite a surprise drop in the unemployment rate from 4.6% to 4.5%, which was the lowest since 1975.Retail sales rebounded in June as the warm weather encouraged consumers to splash out on summer clothing. Sales volumes rose by 0.6% over the month, beating the 0.4% increase forecast by economists. The rise followed a sharp 1.1% drop in May. A better-than-expected June pushed up retail sales by 1.5% in the second quarter overall, following a 1.4% first-quarter fall.The latest monthly snapshot of the housing market from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) showed house prices rose at the slowest rate in 11 months in June. A net balance of 7% of surveyors saw prices rise rather than fall in June, down from 17% in May. It was the weakest since July 2016, a month after the Brexit vote, as political uncertainty weighed on the property market. The picture differed regionally, with London being the weakest market, followed by the south-east.UK productivity has dropped back to where it was at the end of 2007 just before the economy was plunged into recession. Official figures from the ONS showed output per worker fell 0.5% in the first three months of 2017, damaging living standards and ending a run of positive quarterly growth in 2016 which had pulled productivity just above the 2007 peak. The ONS said that had productivity in the UK returned to its pre-recession trend, it would be 20% higher than its current level, meaning Britain would be one-fifth better off.The dashboard analyses how key parts of the economy have performed since April, during the run-up to the referendum, and compares key monthly economic indicators with how they were expected to come in, based on the consensus forecasts in polling of economists by news service Reuters."															
"The sharp fall in sterling triggered by the EU referendum result is having an adverse effect on Britain＊s already weak public finances but has yet to bring about the expected improvement in the trade deficit, a Guardian analysis of the economic news of the past month shows.In a period in which business confidence took a hit from the government＊s loss of its overall majority in the , the Guardian＊s monthly tracker found little evidence that the impact of a more competitive currency was offsetting a slowdown in consumer spending caused by dearer imports.The latest data suggests the first official estimate of growth in the second quarter 每 due on Wednesday 每 will show a modest pickup from the 0.2% recorded in the first three months of 2017 but will not match the robust expansion recorded in the first six months after the  vote.Despite a weather-induced pickup in retail activity in June, consumer spending has been dampened by the failure of wages to keep pace with prices 每 a feature of the economy since the turn of the year.There have been some signs over the past month that the effects of the post-Brexit referendum depreciation of the pound may soon start to fade. The annual inflation rate showed a surprise fall to 2.6% from 2.9%, helped by cheaper fuel prices, while industry＊s fuel and raw material bills are rising by 10% a year rather than the 20% rate of increase seen at the turn of the year.The pound started to fall against other currencies in the autumn of 2015 as financial markets started to factor in the possibility of the UK voting to leave the EU. By the time it reached its low point shortly after Theresa May raised the prospect at the , sterling had fallen by 22% against a basket of currencies. It has since risen by around 4% and is currently trading at just under $1.30 against the US dollar.A weaker currency makes exports cheaper and imports dearer, but the latest set of official trade figures found that a rise in exports was accompanied by an even bigger increase in imports. In May, imports grew by 4.8%, almost double the 2.5% increase in exports, and, as a result, the UK trade deficit in goods widened by more than ?1bn to ?11.9bn. David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee and professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, said: ※Once again this month, there is only thin economic gruel in the data. The UK economy is continuing to be impacted by the fall in the pound post-Brexit, which has raised import prices, resulting in a temporary rise in inflation.§To gauge the impact of the  vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has been tracking eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the stock market. Unemployment beat economists＊ expectations, falling to its lowest level since 1975, retail sales bounced back more strongly than anticipated as a result of the hot weather in June and inflation undershoot.But surveys of business all showed slower growth, the trade deficit was bigger, earnings were weak and house price growth moderated.The public finances were ?2bn deeper in the red in June than in the same month of 2016 每 with half the rise due to the higher debt interest on government borrowing caused by higher inflation.The former Bank of England policy maker, Andrew Sentance, said he expected the second quarter growth figures to show the economy was expanding at a annual rate of just 1% in the first six months of the year.※It is not hard to explain why the momentum of consumer spending has stalled so badly,§ said Sentance, now a senior economic adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ※Real wages are now falling, even though inflation fell back to 2.6% in June. The main reason for the fall in inflation was the drop in the oil price, but it is still reasonable to expect inflation to rise above 3% later this year as the weakness of sterling continues to feed through to the prices paid by consumers.§Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said: ※With the economy showing signs of losing momentum and inflation showing a surprise fall to 2.6%, the latest data suggest that August could well see the Bank of England revise down its forecasts for the economy and put to bed the prospect of a rate hike any time soon, albeit with the door left open for a tightening of policy if the economic data surprise to the upside as we move through the second half of the year. ※However, given the recent disappointing flow of economic data, policymakers should perhaps acknowledge the risk that policy may need to be loosened to help the economy through this soft patch if conditions deteriorate further.§ "															
" I keep waiting for the good news that the Brexiters told us would come once the vote to leave the EU was in. The vote was an unexpected shock to the markets that was always going to take a while to work its way into the main economic data. A year on, Britain is the slowest-growing country in both the G7 and the EU28.  As a result of the Brexit vote and the economic uncertainty it unleashed, Britain is fast becoming the sick man of Europe. That seems unlikely to change soon.  Once again this month, there is only thin economic gruel in the data. The UK economy is continuing to be impacted by the fall in the pound post-Brexit, which has raised import prices, resulting in a temporary rise in inflation.  which was below what most commentators had expected. But the latest estimate for nominal wage growth, that is not adjusted for price changes, for May fell to 1.8% down from 2.1% in April. Real wage growth started falling in April at -0.3% and the rate of decline accelerated in May to -0.7%. UK productivity performance continues to be disastrous, . Output per worker fell 0.5% in the first three months of 2017. The French continue to produce in four days what Britain produces in five. The major consequence of this is likely to be a fall in demand going forward. The latest retail sales numbers suggested a pickup in June with decent weather after a disastrous May. But, on the year, sales are broadly flat and going nowhere. The rise in unsecured borrowing is likely coming to an end. The savings rate, which is at historically low levels, is inevitably going to pick up as people start saving for a rainy day driven by  uncertainty. Industrial production is falling. There is no floor in sight.The concern is that the monetary policy committee has little firepower to help if things get worse with rates so close to zero, and the chancellor seems to be awol. Here＊s hoping. The evidence from business surveys and other economic indicators is consistent with continued slow growth in the UK economy in the second quarter. PwC＊s ※nowcast§ of GDP growth points to a 0.3% increase in Q2, after 0.2% in Q1. That is equivalent to annualised growth of just 1% in the first half of this year, less than half the average growth rate of around 2.5% which the UK economy enjoyed from 2013 until 2016.The squeeze on consumer spending from higher inflation is one of the key drivers of the slowdown. Even though retail sales picked up in June, this was only a partial recovery from the drop in May. The average level of retail sales volumes in the first half of this year is almost identical to the second half of 2016. In other words, the underlying trend is flat, after three years (2014 to 2016) when average retail sales growth was nearly 4.5% a year. It is not hard to explain why the momentum of consumer spending has stalled so badly. Real wages are now falling, even though inflation fell back to 2.6% in June. The main reason for the fall in inflation was the drop in the oil price, but it is still reasonable to expect inflation to rise above 3% later this year as the weakness of sterling continues to feed through to the prices paid by consumers.The employment figures paint a more positive picture, with the jobless rate dropping to 4.5% 每 the lowest we have seen for more than 40 years. But if slow growth continues through this year, as seems likely, unemployment is likely to start edging up. The jobs market is normally a lagging indicator of the economy, so the weakness in GDP growth in the first half of this year is likely to put a dampener on job creation in the remainder of 2017."															
" The International Monetary Fund has cut its growth forecast for the UK economy this year after a weak performance in the first three months of 2017.In its first downgrade for the UK since the EU referendum in June last year, the IMF said it expected the British economy to expand by 1.7% this year, 0.3 points lower than when it last made predictions in April.The Fund raised its forecasts for the UK . In October 2016, it pencilled in growth of 1.1% for 2017, raising this forecast to 1.5% in January this year and to 2% in April.Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF＊s economic counsellor, pointed to a marked change in early 2017. He said the UK＊s growth forecast had been lowered based on its ※tepid performance§ so far this year, adding: ※The ultimate impact of Brexit on the United Kingdom remains unclear.§The IMF left its growth forecast for the UK in 2018 unchanged at 1.5% but said one key risk facing the global economy was that the Brexit talks would end in failure.It contrasted its gloomier outlook for the UK with a , with 2017 growth upgrades for the four biggest eurozone countries 每 Germany, France, Italy and Spain.Germany has been revised up by 0.2 points to 1.8%, France by 0.1 points to 1.5%, while Italy and Spain have both been revised up by 0.5 points to 1.3% and 3.1% respectively.The Fund produces a world economic outlook in April and October to coincide with its spring and annual meetings, but provides updates in January and July.Launching the report in Kuala Lumpur, Obstfeld said the IMF had left its global growth forecasts unchanged at 3.5% in 2017 and 3.6% for next year, noting that the stronger performance by the eurozone, China and Japan had been offset by weaker performances elsewhere.※The recovery in global growth that we projected in April is on a firmer footing; there is now no question mark over the world economy＊s gain in momentum,§ Obstfeld said.He added that .※From a global growth perspective, the most important downgrade is the United States,§ he said. ※Over the next two years, US growth should remain above its longer-run potential growth rate. But we have reduced our forecasts for both 2017 and 2018 to 2.1% because near-term US fiscal policy looks less likely to be expansionary than we believed in April.§ Three months ago, the IMF said it expected growth in the world＊s biggest economy to be 2.3% this year and 2.5% next. The Fund said that while the risk of a repeat of the electoral shocks of 2016 每 Brexit and Trump＊s presidential victory 每 had declined, policy uncertainty remained at a high level and could rise further. It singled out ※difficult-to-predict US regulatory and fiscal policies, negotiations of post-Brexit arrangements, or geopolitical risks§, all of which it said could harm confidence, deter private investment, and weaken growth."															
"Spending by British consumers is growing at the weakest rate in almost three years, as households squeezed by rising prices tighten their belts. Household spending growth slowed to 0.1% in the three months to June, the , the slowest rate of quarterly growth since the final three months of 2014. Business investment in the British economy showed no growth at all in the second quarter.The slowdown in private consumption, which was worse than expected by City economists, comes as . The slump in the value of the pound since the UK＊s vote to leave the European Union last year is also taking its toll.Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ※Consumer spending is likely to be pressurised through the latter months of the year by an ongoing appreciable squeeze on purchasing power. Indeed, real incomes growth is likely to remain negative for some months to come.§Some of the fall in household spending could be attributed to consumers shifting their car purchases to beat a tax change earlier this year, according to analysts at Capital .※We remain optimistic that a modest acceleration in growth in the second half of the year is in prospect,§ said Paul Hollingworth, UK economist at the consultancy. After a 0.6% expansion in the first quarter, the flat level of business investment in the three months to June was particularly disappointing to economists, and could point to firms＊ concerns and uncertainties over Brexit limiting spending decisions. , the TUC general secretary, said the government should keep single-market membership on the negotiating table in Brexit talks to help bolster confidence among firms. ※Instead of getting match-fit for Brexit, business investment is sat on the bench and the economy is sliding towards the relegation zone,§ she said. The ONS reaffirmed its, illustrating the sluggish pace of the UK economy. With inflation at close to peak levels, the Bank of England could be put off from raising interest rates before late 2018, or even early 2019, according to Archer. Britain＊s dominant services sector continued to drive the economy, offsetting a slump in construction and manufacturing. Although weaker consumer spending is worrying in the short term, it could allay fears over households continuing to spend on credit cards, potentially building problems for the future. Sebastian Burnside, a senior economist at RBS, said: ※Households are responding by slowing that spending and putting their finances on a more stable footing. That might not be good for growth this quarter, but it is a much more reassuring sign for the longer term.§Separately, the CBI said retail sales declined in the year to August, disappointing expectations that growth would hold broadly steady. In a survey of 117 firms, of which 57 were retailers, the industry body found sales for the time of year were considered to be below normal to the greatest extent since October 2014.Anna Leach, the head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said: ※Retail sales have cooled as higher inflation continues to squeeze consumers＊ pockets. Looking ahead, firms do expect sales growth to recover, but the pressures on household budgets are set to persist, given little sign of wages picking up.§"															
"unday signaled the completion of a major milestone: the end of the first round of negotiations to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Canada,  and the US are set to meet over multiple rounds in the coming months.Too frequently I have heard the mantra ※do no harm§ from industry leaders as they encourage Donald Trump＊s negotiations. I take a different stand, as I have since Nafta was signed into law 23 years ago. This is an opportunity to do right by workers across the continent. This moment must not be squandered by pandering to transnational special interests. Some of us in Congress, and many workers throughout our heartland, have been waiting for this moment for years.Workers in the midwest cite trade, and Nafta in particular, as a top reason they supported Trump＊s candidacy. In my district in northern Ohio this past election, Trump flipped two historically Democratic counties and almost won a third, Lorain, which voted for Hillary Clinton by the smallest of margins. It is no coincidence that his message on ripping up Nafta resonated with workers hardest hit by the export of hundreds of thousands of American jobs. In his opening salvo, the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, correctly emphasized that the deal had ※failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement§. To fulfill these goals there will need to be major changes, not simple tweaks. America needs a continental compact that lifts workers on all sides of the border, raises wages and balances US trade accounts.Trade agreements are highly complex documents. Their benefits to investors can be quantified; by contrast, their costs to workers are acute and cruel if not done right. Think of communities in the midwest ravaged by the loss of manufacturing jobs. Ohio alone lost about  to Mexico. In rural Mexico, nearly  were lost as imports decimated local economies and forced economic migration as people became desperate for opportunity. Some economists and some of my  suggest deficits are a healthy aspect of trade agreements, citing mighty American buying power as a singular point of success. That is a distorted view. Mammoth deficits are not beneficial when the job loss behind the imbalance creates seismic economic and cultural pressures. The trade deficit can even  as huge trade deficits can create slow growth economies. Just in June, the US experienced a . These deficits mean more money left the wallets of hardworking Americans to feed the greed of rapacious, low-wage seeking transnational interests. Just look at Nafta＊s job numbers: between 1997 and 2010, the US  to Mexico. To help remedy this, Lighthizer should adopt the concept of my bill, the  (HR 2766), as a fundamental stance of US trade policy. It requires the administration adjust policy with any nation accumulating a trade deficit of $10bn or more for three consecutive years. Alternatively, Congress should pass and the president should sign this bill as part of our commitment to lowering trade deficits.There is no doubt that the US economy possesses unparalleled buying power, but trade is about workers, not just goods. Imagine if North America negotiated a deal that lifted the standard of living of workers and local economies by granting increased buying power for US goods? Nearly three decades ago, we were told Nafta was the epitome of a modern trade agreement. Supporters assured job growth, increased economic flexibility for North American industries and new buyers for American goods. The Nafta trade model simply has not lived up to those promises. Wages in Mexico and the US  or declined since Nafta, and working conditions have worsened. This time around, workers in all three countries need truly enforceable provisions that protect their right to organize, work in safe environments and earn livable wages. Enforcement must come with a mechanism for investigation and remediation when violations of wage and working conditions violate the spirit of the agreement.Nafta is not an ethereal idea about trade policy and goods. It is about people, jobs and how much money goes into the paychecks of workers across the continent. The US economy and global corporations can surely benefit from international trade agreements, but that is not enough. Our trade negotiators＊ top priority must be the US worker and promoting fair rather than just free trade. In doing so, the continent will achieve a compact for democratic development across North America. "															
"here was little in  on Wednesday to indicate that the European Central Bank plans to stop pumping cheap money in to the eurozone anytime soon.Some expected him to use the platform of a speech to a gathering of Nobel economics laureates and students to say that a long period of growth across the 19-member currency bloc warranted a reduction in the ECB＊s quantitative easing stimulus programme.It＊s more than two years since  at a rate of 60bn a month to act as a drip feed for the ailing eurozone economy.At its launch, Draghi said the scheme would end in September 2017, but the patient＊s waning energy levels meant this was subsequently extended into next year.There are still good months and bad months for the eurozone, but in the main, it is looking healthier than at any time in the last five years and many Germans in particular, keen for higher interest on their savings, want the drip withdrawn and interest rates to rise.To emphasise the point, eurozone economic surveys for July were buoyed by improvements in manufacturing output while employment continued to grow and business investment remained stable. The data provider Markit said its combined purchasing managers＊ index, which covers manufacturing, services and construction industries, edged higher from 55.7 to 55.8 in August as manufacturing exports improved significantly. That＊s a healthy level of activity and could be seen as an indicator of economic wellbeing.Why then is Draghi still keeping interest rates at near zero and flooding the system with cheap money? He could at least have said the day is nearing when the central bank can step back. But why would he when other indicators point in the opposite direction? Inflation remains subdued and so do wages. Without a surge in wages across the bloc, and not just in Germany, shop price inflation is going nowhere. Oil prices also show no sign of rising significantly. Brent crude has failed to rise much above $55 a barrel over the last year and is currently at $51.50, less than half its value in 2014.If anything Draghi might offer more stimulus given that the euro has picked up in value against most currencies and especially against the pound, possibly putting a brake on exports. But he won＊t because the average rise is to a level still well below that seen before the 2008 financial crash.There are also the warning signs hanging over the global economy. All the indications are that growth in the G7 economies and emerging markets will continue for the rest of the year, but then the 10-year recovery from the crash looks to be running out of steam.Wall Street analysts at HSBC, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley said there was evidence global markets had entered the last stage of their rallies before the current business cycle comes to an end.The analysts said stock market investors were ignoring the corporate sector＊s flagging profits. Money was continuing to pour into equities anyway, increasing valuations across the board. The mismatch with profits had grown to levels not seen since the crash, so at the very least a correction in share prices was likely.Booming stock markets are not supposed to be a crucial element in the mix of factors underpinning sustainable economic forecasts. However, they play an important role in supporting business and consumer confidence, which means a correction could trigger a recession, at least in vulnerable countries.The UK could be one of them, according to UBS, which says Britain＊s recovery from the EU vote is almost illusory. Its model of the UK economy predicts stagnation in the near future and an end to talk of rising interest rates from not just the ECB, but the Bank of England as well.Sir Martin Sorrell believes his advertising clients are already nervous about the outlook for economic growth.  that will reduce his company WPP＊s 2017 growth rate from the 3.1% prediction made last year, and 2% signalled in March, to between 0% and 1%.Before you shed a tear for the the perma-tanned  boss, who raked in ?70m in salary, shares and bonuses in 2015 and ?48m last year, his investors are likely to stick with him. They have benefited from 3% profit growth since 2013, which for a business with near-20% profit margins that have little extra headroom, is impressive.Sorrell promises a bounce-back as firms seek to advertise their way out of stagnant sales. Will clients give him their money or will they prefer Google and Facebook? If the global economy dips and stock markets slide, they might do neither."															
															
"A hotly contested race for one of Westminster＊s most coveted jobs enters its final stages this weekend as six Conservatives battle to run the powerful Treasury select committee.Once seen as a consolation prize for MPs passed over for a cabinet seat, since the financial crisis of 2008 the occupant has become better known 每 and arguably more influential 每 than many ministers.The last chairman, Andrew Tyrie, won a reputation as Westminster＊s inquisitor general after his relentless grillings of Mark Carney, Philip Hammond, government officials and countless bank bosses.Tyrie would have been a shoo-in had he not quit as an MP at the election. His retirement created an unexpected vacancy for a battle that ahead of a ballot in which all MPs can vote looks too hard to call.Tyrie held memorable sessions that forced , the drug-taking former chairman of Co-op Bank, to admit he didn＊t know the size of the bank＊s balance sheet and  to resign as deputy governor of the Bank of England for failing to disclose her brother＊s senior role at Barclays.The prestigious nature of the job is illustrated by the list of candidates 每 such as Nicky Morgan, sacked as education secretary by Theresa May, and two MPs who sat on the committee under Tyrie＊s chairmanship. is hoping to win the backing of Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP members for her soft Brexit approach.Another high-profile contender is Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has sought to reach out to opposition MPs by saying he would not use the chair as a megaphone for his pro-Brexit views.The ballot is on Wednesday and the winner should be announced that evening or the following day. Here are their pitches 每 and the issues they say are their main concerns.The only candidate with cabinet experience and a former City solicitor, Morgan says she has proved her independence since losing her job as education secretary, especially over . One Labour MP said Morgan would get support from opposition parties. She would be the first woman in the post.Ensuring full parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit. Public sector pay. A focus on the wider economy and not just the City. Seen as one of the frontrunners.In terms of high public profile, Rees-Mogg rivals Morgan. The tussles between him and Carney were among the highlights of the committee＊s proceedings in the last parliament, with the Somerset MP accusing the Bank governor of ※political partisanship§ because of his dire warnings over Brexit. But Rees-Mogg 每 who is still working in City fund management 每 insists that he would not use the chair for anti-Europe sermonising, leaving that to the Brexit committee. His aim, he says,?would be to ※achieve consensus and balance§. Holding Hammond and Carney to account. Brexit 每 in a non-partisan way. The failings of the banks, particularly in customer service. Another frontrunner, but he will need to win some opposition support.The MP for Weston-super-Mare has already had one of his ideas 每 the creation of a UK sovereign wealth fund 每 included in the Conservative manifesto. The Treasury committee, he says, should be at the centre of the ※new and changing debate about the kind of post-Brexit economy we want to have§.

"The US bourbon industry has warned that its business and consumers around the world will be harmed if the European Union acts on .At the G20 summit in Hamburg on Friday, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said that if the US took measures against Germany and China＊s steel industries, the EU would ※react with counter-measures§ within a few days.Officials confirmed that one of the targeted products could be bourbon whiskey, 95% of which comes from , the home state of US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and a state that voted 62.5% for Trump in last year＊s election.※This is a really important industry to Kentucky, so people will not be happy that this in the air,§ Susan Reigler, president of , said.Bourbon brings $166m in tax revenue to Kentucky annually, and the industry employs nearly 17,500 people in the state, according to the Kentucky Distillers＊ Association (KDA). ※It＊s not just the people who work in the distilleries, or the bottling plants, but also people like the grain farmers and the truckers who transport it,§ said Reigler.The US Congress declared in 1964 that bourbon could only be made in the US, just as tequila must be made in Mexico and champagne in France.Bourbon, a mix of water, grains and yeast, has historically been popular in , and US distilleries have recently been looking to grow their export market in Asia and Australia.In 2016, US spirit exports to the EU were valued at $654m, and 20% of that was from bourbon whiskey, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (Discus).※Any efforts to impose retaliatory tariffs on US spirits exports to the EU will harm consumers, producers and the US and EU spirits sectors,§ Discus said in a statement.The EU＊s warning came after the US threatened to curb steel imports for national security reasons. EU officials are concerned such a move would trigger protectionist reactions around the world, and the EU would probably respond by targeting US agricultural products such as bourbon.Juncker said the EU was prepared to react within days to a protectionist move by the US. ※I am telling you this in the hope that all of this won＊t be necessary,§ Juncker said. ※But we are in an elevated battle mood.§Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers＊ Association, said trade penalties would damage progress in the global bourbon trade.※Global markets are increasingly important to our signature industry, and we have worked hard over the past decade to open doors, level the playing field and eliminate discriminatory tariffs and policies that would put Kentucky bourbon at a competitive disadvantage,§ Gregory said.※We will continue those efforts to promote, protect and elevate its success around the world.§"															
"The  has edged closer to raising interest rates as a deeper split emerged among its committee of policymakers, with three out of eight voting for an immediate rise to keep inflation in check.The 5-3 split to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25% surprised financial markets and the  on the news. Most City economists had expected a larger majority of the committee to opt to keep borrowing costs low to ease the pressure on households from a drop in living standards in the wake of last summer＊s Brexit vote. It was the committee＊s widest split since May 2011.The financial markets had expected just one policymaker, Kristin Forbes, to maintain her previous vote for a rate rise to 0.5%. In the event she was joined by Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders.Their call for higher borrowing costs follows a rise in inflation to even further above the Bank＊s 2.0% target. Data released on Tuesday showed that , driven in part by the pound＊s weakness since the Brexit vote, which has made imports to the UK more expensive. The pound got some support on Thursday from the prospect of higher interest rates but at $1.276 it is still down 14% against the dollar when compared with the night of the EU referendum a year ago. The pound＊s loss has been the FTSE 100＊s gain, however, as weaker sterling has flattered the earnings of the many companies on the stock index that make money overseas. The FTSE fell after the Bank decision was announced and it closed down 55 points, or 0.7%, at 7419.36.Since the  vote the Bank＊s committee of rate-setters has been forced into a balancing act between keeping import-fuelled inflation in check and providing support to the economy as uncertainty and a squeeze on incomes bites.The five policymakers voting to leave interest rates on hold at June＊s meeting, including the Bank＊s governor, Mark Carney, appeared to be more worried about a slowdown in consumer spending as . Those factors have dented overall growth and left the UK economy  and all its European neighbours in the opening months of 2017. released on Thursday cited a range of views on the MPC. They noted inflation was now expected to overshoot the Bank＊s target by more than previously expected. Supporting those voting for a rate rise, there were also signs that growth in business investment and net trade was on track to make up for weaker consumption. The minutes added that some policymakers felt it was time to start scaling back the massive package of support launched after last summer＊s EU referendum, which included a rate cut and more electronic money printing. ※But there were also arguments in favour of leaving the policy rate unchanged,§ they added.※A slowdown in household consumption, and GDP as a whole, had recently begun, and it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent it would prove to be.§All committee members agreed any rate rises would likely be at a gradual pace and ※to a limited extent§.One seat on the committee was empty 每 the result of Charlotte Hogg＊s resignation as deputy governor after. Forbes leaves the MPC later this month and investors are awaiting an announcement on her replacement.Policymakers will provide a fuller update on their thinking when they release quarterly economic forecasts and vote again on interest rates in August.James Knightley, a senior economist at the bank ING, said he still expected a majority of policymakers to tolerate higher inflation in favour of shoring up the economy.※The economic and political uncertainty, we believe, is too great to get a consensus behind higher rates and with Kristin Forbes leaving the BoE this month, the hurdle to getting that consensus will soon be harder to achieve,§ he said.But Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown said policymakers appeared to be more optimistic than many economists about the UK＊s prospects. ※It seems the willingness of the MPC to ＆look through＊ higher inflation and leave rates on hold is wearing thin, and if inflation continues to surprise we could see higher rates by the end of the summer,§ he said."															
"The way things are looking, the royal family will want to start bulk-buying birthday cards.When King George V sent the first telegrams to those celebrating their 100th birthday in 1917, . Last year, his granddaughter Queen Elizabeth sent 6,405 congratulatory cards to centenarians in the UK. Her own grandson and her great grandson will be signing a whole lot more, based on current projections. Those forecasts suggest that today＊s 10-year-olds have a 50% chance of living to at least 103. This rising longevity has come under the spotlight during the election campaign in a way the Conservatives would rather forget. No sooner had Theresa May raised the idea of people paying more for the costs of social care 每 branded a ※dementia tax§ 每 than she . The focus on the costs of an ageing society continued in a recent warning from the World Economic Forum that the retirement age in Britain and other leading developed countries  to head off a pension crisis.The WEF is right that there are huge cost implications from demographic changes taking place around the world. Indeed, the fact that a longer life is harder to fund for both the individual and state cannot remain a taboo subject, however awkward it may be to talk about who will foot the bill for more health and social care. But what is really missing from the debate about longevity is how a longer life is also a source of opportunities. At the root of this problem is the fact that our society remains largely ageist: too quick to write people off, too narrow minded about life after 60.The gerontologist Sarah Harper highlighted this last week when she called for a change to the way we talk about age.  until they were seriously frail, dependent and approaching death, said Harper, the director of the Oxford Institute of Ageing. Anything else should be called ※active adulthood§.This raises the key point that we are no longer in an age where people cease work in their sixties, expecting to enjoy only a short retirement before they die. Instead, those who get the state pension will on average spend almost a third of their adult life in retirement, as John Cridland noted in his recent  of the state pension age. But despite this seismic shift, we are still structuring life in three stages 每 childhood, work, retirement. What＊s more, the ages at which each stage begins has barely budged in decades. It is this damaging fixation with a three-stage life that Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott explore in their book . Their research in the worlds of psychology and economics feeds into a work that is a mixture of self-help book for those who want to make more of being younger for longer and a manifesto for how firms and policymakers can adapt to rising longevity. The authors make a gloomy assessment of where governments and employers currently stand in that evolutionary process.※What is striking is the contrast between the magnitude of change that society will embark upon as people live longer, and the relatively limited response from corporations and governments,§ they write. ※Saying that corporates and governments are ＆behind the curve＊ doesn＊t even come close.§But the authors also have a positive message. They concede that living longer will inevitably mean most people will have no choice but to work a great deal longer. But that is not necessarily as bad as it sounds. We simply need to think more creatively about what work is, how it can change and how we can change over a longer lifetime, in what they call a ※multi-stage life§. That could mean working at a different pace at different stages, changing path more often or taking sabbaticals, for example. On top of the longevity factor, our working lives will also be shaped by rapid technological changes. Such developments as hi-tech robots and online banking are already forcing people to adapt how they work and in some cases to retrain altogether. For some workers, robots are already stealing their jobs. But here again, a longer life offers opportunities to adapt to those pressures. As Gratton and Scott note about retraining: ※Given that across a 100-year lifespan there are 873,000 hours available and if, as is often claimed, a specialist expertise takes 10,000 hours to acquire, mastery in more than one field is neither daunting nor impossible.§ It＊s an alluring image: a world where people can take time out to retrain, their human skills are valued and nurtured by their employers and the government puts the education and welfare system in place to make it all happen.So how do we get there? Employers and policymakers can start by doing more to help the current cohort of over-50s to stay in work if they want to. There are almost a million 50- to 64-year-olds who are not in employment at all but say they are willing or would like to work, according to the  published by the government this year. In other words, despite skills shortages, employers are not making use of a whole pot of untapped talent and experience.This urgently needs to change. As the Centre for Ageing Better points out,  and employers will have to retain, retrain and recruit those older workers. One solution is to shorten or change working hours. Another is redefining older workers＊ roles so they become mentors to younger recruits, something Cridland recommended in his review. Employers must also move away from the current model where they centre so much of their training on new, young recruits.The onus is also on government to offer more and better education throughout people＊s lives. That must include financial education to help people cope with the greater number of choices a longer life will impose. Crucially, it must be education that is readily available to all.Similarly, our healthcare provision and welfare system will need to evolve so that everyone can benefit from rising longevity. Otherwise, as the 100-year Life authors point out, life risks being ※nasty, brutish and long§ for those unable to afford the kind of self-reinventions and sabbaticals that a longer life would ideally entail.It＊s a life that is hard to imagine as long as we remain stuck in our learn-work-retire model. But instead of just squabbling over care costs, pensions and retirement ages, isn＊t it time we ditched that old way of living and saw rising longevity for what it is? More time to do more things.

"Does the American dream exist? Or has the middle class ruined it by hoarding opportunity on a scale that makes even the infamous one-percenters appear harmless and ineffectual?That＊s the question economics professor and Brookings Institution fellow Richard Reeves has set out to answer, and his findings are worrying: the top echelons of the US middle class 每 those earning over $120,000 每 are separating from the rest of the US, and pulling up the drawbridge behind them.The result, Reeves writes in a new book Dream Hoarders, out this week, ※is a less competitive economy, as well as a less open society§.※The upper middle class families have become greenhouses for the cultivation of human capital. Children raised in them are on a different track to ordinary Americans, right from the very beginning,§ he writes.The upper middle class are ※opportunity hoarding§ 每 making it harder for others less economically privileged to rise to the top; a situation that Reeves says places stress on the efficiency of the US economic system and creates dynastic wealth and privilege of the kind the nation＊s fathers sought to avoid.※The US labor market is mostly meritocratic and not some kind of medieval cartel,§ Reeves told the Guardian, ※but it＊s what happens before that that is unfair.§ The problem, he says, is that people enter the race with very different levels of preparation.※Kids from more affluent backgrounds are entering the contest massively well prepared, while kids from less affluent backgrounds are not. The well-prepared kids win, and everybody pretends to themselves it＊s a meritocracy,§ he says.Reeves believes we have to think much earlier about equality of opportunity, including the way the education system, labor and housing markets work. Without reform, society continues with a system that replicates inequality, he argues.For proof of enduring discrimination that starts in the cradle, Reeves, a former Guardian journalist, looks to the persistent inequality of wealth distribution. He observes that there has been very little change in income distribution of the bottom 80% over the past 30 years.The action, he says, takes place in the upper 20%, who ※are pulling away§.※It＊s true that the top 1% are pulling away even faster, but they are a constantly changing group with a lot of circulation in and out of it. On terms of their effect, the top 1% aren＊t really a big enough group to have much of an effect.§The problem, he says, is that upper middle class are able to point to the 1% as the problem: ※It＊s those rich bastards up there.§※＆We are the 99%＊ turned out to be an incredibly unhelpful slogan, because it allowed the person in the 98th percentile to convince themselves in they＊re really in it together with the person in the 50th or 20th. But that＊s empirically wrong, because it＊s not where the inequality is, and morally wrong because the upper 20% have actually been doing pretty well,§ he says.In Reeves＊ estimation, the failure to address the issue correctly has led to fundamental misunderstandings. While many agree that the rich should pay more in taxes, no one is willing to admit they are rich. ※We need to be honest that the inequality problem does not kick in at 99%, but much earlier than that.§Further, the hoarding of economic opportunity by the upper middle class has served to maintain and reinforce systems that were, pre-civil rights, systematically racist. Zoning laws that were once used to maintain racial segregation in the housing market are now used to maintain classist segregation.※Such laws that were once race-based serve class purposes quite well so while we＊ve seen a reduction in race based segregation, we＊ve seen an increase in class-based segregation,§ he says.Reeves 每 born and raised in the UK but now an American citizen 每 says he was astonished to learn that some US university admissions systems are , favoring ※legacy§ students whose parent or parents also attended. Systems that were developed to keep jews out of Ivy League colleges have now been re-purposed to maintain class-based preferences.A further example is the use of internships. Dream Hoarders cites data that found even in institutions that promote their belief in meritocracy, including Mike Bloomberg＊s New York mayoral administration, rely heavily on nepotism and its affiliated systems.Of the 1,500 interns hired during Bloomberg＊s three-term administration, one in five had been recommended by someone within the administration, Reeves writes. Such practices, he writes, undermine claims of a meritocratic society. ※In some ways, the myth of United States as a classless society is getting in the way,§ he writes.That belief, Reeves adds, ※stands in the way of the recognition of privilege and advantage that＊s needed before any change can be brought about. Is it about privilege to give internships away? Internships are a leg up into the labor market, and it＊s striking we don＊t have those conversations.§But as controversy swirls around Trump＊s willingness to rely on his children or their spouses as White House advisers, and indeed the ethics of Trump＊s business practices, Reeves believes conversations about privilege and its effects on a meritocracy-based society are coming to the forefront.※One of the silver linings of Trump＊s victory is some introspection among the upper middle class. There＊s a growing willingness to accept that some advantages are not the result of purely meritocratic society and are the result of a rigged system and people have a right to be angry. It＊s a difficult conversation but until we have it, there＊s no chance of a solution.§"															
"A ?520m case is scheduled to begin in the high court on Monday that will scrutinise the months leading up to Royal Bank of Scotland＊s ?45bn bailout at the height of the financial crisis. Along with other directors, the disgraced former RBS chief executive  will be forced to defend accusations that investors were misled into buying shares in the Edinburgh-based bank.Barring an eleventh-hour settlement, the case will open in London＊s high court and will require top bankers to give evidence in court for the first time since the bank was bailed out with taxpayers＊ cash in 2008.Goodwin and other former senior bankers will be forced to pore over the detail in the prospectus issued when . At the time, it was a record-breaking sum.The long-running legal action, which is a civil case that will be heard by a high court judge without a jury, is being brought by 9,000 individuals and big City investors who put up their cash to take part in the April rights issue and lost out when the bank was bailed out six months later.Alongside Goodwin, the case names three former directors and the bank itself in a claim that focuses on accusations that untrue or misleading statements were made about the financial health of the bank at the time of the cash call.RBS 每 which is supporting the former directors＊ legal cases and costs 每 has settled with 87% of the investors who had brought claims related to the rights issue, and has not admitted liability during the settlements. Earlier this month, Sir Howard Davies, chairman of RBS, said: ※If we do not reach settlement with the remaining claimants, we will defend ourselves vigorously when the trial starts on 22 May.§The claim was originally brought in the name of John Greenwood, a 75-year-old retired civil engineer from Huddersfield who lost ?45,000, although RBS eventually faced claims from five groups of investors whose total claims reached ?4bn.In December, to share among the different groups making claims. RBS has settled with all but the remaining group, whose claim is for ?520m but which could amount to ?800m if interest is included.Some of the funding for the investor group is provided by the racehorse and pub owner Trevor Hemmings 每 who also owns Preston North End football club 每 who lost money himself. RBS staff are also among the claimants, while the former RBS board member Sir Angus Grossart, also a former shareholder, has attempted to join the action.Goodwin is scheduled to give evidence for two days, starting on 8 June 每 the day of the general election. He has not publicly discussed his role at RBS  and offered a ※profound and unqualified apology for all of the distress that has been caused.§ However, he said it was too simple to blame him for the bank＊s collapse.The case, for which RBS expects to incur ?125m of legal fees, will be heard by Mr Justice Hildyard and is expected to last 14 weeks. But according to reports, it could take seven years to establish the bank＊s liability and quantify damages if appeals are made.The rights issue took place just months after the Edinburgh-based bank had been part of a consortium taking over the Dutch bank ABN Amro.Shareholders were offered 11 new shares at 200p for every 18 they owned. Comparisons with the current share price are made difficult by changes to the share base since the bailout but the equivalent price would be 2,000p. The shares were trading on Friday at 266p, compared with the average price of 502p at which the bank was bailed out. Taxpayers still own more than 70% of the bank.Goodwin had been named Forbes business man of the year in 2002 after masterminding the takeover of NatWest ."															
"Consumers failed to propel the UK economy in the first quarter as rising prices dampened appetite for spending, official figures will show this week.City economists believe the Office for National Statistics will confirm on Thursday that  from 0.7% in the previous quarter.The second estimate of GDP growth provides a more detailed breakdown of how the economy performed, including a first take on consumer spending.Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, said the detail was likely to confirm that the first quarter was ※a very soft period§ for household spending, following decent growth of 0.7% in the previous quarter.He said a consumer slowdown was likely to weigh on the wider economy, which grew by 1.8% in 2016.※Thanks to the rise in inflation, household finances are now facing headwinds rather than tailwinds and this is principally why we are expecting a year of relatively subdued GDP growth of 1.7% over 2017 as a whole,§ Shaw said.The first estimate suggested that growth in consumer-facing businesses slowed sharply in the period January to March. Growth in the service sector, which includes hotels, bars and restaurants, slowed to 0.3% from 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Growth in industrial production and construction output also slowed over the period, to 0.1% and 0.2% respectively.Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said there was a chance that growth could be revised down in the second estimate.※If anything the risks look to be slightly slanted to the downside rather than the upside,§ he said.Separate ONS data due on Tuesday will give the first insight into the state of the public finances after the new fiscal year got underway in April.The figures are expected to show the government borrowed ?9.5bn last month, up from ?9.1bn in the same month a year earlier. It would be the highest level of borrowing in the month of April since 2015.In the 2016-17 financial year to the end of March, , narrowing the gap between what the government spends and earns.It was the lowest deficit since 2007-08, and meant that chancellor Philip Hammond essentially met his ?51.7bn target, set by by the Treasury＊s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, at the time of the budget in March.However, the OBR expects borrowing to rise again this year, to ?55.2bn, partly owing to one-off factors but also because of ."															
															
"My friend Paul Whitehouse told me the news in my local cafe. At first I thought he was practising a sketch for a re-run of the much-missed .Sadly, he wasn＊t. Theresa May＊s repeated denials of an intention to call a snap election had gone the way of so many of her inconsistent and often fatuous pronouncements. There was going to be an election after all.First reports were that she had come to this momentous decision while walking in Snowdonia. But it is pretty obvious that, notwithstanding the denials, the Conservative party machine had been cranking up for some time. Nearly 20 years ago, Gordon Brown and his team were geared up to announce operational independence for the Bank of England if elected, but the chancellor-to-be did not finalise the decision until the weekend before. It was a big moment for Brown, the Bank and the nation. Similarly, this election could well be historic 每 not in a good sense, as I hope to explain 每 but the decision to call it appears to have been finalised in the wonderful atmosphere of the Snowdonia national park.I know the area well and can report that, whatever the impression given by the  vote in south Wales and some of the constituencies on the north coast, there is strong support for our membership of the EU among the people I meet in Penrhyndeudraeth and Dolgellau.I suspect the locals are shocked that a walk in Snowdonia should be associated with an election whose manifesto, the  tells us, will herald ※Theresa＊s Cast-Iron Brexit Pledge§.I did not get where I am today forecasting the results of elections, and have never forgotten my failure, along with the economist Roger Bootle, to take advantage of the odds of 6-1 against the Conservatives being offered by bookmakers at Ascot the day before the 1992 election.All I will venture at this stage is to express the hope that we shall not witness the landslide so many people seem to be predicting. Many factors have been cited to explain May＊s decision, not least the opinion polls, the persistent criticism of Brown for not having ※sought his own mandate§ in 2007, and strong pressure from her colleagues. Also, one suspects, a desire to cock a snook at George Osborne, the godfather of the fixed-term parliament.However, I suspect there is another factor: what a latter-day Thucydides might call ※the truest cause§. Not to put too fine a point on it, May has called this election to get it out of the way before enough people wake up to how catastrophic Brexit is going to be.Now, according to May, ※the country is coming together but Westminster is not§. Oh yes? That is not my impression. The country is torn apart, but with the honourable exceptions of the Lib Dems, Kenneth Clarke, the Scot Nats and the Greens, Westminster has caved in, lamely accepting the triggering of article 50.I read somewhere that May, riding high, is the most powerful prime minister since the war. Really? We shall see. One thing is clear: by caving in to the  and their fellow Brexiters, she now owns the consequences of Brexit. If she ploughs on, she could end up by 2020 as the most unpopular prime minister since records began 每 a feat once achieved by Margaret Thatcher, until she was saved by the Falklands war.At a time when this country has a surfeit of economic problems 每 for example, the pressure on the health service and social care, the savage cuts to the budgets of state schools, and the rise in crime associated pretty obviously with cuts to the police force 每 the last thing we need is Brexit on top of a misconceived austerity programme.After the election there will presumably be a July budget, accompanied by forecasts from the estimable Office for Budget Responsibility, which will begin to show the economic consequences of the government＊s acceptance of a referendum that was conducted beneath a veil of ignorance and deceit.It is no good people fantasising about a ※soft Brexit§. Under the ※leadership§ of May we are leaving the customs union and the single market 每 a market the inception of which Thatcher did so much to foster. And the economic consequences?They are devastating. As Llewellyn Consulting points out, not only is the EU the UK＊s largest export market, ※the US, the UK＊s second-largest trading partner, is significantly less important than the EU§. Of course, the Brexiters go on and on about the opportunities posed by trade with the US and Asia. But, again, ※Asia＊s big three economies (China, Japan and India) are less important still§.All the evidence is that the free-trade agreements that the Brexiters promise us will take many years to negotiate. Llewellyn Consulting estimates that leaving the single market and reverting to a free-trade agreement with the EU could reduce our exports by approximately 20%. Given that exports are 20% of our gross domestic product, ※the net effect would be to reduce UK GDP by around 4%§.At a time when Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is warning that the pressures on the public finances are enormous, and posing serious implications for the nation＊s taxable capacity, the implications of a suicidal abandonment of our main export market are immense.There is only one sensible option. It is to remain in the market that we are told ※the people§ want to leave. I fear that May came to quite the wrong conclusion in my beloved Snowdonia. And it is the younger generation that are going to suffer most, unless they revolt."															
"It is ※urgent§ to reach an agreement on a loan program for Greece but a commitment is still required from Athens on reforms and from  on debt relief, a senior IMF official said on Friday.※It is urgent that we agree on a program and that we conclude these discussions ,§ Poul Thomsen, head of the IMF＊s European department, said. ※There is no doubt about that, it＊s serious.§ Talks between , the International Monetary Fund and the eurozone have dragged on for many months. But Athens needs a fresh infusion of funds soon to make its debt payments due in July.Despite pressure from European heavyweight , the IMF so far has refused to participate in the 86 billion euro loan program the eurozone agreed with Greece in mid-2015, the third since 2010, largely over the issue of the nation＊s debt sustainability.On the reform side, while some outstanding issues remain, Thomsen said ※good progress§ has been made with the Greek authorities in recent weeks, including on budget issues. An IMF mission will be back in Athens ※next week.§Greece announced on Friday a budgetary surplus (excluding debt charges) of 3.9% of GDP in 2016, in line with targets.European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici welcomed the result. ※This should contribute to the will for the steps that lie ahead to find a lasting and comprehensive solution,§ he said on the sidelines of the IMF spring meeting.French Economy Minister Michel Sapin also was optimistic about a deal. ※I am quite confident that we will find, with the IMF and Germany, a solution that will help Greece and thus the EU to stabilize the situation,§ he said.Thomsen, however, said disagreements persist over the period of time in which Athens will have to meet the surplus objective, which the IMF considers too ambitious.The eurozone says Greece can deliver a primary surplus of 3.5% of in 2018 but the IMF has said only 1.5% is feasible. The IMF also needs more clarification from Europe on how it will implement the promised debt relief for Greece, he said.If these two issues are resolved, the IMF will be able to participate financially in the aid plan, as it did in 2010 and 2012, Thomsen said.IMF chief  on Friday met with Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos and she had ※constructive§ discussions, but did not provide further details. She has stressed the fund cannot participate in any loan program unless the debt level of the country is considered sustainable."															
"Britain＊s retailers suffered a third consecutive month of falling sales in March, according to industry figures that add to evidence that a post-referendum rise in living costs is denting consumer spending.In advance of official inflation figures on Tuesday, expected to confirm sharper price rises in the shops, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said takings were down 1% compared with March last year.Its monthly snapshot showed that a dip in demand for clothing, toys and household appliances contributed to the biggest fall in like-for-like sales for a year and a half. But the BRC cautioned that the latest figures were distorted by the timing of Easter, which falls in April this year but was in March in 2016.However, the lobby group said a slowdown in non-food sales was persisting and the underlying trend for that part of the market was the weakest for almost six years.The figures follow official data from the Office for National Statistics showing . Retailers face the dual pressures of cautious consumers and rising operating costs this year. Their labour costs have risen with an increase in the national living wage, transport costs are up on higher oil prices and imported goods are more expensive because of the pound＊s sharp fall since the Brexit vote last June.Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at the report＊s co-authors KPMG, described the sales drop in March as a disappointing end to the first quarter for retailers.※Easter being later in the year is likely to have contributed to the bleaker picture, alongside the other obstacles facing the sector 每 especially increased input costs,§ he said.※Food sales remained in the black for a full quarter, although this is largely being driven by rising inflation, so no reason for too much celebration. Women＊s footwear certainly stepped up, encouraged by the arrival of spring collections. Meanwhile, the rise in jewellery and beauty products is likely to have been helped by Mother＊s Day.§Over the three months to March, food sales decreased 0.2% on a like-for-like basis but increased 1.2% on a total basis, which does not adjust for the effect of store openings. ※This marginal growth in food was bolstered by slightly higher shop prices following increases in global food commodity costs and a weaker pound,§ said the BRC＊s chief executive, Helen Dickinson.Economists have forecast that people will be left with less cash to spare for discretionary spending this year because they are , household bills and fuel as prices rise. Meanwhile, , leaving people worse off in real terms. As a result, the Bank of England and other forecasters expect weaker consumer spending to drag on economic growth this year.Inflation figures for March, due on Tuesday morning, are , its highest for more than three years, according to a Reuters poll of economists. But some predict inflation possibly eased thanks to softer petrol prices and the later timing of Easter holidays making airfares lower than in March 2016. A separate report on Tuesday from Barclaycard suggests the higher cost of filling up the car is taking a significant chunk out of household budgets for motorists.It found spending on petrol was up 16.1% in March compared with a year earlier. But the report, based on data from credit and debit card transactions, signalled consumers were still happy to treat themselves. As the weather improved, spending on pub trips rose 12.5% on a year ago and restaurants enjoyed a similar 12.2% jump. Sales at DIY stores and garden centres were up 4.2% and 9.5%, respectively.Barclaycard said its polling of consumers showed a higher proportion - 41% - were confident in the UK economy in March but that the prospect of higher prices later in the year would prompt a third to shop more at discount stores this year.More than half 每 52% 每 were more worried about the cost of day-to-day items than they were this time last year, with 74% citing a more expensive weekly shop as the reason.※While confidence levels have steadily improved over the past six months, consumers remain fully aware of the potential impact of inflation on their household budgets,§ said Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard."															
"Fresh details on price rises and wage growth this week are expected to underline the rising pressures on UK household budgets as the pound＊s sharp fall since the Brexit vote continues to stoke inflation.The Bank of England has warned the economy＊s main engine of growth, consumer spending, will lose momentum this year as rising living costs eat into people＊s budgets. Economists expect official figures on Tuesday will vindicate those worries, with inflation forecast to have reached its  in March. The consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation is forecast to be 2.3% for the second month running, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll of economists. There was a broad range of views in the survey, with the lowest forecast at 1.9% and the highest at 2.5%.Labour market figures on Wednesday will offer new insights into whether looming Brexit negotiations have started to affect hiring decisions and will shed light on whether pay growth is keeping pace with inflation, or if incomes are in fact falling in real terms.Economists forecast average pay growth slipped to 2.2% in the three months to February, compared with a year earlier.※Worrying for UK growth prospects, the fundamentals for consumers look odds-on to weaken markedly further over the coming months as rising inflation eats further into purchasing power with the squeeze reinforced by muted earnings growth,§ said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at the consultancy IHS Markit.※We expect inflation to reach 3% before the end of 2017 and it could well rise further, to a peak around 3.3%, in the early months of 2018.§The sharp fall in the pound since the referendum last summer has raised the price of imported goods such as fuels, metals and food ingredients. That has sparked some high-profile price tussles between suppliers and retailers, . There have also been . Doritos, Peperami and Coco Pops were the latest products to be affected by ※shrinkflation§.While economists agree that the underlying trend in inflation will be upwards this year, as higher oil prices add to pressure from the weak pound, some see a good chance the measure will fall back in March＊s figures. Economists at HSBC forecast inflation dipped to 2.2% year on year from 2.3% in February. ※In March, inflation pressures should ease a touch, with oil and petrol prices having fallen over the month. Moreover, Easter fell in March in 2016 but is not until April in 2017, which will favour the comparison 每 although obviously this effect will go into reverse in April,§ they wrote in a preview note.Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, expects inflation to drop to 2.1%, thanks to the Easter impact on airfares being delayed until April this year, as well as softer fuel prices and a reversal of February＊s ※lettuce crisis§, when bad weather hit harvests in southern Europe and pushed the price of an iceberg up 67%.But economists at Investec predict inflation will nudge up to 2.4%, taking it further beyond the Bank＊s 2.0% target. ※We anticipate further upward pressures from food, clothing and utilities 每 the latter reflecting the fact that two major utility companies raised prices, electricity prices in particular, on the month,§ said Investec＊s Chris Hare.A separate report from Lloyds added to evidence that companies were passing on some of their rising costs to customers. The bank＊s regular health check on businesses in England and Wales found activity rebounded in March, helped by improving order books. But hiring slowed and average prices charged for goods and services rose at the fastest pace for almost six years.The weaker pound also has benefits for UK businesses, because it makes their goods and services significantly cheaper in overseas markets.The forecaster EY Item Club predicted a revival in the UK＊s overseas markets will support the economy＊s readjustment away from consumer spending towards trade, and help smooth the impact of Brexit on economic growth.The group＊s spring forecast, released on Monday, notes consumer spending provided all the UK＊s growth last year, while overseas trade subtracted 0.4% from GDP. But the balance of economic activity in 2017 would be different.It expects the pound＊s drop, along with improving fortunes for the UK＊s big trading partners, to spur exports growth, with net trade forecast to add 0.2% to GDP this year and another 0.6% in 2018.The UK economy will grow 1.8% this year, matching , but then growth will ease to 1.2% in 2018, the group predicted. Against that backdrop, the Bank of England is forecast to hold interest rates at their record low of 0.25% until the autumn of 2018.※Although the starting gun for Brexit has just been fired, the UK economy has been adjusting to life outside the EU since the referendum,§ said Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club."															
"o developed country has been immune to the  since the financial crisis, but Britain has been particularly hard hit. Instead of productivity rising by around 2% a year, as was customary before 2007, more workers have been employed to?produce virtually the same output.International comparisons show that the US, Germany and France are at least 20% more productive than the UK, and the gaps show no sign of closing after a lost decade that has left productivity 15% below where it would have been had the pre-2007 trend continued. Put another way, the economy would be in the region of ?250bn bigger 每 and living standards markedly higher 每 had?productivity growth not collapsed.In 2008 or 2009, when the economy was suffering its worst recession of the postwar era, poor productivity could be seen as a price worth paying. At the time, there were justifiable fears that unemployment was on?course to match the 3 million-plus levels of the early 1980s and early 1990s, but the willingness of employees to accept pay freezes and pay cuts meant there were far fewer redundancies than might have been expected. Employers kept workers on rather than laying them off.This explanation no longer stands up to serious scrutiny. The economy has been growing, if at times falteringly, for more than seven years, and there should have been a sustained productivity improvement by now. That there hasn＊t been one shows a dark side to record employment levels: too many of the jobs being created are low-wage and low-skill.Solving the ※productivity puzzle§ has become a priority for policymakers, and rightly so. Ministers know that there will be no hiding place in the post-Brexit economy, and from Theresa May downwards there is a?search for solutions.Britain certainly has companies that are highly productive. What＊s more, as Andy Haldane, the Bank of England＊s chief economist, , they can be found in every sector and in every region. The problem is that for every ※frontier§ firm there are two or three laggards dragging down the average. Around 1% of companies have seen productivity growth of approximately 6% a year 每 but one-third have seen no increase since 2000. Many of these firms would have gone out of business, so the theory goes, had interest rates not been kept so low for so long.The problem with a good blast of ※creative destruction§ is that there is a lot of pain for not much gain: Mr Haldane estimated that interest rates at 4.25% rather than 0.25% would have meant 10% more companies going bust, a 1-2% improvement in productivity and the loss of 1.5m jobs. That＊s a high price to pay, especially since not all the bankruptcies would be zombie companies.A better approach would be to tackle productivity from both ends: raising the level of demand to ensure that workers are kept busy while at the same time addressing the economy＊s long-standing structural deficiencies, of which the most glaring is a lack of investment. Productivity goes up when employees have access to the latest kit?and the skills to use it effectively. But,?with labour cheap and plentiful, too many employers see no reason to invest. It?is?this ingrained tendency that best makes the case for a national investment bank: if the private sector won＊t rise to the challenge, the state should step into the breach."															
"A ?246m investment in developing battery technology in Britain is to be launched by the government as part of its drive towards what it says is a modern industrial strategy. The business and energy secretary, , will announce the funding, including a ?45m competition to make batteries more accessible and affordable, in a speech on Monday that should spell out further the government＊s plans to increase productivity and growth.The ?246m, to be spent over four years on research and innovation in battery technology, is likely to have particular benefits in the automotive sector and renewable energy.The search for an industrial strategy was , designed to help Britain＊s economy after Brexit, garnering more than 1,900 responses from businesses and other organisations in a three-month consultation. A white paper is due later in the year, but Clark is expected to say of the strategy: ※For all our citizens to be able to look forward with confidence to a prosperous future, we need to plan to improve our ability to earn that prosperity. To enjoy a high and rising standard of living we must plan to be more productive than in the past.§He will also say: ※Economists have pointed to what they have called a productivity puzzle in Britain. That we appear to generate less value for our efforts than, say, people in Germany or France. In other words, we have to work longer to get the same rewards.※It＊s not that we want 每 or need 每 people to work longer hours. It＊s that we need to ensure that we find and seize opportunities to work more productively 每 as a country, as cities and regions, as businesses and as individuals. If we can do so, we can increase the earning power of our country and our people.§Investing in science and research was the first of 10 ※pillars§ of the outlined industrial strategy. Clark will add that the strategy could ※bring together concerted effort on areas of opportunity that have previously been in different sectors, or which require joining forces between entrepreneurs, scientists and researchers, industries, and local and national government.§Professor Philip Nelson, chief executive of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said: ※Batteries will form a cornerstone of a low carbon economy, whether in cars, aircraft, consumer electronics, district or grid storage. To deliver the UK＊s low-carbon economy we must consolidate and grow our capabilities in novel battery technology.§Richard Parry-Jones, formerly of the UK Automotive Council, will chair a board overseeing the investment. Clark will also confirm another ?25m to be allocated to research and development of connected autonomous vehicles, this time on schemes for off-road, driverless vehicles destined for construction, farming and mining."															
"s someone born in the US who has spent all his adult life in the UK, you might think I?would be a natural advocate for a comprehensive US-UK free trade agreement. After all, more than 15% of all UK goods exports already go to the US 每 the biggest percentage for any single country, if the 47% of UK goods exports that go to the EU＊s 27 countries are discounted.The US and UK are the world＊s two pre-eminent services exporters and the flow of knowledge and deals between them is similarly immense, as is the healthy competition between firms and financial centres. Because of this, a surprisingly large number of politicians and commentators seem to believe that, rather than pursuing quick wins that tackle some of the practical issues faced in UK-US trade, a comprehensive FTA with the US should be an early goal for post-Brexit Britain.The prime minister herself seemed to embrace the idea of a comprehensive FTA on her first trip to Washington to meet President Donald Trump 每 and the topic clearly came up again at the recent G20 meeting, where Trump spoke of a ※big§ and ※powerful§ deal between the two countries, to be negotiated rapidly. Yet I am distinctly uneasy about this prospect, and so, too, are many I speak to in business across the UK. While a  could be a long-term aspiration, it＊s not at the front of the queue for businesses 每 for whom other, more immediate priorities take precedence. It is a stark fact that the US has many of the world＊s toughest and most seasoned trade negotiators, whereas the UK has ceded its policy and knowhow to the European commission for decades. The office of the US trade representative pulls together the very best private-sector talent to negotiate bilateral and multilateral deals on behalf of the country. The embryonic appears to have embraced the more conventional Whitehall approach, staffing up primarily with civil servants plus a smattering of global experts. If talks began on a US-UK deal over the coming months, I know which of the two I＊d put my money on to get the upper hand in a complex and lengthy negotiation.Some of that complexity comes from the fact that FTAs need to cover a broad sweep of issues to be compliant with . That would see UK negotiators having to go head to head with US counterparts across a huge range of issues while, in all likelihood, still ironing out a long-term deal between the UK and the EU. Given that both home-grown and many US-owned companies in Britain have repeatedly said the , and needs to be in place first, the notion that a US deal could be negotiated in short order seems far-fetched. In any UK-US negotiation, the American side would also start with the advantage of market size. With a population five times larger than the UK＊s, US companies have either been operating at a continental scale without trade barriers for many decades or have been born more recently into a giant home market of 330m. Their experience and, in some sectors, sheer size gives them an in-built advantage 每 and gives US negotiators another important edge.In many cases, US firms also start with significantly lower regulatory costs and requirements than their UK counterparts. US negotiators know this and would seek to ※bake§ these advantages into any deal. While issues such as mutual recognition of product standards and regulatory equivalence are highly technical, there is a huge risk that UK-based firms would continue to face higher up-front costs and regulatory requirements after any agreement, leaving them at an instant disadvantage to US competitors that would suddenly have wider scope to compete in and buy up chunks of the UK market. are positive and healthy, particularly where they leave long-lasting economic value for the communities they affect; another consequence of a US-UK agreement could be predatory purchasing of UK firms by bigger, cash-rich US competitors. We have seen cases where UK firms were hollowed out and asset-stripped by overseas buyers. Indeed, in more limited circumstances, UK firms have done the same in the US and other markets. But the truth is that under a US-UK deal, this less-welcome variant of mergers and acquisitions activity would probably be to the UK＊s long-term disadvantage.Finally, there are political considerations. Our government＊s ※global Britain§ vision and  are not natural bedfellows, regardless of the strength of the special relationship. It seems difficult to imagine that the Trump administration would make any concessions, even to a close ally such as Britain, that undermined US jobs or investment.My concerns are not means born of knee-jerk protectionism. British firms cannot and must not be wrapped in cotton wool to protect them from cut-throat international competition. Disruption of the status quo and acceptance that businesses are destroyed as well as created are crucial to an innovative and strong commercial environment. Yet there is something about a British government opening the floodgates to US competition before developing the organisation and experience needed to navigate the world of international trade agreements that causes deep and abiding concern among many trading firms.Despite Trump＊s public show of support for a comprehensive US-UK deal, British ministers should focus on the more practical aspects of our trading relationship 每 and avoid diving straight into a complex deal.Less sexy though they may be, there are updates to existing investment, double taxation and social security treaties, or changes to customs procedures, that could help thousands of firms more swiftly. And the UK government could continue to boost practical support to help more UK firms to explore the US market and look to work with its US counterparts to alleviate the small, everyday barriers to doing business that suppliers and customers on both sides of the Atlantic often experience. These sorts of incremental, quick-win steps would lead to more UK-US trade, which is absolutely to be welcomed and encouraged. But there should be no headlong rush into a politically attractive, but economically uncertain, UK US free trade deal."															
"Our , From Project Fear to Project Prosperity, estimates that the gains from a full Brexit will be ?135bn 每 around a 7% boost to GDP, with the reforms also raising the longer term growth rate.There are four elements in the calculation: 1) free trade, either via free trade agreements with the EU and the rest of the world, or if those are sticky via unilateral moves to remove our trade barriers 2) UK-run pragmatic regulation to replace the EU＊s intrusive single-market regulation of our whole economy 3) our net EU contribution and 4) the cost to the taxpayer of the subsidy paid to unskilled EU immigrants, which we estimate at ?3,500 per adult.Predictably, our estimates have triggered howls of protest and derision from the economists who aligned themselves with ※project fear§. However that project was founded on two main planks: the assumption that  UK would pursue protectionist and other illiberal policies, and the use of a ※gravity§ trade model.The first assumption envisions that the UK would plainly not reap any gains from free trade; even worse, it would raise barriers against the world as well as against the EU. It was then combined with assumptions about ※uncertainty§, which led these economists to predict a bad recession. Both these assumptions are now seen to be baseless. We have a government committed to free trade. The recession simply has not happened: indeed the economy has had  and now, due to the large Brexit devaluation, is experiencing a strong ※rebalancing§ towards net exports away from consumption. There are leads and lags, but growth is plainly still well underway.This brings me to the gravity model. This is a model that has strongly caught on among trade economists who argue that trade is associated with the size of trading partners and their closeness to them. This model is widely used to support the case for UK integration into the EU as our closest, largest neighbour.In fact the gravity model does not fit the UK＊s trade history at all well: it cannot account for the surge in our service exports all around the world, or our huge trade with anglophone countries, or indeed the  in the share of our trade with the EU. Our classical model, based on comparative advantage, by contrast fits these facts well. Our trade gain estimates are therefore based on the best model of UK trade. Patrick Minford is a professor of economics at Cardiff University; he was a founder and former director of Liverpool Research GroupPatrick Minford＊s projection of a ?135bn economic boost from a hard Brexit is an example of the worst sort of voodoo economics. His modelling is based on the UK unilaterally removing all restrictions and tariffs and trying our luck in a global market. According to  who have analysed his work, this would mean a massive fall in wages and the ※elimination§ of .Minford＊s self-styled ※§ has no credibility with the vast majority of economists. His view of the EU as a costly protectionist club reflects this debunked position. In reality, the single market eases internal trade and reduces costs. As is typical of theoretical economists, his model makes gross assumptions, including the idea that consumers have no preference, for example, between a US computer and one made in Taiwan, and that the distance goods travel to market is irrelevant.In the real world, proximity, common standards, and rapid movement of components matter, hence the importance of the customs union. UK manufacturing is largely foreign-owned and revolves around assembly of components manufactured elsewhere in the EU. Ironically, this makes it even more important that we stay in the customs union, to ease the passage of components across borders.Minford＊s work is indicative of the whole Brexit project: based on the illusion that the UK has some manifest destiny that allows us to stand alone in a globalised world. It is high time this phony economics was sent into retirement. Molly Scott Cato is the Green party speaker on economy and finance and spokeswoman for EU relations"															
"It was at Jackson Hole in 2014 that  prepared the ground for the European Central Bank＊s massive bond-buying programme to help rescue the economies of the eurozone, embattled from years of sovereign debt crises.The annual event, held at the Wyoming fishing retreat by the  Bank of Kansas City since 1978, takes place from 24 to 26 August. And it could provide the backdrop for the ECB president to signal the eventual withdrawal from loose monetary policy by the central bank.Pressure is mounting on the world＊s central bankers to give more clues about how they intend to exit huge stimulus packages unfurled to dig the global economy out of a hole after the financial crisis. After a decade of low-interest rates and bond buying, a process known as , the Jackson Hole summit could be a platform to convince markets they can safely wean the world off cheap money. ※It＊s an important event because we＊re at a critical crossroads for many central banks, especially, I would say, for the ECB. The global economy, many economies, still need expansionary policy 每 but I don＊t think we need this extreme form of monetary policy,§ said Robert Bergqvist, chief economist at Swedish bank SEB.The ECB is spending 2.3tn (?2.1tn) on its QE policy, while the Bank of England injected ?435bn into buying gilts. The Federal Reserve, which is further ahead thanks to a faster recovery in the US,  and has bought more than $4.5tn of assets (?3.5tn). Still, normalisation may not be the easiest path for central bankers, with fragile economies, inflation not taking off as expected and the potential for roiling the financial markets with sudden changes.※The rollback of QE is an experiment that has never been tried before and it is not clear how markets will react,§ said economists at fund manager Intermediate Capital Group. ※Their ownership of the market is significant. As markets anticipate Fed balance-sheet reduction and reduced ECB buying in 2018, the risk of market disruptions will increase.§The Fed chair, , is the first leading figure to speak at the event on Friday, followed by Draghi later that day. The Bank of England＊s deputy governor for monetary policy, Ben Broadbent, is expected to attend the symposium but is not scheduled to speak publicly. The meeting risks being overshadowed by political events, after posturing from Donald Trump and  rattled markets this month and the US president became embroiled in a bitter row over his after the death of a counter-demonstrator at a rally attended by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville. Yellen said in June that the Federal Reserve would begin to reduce the size of its balance sheet , leading to speculation the central bank could start to reduce reinvestments of maturing securities it holds this year. ※Yellen could say the Fed is going from ＆relatively soon＊ to ＆soon＊. If she wants to implement this in October, she could announce it in September,§ said Kathy Bostjancic, head of US macro investor services at Oxford .Draghi may not want to use Jackson Hole to signal the end of the ECB＊s bond buying, according to David Meier, an economist at Julius Baer. The governor may instead look to ※downplay as much as possible the effects of monetary policy normalisation in order to keep financial markets calm§, he said. Instead, Draghi could repeat a message he gave in June at the ECB forum in Sintra, near Lisbon, when he expressed confidence in the eurozone economic recovery and reminded investors the ECB＊s exit from QE would be contingent on calm conditions on the financial markets, according to Mark Wall, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. While Draghi is not expected to set expectations for the timing of a decision on QE, he could ※still make a throwaway comment§ on currency exchange rates that would pique the markets＊ interest, Wall said.Although the Jackson Hole is billed as a get-together for central bankers and academics to discuss topics not necessarily of immediate concern, looking instead at emerging issues and trends, the meeting has become a key item watched by global investors and others for signs of their thinking. The Financial Times last week found six central banks 每 the Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of Japan, Bank of England and the Swiss and Swedish central banks 每 , more than four times the pre-crisis level, following their policy interventions."															
"Don＊t worry, the Brexiters say 每 when the negotiations reach their nail-biting conclusion, Brussels will cave in.In parliament, there are more than enough Tory backbench MPs who hold this view to stymie any backsliding by chief negotiator David Davis and his cabinet colleagues. Or so they think.In the media, the  is joined by the  in giving Brexiters the backbone to carry on, when most of the establishment is obviously against the project.The view from the Brexit trenches can be summed up in  ※Ignore the doom-mongers, and the EU＊s attempts to embarrass Britain 每 a good deal is looking likelier than ever§.This is the cake-and-eat-it deal that secures full access to the single market, without making any concessions on the free movement of labour or the power of the European court of justice over disputes involving UK citizens and businesses.This message can also be heard inside the Treasury, where senior officials believe that when the final deal is announced, British business will smile at the result and UK plc will sail on happily as an independent nation.There will be enough access to the markets and institutions of the EU, they say, for the banks, the car companies and the pharmaceutical giants to scrap any relocation plans.Money talks is the message and even Michel Barnier cannot escape that basic maxim.But as a plan it is more akin to buying a lottery ticket than executing a well thought-out strategy. Maybe we shouldn＊t be surprised that the government is so cavalier. If ever there were two people who thought planning was boring and that most things could be achieved if carried through with elan and fortitude, it was George Osborne and David Cameron.Osborne, it must be remembered, botched two out of six budgets and was on course to miss his austerity target by five years when he was booted out of office, while Cameron＊s studious lack of planning landed the country with a Leave vote and a civil service about as prepared for the battle with Brussels as Baldrick was before going over the top in .The same goes for Liam Fox＊s attempts to portray himself as a superb dealmaker who can help British business break into one virgin market after another.Fox flies to the US this week to begin laying the groundwork for a deal with the Trump administration. We don＊t know anything about the agenda he intends to pursue, because he has refused to answer questions about the specifics.Nonetheless, he talks big about his prospects for a deal, citing the recent EU-Japan and EU-Canada trade deals as examples of what can be achieved.What he ignores is that the EU-Japan deal only covers manufacturing and even then, there are flaws in the scheme that relate back to our relationship with the rest of Europe.As Jill Rutter, the Brexit specialist at the Institute for Government, said , Fox＊s view that a trade deal with the EU is easier than most ignores how trade works.She picks up on comments by Barnier, who says the convergence of current regulations is a good starting point, but what about the future, as the UK capitalises on its new-found freedom and makes its own independent rules?Barnier has said: ※The questions that we have are: is that divergence reasonable? Is it under control? Is it mastered, and if so by whom? Or will it become a tool for regulatory competition with us?... It is one of the keys to the success of the negotiation ＃ of the future relationship.§The Japanese have agreed to converge with the EU, but once you look in detail at the deal, there are many areas where the two sides remain far apart 每 on vehicle emissions, for example. Japan can only gain from convergence, however small. The UK, already converged, can only lose.Rutter recognises that Fox and the other gamblers in government may prove to be right and, for the sake of a few car sales, the EU will roll over, but she warns ※it would be foolish for the UK to base its economic future on that?hope§.And yet that hope persists and continues to have a voice. Not among the major business groups, and most pointedly the British Chambers of Commerce, which this weekend has come out of hiding to declare the government＊s  stance a disaster.Its stance shows that business leaders have little faith in Fox establishing bridgeheads into the US, Japan and EU economies to facilitate trade. They are wary of what he is prepared to concede, as are anti-poverty campaigners, who fear that in talks with the US he will usher back all the bad bits of the failed TTIP trade talks between Washington and Brussels, from secret arbitration courts to chemically washed chicken and greater access to public sector contracts.Michael Gove says his cabinet colleagues have  for several years after quitting the European Union. It＊s a concession that affects the transition and not the ultimate deal. That deal is still expected to secure the main benefits of membership, while satisfying the demand for sovereignty in all matters. It is a hope and no more."															
"City bond traders have put the champagne on ice. They had a good run. For some it lasted almost a year. But it＊s over now and the ※new normal§ of low trading volumes and weak profits is reasserting itself.On Wall Street,  took the biggest hit. This week the firm reported profits had plunged 40% in the second quarter on its bond, currency and commodities trading desks.All the other big names in the US investment banking world saw bond trading profits dive in the three months to the end of June, save for age-old Goldman rival Morgan Stanley, which restricted the loss to 4%.Lloyd Blankfein, the Goldman boss who rose through the ranks of bond traders to the top job, was unlikely to be sanguine about the turn of events amid concerns that his bank suffered more than most for relying on out-of-favour hedge funds as clients.Back in October 2016 the story was very different. Barclays was on a high after what it said was a summer bonanza for its bond traders, pushing quarterly profits to a two-year high. Likewise Goldman, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and JPMorgan were raking in the trades.. The US central bank signalled in late 2015 that the post-crash era of low inflation and low interest rates was coming to an end. To combat the threat of inflation, it would start to raise rates consistently through 2016 and 2017.This move put two trends in motion that spelled a big payday for the banks. First, the price of bonds started to fall, making them more attractive to buy. Second, not long afterwards, it became clear the other central banks were not going to follow suit in raising rates.That broke seven years of agreement among the major central banks to hold interest rates at near zero as a way to boost economic activity. The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were still on board, but Janet Yellen at the Fed had broken away.Without a consistent story, investors in fixed-income securities, the jargon name for bonds, found themselves needing to back several horses. And investors demanded the banks buy and sell their securities more frequently as uncertainty translated into an ever-changing mood in the market.The main measure of volatility 每 the Vix index 每 was still well below the 2009 peak, but it was elevated in 2016. And traders make money in periods when uncertainty and confusion raise levels of volatility.Until this moment bond trading floors had undergone a dramatic cultural shift. The brazen antics of Oliver Stone＊s flamboyant junk bond king character Gordon Gekko in his film Wall Street were consigned to history. In came the sober suits with an emphasis on cost control.Jordan Hiscott, chief trader at trading firm Ayondo, said the bond markets have become a more sober environment since the financial crisis. Lower profit margins and clients from the pension fund industry and sovereign wealth funds focusing on costs have forced the industry＊s colourful characters to tone down their antics.※It might be that Goldman suffered more than most because its reputation is for charging high prime broking fees. A reliance on clients like hedge funds, which are clearly out of favour for charging high fees themselves, might also have hurt Goldman,§ he said.Dhaval Joshi, chief European investment strategist at BCA Research, said the bond boom had come to an end as the fog around the course of interest rates, made worse by Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, intensified.※When the Federal Reserve signalled that it would begin to raise interest rates, it changed the story. Since then there hasn＊t been a clear path,§ he said.Major bond investors got burned by this turn of events and while their initial reaction was to instruct the banks to switch their portfolios 每 prompting a rise in trading fees 每 they are now reluctant to take big bets.Joshi says the long-run trend for low inflation and low interest rates is about to reassert itself. This might mean a few more fees for the bank＊s bond departments as asset managers adjust their holdings again.

" will have to rip up the government＊s deficit reduction plan or increase taxes for most of the population if he decides to end seven years of austerity by sanctioning higher public sector pay, reversing welfare cuts and providing extra cash for Whitehall departments, a thinktank has said.The Resolution Foundation said it was possible for the chancellor to do a U-turn in his autumn budget, but only if he was prepared to increase borrowing by more than ?100bn over the next four years or to make individuals and companies pay more tax.Its report, Living With Austerity, said that given the  it was understandable that politicians would want to revisit the debate, but that they had to face up to the costs involved.Theresa May＊s failure to win an overall majority in last month＊s general election has led to many leading Conservatives 每 including the foreign secretary, , health secretary and the education secretary , suggesting that the time has come to abandon the 1% cap on public sector pay. has been resisting calls for a more generous approach to public sector workers and has insisted that the government stick to its plan of .The Resolution Foundation said public sector pay was only a small part of austerity, and that removing the 1% cap would amount merely to tinkering. Its analysis found that the public sector was facing two ※crunches§, a squeeze on pay that would bring it back to 2005 levels by 2020 and a loss of jobs that would result in a headcount below five million for the first time this century.The report said allowing public sector pay to rise in line with pay in the private sector for the rest of the decade would cost ?9.7bn by 2021-22, while expanding the public sector workforce in line with the increase in the UK＊s population would cost a further ?11.5bn over the same period.Far more households are affected by the  than by the public sector pay cap, but the foundation said the cost of unfreezing them would be lower. Allowing working age benefits to rise in line with inflation from next April would cost ?3.6bn by 2021-22, while reversing the cuts to work allowances in universal credit would cost around ?3.2bn.Since 2010, only the NHS, international development and schools have been spared budget cuts. The report said allowing departmental spending (including public sector pay) to rise in line with GDP growth after the end of the current spending review in 2019-20 would cost ?12.3bn by 2021-22. Reversing the cuts planned for the next two years would cost a further ?11bn.Matt Whittaker, chief economist at the Resolution Foundation, said it was no surprise that squeeze fatigue had set in. ※But recognising that fatigue is very different to doing something about it. If we want a serious discussion on ending austerity, we need to get serious about prioritising what spending we really want to see rise and how we want to pay for it 每 and that means tax rises for most of us.※The chancellor can start by cancelling . But if he wants to raise serious revenues despite the challenges of having a minority government, which the Office of Budget Responsibility may force him to irrespective of plans to end aspects of austerity, then he could look at freezing tax thresholds, which could raise up to ?12.5bn.§The foundation said weaker than expected economic expansion and pay growth this year meant there was a significant risk that the independent Office for  Responsibility would downgrade its forecasts for the public finances in the budget. The chancellor would need to respond to these development even before any moves to ※end austerity§, it added."															
"s the true extent of the Brexit farce becomes more apparent, it is now , while the rest of the world 每 with the possible exceptions of Presidents Putin and Trump 每 look on in sympathetic bewilderment.One of several satisfactory aspects of the election result was the way that Theresa May and her advisers at No 10 met their comeuppance over their widely leaked plans to sack the chancellor of the exchequer.Philip Hammond＊s sin was to let them know that the warnings of our Brussels-based ambassador Sir Ivan Rogers, whom they sacked, were prescient; that making the country poorer was neither good politics nor good economics; and that our continental partners were not going let us have our cake and eat it.The way my old friend, exit secretary David Davis, caved in to the insistence from the EU27 that this so-called negotiation be dealt with according to their timetable, not his, was no less embarrassing for being so predictable.In case anybody hasn＊t noticed, I ought to point out at this stage that the buzzword in Brussels and London is now ※transition§. The two-year timetable for  is patently absurd. The debate is over how to handle the transition and how long it should be, with influential Remainers hoping that the transition will take several hundred years and that meanwhile we will remain inside the customs union and Margaret Thatcher＊s greatest achievement, the single market.At which point I should like to quote from a recent lecture by Sir Brian Unwin to the Norwegian parliament. Unwin is not only a former Treasury official and chairman of Customs and Excise, but was also president of the European Investment Bank. The EIB has been an unsung hero of the financing of much of the infrastructure investment in this country that our austerity-obsessed government has eschewed, and Unwin worries about what happens after the Brexit that we both still hope will not happen.But it is not just EIB investment that will be lost. A lot of investment plans are on hold, at a time when, as the City economist Andrew Smithers argues, the short-term culture of modern chief executives is already having a damaging impact on the investment that is key to productivity.The evidence for concern about Brexit-induced potential loss of trading and investment opportunities is accumulating thick and fast. I was particularly struck by Unwin＊s point that, if the UK is forced to follow the hard Brexiters＊ path towards dependence on World Trade Organisation rules, ※it will find itself subject to substantial tariffs on its exports to and imports from the EU and possibly no deal for finance and services at all§.As Lord Adonis pointed out in the Lords debate on the Queen＊s speech last week, more than 60% of our trade is with the EU or with other countries with which we enjoy free or preferential access as members of the customs union and single market. Leave? What folly!The Global Policy Institute estimates that leaving could . As Unwin points out: ※In order to implement the tariffs the UK would also have to restore customs controls and documentation at the border.§Most of these were removed when Unwin was chairman of Customs and Excise in the late 1980s, as the single market was implemented. Unwin echoes the warning of Michel Barnier, the EU＊s chief negotiator, about potential costs, queues and delays, citing an estimate that ※this could quadruple the number of documents needing to be processed 每 from some 90 to 390 million§. (Nothing like an assault on red tape, eh?)And why is all this nonsense happening? Largely because of the anti-Europeanism that Lord Heseltine recently described as ※the cancer gnawing away at the heart of the Conservative party§.Heseltine is still fighting. The former ※wet§ Tory and now Liberal Democrat Lord Dykes told me last week that he was shocked to hear Kenneth Clarke saying he had accepted that we were now leaving the EU. So was I.Which brings us back to his successor but three, . Hammond frequently states that the British people (or some of them) voted to leave the EU but not to become poorer. There is a logical problem here: leaving the EU means the nation becomes poorer. Even my eccentric old Brexiter friend Lord Lawson apparently conceded this point recently to a private gathering (I am not betraying a confidence; this was reported in the .)So did the 37% of the electorate who voted for Brexit know what they were doing? We should be told! As the historian Sir David Cannadine recently reminded an audience at the British Academy, the problem with democracy, according to Plato, is that it elevates opinion above knowledge. Although, as Churchill said, it is better than the alternative.Can the circle be squared? We need statesmanship, or stateswomanship. It should be possible, at heads-of-government level, for the other 27 EU countries to make a minor concession on the ※free movement of workers§ front so that parliament (sovereignty!), not the EU, would decide national immigration policy.Finally, all those Brexiters who advocate a European Free Trade Area solution ought to be aware that it was because Efta was so unsatisfactory that we joined what became the EU. As Adonis pointed out, Efta＊s equivalent of the European commission is called the surveillance authority. He added: ※I look forward to that Orwellian construct being sold to the .§"

"here could hardly be a worse time for the economy to be starting . That thought will be uppermost in the mind of Philip Hammond when he stands up on Thursday to make the annual address by the chancellor to the City＊s elite at London＊s Mansion House. Mr Hammond has been warning of the dangers of Britain being outside both the single market and the customs union since entering 11 Downing Street last summer. Until now, his counsel has not been sought by Theresa May, and there was plenty of talk about the chancellor losing his job in a post-election reshuffle. But that was then, when the expectation was of a Conservative landslide. This is now, and Mr?Hammond is unsackable at a time when the economic skies are darkening. His position has unquestionably been strengthened by the election result. The question is what the chancellor does with his newfound power.Anything the chancellor can do to haul the UK back from the brink of a chaotic departure from the EU would certainly be welcome, but Brexit is only part of the story. Mr Hammond also needs to recognise that the economic approach of the past seven years has been a failure. None of the recent data has been good. . Inflation is rising. . Britain has a?cost-of-living crisis at the same time that it has a political crisis. The only reason it is not having a sterling crisis as well is because the financial markets are clinging to the hope that the inconclusive result of the election makes a softer Brexit more likely. Should that hope proved unfounded, the pound will drop sharply, adding to the squeeze on?living?standards.The Bank of England is no position to provide much support for an ailing economy. Official interest rates are already at 0.25% and a further dollop of money creation through the quantitative easing programme would do little other than boost asset prices. Instead, the onus is on the chancellor to use his autumn budget to set a different course for the economy. That is certainly what voters want, fatigued as they are by a decade of cuts and falling wages. It is also what a politically wounded Mrs May wants; hence the message from senior Conservatives since the election that austerity is dead. But saying austerity is dead is the easy bit. The hard part is to enact measures that would make the slogan meaningful, and that would require, for example, removing the cap on public sector pay awards, abandoning welfare cuts, doing a U-turn on the reduction in per-pupil spending in education and spending more on?the health service.Unsurprisingly, Mr Hammond has been pushing back against the idea that he should effectively filch large chunks of Labour＊s manifesto. He also thinks that raising taxes too dramatically would be unacceptable to the Tory party. Scrapping welfare cuts announced but yet to be implemented would cost ?9bn, while protecting the schools budget from cuts would require a further ?4bn. The Treasury could loosen the purse strings by ?20bn or more without breaking its?fiscal rules because there is a hefty margin of error built into its plans.But this headroom would quickly be used up should the economy suffer a prolonged period of sub-par growth or, even worse, another recession. Here, though, the chancellor＊s cautious approach is less defensible than it is on Brexit. Higher government borrowing is warranted because the outlook for two of the other components of demand 每  and investment 每 is so poor. Consumers are seeing their living standards eroded by higher inflation, while political uncertainty and a slowing economy hardly provides a fertile climate for investment. Nor is it a compelling argument, when the heavens are about to open, for the Treasury to say it is saving its money for a rainy day. This is a rainy day. A bold, different and expansionary budget is needed."															
"Britain is experiencing a rapid decline in living standards with the biggest squeeze in workers＊ pay since 2014, according to the latest official data.Regular pay adjusted to account for the impact of inflation fell by 0.6% year on year in the three months to April. It was the weakest data since the summer months in 2014, according to the Office for National Statistics. The decline followed a 0.4% drop in the three months to March.Trade unions reacted with dismay to the figures. Frances O＊Grady, general secretary of union umbrella body the TUC, warned that Britain was heading for a fresh crisis in living standards.※Real wages have fallen for the second month in a row. Unless the government gets its act together, we＊ll soon be in the middle of another cost of living crisis,§ she said.※Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs across the UK. And it＊s time to bin the artificial pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. Britain needs a pay rise, not more pressure on household budgets.§Len McCluskey, general secretary of Britain＊s biggest union, Unite, said millions of workers were struggling to make ends meet. ※The Tories have succeeded in creating the longest period of falling real terms pay since the Napoleonic wars. They are clearly the party of economic mismanagement.§When adjusted for inflation, UK employees are now earning ?15 less a week after tax and deductions than they were in March 2008, six months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and .The latest drop in real wages reflects mounting pressure on household budgets, as the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the EU referendum drives up the cost of goods imported from abroad and feeds through to higher shop prices.The ONS said that before inflation, regular pay growth excluding bonuses slowed to 1.7% year on year in the three months to April. It was much weaker than the 2% growth in pay that had been expected by economists.  growth for the three months to March was also revised down sharply to 1.8% from a previous estimate of 2.1%, underlining the pace at which a drop in living standards is taking hold.Prices were rising at a faster rate,   in April, and jumping to  according to ONS data published on Tuesday.The fall in real pay comes despite an employment rate which held 74.8% in the three months to April, the highest since records began in 1971. The number of people in work rose by 109,000 to 31.95 million.Meanwhile the unemployment rate was unchanged at a 42-year low of 4.6% and the number of unemployed people fell by 50,000 to 1.53 million.※The terrible news on pay comes despite another strong jobs performance, with unemployment remaining at its lowest level in over 40 years,§ said Stephen Clarke, economics analyst at the Resolution Foundation thinktank.※The sharp contrast between our terrible record on pay and strong jobs performance shows that the currency-driven inflation we are experiencing is not feeding through into wage pressures and is simply making us all poorer instead.§The work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, highlighted the jobs figures.※This is yet another strong set of record-breaking figures with employment up and unemployment down, fuelled by full-time opportunities. This is good news for families as we continue to build a stronger, fairer Britain.§But Debbie Abrahams, shadow work and pensions secretary, said Labour was ※deeply concerned§ that millions of people remain in low paid, insecure work.Economists are predicting the pay squeeze will accelerate in the coming months, with inflation likely to rise above 3% and as firms limit pay rises as their own costs rise and the economy weakens. The squeeze is expected to weigh on consumer spending, which has been the key driver of economic growth since the financial crisis.※The UK economy faces a dangerous cocktail of political uncertainty, slowing growth and shrinking real wages,§ said Ben Brettell, senior economist, Hargreaves Lansdown.The weak outlook for consumers and pay is expected to convince policymakers at the Bank of England to look beyond rising inflation 每 already well above the Bank＊s 2% target 每 and leave interest rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.25% for a prolonged period. Economists at ING bank said policymakers are unlikely to raise rates before 2019.Neil Carberry, director of employment and skills for the CBI business lobby group, said the government must ※put the economy front and centre, create stability and ensure the EU negotiations get off to a positive start§."															
"ast your mind back to March 2008. The financial markets have been in turmoil since the previous summer and in the previous month the Labour government has been forced to nationalise the troubled bank Northern Rock. Few realised it at the time but the economy had peaked. A deep and brutal recession was about to begin. In that month, the average basic weekly wage, excluding bonuses, was ?473.The recession officially came to an end by late 2009 and after a couple of years of weak and patchy growth, the worst seemed to be over. Activity picked up, unemployment started to come down. Yet more than nine years after the slump of 2008 began, wages 每 the yardstick by which most people judge whether the economy is doing well or not 每 have not recovered. In fact, , they have gone backwards. The average basic weekly wage, adjusted for movements in prices, now stands at ?458.This is a quite staggering performance, which breaks all sorts of records for all the wrong reasons. There has been nothing like the current squeeze on real wages in living memory. The Resolution Foundation, a thinktank that concentrates on the living standards of those on middle and low incomes, There is certainly no immediate prospect of workers becoming better off.  Basic pay in the three months to April 2017 was 0.6% lower than in the same three months of 2016.The increase in prices is pretty easy to explain. Inflation was artificially low as a result of a temporary collapse in oil prices. The cost of crude has subsequently recovered a bit, but the depreciation of the pound since the Brexit referendum has also had the effect of pushing up the cost of living.The continued depressed state of wages takes a bit more explaining. For years, the Bank of England has been predicting that the fall in unemployment will make it harder for employers to attract and retain workers, forcing them to offer more generous pay deals. But that has simply not happened. In the past year, employment has risen, unemployment has fallen and inflation has started to bite: in past times a combination of factors that would lead to pressure for higher wages. But a year ago regular pay was rising by 2.4%; now it is rising by 1.7%.As John Philpott, who runs the Jobs Economist consultancy, noted: ※What＊s remarkable is that pay growth, however measured, is so weak at a time when employment is at joint record rate of 74.8% and unemployment at a 42-year low of 4.6%, driven almost entirely in the latest quarter by relatively strong growth in full-time jobs for employees on permanent contracts. Hard times and near full employment make strange bedfellows, highlighting the extent to which a deregulated labour market with an abundance of workers available to fill low wage vacancies has altered the UK jobs landscape.§ curbs in the public sector are a factor but they are not the whole story. Just as in the early 19th century, private sector employers feel no need to pay higher wages. Despite the fall in the jobless total, they can tap into a large pool of unskilled, deunionised, insecure workers. History is repeating itself. "															
"here is a small but vibrant web forum, , whose members＊ outrage at inflated property prices is matched only by their dismay that the longed-for slump has never materialised. After Nationwide reported last week that house prices had , its faithful believe the day of reckoning is finally coming.The average home fell in value by 0.2% in May, said Nationwide, following on from declines of 0.4% in April and 0.3% in March. Not since the height of the financial crisis in 2009 have prices fallen for three months in a row.When the report of that data was published on theguardian.com, the highest-rated response below the line was: ※If you have a house for sale, drop the price because in six months it＊s going to be a lot lower.§It is worth taking a closer look at the data. The most striking figure to emerge is that house prices in May actually rose 每 from ?207,699 to ?208,711. Nationwide reported them as falling only after making a seasonal adjustment. That may make statistical sense to some, but it＊s no comfort to a buyer whose deposit won＊t be seasonally adjusted by their bank.The unadjusted figure of ?208,711 is actually the all-time record high for house prices in the UK. But a slowdown in London 每 and outright declines in many boroughs 每 is evident to any buyer. The capital is both the reception city for migrants, now falling in number, and the exit city for the UK＊s financial services industry post-Brexit. It would be remarkable if its rental and sales markets had done anything other than go into reverse. The glut of luxury apartment building only adds to the downward pressure.The question for the 87% of the British population not in London is how far this will ripple beyond the capital. There are some good reasons why it should; the absolute level of prices is so high that further expansion is almost inconceivable. While London prices reflect an international market, in towns and cities elsewhere they must be supported by local UK incomes, which are currently static at best.Crucially, we are also seeing the end of the buy-to-let landlord as the marginal buyer of virtually every new one- or two-bed flat to come on to the market. Stamp duty, higher taxes and strict new affordability tests have sent lending to landlords into freefall. It is a long-overdue rebalancing of the market, and will inevitably depress prices.Every hit on landlords and fall in prices is greeted cheerfully by young adults, who have been priced out of the market. But there＊s the rub. The scale of the decline in home ownership among the young has been so dramatic that it has created a vast level of pent-up demand. It means that any significant fall in the market will provoke a ※relief rally§ of buying by those who have been desperate to get on the fabled ladder.Now throw into this mix Britain＊s near permanent failure to build enough houses. Then add migration 每 yes, it＊s down, but instead of the need to build a new city the size of Sheffield each year, it suggests we need to build one the size of Brighton, and there＊s little sign of that. What all this tells you is that price falls, when they come, are likely to be moderate rather than steep.Always bear in mind that house prices are largely a function of how much a bank is willing to lend against an asset. , no longer lending in volume to landlords, are now throwing money at first-time buyers. Rates for 90% loans have tumbled to as low as 1.9% for two-year deals and just 2.55% for five-year fixes.Of course, we can＊t rule out a house-price crash. The fog of Brexit will becalm the market for several years to come. But a full-scale crash requires a steep rise in interest rates 每 and, for now, no one is forecasting that.What do BT and British Airways have in common? You could point to the public relations disasters that dog each organisation: one hitting the headlines recently following its accounting scandal, the other struggling to cope with the after-effects of last weekend＊s cancelled flights.The other problem they share is a huge shortfall in their retirement fund. But there is good news on this front, because pension deficits at the UK＊s largest companies appear to be falling. Pension adviser Mercer said last week that the collective deficit of final salary pension schemes among FTSE 350 firms fell in the past month by more than ?10bn 每 from ?145bn to ?134bn.One of the biggest factors was a year of rising stock markets: they are at all- time highs in New York and London. Another, more surprising, factor is a slowdown in decades of improving life expectancy.In March, an Institute of Actuaries paper showed that the usual annual improvements in life expectancies were slowing. Mortality rates showed fairly steady improvements of 2.6% a year for men and 2.2% for women between 2000 and 2011. Since then, it says, annual increases have been close to zero. Accountant PwC says total liabilities for the UK＊s 5,800 final salary pension schemes, which it estimates at ?2tn, would fall by 15%, or ?310bn.Not everyone agrees. Andrew Scott and Lynda Gratton of London Business School 每 authors of a recent book,  每 argue that the majority of children born in rich countries today can expect to live to more than 100, and individuals and employers should be planning on that basis.Other experts counter that poorer people and those most likely to suffer ill-health, and drag down mortality averages, are less likely to be in jobs with generous retirement schemes.With this in mind, far from breathing a sigh of relief following news of a short-term cut in pension deficits, employers should continue to prepare for the worst.French Connection was once a big brand 每 remember when every teenager wanted FCUK on their T-shirt?

But history suggests Marks won＊t care. The shares are around 37p, compared with 487p in their heyday: but, like the retailer＊s fashions, they still look expensive."															
"n important moment during the so-called election ※debates§ last week occurred when a young lady in the studio audience told Theresa May that she had voted for  because she had swallowed the lie that it would bring ?350m a week for the health service. The prime minister, an uncomfortable Remainer and now an uncomfortable Brexiter, had no answer to this, resorting to the cliche that the government spends more every year on the NHS. This, like so many of the answers trotted out by her (also uncomfortable) team is an example of what Dr?Johnson might have called ※a last refuge of the political scoundrel§.The crisis arises because the increase in NHS spending each year is nowhere near enough to meet the well-known demands on the service. As I understand it, extra  spending is running at no more than 1% a year in ※real§ 每 ie inflation-adjusted 每 terms, whereas merely to avoid going backwards the service needs an annual real-terms increase of 4%.Furthermore, the situation threatens to get a whole lot worse, as the service suffers from the thinly disguised racism behind Ukip＊s conquest of the Conservative party 每 and May＊s obsession with reducing immigration almost guarantees an impending recruitment crisis.Of course, the problems in the NHS are only the most publicised of the obstacles facing the public sector generally. There are also looming crises in the pensions business, as well as goodness knows how  and its transport infrastructure.It all boils down to two essential factors: one, , is the fantasy that we can enjoy Scandinavian levels of public service and welfare on US-style tax rates. (It is, by the way, scandalous that the right wing of the Conservative party and their ghastly tabloids have made ※welfare§ into a dirty word 每 while always promising tax cuts.) The major political parties are beginning to recognise this, up to a point.The second factor is a decline to barely recognisable levels in the annual increase in economic productivity. As the economist Simon Wren-Lewis has pointed out, this goes back, like so many other economic and social problems, to the 2007-09 financial crisis. We thought we had learned a lot from the economic disasters of the interwar years, and for decades after 1945 policies conducive to growth were taken for granted.This was all lost after the financial crisis 每 a crisis that itself illustrated how the lessons of the 1920s had been forgotten, most of which are readily available in JK?Galbraith＊s book . George Osborne＊s misconceived austerity programme hardly constituted the kind of policy for growth that would encourage business to invest in the pursuit of gains to productivity. Nor did his cuts to public sector investment. As Wren-Lewis reminds us, recoveries from past recessions have been characterised by periods of rapid growth. No such luck in this decade, and, having analysed the Conservative manifesto, the Institute for Fiscal Studies emphasises that what is in store if they get back with untrammelled authority is at least five more years of austerity.This puts May＊s claims about her ※great national mission§ in perspective. Brexit, we are told, gives us ※an enormous opportunity§. Why, thanks to her lame acceptance of a narrow result in an advisory, non-binding and grossly ill-informed referendum, ※we have the opportunity to change the country for the better§.Well, who wants to change the country for the worse? Sounds like a rhetorical question, doesn＊t it? But it isn＊t. The people who in effect want to change the country for the worse, whether or not they realise it, are those leaders and would-be leaders 每 I fear this appears to include the Labour party too 每 who are embracing Brexit.It was Boris Johnson who predicted, with his usual misuse of our language, that Brexit would be ※a Titanic success§ 每 a most unfortunate metaphor. Now, some of my fellow Remainers are hoping that when it becomes clear in due course that Brexit would almost certainly be a Titanic disaster, even our present generation of leaders may recognise the need to reconsider the entire project. The terrible truth is, however, that much damage will have been done meanwhile. Indeed, one reads and hears almost daily of decisions that are already being taken by firms dependent on the single market to relocate at least part of their operations, and of academic institutions and research organisations experiencing serious recruitment problems, especially of the skilled immigrants who counterbalance this country＊s skills deficiencies.It has not been unamusing to witness the narrowing of the opinion polls and signs of panic in the May ranks. For anyone who cares about prospective damage from Brexit, an ideal result on Thursday would be a hung parliament in which neither main party could form a government without embarking on a coalition with the Lib Dems and SNP 每 a condition of whose cooperation would be to think again on Brexit.Brexit is the biggest disaster facing this country since the second world war. That war brought Winston Churchill to the fore as a leader who opposed the appeasers. Where is the leader who can stand up to the Brexiters? Alas, not May."															
"his week Britain slumped to the  of advanced economies. Along with Italy, Britain is officially the worst performer among the G7 so far this year, held back by high inflation that is putting consumers under pressure. The cause of that high inflation is primarily the knock-on effect of the weaker pound, which  result last year.Just because the world didn＊t change on 24 June 2016 doesn＊t mean that it was never going to change. The time-lag between cause and effect is a cornerstone of economic behaviour. This basic dynamic takes into consideration the notion, observable over decades of analysis, that shocks rarely impact economies 每 particularly sophisticated ones 每 overnight. The  time-lag has just ended.Before last year＊s referendum, the UK looked set to deliver a strong, consistent economic performance. Leaving the European Union seemed an act of economic jeopardy, but the . Even by the end of last year, six months after the Brexit vote, it looked as if the doomsayers had been proved wrong, with the .The weakness of the pound only seemed to inflict mild annoyance for those whose holidays had suddenly become more expensive. And besides, the leavers argued, our currency would bounce back at some point. Even the ratings agencies and the scaremonger-in-chief 每 the Bank of England 每 seemed to have called it incorrectly.But the triumphalism and complacency of the Brexiters since then is a testament to how illiterate, politicised and pseudo-intellectual the whole discussion on economic impact has become. If I had a pound for every time a Brexit supporter confidently opined that a weak sterling will bolster UK exporters, despite it also increasing their costs, I would have ＃ well, they would be worth a lot less than this time last year. It＊s almost as if the fact that we woke up the day after the referendum to find that there was still money in the cashpoints was proof enough that it was all going to be OK. The experts were wrong!But that＊s not how it works. And the consistent depression of the pound should have been our guide. You see, currencies are the exception to the time-lag rule, because they are more sensitive and dynamic in times of economic uncertainty. The fuse of currency depreciation had been lit, and was quietly making its way towards the tinderbox of rising inflation, higher household debt and increased pressure on spending power.The  is now spending an additional  on groceries compared with last year. That may not seem a huge amount, but with  that could mean an extra ?119 over the course of this year. Airfares, package holidays and energy bills are all rising while wages remain the same.Last month unions accused the government of ignoring the plight of ordinary workers as life becomes more?expensive. The TUC general secretary, Frances O＊Grady,  of a?※living standards crisis§.And yet these significant and worrying developments have barely registered either in public debate or, indeed, in the election the country is holding that was meant to put to bed any Brexit-related uncertainty. The whole messy economic aspect has been conveniently folded under the deferred resolution of a final agreement 每 as if these are all merely wrinkles that will be smoothed out during negotiations once a final deal has been secured.How did we let this happen? The economy question seems to have dropped out of the debate because it has been so debased by Brexit evangelists, backed by their cheerleaders in the press, treating any expressions of concern like sabotage. We have gone from ※there will be no impact, don＊t talk Britain down§ to ※if there is, it＊s worth it§, making a martyr＊s?virtue of absorbing economic shocks for some greater ultimate good.Of course, economies are unpredictable, and a pattern does not make a trend, but today these are the new, inescapable facts: the United Kingdom has not fallen below fourth place in the list of  economic growth since the financial crisis of 2007-8 and it?is now last; UK house prices have fallen for a third month in a row, also for?the first time since the financial crisis; and the pound is at its lowest point for about 30 years.The past 12 months have undermined our ability to have any rational discussion about the economy because Brexit is now an ideology where there are only comrades and traitors. Populist pandering politicians have rendered any honest appraisal of fact as partisan.A slowing economic performance is hitting the British people in almost every part of their lives, impacting property values, energy bills, food prices, and the pay packet they take home.Burying heads in the sand and treating any examination of the possibility that a Brexit effect might already be upon us as treason is nothing short of a dereliction of duty. Those who know what damage our EU exit is still likely to?cause have to start speaking up."															
"John Veit-Wilson is right (, 2 June); destitution is being used by the Conservative government as a policy tool to destroy the defining principle of all welfare states, that they offer a minimum real level of living to all inhabitants. Such a minimum income must be able to pay for truly affordable housing, the provision of which was neglected in the Cambridge TV debate. The need for food banks will continue to grow, and the health of the poorest diminish, until the chaotic UK housing market is brought under control. Rents must stop taking the money needed for food, fuel, water and other necessities. Several parties＊ manifestos gave land value tax a nod. The advantages are that land cannot be placed tax-free in an overseas bank, taxing land forces into use the 600,000 plots of unused land owned by the big builders, it is progressive, it relieves the incomes of hardworking people and companies by enabling the abolition of inefficient taxes such as council tax, business rates and stamp duty.Two other laws are needed: no international speculator should be allowed to buy British land, which must be reserved for British citizens; and landowners should be required to sell any property they have left unused for six months. Thanks to Oliver Wainwright for his quick comparisons between the main parties＊ housing policies, the most progressive of which is clearly the Liberal Democrats＊ (, G2, 1 June). What bugs me is that the inequity of the application of VAT at the full rate on most maintenance work to the existing estate (which is the main problem as far as both public health and CO emissions are concerned) when newbuild housing is zero-rated, is not mentioned in any debate.With a 20% incentive to demolish and rebuild, even in the unlikely event of a  victory, we would still see pressure for a continuation of this process on inner-London councils with large public landholdings, such as Lambeth, Southwark, with all the waste of embodied energy and disruption of communities that this implies, but which suits the volume housebuilders just fine. Land nationalisation has a long history, relevant today when private profit from land has overwhelmed public interest. Who owns, occupies and uses land is the root problem in many countries. Israel/Palestine is the most obvious case. With nationalisation back on its agenda, Labour should revisit a 1973 proposal to convert all land from freehold to 99-year leasehold. Land ownership is the greatest source of power, undeserved gains, and the skewing of wealth to a small minority. It is a power that determines democratic elections."															
" hinted that a Labour government would introduce tax rises on those paying the top rate of tax 每 at ?150,000 and above 每 and that Labour＊s biggest tax increases would be reserved for the richest.The shadow chancellor said those most affected by income tax increases would be ※the 1% at the top§, a figure that roughly equates to the proportion already on the highest, 45% rate, of income tax.McDonnell was careful to avoid being too specific but when questioned he declined to rule out raising the top rate of tax to 50p, saying the party was still ※consolidating and confirming our manifesto§.McDonnell had hinted earlier in the weekend that those earning over ?80,000 would be asked to pay a ※modest§ increase. This would effectively create a new tax bracket for those earning between ?80,000 and ?150,000.McDonnell said the party＊s manifesto would clarify its new tax rates for those who earn over ?80,000. ※I think people will be pleasantly surprised on the modesty of what we are asking of people,§ he said. ※One of the principles is that the highest earners will pay the most.§When  was in government it introduced a 50p rate of tax on those earning ?150,000 after the financial crisis in 2010, but the rate was cut to 45p by George Osborne in 2013. Those earning between ?45,000 and ?150,000 pay a 40% rate.Conservative sources responded by claiming that McDonnell backed an even higher tax rise, pointing to a 2012 blog in which he called for ※the restoration of progressive income tax of 60% on incomes above ?100,000§.Those earning high salaries would benefit in other ways from Labour＊s manifesto, he told the audience at the Museum of London. ※I want to pay tribute to those who do pay their taxes at the high level,§ he said. ※They make their contribution and we thank them for that. At the same time, we want a fair taxation system. If we upgrade our economy, we will create a richer society.§McDonnell also reflected on Friday＊s local election results, in which the party lost more than 300 council seats, and , Tees Valley and the West Midlands. On the BBC＊s Andrew Marr show, McDonnell called the results ※really disappointing§ but refused to say whether he and Corbyn would step down if Labour loses the general election on 8 June.※I＊m not working on wild hypotheticals,§ he said. ※I think we＊ve got a period of time in which we＊ve not been able to get our policies across. Partly that＊s the media, I have to say. I have to be straight about that. But also we are campaigning with a united party, our campaign has got to step up a notch. The general election starts now.§On the ground, local Labour activists opposed to Corbyn have been discreetly compiling data from voters on whether a change of leadership could persuade them to back the party. Activists in a number of areas where the Labour vote slipped in the local elections, including parts of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and West Midlands, have been asking voters ※what could we change that would persuade you to vote Labour?§ according to canvass returns seen by the Guardian.Canvassers mark papers with a ＆J＊ if voters suggest changing the leadership. Those who suggest the Labour leader is the problem will get call-backs from the local Labour MP to try to bring in personal votes.Alan Johnson, a Labour former home secretary who is stepping down as an MP at the election, said Corbyn had shown he could deliver his message to ※rallies to hundreds of supporters in safe Labour territory,§ but had to expand this reach in the election. ※Here＊s a chance for him to do that and he has to grasp [it],§ Johnson told Sky News＊s Sophy Ridge on Sunday.Asked if this election was a battle for the existence of the party as a political force, Johnson said: ※Yes, it is. You lose two elections and that＊s bad enough.

"lobalization and the international rules-based order that underpins it are under siege. Bunkering down and hoping the flames of populism burn out as economic growth picks up is not a winning strategy. The crisis of confidence in the benefits of globalization and multilateralism likely will persist as long as rates of social and economic inequality remain stubbornly high.The best defense of multilateralism and the rules-based order is a good offense. Addressing inequality and updating the rules of the global economy to reflect the needs of the 21st century must guide the agenda for this week＊s  and World Bank spring meetings.The finance ministers and central bank governors gathered for the spring meetings should focus on new approaches to reduce inequality and increase resilience, not just on new language for press releases and other official statements. A number of steps to restore faith in the system should be considered, including improving the rules shaping international trade, developing a shared vision for effective regulation of technology, and ensuring the IMF and multilateral development banks (MDBs) are prepared to help prevent and respond to crisis. The post-second world war period has produced the greatest economic expansion in world history, including a dramatic reduction in extreme poverty. Yet the institutions, norms and rules that form the backbone of the economic order have proven remarkably slow to change. The most prominent example was the inability of global financial regulation to keep pace with the innovation and evolution of the financial system, contributing to the most severe global recession since the Great Depression. The rise of a global populist strand that seeks to draw economies apart rather than bring them together also represents an existential threat to multilateralism and the rules-based order. While protectionism makes for good political soundbites, history is littered with examples of the failure of these policies. Yet it is true that changes to the international trading system are needed, especially non-tariff barriers to trade that harm fair competition. All credible ideas should be on the table, including potential penalties for countries with persistently large current account surpluses, particularly those that intervene in the foreign exchange market. While global supply chains may reduce the impact exchange rates have on trade, it is still critical we find new ways to address the unfair advantage some derive from manipulating their currency. The IMF can and should do more to hold countries accountable. A multilateral approach to addressing imbalances will be far more effective and less draconian than any unilateral or regional solution. And additional reforms to the international trading system are needed, including faster resolution of disputes between countries, increased transparency, and improved technical assistance to developing countries. Advances in technology are radically transforming the global economy. The lack of global policy coordination to address technologies that often live outside the borders of any one jurisdiction is already having a negative impact on innovation and regulation. While issues related to taxation have dominated the discussion at previous spring meetings, there are several other subjects deserving of attention. Reducing data localization 每 the requirement that data is stored, managed and handled within a country＊s borders 每 especially as it pertains to financial data, needs to be addressed. Maintaining information in unnecessary jurisdictions creates a barrier to entry for many smaller firms and slows innovation by way of machine learning with the ability to transform fields like financial inclusion which are central to reducing inequality. A major hurdle to reducing data localization is formulating a global framework for managing data privacy issues. The EU每US Privacy Shield is already providing a structure for the United States and Europe, but officials need to focus on building a framework that includes far more of the global economy. As the memory of the global financial crisis fades, it is critical that the lessons we learned from facing the abyss continue to impact our policy choices. While post-crisis reforms have made the global financial system more resilient, in many ways governments have fewer tools today to protect the system from another crisis. This is one of many reasons it is essential the MDBs and IMF are well resourced. The World Bank＊s ability to lend during the Great recession helped ensure it did not become a depression. Those leading the justified efforts to optimize MDB balance sheets should carefully consider how resources can be stretched while maintaining the ability to lend during a crisis. The IMF lending toolkit should not be overly constrained by inflexible requirements that limit its ability to prevent and respond to a crisis. Fears that all but the most rigid standards will put taxpayer money at risk are significantly exaggerated. The IMF has never lost a dollar of taxpayer money, and should maintain the flexibility needed to protect the global economy.After nearly a decade responding to the financial crisis and its economic aftershocks, officials must now devote the same level of creativity and ambition to addressing the crisis of confidence in the international economic order. Protectionism and a retreat from international cooperation is clearly not the answer, but policy makers minimize the underlying mistrust of globalization and multilateralism at their peril. In order to promote sustainable and inclusive growth, policymakers must focus on tangible changes that are responsive to the challenges we face. "															
"he public profile of mental health experienced another boost this week, thanks to some moving  about the impact of their mother＊s death, nearly 20 years ago. The two royals are working for the , which seeks to combat the stigma surrounding mental health issues, and to encourage people to speak more openly about their difficulties.Harry＊s admission that he had ignored his own emotional distress for several years before eventually having counselling , from a figure more commonly associated with laddish machismo.  was also a good use of his celebrity.The royal family cannot get involved in divisive party political issues, and so we can only conclude from these interventions that mental health is something that exists beyond the fray of politics. Breaking the ※stigma§ surrounding mental health issues is certainly not something that one would want to identify as a leftwing or a rightwing agenda.On the other hand, political parties have been keen to make the mental health agenda their own. Theresa May has established mental health as one of the key areas where she hopes to signal her government＊s concern for everyday human suffering, making a high-profile speech in January that also stressed the importance of breaking the stigma that clouds the issue.All of this presents something of a riddle.  problems have risen in profile to the point where the prime minister and the heir to the throne are personally committed to combating them. Yet there is scarcely any public discussion about where they actually stem from. Losing a parent at a vulnerable age, as Harry did, is terrible and harmful 每 but epidemics do not arise purely out of private tragedies.The stigma attached to mental health is a real problem in workplaces and schools, as are the benefits of overturning it. But stigma can scarcely be viewed as the cause of what it stigmatises.The orthodoxy that has taken root since the 1980s is that mental health problems are disorders of the brain. The success of SSRIs since the has helped to entrench this view. This doesn＊t mean that mental illness can＊t be treated with ※talking cures§, such as cognitive behavioural therapy or by being more open about one＊s emotions, as Prince Harry has argued. But the idea that mental health problems are illnesses just like any other illnesses has become one of the main ways in which the stigma is challenged. Comparisons with cancer have become common.The idea that one is simply ※unwell§ no doubt provides comfort to many people wrestling with their own depression or anxiety. But it also blocks out a whole host of more fundamental cultural, political and economic questions regarding the distribution of distress in our society 每 the sorts of questions that the Duke of Cambridge would be less likely to grapple with.There is no more damning indictment on British society in 2017 than the prevalence of mental distress among children. Nearly a quarter of a million , and have been climbing year-on-year. Rates of self-harm amongst young girls have .Are we to believe that it was simply ※stigma§ that swept all this under the carpet in the past? Or might children be telling the truth, when they say they feel overwhelmed by the requirement to perform, excel, keep up? The NSPCC reports that some children are having to sit mock exams just a few weeks after returning from the summer holidays. Think about what that means and does psychologically. What does Theresa May have to say about that? British children have become damagingly competitive, and less forgiving of failure. Which minister will have the guts to stand up and say to children that being average is OK?Adult mental health problems may present themselves as medical and be treated as such, but they are not immune to sociological analysis. Researchers have found that adult mental health is worse among those who frequently moved house as a child. Today＊s housing crisis is tomorrow＊s mental health crisis.Rising household indebtedness is another major culprit, especially the kinds of problem debts that are associated with week-by-week financial precarity. Children suffer when their parents are too stressed or depressed to listen to them or play with them. Debt problems break up families.Austerity has been disastrous for the nation＊s mental health. The British Psychological Society has called for a termination of benefit sanctions (which are effectively designed to produce anxiety); academics have shown the deep emotional harm . Teachers, who live under the constant spectre of monitoring and performance assessment, are .The seductive concept of ※public sector productivity gains§ conceals thousands of personal tragedies among doctors, paramedics and local government service providers, many of whom cling to a dream of exiting their profession. And these are the same people who look after the wellbeing of our children and mental health patients.No doubt mental health will feature prominently in party manifestos, now that it＊s gone mainstream. Whether any of the above gets a look-in remains to be seen. Labour should be shouting about it, and not allow the hypocritical architects of austerity an inch of this territory. Next time a Labour politician is patronised as being too leftwing by a journalist, the evidence on what inequality does to our minds should be slung back.So, yes, we need to talk more. And, yes, stigma surrounding depression and anxiety makes things worse. But it＊s not just ourselves and our medical histories we need to talk about. We also need to talk about what sort of society we＊ve built, and what the alternative might look like. For all their good intentions, Harry and Wills might need to sit that one out."															
"hings are not going well in the world＊s richest economies. Most OECD countries are facing their highest levels of income inequality in 30 years, while generating ecological footprints of a size that would require four, five or six planet Earths if every country were to follow suit. These economies have, in essence, become divisive and degenerative by default. Mainstream economic theory long promised that the solution starts with growth 每 but why does that theory seem so ill-equipped to deal with the social and ecological fallout of its own prescriptions? The answer can be traced back to a severe case of physics envy. In the 1870s, a handful of aspiring economists hoped to make economics a science as reputable as physics. Awed by Newton＊s insights on the physical laws of motion 每 laws that so elegantly describe the trajectory of falling apples and orbiting moons 每 they sought to create an economic theory that matched his legacy. And so pioneering economists such as William Stanley Jevons and L谷on Walras drew their diagrams in clear imitation of Newton＊s style and, inspired by the way that gravity pulls a falling object to rest, wrote enthusiastically of the role played by market forces and mechanisms in pulling an economy into equilibrium. Their mechanical metaphor sounds authoritative, but it was ill-chosen from the start 每 a fact that has been widely acknowledged since the astonishing fragility and contagion of global financial markets was exposed by the 2008 crash. The most pernicious legacy of this fake physics has been to entice generations of economists into a misguided search for economic laws of motion that dictate the path of development. People and money are not as obedient as gravity, so no such laws exist. Yet their false discoveries have been used to justify growth-first policymaking.  In 1955, the economist Simon Kuznets thought he had found such a law of motion, one that determined the path of income inequality in a growing economy. The scant data that he could gather together seemed to suggest that, as a nation＊s GDP grows, inequality first rises, then levels off, and ultimately starts to fall. Despite Kuznets＊ explicit warnings that his work was 5% empirical, 95% speculation and ※some of it possibly tainted by wishful thinking§, his findings were soon touted as an economic law of motion, immortalized as ※§每 resembling an upside-down U on the page 每 and has been taught to every economics student for the past half century. As for the curve＊s message? When it comes to inequality, it has to get worse before it can get better, and more growth will make it better. And so the Kuznets Curve became a perfect justification for trickle-down economics and for enduring austerity today in the pursuit of making everyone better off some day. Forty years later, in the 1990s, economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger thought they too had found an economic law of motion, this time about pollution. And it appeared to follow the very same trajectory as Kuznets＊ curve on inequality: first rising then falling as the economy grows. Despite the familiar caveats that the data were incomplete, and available for local air and water pollutants only, their findings were quickly labeled the ※§. And the message? When it comes to pollution, it has to get worse before it can get better and 每 guess what 每 more growth will make it better. Like a well-trained child, growth will apparently clean up after itself. Except it doesn＊t. If we have learned one thing from the emergent crises of recent decades 每 from the tipping points of climate change and the rise of the 1% to the near-collapse of financial markets 每 it is that it＊s time for economics to ditch the fake physics. Thanks to more and better data, it has become clear that such economic laws of motion simply don＊t exist. Far from being a necessary phase of development, extreme inequality and environmental degradation are the result of policy choices, and these choices can be changed. In the place of laws to be obeyed, there are design decisions to be made. So if the economy is not best thought of as a mechanism that returns to equilibrium and follows fixed laws of motion, how should we think of it? Like the living world: it＊s complex, dynamic and ever-evolving. And for economists, that means it＊s time for a metaphorical career change: from engineer to gardener. Let＊s take off the hard hat and give up on reaching for the economy＊s control levers because they simply don＊t exist. Instead, put on some gardening gloves, pick up a pair of secateurs, and start to steward the economic garden. And if you think that sounds laissez faire, then you＊ve never done a hard day＊s work in the garden: it calls for getting stuck in, digging, pruning, weeding and watering the plants as they grow and mature. How can economic gardeners help to create a thriving economy, one that is inclusive and sustainable and will help to achieve the sustainable development goals? By following two core principles: make it regenerative and distributive by design. Regenerative economic design ensures that instead of using up Earth＊s resources, we use them again and again and again. We learn to work with, not against, the cyclical processes of life, including those for carbon, water and nutrients. Thanks to innovations in the  and  we can start turning last century＊s degenerative economy into this century＊s regenerative one. Distributive economic design, in turn, ensures that value created is spread far more equitably among those who helped to generate it. Think employee-owned companies 每 such as the  and  每 that reward committed employees rather than short-term shareholders. Think community-owned renewable-energy systems that generate electricity along with income for community purpose. Think creative commons licensing that enables valuable innovations, like those of the , to be shared, improved and used without end. Thanks to the rise of digital networks, there＊s more opportunity than ever to turn last century＊s divisive economy into this century＊s distributive one. So how can economic policymakers be more like gardeners in their approach? They should think of policy as an adapting portfolio of experiments, says , a leading thinker in the field of evolutionary economics. We should mimic nature＊s process of natural selection, which can be summed up as diversify-select-amplify: set up small-scale policy experiments to test out a variety of interventions, put a stop to the ones that don＊t work and scale-up those that do. Nobel-prize-winning political scientist Elinor Ostrom agreed. ※We have never had to deal with problems of the scale facing today＊s globally interconnected society,§ . ※No one knows for sure what will work, so it is important to build a system that can evolve and adapt rapidly.§Realising that the economy is ever-evolving is an empowering insight. If complex systems evolve through their innovations and deviations, then this gives added importance to novel initiatives 每 from complementary currencies to open-source design 每 that are at the leading edge of new economic design. Better still, every one of us can have a hand in shaping the economy＊s evolution. Not just in how we shop, eat and travel, but in how we volunteer, invest and protest. In how we set up new businesses, save for our pensions, license our inventions, and power our homes. Who knows, we could just turn out to be butterflies that stir up powerful winds of change."															
"Doritos, Peperami and Coco Pops are the latest products to fall victim to shrinkflation as rising costs hit food producers.The size of a large bag of Doritos has been reduced by 10% to 180g but remains on sale at the same average price of ?1.99.

It said the number of Coco Pops in a box had actually increased by more than 10%.

"ew figures on business confidence suggest that the one place where the service sector boom is on the ebb is in the consumer sector 每 hotels and restaurants, gyms and hairdressers. The twin pressures of rising inflation and slowing pay rises are squeezing household incomes. The ratio of personal debt to household income, which fell steadily in the years after the financial crisis, has now?again begun to rise. Last week, new figures were published showing February brought the highest increase in .The British economy＊s failure to wean itself off an addiction to growth fuelled by an expanding consumer debt bubble is bad for consumers, and bad for the economy as a whole. It is no substitute for business investment, which the OECD has forecast will fall sharply in future years in . It makes recession more likely, and, when it comes, deeper and longer. The human costs of getting into problematic debt are no less profound: people are a third more likely to develop mental health issues if they find themselves .Historically, financial regulators have lacked both the power and the will to ensure that unhealthy levels of consumer debt are held in check. Customers who get into persistent debt tend, after all, to be very profitable for credit card and loan companies. Rather than help people struggling with repayments, it is in their interests to offer products that encourage consumers to use credit cards as an expensive form of long-term borrowing. The  (FCA) estimates there are 2 million people carrying persistent debt on their credit card, defined as paying more in fees and charges over an 18-month period than the amount they borrowed in the first place.From the embers of the 2008 financial crisis, a new regulatory regime emerged and there are some signs that it is now, finally, asserting itself. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England＊s chief economist, first  about rising consumer credit in 2015, but it was not until last week that  that the Prudential Regulation Authority will be reviewing whether lending standards have become too lax, risking macroeconomic financial stability.The FCA is now consulting on  for credit card companies: it has proposed that they should be required to prompt customers with persistent debt to increase their repayment thresholds after 18 months, and, if they are still in persistent debt after a further 18 months, to propose repayment plans to help them repay and ultimately to take steps to make the debt more affordable.But this is too little, too late. The rules are?vague and leave far too much leeway for the companies, which are unlikely to change their behaviour without tougher action. There is too little emphasis on preventing consumers from getting into persistent debt in the first place 每 for example, by forcing companies to increase the very low minimum monthly payments they require from customers. It＊s in the same vein as action the FCA has taken on extortionate overdraft charges, leaving it up to banks to set their own maximum cap on charges, rather than enforcing a cap of its own making.None of this, however, will reduce the root causes of problem debt. The most common reason people get into unmanageable debt is . A growing number of low-income families face a grim mix of stagnant wages, increasing inflation and huge?cuts to tax credits and benefits in the coming years, which will force growing numbers of people towards unsustainable debt. The?most significant thing the government could do would be to reverse the unnecessary and expensive tax cuts it has planned for businesses and more affluent families, and use the proceeds to cushion the?blow of its unfair and unwarranted cuts to?benefits and tax credits."															
"The Bank of England has flagged up new  as Britons rack up debt on credit cards, car purchase schemes and personal loans.Reinforcing , minutes from a policy meeting published on Tuesday suggested it was worried about looser lending conditions such as higher maximum loan limits. The financial policy committee (FPC) announced last week it was launching a review into the credit quality of new lending 每 underwriting standards and the risk models used by banks 每 and said it would scrutinise these findings over the coming months. Tuesday＊s record of the FPC meeting revealed policymakers were worried about the risk to banks and other lenders from rising consumer borrowing, although they played down the risks to the wider economy.※If recent strong growth had been driven by weaker underwriting standards, this could reduce the resilience of lenders to shocks. The FPC judged that underwriting standards should be monitored closely,§ ※Overall, the committee judged that, relative to mortgage debt, consumer credit was less likely to pose a risk to broader macroeconomic stability through its effect on household spending. Instead, the recent rapid growth in consumer credit could principally represent a risk to lenders if accompanied by weaker underwriting standards.§The FPC, chaired by the Bank＊s governor, Mark Carney, described household indebtedness as ※high by historical standards§ and noted it had begun to rise relative to incomes. ※Consumer credit had been growing particularly rapidly. It had reached an annual growth rate of 10.9% in November 2016 每 the fastest rate of expansion since 2005 每 before easing back somewhat in subsequent months,§ the meeting minutes noted.※Growth had been broad-based across different segments of the market. Dealership car finance had seen the fastest expansion in recent years, but credit cards and personal loans had contributed materially to the acceleration in consumer credit in 2016.§The Bank＊s latest remarks on household debts follow  and prompting some households to run down savings or turn to loans to cover their living costs.On Monday, . The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said charges could be eased or withdrawn if customers could not afford to curb their liabilities through a repayment plan.The FCA found that 3.3 million people had fallen into a persistent credit card debt spiral, where all their money is spent on repaying interest, while the total debt is never lowered."															
"A sharp rise in food prices has added ?21.31 to the average household shopping bill over the past three months as the number of promotions fell to an 11-year low, according to new grocery market data.The price of everyday goods at supermarkets rose 2.3% in the three months to 26 March from a year ago, said Kantar Worldpanel, a sharp pick-up from the .Rising prices for everyday staples such as butter, fish, tea and skincare have been partially offset by falling prices for crisps, bacon, chocolate and fresh poultry, Kantar said.Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ※We expect inflation to continue to accelerate, and as a result we＊re likely to see consumers looking for cheaper alternatives.

Separate data from Nielsen showed the proportion of consumer spending on promotions at UK supermarkets has fallen to an 11-year low.Just over a quarter (26%) of money spent at supermarkets went on products with temporary price cuts or multibuy offers in the four weeks to 25 March, the lowest level since 2006. Supermarkets＊ own-label products are more affected than other categories: 18% of sales went on promotional spending, compared with 41% of branded goods sales.※The level of promotional spend has gone back to levels not seen since before the 2008-09 economic crisis,§ said Mike Watkins, Nielsen＊s UK head of retailer and business insight.※The last few years have seen about a third of the typical supermarket shopping bill going on promotional items. However, to be more price competitive, supermarkets have turned temporary price reductions into permanent cuts, so there＊s less promotional activity as many prices are cheaper all-year round.§Last year,  in favour of lower everyday prices.However, the sharp slide in the pound since the Brexit vote last June has increased the cost of imported goods, and grocers have been passing on the rises to customers.Kantar said supermarket sales of ※free from§ products grew by 36% year on year in the past three months, with more than half the population (54%) purchasing a gluten or dairy-free product. German discounters Lidl and Aldi have reached new record market shares and together account for 11.7% of the grocery market, according to Kantar. Lidl was the fastest-growing retailer with sales growth of 15%, taking its market share to 4.9%. Aldi increased sales by 14.3%, taking its share to 6.8%. Iceland posted its strongest sales growth since March 2013, of 9.8%, after introducing more fresh and chilled lines. Bigger rivals Tesco, Sainsbury＊s and Asda have seen sales and market share slip. Morrisons was the only one of the big four to achieve higher sales, of 0.3% in the past 12 weeks."															
															
"Retail sales rebounded in June as the sunny weather put consumers in the mood to update their summer wardrobes.Sales rose by 0.6% last month, beating the 0.4% increase forecast by economists and following a sharp 1.1% drop in May, according to the  (ONS).While consumers splashed out on T-shirts and sandals, as well as household goods, the volume of food and fuel sales fell.※A particularly warm June seems to have prompted strong sales in clothing, which has compensated for a decline in food and fuel sales for the month,§ said Kate Davies, a senior statistician at the ONS.A better-than-expected June pushed up retail sales by 1.5% in the second quarter overall, following a 1.4% fall in the first quarter.Ian Geddes, head of retail at the consultancy Deloitte, said the sunny weather had brought a ※Glastonbury feelgood factor§ to Britain＊s high streets. ※The good weather has clearly boosted footfall on the high streets as well as clothing sales, which coincided with stores being full of summer lines,§ Geddes said. ※June＊s retail numbers gave a timely boost to the second quarter, which means that the retail industry has ended the first half of the year flat, as opposed to down.§Economists cautioned that the rebound could prove temporary amid a sustained fall in real pay as . The first estimate of UK growth in the second quarter, published by the ONS next week, is expected to show a slight pick-up from.※Consumer spending has been a powerful engine of UK economic growth for the past three years, but has now lost momentum,§ said Andrew Sentance, a senior economic adviser at accountancy firm PwC and a former member of the Bank of England＊s rate-setting committee. ※The GDP figures for the second quarter are likely to confirm this picture of subdued economic growth. The vote for Brexit has created a more uncertain climate for business and a squeeze on consumers from higher inflation. We face the prospect of weak economic growth this year and next.§  from 2.9% in May, mainly because of lower fuel prices. Reflecting the fall in inflation, the ONS said retail sales annual growth in shop prices 每 including petrol stations 每 slowed to 2.7% in June from 3.2% in May.However, with regular pay growth excluding bonuses currently running at 1.8%, workers are suffering a sustained period of falling real pay. Despite the weak backdrop for household finances, economists at Capital  said there were a number of reasons why a collapse in consumer spending was unlikely.※The squeeze in real wages looks likely to intensify as inflation continues to rise to around 3%. However, nominal spending should continue to hold up well, supported by strong employment growth, resilient consumer confidence and low borrowing costs. ※In any case higher inflation should prove transitory, falling back to 2% by the end of 2018. Indeed, there are already signs that the effect of the weaker pound on retailers＊ costs is starting to wane. As such, while we are forecasting a slowdown in real consumer spending growth, a collapse looks unlikely.§Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said a rise in retail sales in June was unlikely to convince policymakers that the time was right to raise interest rates. ※While today＊s reading is welcome news and may limit any further downside to GDP growth during the second quarter, I doubt that the middle ground on the Bank＊s monetary policy committee is going to get more hawkish on the back of sales of paddling pools and flip-flops,§ he said.Clarke predicted the MPC would leave UK interest rates on hold at an all-time low of 0.25% at its next policy meeting in August, despite inflation being well above the Bank＊s 2% target and forecast to climb higher.

"en years ago this month, the French bank BNP Paribas decided to limit investors＊ access to the money they had deposited in three funds. It was the first loud signal of the financial stress that would, a year later, send the global economy into a tailspin. Yet the massive economic and financial dislocations that would come to a boil in late 2008 and continue through early 2009 每 which brought the world to the brink of a devastating multi-year depression 每 took policymakers in advanced economies completely by surprise. They had clearly not paid enough attention to the lessons of crises in the emerging world.Anyone who has experienced or studied developing-country financial crises will be painfully aware of their defining features. For starters, as the late  argued, financial crises can take a long time to develop, but once they erupt, they tend to spread rapidly, widely, violently and (seemingly) indiscriminately.In this process of cascading failures, overall financial conditions quickly flip from feast to famine. Private credit factories that seemed indestructible are brought to their knees, and central banks and governments are confronted with tough, inherently uncertain policy choices. Moreover, policymakers also have to account for the risk of a ※sudden stop§ to economic activity, which can devastate employment, trade and investment.Marshaling a sufficiently comprehensive response to extreme financial stress becomes even more difficult, if not enough was done during the good times to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth. It becomes harder still when politicians are actively playing the blame game. In the end, the sociopolitical and institutional effects of a crisis can far outlast the economic and financial ones.All of these lessons would have been useful to advanced-economy policymakers 10 years ago. When BNP Paribas froze $2.2bn worth of funds , it should have been obvious that more financial stress would be forthcoming. But policymakers drew the wrong conclusions, primarily for two reasons.First, it took some time for policymakers to come to grips with the extent of the financial system＊s latent instability, which had accumulated under their watch. Second, most policymakers in the advanced world were too dismissive of the idea that they had anything to learn from emerging countries＊ experiences.Unfortunately, these problems are yet to be fully resolved. In fact, there is a growing risk that politicians 每 many of whom are distracted and sidestepping their economic-governance responsibilities 每 may be missing the biggest historical insight of all: the importance of an economy＊s underlying growth model.Indeed, advanced-country politicians today still seem to be ignoring the limitations of an economic model that relies excessively on finance to create sustainable, inclusive growth. Though those limitations have been laid bare over the past 10 years, policymakers did not strengthen adequately the growth model on which their economies depend. Instead, they often acted as if the crisis was merely a cyclical 每 albeit dramatic 每 shock, and assumed that the economy would bounce back in a V-like fashion, as it had typically done after a recession.Because policymakers were initially captivated by cyclical thinking, they did not regard the financial crisis as a secular or epochal event. The result was that they purposely designed their policy responses to be ※timely, targeted and temporary§. Eventually, it became clear that the problem required a much broader, longer-term structural solution. But by that time, the political window of opportunity for bold actions had essentially closed.Consequently, advanced economies took too long returning to pre-crisis GDP levels, and were unable to unleash their considerable growth potential. Worse, the growth that they did achieve in the years after the crisis was not inclusive; instead, the excessively wide income, wealth and opportunity gaps in many advanced economies endured.The longer this pattern persisted, the more advanced economies＊ future growth prospects suffered. And what was previously unthinkable 每 both financially and politically 每 started to become possible, even likely.A decade after the start of the crisis, advanced economies still have not decisively pivoted away from a growth model that is overly reliant on liquidity and leverage 每 first from private financial institutions, and then from central banks. They have yet to make sufficient investments in infrastructure, education and human capital more generally. They have not addressed anti-growth distortions that undermine the efficacy of tax systems, financial intermediation and trade. And they have failed to keep up with technology, taking advantage of the potential benefits of big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence and new forms of mobility, while managing effectively the related risks.Policymakers in the advanced world lagged in internalising the relevant insights from emerging economies. But they now have the evidence and analytical capability to do so. It is in their power to avert more disappointments, tap into sources of sustainable growth and tackle today＊s alarming levels of inequality. The ball is in the political class＊s court."															
"ast summer, researchers at the International Monetary Fund settled a long and bitter debate over ※neoliberalism§: they admitted it exists. Three senior economists at the IMF, an organisation not known for its incaution, published . In so doing, they helped put to rest the idea that the word is nothing more than a political slur, or a term without any analytic power. The paper gently called out a ※neoliberal agenda§ for pushing deregulation on economies around the world, for forcing open national markets to trade and capital, and for demanding that governments shrink themselves via austerity or privatisation. The authors cited statistical evidence for the spread of neoliberal policies since 1980, and their correlation with anaemic growth, boom-and-bust cycles and inequality.Neoliberalism is an old term, dating back to the 1930s, but it has been revived as a way of describing our current politics 每 or more precisely, . In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, it was a way of assigning responsibility for the debacle, not to a political party per se, but to an establishment that had conceded its authority to the market. For the Democrats in the US and Labour in the UK, this concession was depicted as a grotesque betrayal of principle. Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, it was said, had abandoned the left＊s traditional commitments, especially to workers, in favour of a global financial elite and the self-serving policies that enriched them; and in doing so, had enabled a sickening rise in inequality.Over the past few years, as debates have turned uglier, the word has become a rhetorical weapon, a way for anyone left of centre to incriminate those even an inch to their right. (No wonder centrists say it＊s a meaningless insult: they＊re the ones most meaningfully insulted by it.) But ※neoliberalism§ is more than a gratifyingly righteous jibe. It is also, in its way, a pair of eyeglasses.Peer through the lens of neoliberalism and you see more clearly how the political thinkers most admired by Thatcher and Reagan helped shape the ideal of society as a kind of universal market (and not, for example, a polis, a civil sphere or a kind of family) and of human beings as profit-and-loss calculators (and not bearers of grace, or of inalienable rights and duties). Of course the goal was to weaken the welfare state and any commitment to full employment, and 每 always 每 to cut taxes and deregulate. But ※neoliberalism§ indicates something more than a standard rightwing wish list. It was a way of reordering social reality, and of rethinking our status as individuals.Still peering through the lens, you see how, no less than the welfare state, the free market is a human invention. You see how pervasively we are now urged to think of ourselves as proprietors of our own talents and initiative, how glibly we are told to compete and adapt. You see the extent to which a language formerly confined to chalkboard simplifications describing commodity markets (competition, perfect information, rational behaviour) has been applied to all of society, until it has invaded the grit of our personal lives, and how the attitude of the salesman has become enmeshed in all modes of self-expression.In short, ※neoliberalism§ is not simply a name for pro-market policies, or for the compromises with finance capitalism made by failing social democratic parties. It is a name for a premise that, quietly, has come to regulate all we practise and believe: that competition is the only legitimate organising principle for human activity.No sooner had neoliberalism been certified as real, and no sooner had it made clear the universal hypocrisy of the market, than the populists and authoritarians came to power. In the US, Hillary Clinton, the neoliberal arch-villain, lost 每 and to a man who knew just enough . So are the eyeglasses now useless? Can they do anything to help us understand what is broken about British and American politics? Against the forces of global integration, national identity is being reasserted, and in the crudest possible terms. What could the militant parochialism of Brexit Britain and Trumpist America have to do with neoliberal rationality? What possible connection is there between the president 每 a freewheeling boob 每 and the bloodless paragon of efficiency known as the free market?It isn＊t only that the free market produces a tiny cadre of winners and an enormous army of losers 每 and the losers, looking for revenge, have turned to Brexit and Trump. There was, from the beginning, an inevitable relationship between the utopian ideal of the free market and the dystopian present in which we find ourselves; between the market as unique discloser of value and guardian of liberty, and our current descent into post-truth and illiberalism.Moving the stale debate about neoliberalism forward begins, I think, with taking seriously the measure of its cumulative effect on all of us, regardless of affiliation. And this requires returning to its origins, which have nothing to do with Bill or Hillary Clinton. There once was a group of people who did call themselves neoliberals, and did so proudly, and their ambition was a total revolution in thought. The most prominent among them, Friedrich Hayek, did not think he was staking out a position on the political spectrum, or making excuses for the fatuous rich, or tinkering along the edges of microeconomics.He thought he was solving the problem of modernity: the problem of objective knowledge. For Hayek, the market didn＊t just facilitate trade in goods and services; it revealed truth. How did his ambition collapse into its opposite 每 the mind-bending possibility that, thanks to our thoughtless veneration of the free market, truth might be driven from public life altogether?hen the idea occurred to Friedrich Hayekin 1936, he knew, with the conviction of a ※sudden illumination§, that he had struck upon something new. ※How can the combination of fragments of knowledge existing in different minds,§ he wrote, ※bring about results which, if they were to be brought about deliberately, would require a knowledge on the part of the directing mind which no single person can possess?§This was not a technical point about interest rates or deflationary slumps. This was not a reactionary polemic against collectivism or the welfare state. This was a way of birthing a new world. To his mounting excitement, Hayek understood that the market could be thought of as a kind of mind. had already given us the modern conception of the market: as an autonomous sphere of human activity and therefore, potentially, a valid object of scientific knowledge. But Smith was, until the end of his life, an 18th-century moralist. He thought the market could be justified only in light of individual virtue, and he was anxious that a society governed by nothing but transactional self-interest was no society at all. Neoliberalism is Adam Smith without the anxiety.That Hayek is considered the grandfather of neoliberalism 每 a style of thought that reduces everything to economics 每 is a little ironic given that he was such a mediocre economist. He was just a young, obscure Viennese technocrat when he was recruited to the London School of  to compete with, or possibly even dim, the rising star of John Maynard Keynes at Cambridge.The plan backfired, and Hayek lost out to Keynes in a rout. Keynes＊s General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in 1936, was greeted as a masterpiece. It dominated the public discussion, especially among young English economists in training, for whom the brilliant, dashing, socially connected Keynes was a . By the end of the second world war, many prominent free-marketers had come around to Keynes＊s way of thinking, conceding that government might play a role in managing a modern economy. The initial excitement over Hayek had dissipated. His peculiar notion that doing nothing could cure an economic depression had been discredited in theory and practice. He later admitted that he wished his work criticising Keynes would simply be forgotten.Hayek cut a silly figure: a tall, erect, thickly accented professor in high-cut tweed, insisting on the formal ※Von Hayek§ but cruelly nicknamed ※Mr Fluctooations§ behind his back. In 1936, he was an academic without a portfolio and with no obvious future. Yet we now live in Hayek＊s world, as we once lived in Keynes＊s. Lawrence Summers, the Clinton adviser and former president of Harvard University, has said that Hayek＊s conception of the price system as a mind is ※as penetrating and original an idea as microeconomics produced in the 20th century§ and ※the single most important thing to learn from an economics course today§. This undersells it. Keynes did not make or predict the cold war, but his thinking wended its way into every aspect of the cold-war world; so too has Hayek＊s thinking woven itself into every aspect of the post-1989 world.Hayek＊s was a total worldview: a way of structuring all reality on the model of economic competition. He begins by assuming that nearly all (if not all) human activity is a form of economic calculation, and so can be assimilated to the master concepts of wealth, value, exchange, cost 每 and especially price. Prices are a means of allocating scarce resources efficiently, according to need and utility, as governed by supply and demand. For the price system to function efficiently, markets must be free and competitive. Ever since Smith imagined the economy as an autonomous sphere, the possibility existed that the market might not just be one piece of society, but society as a whole. Within such a society, men and women need only follow their own self-interest and compete for scarce rewards. Through competition, ※it becomes possible§, as the sociologist Will Davies , ※to discern who and what is valuable§.What any person acquainted with history sees as the necessary bulwarks against tyranny and exploitation 每 a thriving middle class and civil sphere; free institutions; universal suffrage; freedom of conscience, congregation, religion and press; a basic recognition that the individual is a bearer of dignity 每 held no special place in Hayek＊s thought. Hayek built into neoliberalism the assumption that the market provides all necessary protection against the one real political danger: totalitarianism. To prevent this, the state need only keep the market free.This last is what makes neoliberalism ※neo§. It is a crucial modification of the older belief in a free market and a minimal state, known as ※classical liberalism§. In classical liberalism, merchants simply asked the state to ※leave us alone§ 每 to . Neoliberalism recognised that the state must be active in the organisation of a market economy. The conditions allowing for a free market must be won politically, and the state must be re-engineered to support the free market on an ongoing basis.That isn＊t all: every aspect of democratic politics, from the choices of voters to the decisions of politicians, must be submitted to a purely economic analysis. The lawmaker is obliged to leave well enough alone 每 to not distort the natural actions of the marketplace 每 and so, ideally, the state provides a fixed, neutral, universal legal framework within which market forces operate spontaneously. The conscious direction of government is never preferable to the ※automatic mechanism of adjustment§ 每 ie the price system, which is not only efficient but maximises liberty, or the opportunity for men and women to make free choices about their own lives.As Keynes jetted between London and Washington, creating the postwar order, Hayek sat pouting in Cambridge. He had been sent there during the wartime evacuations; and he complained that he was surrounded by ※foreigners§ and ※no lack of orientals of all kinds§ and ※Europeans of practically all nationalities, but very few of real intelligence§.Stuck in England, without influence or respect, Hayek had only his idea to console him; an idea so grand it would one day dissolve the ground beneath the feet of Keynes and every other intellectual. Left to its own devices, the price system functions as a kind of mind. And not just any mind, but an omniscient one: the market computes what individuals cannot grasp. Reaching out to him as an intellectual comrade-in-arms, the American journalist Walter Lippmann wrote to Hayek, saying: ※No human mind has ever understood the whole scheme of a society ＃ At best a mind can understand its own version of the scheme, something much thinner, which bears to reality some such relation as a silhouette to a man.§It is a grand epistemological claim 每 that the market is a way of knowing, one that radically exceeds the capacity of any individual mind. Such a market is less a human contrivance, to be manipulated like any other, than a force to be studied and placated.  ceases to be a technique 每 as Keynes believed it to be 每 for achieving desirable social ends, such as growth or stable money. The only social end is the maintenance of the market itself. In its omniscience, the market constitutes the only legitimate form of knowledge, next to which all other modes of reflection are partial, in both senses of the word: they comprehend only a fragment of a whole and they plead on behalf of a special interest. Individually, our values are personal ones, or mere opinions; collectively, the market converts them into prices, or objective facts.After washing out at LSE, Hayek never held a permanent appointment that was not paid for by corporate sponsors. Even his conservative colleagues at the University of Chicago 每 the global epicentre of libertarian dissent in the 1950s 每 regarded Hayek as a reactionary mouthpiece, a ※stock rightwing man§ with a ※stock rightwing sponsor§, as one put it. As late as 1972, a friend could visit Hayek, now in Salzburg, only to find an elderly man prostrate with self-pity, believing his life＊s work was in vain. No one cared what he had written!There had, however, been hopeful signs: Hayek was ＊s favourite political philosopher and was said to be Ronald Reagan＊s, too. Then there was Margaret Thatcher. To anyone who would listen, Thatcher lionised Hayek, promising to bring together his free-market philosophy with a revival of Victorian values: family, community, hard work.Hayek met privately with Thatcher in 1975, at the very moment that she, having been named leader of the opposition in the UK, was preparing to bring his Big Idea off the shelf and into history. They huddled for 30 minutes on Lord North Street in London, at the Institute for Economic Affairs. Afterwards, Thatcher＊s staff anxiously asked Hayek what he had thought. What could he say? For the first time in 40 years, power was mirroring back to Friedrich von Hayek his own cherished self-image, a man who might vanquish Keynes and remake the world.He replied: ※She＊s so beautiful.§ayek＊s Big Idea isn＊t much of an idea 每 until you supersize it. Organic, spontaneous, elegant processes that, like a million fingers on a Ouija board, coordinate to create outcomes that are otherwise unplanned. Applied to an actual market 每 one for pork bellies or corn futures 每 this description is little more than a truism. It can be expanded to describe how various markets, in commodities and labour and even money itself, form that part of a society known as ※the economy§. This is less banal, but still inconsequential; a Keynesian accepts this description happily. But what if we bump it up one more step? What if we reconceive all of society as a kind of market?The more Hayek＊s idea expands, the more reactionary it gets, the more it hides behind its pretence of scientific neutrality 每 and the more it allows economics to link up with the major intellectual trend of the west since the 17th century. The rise of modern science generated a problem: if the world is universally obedient to natural laws, what does it mean to be human? Is a human being simply an object in the world, like any other? There appears to be no way to assimilate the subjective, interior human experience into nature as science conceives it 每 as something objective whose rules we discover by observation.Everything about the postwar political culture lay in favour of John Maynard Keynes, and an expanded role for the state in managing the economy. But everything about the postwar academic culture lay in favour of Hayek＊s Big Idea. Before the war, even the most rightwing economist thought of the market as a means to a limited end, to the efficient allocation of scarce resources. From the time of Adam Smith in the mid-1700s, and up to that of the founding members of the Chicago school in the postwar years, it was commonplace to believe that the ultimate ends of society and of life, were established in the non-economic sphere.On this view, questions of value are resolved politically and democratically, not economically 每 through moral reflection and public deliberation. The classic modern expression of this belief is found in a 1922 essay called Ethics and the Economic Interpretation by Frank Knight, who arrived at Chicago two decades before Hayek. ※The rational economic criticism of values gives results repugnant to common sense,§ Knight wrote. ※Economic man is the selfish, ruthless object of moral condemnation.§Economists had struggled for 200 years with the question of how to place the values on which an otherwise commercial society is organised beyond mere self-interest and calculation. Knight, along with his colleagues Henry Simons and Jacob Viner, were holdouts against Franklin D Roosevelt and the market interventions of the New Deal, and they established the University of Chicago as the intellectually rigorous home of free-market economics that it remains to this day. However, Simons, Viner and Knight all started their careers before the unrivalled prestige of atomic physicists drew enormous sums of money into the university system and kicked off a postwar vogue for ※hard§ science. They did not worship equations or models, and they worried about non-scientific questions. Most explicitly, they worried about questions of value, where value was absolutely distinct from price.It is not just that Simons, Viner and Knight were less dogmatic than Hayek, or more willing to pardon the state for taxing and spending. It is not the case that Hayek was their intellectual superior. But they acknowledged as a first principle that society was not the same thing as the market, and that price was not the same thing as value. This set them up to be swallowed whole by history.It was Hayek who showed us how to get from the hopeless condition of human partiality to the majestic objectivity of science. Hayek＊s Big Idea acts as the missing link between our subjective human nature, and nature itself. In so doing, it puts any value that cannot be expressed as a price 每 as the verdict of a market 每 on an equally unsure footing, as nothing more than opinion, preference, folklore or superstition.More than anyone, even Hayek himself, it was the great postwar Chicago economist Milton Friedman who helped convert governments and politicians to the power of Hayek＊s Big Idea. But first he broke with two centuries of precedent and declared that economics is ※in principle independent of any particular ethical position or normative judgments§ and is ※an ＆objective＊ science, in precisely the same sense as any of the physical sciences§. Values of the old, mental, normative kind were defective, they were ※differences about which men can ultimately only fight§. There is the market, in other words, and there is relativism.arkets may be human facsimiles of natural systems, and like the universe itself, they may be authorless and valueless. But the application of Hayek＊s Big Idea to every aspect of our lives negates what is most distinctive about us. That is, it assigns what is most human about human beings 每 our minds and our volition 每 to algorithms and markets, leaving us to mimic, zombie-like, the shrunken idealisations of economic models. Supersizing Hayek＊s idea and radically upgrading the price system into a kind of social omniscience means radically downgrading the importance of our individual capacity to reason 每 our ability to provide and evaluate justifications for our actions and beliefs.As a result, the public sphere 每 the space where we offer up reasons, and contest the reasons of others 每 ceases to be a space for deliberation, and becomes a market in clicks, likes and retweets. The internet is personal preference magnified by algorithm; a pseudo-public space that echoes the voice already inside our head. Rather than a space of debate in which we make our way, as a society, toward consensus, now there is a mutual-affirmation apparatus banally referred to as a ※marketplace of ideas§. What looks like something public and lucid is only an extension of our own pre-existing opinions, prejudices and beliefs, while the authority of institutions and experts has been displaced by the aggregative logic of big data. When we access the world through a search engine, its results are ranked, as the founder of Google puts it, ※recursively§ 每 by an infinity of individual users functioning as a market, continuously and in real time.The awesome utilities of digital technology aside, an earlier and more humanist tradition, which was dominant for centuries, had always distinguished between our tastes and preferences 每 the desires that find expression in the market 每 and our capacity for reflection on those preferences, which allows us to form and express values.※A taste is almost defined as a preference about which you do not argue,§ the philosopher and economist Albert O Hirschman once wrote. ※A taste about which you argue, with others or yourself, ceases ipso facto being a taste 每 it turns into a value.§Hirschman drew a distinction between that part of one＊s self that is a consumer, and that part of one＊s self that is a supplier of reasons. The market reflects what Hirschman called the preferences that are ※revealed by agents as they buy goods and services§. But, as he puts it, men and women also ※have the ability to step back from their ＆revealed＊ wants, volition and preferences, to ask themselves whether they really want these wants and prefer these preferences§. We fashion our selves and identities on the basis of this capacity for reflection. The use of one＊s individual reflective powers is reason; the collective use of these reflective powers is public reason; the use of public reason to make law and policy is democracy. When we provide reasons for our actions and beliefs, we bring ourselves into being: individually and collectively, we decide who and what we are.According to the logic of Hayek＊s Big Idea, these expressions of human subjectivity are meaningless without ratification by the market 每 as Friedman said, they are nothing but relativism, each as good as any other. When the only objective truth is determined by the market, all other values have the status of mere opinions; everything else is relativist hot air. But Friedman＊s ※relativism§ is a charge that can be thrown at any claim based on human reason. It is a nonsense insult, as all humanistic pursuits are ※relative§ in a way the sciences are not. They are relative to the (private) condition of having a mind, and the (public) need to reason and understand even when we can＊t expect scientific proof. When our debates are no longer resolved by deliberation over reasons, then the whimsies of power will determine the outcome.This is where the triumph of neoliberalism meets the political nightmare we are living through now. ※You had one job,§ the old joke goes, and Hayek＊s grand project, as originally conceived in 30s and 40s, was explicitly designed to prevent a backslide into political chaos and fascism. But the Big Idea was always this abomination waiting to happen. It was, from the beginning, pregnant with the thing it was said to protect against. Society reconceived as a giant market leads to a public life lost to bickering over mere opinions; until the public turns, finally, in frustration to a strongman as a last resort for solving its otherwise intractable problems.n 1989, an American reporterknocked on the 90-year-old Hayek＊s door. He was living in Freiburg, West Germany, in a third-floor apartment in a stucco house on Urachstrasse. The two men sat in a sunroom whose windows looked out on the mountains, and Hayek, who was recovering from pneumonia, pulled a blanket over his legs as they spoke.This was no longer the man who had once wallowed in his own defeat at the hands of Keynes. Thatcher had just written to Hayek in a tone of millennial triumph. None of what she and Reagan had accomplished ※would have been possible without the values and beliefs to set us on the right road and provide the right sense of direction§. Hayek was now cheerful on his own account, and optimistic about the future of capitalism. As the journalist wrote, ※In particular, Hayek sees a greater appreciation for the market among the younger generation. Today unemployed youth in Algiers and Rangoon riot not for centrally planned welfare state but for opportunity: the freedom to buy and sell 每 jeans, cars, whatever 每 at whatever prices the market will bear.§Thirty years on, and it can fairly be said that Hayek＊s victory is unrivalled. We live in a paradise built by his Big Idea. The more closely the world can be made to resemble an ideal market governed only by perfect competition, the more law-like and ※scientific§ human behaviour, in the aggregate, becomes. Every day we ourselves 每 no one has to tell us to anymore! 每 strive to become more perfectly like scattered, discrete, anonymous buyers and sellers; and every day we treat the residual desire to be something more than a consumer as nostalgia, or elitism.What began as a new form of intellectual authority, rooted in a devoutly apolitical worldview, nudged easily into an ultra-reactionary politics. What can＊t be quantified must not be real, says the economist, and how do you measure the benefits of the core faiths of the enlightenment 每 namely, critical reasoning, personal autonomy and democratic self-government? When we abandoned, for its embarrassing residue of subjectivity, reason as a form of truth, and made science the sole arbiter of both the real and the true, we created a void that pseudo-science was happy to fill.The authority of the professor, the reformer, the legislator or the jurist does not derive from the market, but from humanistic values such as public spiritedness, conscience or the longing for justice. Long before the Trump administration started demeaning them, such figures had been drained of salience by an explanatory scheme that can＊t explain them. Surely there is a connection between their growing irrelevance and the election of Trump, a creature of pure whim, a man without the principles or conviction to make for a coherent self. A man without a mind, who represents the total absence of reason, is running the world; or at least ruining it. As a Manhattan real estate wiseguy, though, Trump, hey 每 he knows what he knows: that his sins have yet to be punished in the marketplace.

"Britain＊s consumers are taking a more cautious approach to shopping as higher inflation above the level of earnings eats into their spending power.Only higher spending on food in supermarkets kept retail sales growing last month, with declines in all other main sectors, according to figures published on Thursday by the  (ONS). Growth in retail sales volumes was static at 0.3% in July after the ONS revised the figure for June down to the same level, although the result still beat analysts＊ expectations for a rise of 0.2%.Some economists blamed wet weather in July for weaker sales by fashion retailers, after sunnier conditions in June brought shoppers out in force.Strong food sales in stores at 1.5%, up from 1.1% a month earlier, helped offset a decline elsewhere, said Ole Black, an ONS senior statistician. ※While the overall growth is the same as in June, trends in growth in different sectors are proving quite volatile,§ he said.The annual rate of sales volume growth was 1.3% in July, down from 2.8% in June and considerably lower than the higher rates towards the end of 2016. High street stores selling clothing and footwear were among the hardest hit, experiencing a fall of 0.5% in July compared with a month earlier. However, consumers spent more online, according to the data, helping sales to increase by 15.1% year-on-year and by 0.3% month-on-month, accounting for approximately 16% of all retail spending.B&Q and Screwfix owner, Kingfisher, Europe＊s largest home improvement retailer, reported on Thursday that , driven by a 10.7% decline in the sale of seasonal goods such as barbecues and garden furniture at B&Q, following a strong first quarter boosted by better weather.Wet weather in July also affected fashion sales, with worse conditions possibly on the horizon for retailers, said Keith Richardson of Lloyds Bank. ※It＊s hard to escape the feeling that there may be dark clouds on the way,§ he said.Although spending was higher at the supermarket checkout, prices have been rising while the phenomenon known as ※shrinkflation§ has cut the size of many products for consumers, maintaing profits for producers. But the cost of food could continue to rise further, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, which estimates pork meat and rice commodity prices rose by 21% and 11% respectively between May and June alone. Supermarkets have been tempting shoppers to keep spending, or encouraging them to switch brands for own-label products, according to Richardson. ※Despite consumers finding their purses a little lighter each month, the supermarkets continue to find ways to help shoppers adapt their spending rather than rein it in,§ he said.The figures come as the economy shows greater signs of resilience than expected, with the UK recording its  since the mid 1970s. Inflation , thanks to falling fuel prices, alleviating some of the  at a time when households are facing uncertainty from Brexit. However,  by 3.6% from next year, after July＊s retail price index came in higher than expected on Tuesday, leading the government to prepare the steepest hike in average ticket prices for five years. The number of people cutting down on household spending is at the highest level for two years, as more than half of Britons said they looked to lower expenditure in the second quarter of 2017, according to Nielsen＊s latest Global Survey of Consumer Confidence and Spending Intentions. The market research firm found consumer confidence has fallen sharply since the EU referendum, with the UK slipping from the second most confident country in Europe, behind only Denmark, to ninth place.The drop in retail sales adds to mounting problems for many small businesses that depend on consumers to stay afloat, at a time of rising production costs with higher levels of inflation, according to Mike Cherry, national chair at the Federation of Small Businesses. ※Small business owners are paying themselves less, struggling to award pay rises and pushing up prices in an attempt to absorb increased outgoings. This threatens to further stifle already reduced consumer spending power,§ he said.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the retail sales figures showed continuing consumer caution amid squeezed purchasing power and weakened confidence. ※The squeeze on consumers remains appreciable, despite easing marginally from May＊s peak,§ he said."															
"he United Kingdom＊s withdrawal from the  no doubt carries many risks. But, if British politicians and business leaders are right, it also creates an important opportunity: the possibility of building a safer, greener, more efficient, and more innovative farming sector. If the UK manages to seize this opportunity, the EU, the United States and other economies with highly protected agricultural sectors might follow suit.As it stands, large parts of UK agriculture are locked into the EU＊s common agricultural policy, which is accused of driving the sector toward larger, more industrial and  practices, including by failing to support farm diversity and . A 2005  found that the ?3bn ($3.9bn) in subsidies that the UK receives from the CAP went largely to major agribusiness and food-manufacturing companies, such as Nestl谷, Cadbury, and Kraft. Once freed from the flawed CAP, Brexit＊s proponents argue, the UK will be able to build a more competitive agricultural sector that better serves farmers and agricultural workers, including by reducing dependence on distorting subsidies. And they could be right. In New Zealand, the abolition of subsidies in 1984 helped to catalyse innovation and diversification in the agricultural sector, which today drives New Zealand＊s economic growth.It should be noted, however, that New Zealand＊s agricultural sector had decades of experience surviving without subsidies. Indeed, those that were abolished in 1984 had been created in the 1970s as a short-term solution to new challenges to the sector. In the UK, by contrast, subsidies are deeply entrenched and flow to powerful wealthy supporters of the current government. This may explain why the government＊s  strategy proposes sustaining subsidies, to be paid for directly from the British public purse.To be sure, the abolition of subsidies was only one element of New Zealand＊s agricultural transformation. Equally important was the effort made by the country＊s leaders to secure access to growing markets in the Middle East, Japan and subsequently China, which is now New Zealand＊s largest export market, accounting for . For the UK, again the situation is different. New Zealand is a huge net agricultural exporter, producing, for example, 98% more lamb and mutton than its population consumes. For New Zealand, therefore, finding new export markets was a matter of life and death. Britain, by contrast, is a , buying 46% of its food from other countries, including 27% from the EU.Free-trade agreements are as important to the UK＊s effort to ensure its agricultural sector＊s competitiveness as they were to New Zealand. But the primary objective must not be to ensure that British agricultural exports are competitive. Rather, Britain must ensure that foreign imports do not overwhelm its own agricultural objectives. In short, the existential challenge facing farmers lies within Britain＊s own borders.Of course, UK farmers will face increased hardship from losing the EU market, which accounts for more than half of what they export. Blocking EU migrants from the UK would also hurt farmers, given that . But the most pressing goal must be for Britain to decide what kinds of farms and food it wants to develop, and then to protect their interests in its deals with the world＊s major exporters, with which it is attempting to conclude free-trade agreements. This includes the US, which is already seeking approval for its farmers to sell chlorine-washed chicken in the UK.Yet the likelihood that British trade negotiators will secure favourable terms for domestic farmers is low. Almost every country in the world 每 especially the US 每 has well-organised and influential agricultural industries that are highly skilled at pushing their governments to secure advantages for them in new trade deals.Moreover, unlike New Zealand＊s negotiators, who always placed agriculture at the top of the agenda, UK negotiators are poorly placed to ensure that free-trade agreements protect domestic farmers. They are, after all, representing a services-driven economy, in which agriculture is not a major engine of growth.As a result, far from protecting national agricultural objectives, new free-trade agreements are likely to bring increases in cheap food imports.  that a post-Brexit UK is likely to see its imports of beef, poultry, butter and milk powder increase.Given the current state of British agriculture, it will be very difficult for UK farmers to compete with such imports. Many farmers are suffering a longstanding crisis in farm incomes. Young people are fleeing the countryside; the average age of a British farmer is now 59. And the average British farm is 41 hectares, compared with New Zealand＊s 250-hectare farms.If agriculture is to be transformed into a safer, greener, fairer element of Britain＊s post-Brexit economy, UK policymakers will need to change their approach radically. For starters,  to protect the rural environment, ensure animal welfare, and improve education, knowledge transfer and business training for farmers and agricultural workers.British policymakers must also move beyond ad hocresponses to natural and man-made disasters, by building more effective and reliable protection systems. For example, they could facilitate the provision of affordable insurance for farmers or create some type of mutual-assistance scheme. Implementing (and funding) such initiatives will require sustained political will.The UK must also ensure that its agricultural sector can take advantage of new technologies. Here, too, New Zealand provides a helpful example, with its  focused on bringing together the public and private sectors to identify high-value-added opportunities and investments in research and technology. Agriculture-focused universities have also aided in the development and deployment of efficiency-enhancing sensors, crop yield monitors, satellite imagery, and smart farming hardware and software systems.Michael Gove, a leading Brexiteer and now secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, has  Brexit as ※a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reform how we care for our land, our rivers and our seas, how we recast our ambition for our country＊s environment and the planet.§ That is all well and good, but it is not yet reflected in policy. The task ahead is to see that it is."															
															
"I was very sorry to learn that Jeremy Bullmore＊s workplace advice column (, 1 July) is coming to an end. Anyone who wants to understand what it is like to work in a late-capitalist, neoliberal world, and why British productivity is so poor, could do worse than read the endless complaints of frustrated careers and incompetent management that he has handled with such gentle wisdom. Perhaps his columns should be donated to a leading business school as a research archive? I wanted to thank Jeremy Bullmore for 12 years of his insightful column. It has been a valuable resource for me in understanding the world of work, and the personalities found within it. His guidance has frequently helped me achieve perspective when I read about someone in a similar situation to me, and reassured me that some problems are universal.The three scenarios he signed off with were spot-on; I can relate to each one he describes. These experiences are what spurred me on last year to become a workplace union rep, and speak up for others going through similar situations. Having the courage to call out bullying behaviour is the hardest thing to do at dark times, but it is the only way to come through the other side stronger.Workplaces can sometimes be a bear-pit, but Jeremy＊s column has been an inspiration, and I have kept his ※few last thoughts§ paragraphs as a starting point to resolve problems at work. All the best JB, we＊ll miss you."															
"Britain may need to have a national debate on university tuition fees, Theresa May＊s most senior minister has said after urging the Tories to modernise to win over young metropolitan voters who backed Jeremy Corbyn＊s Labour.  said the current system, with fees capped at ?9,250 a year, allows UK universities to deliver high quality courses and teaching, and accounts for the country＊s disproportionate number of top institutions.But the first secretary of state acknowledged that student debt is a ※huge issue§, particularly after Labour unexpectedly eroded the Conservatives＊ Commons majority in the general election after . In a speech to the Bright Blue thinktank in central London on Saturday, Green urged the Tories to ※change hard§ to woo young, educated voters who backed Labour on 8 June. Answering questions afterwards, he said the only way to bring down tuition fees while maintaining standards would be to raise taxes, but he acknowledged that could be the subject of a national conversation. Asked about his message for students who backed Labour and are angry about being, Green said: ※I think this is clearly a huge issue. I think in the long term we＊ve got to show that they are getting value for the money. ※If we want to have 40%-plus of people going to university and if we want those university courses actually to be valuable, which I think is where the strain is often taken in European universities 每 you actually look at the teaching that you get in some European universities, you have lecture halls with 600 people in and things like that 每 it＊s not actually as good a teaching and learning experience as you get in this country.§ He added: ※If you wanted to say you want to reduce [fees] then either fewer people go to university or the experience would be less. Because the only other way you can get extra money to go in, if you wanted the same number of people, the same kind of teaching, would be to take it from working people through their taxes ＃ it may well be that this is a national debate that we need to have.§In a wide-ranging speech that will be seen as closely linked to May＊s plans for government, Green appeared to criticise part of former PM David Cameron＊s approach to modernisation, suggesting it was not necessarily about ※hugging huskies, cuddling hoodie-wearing teenagers and PR stunts§. He did praise Cameron as a moderniser later in the speech.Green acknowledged mistakes had been made during the general election campaign, describing discussions around the party＊s social care policy, dubbed a ※dementia tax§ by critics, as ※less than ideal§. And he said the Tories must now adapt to the changed political landscape or risk doing ※serious long-term damage§ to their electoral prospects. Green said: ※In that classic Daily Telegraph slogan: Times Change, Values Don＊t.  believe in free markets, individual liberty, a helping but not all-powerful state, strong defence and our traditional institutions as strongly as ever.※But realistic Conservatives recognise that we need constant reform to defend those values. Fighting yesterday＊s battles is a recipe for irrelevance. Tory reform is the route to a successful party, and more importantly a successful country.§ Green said the reason the Tories lost their majority in the June vote was because the party was 30 percentage points behind anti-austerity Labour among 18- to 35-year-olds. But while acknowledging a need to tackle increasing hostility to capitalism, Green said the Tories would stick to their deficit reduction plan. He said: ※It is an inconvenient fact, all but ignored by the opposition, that the deficit is still far too high, so I am pleased we have renewed our commitment to restore the public finances by sticking to the fiscal rules announced by the chancellor in the autumn statement, which will guide us to a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade.§However, Green said the Tories must provide answers to growing anti-austerity feelings that go beyond populism, highlighting plans to build 1.5m homes by 2022, devolve power and money locally through metro mayors and city deals, and an industrial strategy focused on new technology to give young people hope of a good job.Green said: ※The discontent with capitalism since the 2008 crash, which is vaguely expressed as being anti-austerity, needs to be tackled head-on.※If young people feel the world is not giving them an even break, they look for radical change, even if what is being promised, by populists on the left or right, is just a better yesterday. Ukip hankers after the 1950s, Corbyn＊s Labour the 1970s, with both hoping that nobody under 40 reads a history book and sees the glaring faults in those eras.§"															
"The consumer-driven momentum that has kept the British economy afloat since the Brexit vote is declining rapidly, with new data showing households in the grip of the most protracted squeeze on living standards since the economic crisis of the mid-1970s.Against a backdrop of rising prices and stagnant wage growth, incomes adjusted for inflation have now fallen for three successive quarters, the first time this has occurred since the International Monetary Fund had to bail Britain out in 1976.At the same time, the amount being set aside as savings has now slipped to just 1.7% of disposable income 每 the lowest level on record, and a fraction of the near-10% average for the last 50 years. Just a year ago, it was more than three times the current rate.The new data from the Office for National Statistics shows that in the first three months of 2017, the mounting financial pressure on consumers brought the UK＊s strong performance following last summer＊s Brexit vote to an abrupt halt.On Thursday, separate figures showed an unexpected jump in consumer credit. Households borrowed an extra ?1.7bn in May - ?300m more than had been expected 每 on credit cards, personal loans and car finance. A survey of consumer confidence also showed a steep decline.Despite saving less and borrowing more, consumers still reined in their spending, contributing to economic growth confirmed today at just 0.2% 每 the lowest of any of the major G7 industrial nations.Spending in the shops, new car sales and property transactions have all showed signs of weakness, and the Bank of England has expressed concern about rising levels of consumer debt.Monthly health checks on manufacturing, construction and services due next week will be scrutinised for signs that the hung parliament is now having an impact on business confidence, but the ONS figures show that the economy was already fragile when Theresa May called the general election.Real household income in the UK 每 a measure of spending power adjusted for movements in prices 每 fell by 1.4% in the first three months of 2017, following falls of 0.3% in the third quarter of 2016 and 0.4% in the fourth quarter.The only recent parallel for such a prolonged squeeze occurred four decades ago, when a combination of a sterling crisis, pay restraint and public spending cuts agreed with the IMF resulted in real household income falling by around 6% between the fourth quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1977.In the City, the pound fell back below $1.30 amid speculation that the Bank of England would be wary of adding to consumer pain by raising interest rates.Sterling had been edging higher after remarks by Threadneedle Street＊s governor, Mark Carney, were seen as a hint that the first increase in interest rates in a decade would soon be announced. 每 a measure of how much money individuals are putting away for retirement or a rainy day out of their disposable income 每 fell below 2% for the first time. But it added that, despite the fall in the savings ratio, individuals also spent less in the shops and on going out, contributing to the sharp slowdown in the UK economy, from 0.7% growth in the final quarter of 2016.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at City data group IHS/Markit, said: ※The main drag seems to have come from weaker household spending growth, which dropped from 0.7% late last year ＃ which can in turn be at least partly linked to a third consecutive quarterly fall in real household disposable income 每 its worst run since the 1970s, according to official statisticians.§ Frances O＊Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: ※These figures make for grim reading. People raiding their piggy banks is bad news for working people and the economy. But with wages falling as living costs rise, many families are having to run down their savings or rely on credit cards and loans to get through the month.§The also fell deeper into the red in early 2017 as the trade gap in goods widened and the surplus in services widened.The one bright spot for the government from a downbeat set of economic statistics was news of a . With services accounting for 79% of the economy, this raised the prospect of GDP growing in the second quarter. Darren Morgan, ONS head of GDP, said growth in the first quarter of 2017 was driven by business services and construction, with declines in some consumer-focused industries, such as shops and hotels. ※The saving ratio has fallen again this quarter to a new record low, partly as a result of higher tax payments reducing disposable income. Some of the fall could be as a result of the timing of those payments, but the underlying trend is for a continued fall in the saving ratio.§The balance of payments 每 which measures trade flows, income from investment, and payments to international bodies such as the EU 每 was in deficit by ?16.9bn in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from ?12.1bn in the previous three months. The ONS said the UK＊s poor trade performance wiped 0.8 percentage points from growth in the first quarter.Some deterioration had been expected in the City after the sharp narrowing of the deficit in late 2016, and analysts said the fall in the value of sterling 每 which makes exports cheaper and imports dearer 每 should help the balance of payments.

"Britain＊s poorest families, he says, are being hardest hit by the rising prices of essentials like food and fuel, and action to prevent  becoming entrenched must therefore be a priority.Haldane has met dozens of people this week who said they were struggling to cope with the rising cost of living. He heard of parents stopping their children from going on school trips in order to divert the money towards increasingly expensive basic supplies. He heard about increasing numbers of loan sharks setting up shop and about people who scour supermarkets to save a few pennies on a loaf of bread. In fact, he heard dozens of similar stories during roundtable events in Cardiff, Barry and Porth, in the Welsh valleys.※Prices in the shops have , particularly for some essentials like food and fuel,§ said Haldane. ※Adjusting for inflation, most people＊s pay is probably falling rather than going up and that is causing a particular pinch for people further down the income spectrum.§The economist, who sits on the Bank＊s monetary policy committee that decides when interest rates will have to be raised to put a lid on inflation, said it is important to remember that rising prices have the biggest impact on the poorest.※It hits hardest those on the lowest incomes and those whose incomes are fixed in money terms, for example those on benefits or on amounts close to the minimum wage.§In a clear hint that a rise in interest rates could be looming, he added: ※The reason we absolutely are sitting up and paying attention now to rises in the cost of living 每 inflation is up to almost 3% 每 is not just because that is in breach of our target but because that is having big and serious consequences for those on the lowest incomes in society and that came across loud and clear today.§The Bank of England economist＊s day trip to Wales marked the start of a series of visits, in collaboration with , that aims to expand the Bank＊s previous outreach programme with business figures to ordinary people, including those on low incomes or benefits and the self-employed.The eventual aim is for Haldane and other senior colleagues from Threadneedle Street to visit every county in the country 每 and to feed back what they are told into ※deliberations on monetary policy and interest rates§. Haldane is clear about what he is hearing: ※First and foremost we need to set our interest rate policy to prevent those higher inflation rates becoming entrenched.§His comments came after Haldane hinted that he considered  at this month＊s meeting of the MPC. The eventual vote was at their record low of 0.25% 每 the stance that Carney backed 每 but the result was closer than had been expected and Haldane has now made it clear he could soon change sides. .Just 24 hours after Carney said the state of the economy and the uncertainty caused by Brexit meant  should not change, the chief economist said they should go up before the end of the year.He used a speech to say the balance of risks had shifted so that the dangers of moving too late on interest rates outweighed those of raising them too soon. On Wednesday, when Haldane was in Wales,  that continued growth would eventually lead to higher rates.Back in , some of those who turned out to speak to the Bank＊s top economist expressed their worries about rising mortgage rates. But a larger number of people, many of whom were not homeowners, stressed the problems caused by spiralling prices.At a community centre in Ely in western Cardiff 每 on the edge of Wales＊s largest housing estate 每 53-year-old Tracy described shopping around in order to try to save 10 pence on a loaf of bread. ※People are going without fuel, gas and electric, food,§ she said.When Haldane asked her whether people were ※scrimping or saving or trying to borrow§ to deal with their situations, she claimed that loan sharks were on the rise.Gloria, 82, said she was worried about energy bills hitting older people who struggled to switch to cheaper providers. She had brought with her a letter from an energy supplier outlining a 6% increase in gas prices, 11.1% for electricity, and 8.5% for those on a dual fuel deal. Three sixth-formers said they feared university loans, and two 25-year-old graduates said friends had left the area because of .Alan, who was approaching retirement, said that he had been involved with research that had revealed people＊s ※coping strategies§.※First there is multiple debt, with people who have exhausted all avenues turning to illegal sources.

I never thought I＊d be a government statistic but I am now a ＆jam＊,§ she said 每 referring to Theresa May＊s ※just about managing§ group.※We have nothing left. People are not spending in shops.

She blamed ※stagnating wages§, saying people were talking about having to choose between heating or eating.Speaking afterwards, Haldane said the phrase of ※self-imposed austerity§ had stuck with him. It was, he said ※people cutting back on investing in themselves or in their family. That was a worrying thing to hear. How generalised that is it is tough to know but ... that will be a big point for me to take away and reflect on.§ "															
"The sale of Arrium and its troubled Whyalla steelworks is expected to be delayed today while the federal government finalises a deal that would give one of the bidders up to $400m in taxpayers＊ funds. The  hangs in the balance as administrators finalise a deal to sell off the company. There are currently two offers made for Arrium, but only one is set to receive direct financial assistance from the federal government. That bid is from a Korean private equity firm, led by Newlake Alliance and JB Asset Management, and backed by technology from steelmaking giant Posco. The Korean bid is understood to have asked for $400m in federal funding, on top of about $50m offered by the South Australian government to whoever buys the company. The Korean bid is the preferred offer and is overwhelmingly backed by the creditors＊ committee, which includes the big four banks: Commonwealth, ANZ, Westpac and NAB. But a second bidder, UK commodity traders Liberty House Group, has offered to buy Arrium and keep Whyalla operational without any federal funding assistance.Liberty has only asked for a loan guarantee from the federal government and made a revised offer this month, but has been largely left out of ongoing talks since the Korean firm was named the preferred bidder on 15 June. A source close to the negotiations said the deal to sell Arrium was due to be made today, but the administrators, KordaMentha, had agreed to an extension after representations were made by the federal government. The source said the Korean firm was still preferred. ※Clearly, the government wanted a bit more time, by the look of it. It＊s no big deal, things are pretty close,§ the source said. ※It＊s a lot of money from the government, and if they want more time, it doesn＊t particularly faze anyone.§ Former industry minister  travelled to Korea late last year to meet with Posco about the Arrium sale. He was joined by the South Australian treasurer, Tom Koutsantonis, and the then Australian Workers＊ Union national secretary, Scott McDine. Hunt described the negotiations as positive.※We stood together and made it clear that we are determined to work with any potential buyer for the steelworks to support the workers of Arrium and the Port Pirie community,§ Hunt said.AWU has been lobbying privately and publicly in support of the Korean bid, which it says is superior. The union says it involves a $1.4bn investment in the Whyalla steelworks and gives it another 30-year lifespan. The Korean bid relies on the use of a Posco technology, known as Finex, which removes the need for a blast furnace and is said to lower emissions.The bid also relies on the installation of a new 220MW gas-fired power plant, which it says will support the South Australian electricity grid.A spokesman for the industry minister, , said the sale of Arrium was a matter for the administrator, KordaMentha."															
"Britain＊s hard-pressed consumers are increasingly turning to credit cards, overdrafts and loans to support their spending, according to the .Threadneedle Street＊s found that the outstanding amount of unsecured consumer credit rose by 10.3% in the year to May, five times as fast as the growth rate of earnings.The size of the increase is likely to add to the Bank＊s concerns  about the precarious financial position of many individuals, and led some City analysts to speculate that it would encourage Threadneedle Street to try to rein in consumer borrowing with an increase in interest rates.With the City detecting that the Bank is edging closer to its first increase in borrowing costs since the start of the financial crisis a decade ago, sterling briefly rose above $1.30 on the foreign exchanges to its highest level since the general election three weeks ago.The data came as Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said his organisation wanted to find out what was happening in the car loan market, a crucial component of the consumer credit sector. Annual growth in car financing has been averaging 20% since 2012.Bailey said he had held discussions with the US authorities about car loans, because the UK market may bare some of the hallmarks of the business model used for selling vehicles on the other side of the Atlantic.Speaking in London, Bailey said: ※What＊s going on here? Does it mean there are more cars or the form of financing has changed? I think it＊s something to do with the latter rather than the former,§ he said.Bailey said his hunch was that the market had undergone a structural change. ※It has become more like the US, more of a secured finance market than it was in the past,§ he said.Regulators need to know if consumers will prioritise paying back a car loan before other forms of unsecured lending, such as credit cards or personal loans.The FCA is concerned about a lack of transparency, potential conflicts of interest and irresponsible lending in the motor finance industry and after its review will decide whether it needs to take action to curtail the explosive growth.Most of the growth has been fuelled by personal contract plans, which can start at less than ?100 a month and with only a ?100 deposit. Buyers never actually purchase the car, but make payments to cover the depreciation on a vehicle between driving it out of the showroom and handing it back, usually three years later.Data released by the Bank provided evidence of a slowdown in the housing market, with lending secured against a home rising by 2.9% to ?1.338tn in the 12 months to May.Unsecured consumer credit continued to grow strongly and rose by ?1.7bn during May alone, faster than its average of ?1.5bn in the previous six months.Credit card borrowing is growing at an annual rate of 9.1% while other loans and advances rose by 10.9%.Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ※It may be that the heightened squeeze on consumer purchasing power is increasing the need for some consumers to borrow.※The Bank of England will be far from happy with the May consumer credit data, and it could bolster the case for a near-term interest rate hike to try to curb consumers＊ readiness to borrow.§The latest income tracker from the supermarket chain Asda found that the spending power of UK households had fallen by 1.9% over the past year, the sharpest decline in four years.Asda said families had average discretionary income of ?194 in May, ?4 a week lower than in the same month last year. Families with the lowest incomes saw the biggest reduction in disposable income.Living standards have been squeezed in recent months because the fall in the value of sterling since last year＊s EU referendum, which has pushed annual . Ruth Gregory, the UK economist at Capital , said the Bank of England＊s data suggested that households remained confident enough to increase borrowing to help smooth consumption in the face of the squeeze on their real incomes.※Of course, this will do nothing to allay policymakers＊ concerns about the recent rapid increases in unsecured lending and strengthens the case for the financialpolicy committee to act to address this issue at its next meeting in September,§ she said."															
															
"t was billed as the first big Brexit battle for the City of London. Would , which is what former French president Fran?ois Hollande wanted when he said ※those who seek the end of Europe§ needed to be taught ※a lesson§? Or would the European commission take the grown-up view that, actually, forcing all this financial activity to take place within the borders of the EU would do more harm than good, even for the EU itself?The answer 每 as with most things Brexit-related 每 is messy. The keenly awaited report from the commission booted the important decisions into the long grass of technical assessments. Yet the commission has also retained the nuclear option of enforced relocation for clearing houses, bodies that stand between two parties to a financial trade, when they＊re dealing in euro-denominated derivatives.That will alarm , and especially the Treasury. Not even the US, where protectionist tendencies are rarely far from the surface, insists upon dollar-related derivative trades being cleared in its own back yard.On a cheerful reading for the City, one might say that nothing has been settled immediately. London has avoided an upright Hollande-style land grab. The commission is formally open to the idea that enhanced supervision by the European Securities and Markets Authority could do the job of ensuring the EU can protect itself against market instability.Yet the proposal also clears the way for that same body to insist that clearing houses move their euro business to the EU in some circumstances. The idea almost seems to be framed with London in mind. The proposed two-tier system actually contains three tiers, with the highest category of ※substantially systemically important§ seemingly reserved for LCH, the London Stock Exchange＊s big clearing house in London. LCH currently clears about three-quarters of interest rate swaps denominated in euros.A judgment that LCH is big and important is not contentious. But the idea that safety would be improved by peeling off parts of the business, and forcing them into the EU, makes no sense. Such a manoeuvre would probably create more risks, not fewer. Smaller pools of capital are less able to absorb shocks when one party to a trade defaults. Regulators have to work harder to police activity. Costs would increase for everybody, including businesses across .The correct way forward here would be for the EU to give itself whatever powers of supervision it wants over euro-denominated clearing. It＊s not hard to do, and it＊s how the US operates. The entire thrust of international regulation since the financial crisis has been to improve transparency and LCH already dances to the tune of many different regulators. Clearing houses, or central counter parties, are now one the most tightly regulated parts of the financial system.But none of those international regulators has ever insisted on enforced relocation of clearing. , by rights, should not change that approach. Brussels, one fears, is playing hardball games even before negotiations have even started. If your share price has fallen as far and as fast as Capita＊s, the definition of success is avoiding fresh calamities.  did the trick. The outsourcing firm continues to expect profits to improve in the second half. Its win rate on contracts has returned to one-in-two, as opposed to last year＊s one-in-three. And the promised cost savings are arriving. The shares rose 15% to 634p.That＊s a long way from the ?10.50 of a year ago, before the first of two hefty profits warnings related to overspending on the London congestion charge contract and failure to spot the rot in the now-sold recruitment business. But it should encourage the idea that  requires less surgery than sprawling rival Serco did.The risk of a rights issue could soon be zero. Net debt was ?1.8bn at the last count but, if the sales of the asset services division fetches the rumoured ?700m, the proceeds would return Capita＊s balance sheet to the land of the normal. At the point, the ambition to protect the dividend, currently offering a 5% yield, would be more than credible. The divi costs ?200m a year, and Capita still managed to generate ?400m of cash in its rotten 2016.Chief executive Andy Parker was obliged to fall on his sword in March. It wasn＊t unexpected since Capita has had two profits warnings in 25 years and both were on his watch. But, as matters look today, he＊s not handing over a basket-case."

"n 2009, shortly after the global markets had suffered their worst crisis for 90 years, Alexis Stenfors was working as a currency trader for Merrill Lynch in London. With 15 years＊ experience, he was good at his job and he prided himself on his ability to read the markets. His view was that the whole financial system was going to go ※belly up§. That was what he was betting on.And boy did he bet. He took increasingly extreme positions and when they failed to return dividends, he covered up losses in his trading books that he estimated to be around $100m (?78m). Then he went on holiday to India. Stenfors didn＊t realise it at the time, but it was the end of his career as a trader, and the beginning of his notoriety as a rogue trader. Merrill Lynch later announced that his actions had resulted in the loss of $456m (?356m).He lost his job, the media left his reputation in tatters and he was banned from the City for five years. Now he has written , a book about his experiences. Or rather, he has written a book that touches on his experience, but is rather more concerned with institutional wrongdoing, such as the . It＊s a strange confession-cum-critique in which the author still seems unable to explain his own role.One chapter, quoting the question that has often been put to him, is titled: ※Why did you do it?§ At the end of it, having not said much about his motivations, he writes that, despite seeing a psychiatrist for two years: ※I am not sure if I have come any closer to a definitive answer to the question.§When discussing banking flaws he can be authoritative, but about himself he appears detached, incurious, even alienated. Yet the man I meet at , is far more open than his prose.Stenfors is originally from Finland, part of the small Swedish-speaking minority. He says that this made him feel different to the crowd. As a young boy, he developed a fascination with foreign currencies, collecting coins and making lists of their value. It was an interest, he says, that led him to go into banking, working as an intern at Dresdner bank in Germany in the early 90s. And it would lead him to London, on to Japan and then back to London again, the scene of his downfall.He once told a journalist that, as a young man in Finland, he had used the name Patrick Bateman to book squash courts. Bateman is the New York trader and homicidal psychopath in Bret Easton Ellis＊s novel, , a book Stenfors had enjoyed. It was a joke, but apparently that was the extent of evidence in Stenfors＊s blameless background that he might one day dabble in infamy.He describes an affluent but pressurised life as a trader, with huge financial rewards but little opportunity to do anything with them. He also writes of a ruthless managerial approach. One boss suggested that Stenfors＊s wife Maria should be induced when she was having a troublesome pregnancy, to save Stenfors having to take time off. On another occasion, his request for leave to visit his sick father was turned down, and his father died before he could get to him. But none of this lessened his dedication to the job.Now a lean 46-year-old academic, he looks relaxed in a dark suit and open-necked shirt. His short dark hair is untroubled by grey. He lives with Maria and their two children in central London. Unlike some other notable rogue traders, Stenfors never came close to being sent to prison. Why?※There was never a criminal investigation, or even a hint that it could be criminal,§ he says.Initially he was angry that he had been grouped with the likes of , the trader who brought down Barings Bank. But couldn＊t his deceit, deliberately mismarking his books, be seen as a kind of fraud? ※I think you would have to ask a lawyer,§ he says. ※First of all, the process of valuing a book, we did it ourselves as the traders. Looking back, how on earth can you have such a set up?§Good question. Perhaps the most shocking element of Stenfors＊s new book is that it confirms that the economic crisis, which was effectively created by the banks, did very little to make the banks address their bad habits. Merrill Lynch, for example, had to be bailed out by the Bank of America in what amounted to a buyout. On New Year＊s Eve 2008, the day before the deal went through, Merrill Lynch brought forward its bonus payments by several months and lavished them on staff. Once the deal was complete, Merrill Lynch announced it had just lost $13.8bn (?10.7bn) in the previous three months. Stenfors says that this manoeuvre made him feel ※sick§.※I had this feeling that there was something really wrong with the system,§ he says, and notes that the problems have continued with the massive Libor and foreign currency manipulations.But it didn＊t stop him from making wild bets in a desperate effort to make money for a bank that had played an instrumental role in the complex junk trades that helped bring about the crisis. ※I didn＊t have the capability to think about the system as a whole,§ he says. ※It was like working in a nuclear reactor. You＊re so busy working on pipes here and there, you don＊t get to go outside and say: ＆Hang on, what happens if the whole things explodes?＊§Except that was exactly what Stenfors was gambling on. None of it makes sense, but he describes a kind of intense social isolation dominated by work. He didn＊t really see anyone who wasn＊t involved in finance, other than his wife and their two children. Inside the bubble, all that mattered was winning. It didn＊t matter if the price of the victory was the demise of everything else.And that seemed to be enough to quell any doubts he may have had. Stenfors describes himself as someone whose political sympathies have always been on the left. But he also recalls an occasion when he was told by a manager to sack a Japanese trader whose healthy profits were not steep enough for the company＊s liking. He did as he was told.※Where do you draw the line between the morals of the bank and the morals you hold yourself?§ he writes. ※Should any such line be drawn at all?§ I＊m astonished by this question, which seems a total abnegation of personal responsibility. Can he really be so ambivalent?※I think it＊s very clear that you should follow your own morals in this sense, and that＊s what I wish I had done much earlier,§ he says. ※But it＊s very easy for me to say: ＆Follow your own morals and it will be fine.＊ But it won＊t be fine. Because if you break the rules and conventions, you＊ll begin to run into trouble.§ He talks about not being invited to drinks parties, and being denied the trading book you desired or getting a smaller bonus. All of which makes it sound as if it＊s pretty easy for the banking culture to maintain immoral practices.I ask Stenfors how much money he was earning at his peak. ※I don＊t want to say,§ he replies. I push him several times, because I want to know how much money corrupts, and how much is enough to enable someone to walk away. Eventually, he says that in 2008 he earned ※a seven-figure sum§. However, he argues that money is not the issue, because you never have time to spend it. What motivated him, he says, was being right.※You get these bonus cheques, but there＊s no way you can use the money, only maybe when you retire. I＊ve spoken to so many people over the years and all they want to do is open a pub in Cornwall. But they never do because they never have enough money.§ At ?1m and more a year, you wonder how much it costs to open a boozer.But the point is that the more you earn, the more you believe you need to earn. For all his talk about not caring about money, Stenfors admits that it irked him if his bonus was not as large as he thought he deserved. Sometimes he made a lot of money for the bank, but the bank overall didn＊t perform well, and he felt short-changed.※Trading is very individualistic. You think you deserve this regardless of how the company as a whole is doing. It＊s only me, me, me. I was extremely arrogant. But money in this sense isn＊t necessarily about acquiring wealth. It＊s more like you＊ve won the race and you think you deserve the gold medal.§Stenfors took a PhD in economics at SOAS after he left trading, or trading left him. He is now a senior lecturer in economics and finance at Portsmouth University. He has a wide range of friends, he says, and feels much happier.I ask him if he felt his job as a trader was important. He did at the time, he says 每 he thought he played a vital role in helping global trade. But now he is not proud of the speculative element. ※The betting was way too much. It was sort of like it started small and then it became so extremely large.§But for all his apparent objection to speculation, I can see something in his eyes when he speaks about trading, a spark of excitement. He＊s now eligible to apply for a licence again. Would he do it? ※I miss the buzz and I follow the markets,§ he says, ※but I don＊t think so.§ He says he couldn＊t do it without becoming obsessed again.Does he miss the money? ※Of course, it＊s always easier to live if you have more money, but to go back to trading simply to make more money? No, I wouldn＊t. I know that if I went back, I know what I would become.§A risk-taker? In the book, he writes: ※Although other people in the market probably saw me as a big risk-taker, I didn＊t spend much time thinking about it 每 at least not until it was too late.§※That was the only thing that I really liked,§ he says now. ※Without being a risk-taker, I would not even think about it. That was the thing I enjoyed.§I think he should stick to lecturing.Early on I learned to accept that the rules of trading did not always apply to the rest of society or vice versa. Despite this, conventions within the dealing room felt logical and everybody seemed to accept them. In the absence of outside regulation, the banks simply wrote the rules themselves, which were then accepted by the rest of the market as well. The environment might not have been pleasant, fair or honest all the time 每 but even so I did not think of trading as immoral.During the 1939-40 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, the Finnish army had a sniper called Simo H?yh?. Having killed 505 soldiers in less than 100 days, he came to be nicknamed White Death by the Red Army. Some 40 years later, when H?yh? was asked whether he had any regrets about killing all those people, he answered: ※I only did my duty, and what I was told to do, as well as I could.§ Traders who showed no compassion for wounded competitors were sometimes also nicknamed ※snipers§. Individuals who do their duty, what they are told to do, and as well as they can, are often considered perfect employees 每 no matter what their job description is.I was once told by a manager to fire a Japanese employee in my team who had served the bank for two decades. The trader in question had done nothing wrong and had generated a stable revenue stream every year. But the trajectory was not steep enough and the trader had to go. I remember expressing unease about the assignment, not least because of the Japanese tradition of lifelong employment.※Don＊t worry,§ I was told. ※We can always suggest a cleaning job in Hokkaido.§ I understood. Giving the trader the option of moving to another island of Japan would mean that the bank, technically speaking, still required the employee＊s services. However, given that it would mean being humiliated in front of family and friends, the trader would never exercise that option. I did my duty.Afterwards, some colleagues jokingly began to call me the Axeman. I hated the nickname, but thankfully did not have to perform any more such executions. Money probably does have a tendency to drive out morality."															
"This month sees the 20th anniversary of the granting by New Labour of independence to the Bank?of England.It was not full-scale independence but ※operational independence§ in monetary policy: that is, the freedom to change interest rates without having to consult the chancellor. The Bank is still the Treasury＊s agent in other matters, such as decisions about the nation＊s currency reserves.The Strand Group at King＊s?College London held a high-powered conference to mark Bank independence last week: but against the background of elections and all this  nonsense, the anniversary of what was a controversial event at the time seems to have passed non-aficionados by.I myself was against the move at the time, and while hardly anyone questions the idea now, I am still inclined to take the Zhou Enlai view. This is a reference to then Chinese premier＊s reply in the 1970s when he was asked what he thought the consequences of the French Revolution had been. He famously replied: ※Too early to tell.§ This has gone down in fake history as a witty reference to the events of 1789, but an official who was present said Zhou was actually referring to the riots in Paris in 1968.Even critics of Gordon Brown give him, and his economic adviser at the time, Ed Balls, credit for making the Bank independent in this area.It is noteworthy, however, that most of the Brexiters who go on about parliamentary sovereignty seem to have no qualms about placing decisions in the hands of unelected officials.The granting of independence was the final resort of British policymakers in the long, and losing, battle for Labour and Tories alike to control inflation. Both parties had problems with incomes policies in the 1970s. The Tories brought monetarism from 1979, but that failed 每 indeed, the doctrine was even subsequently disowned by Milton Friedman, its most prominent advocate. Then came Chancellor Lawson＊s obsession with the success of the Germans in controlling inflation; his instrument was to be membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. When Margaret Thatcher vetoed that, Lawson directed the Bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market so that the pound ※shadowed§ the Deutschmark.When he was rumbled, there was hell to pay, ending with Lawson＊s dramatic resignation in 1989. Ironically, after Lawson went, Thatcher was finally worn down a year later, and the pound joined the ERM in 1990.Membership of the ERM then ended in sterling＊s ignominious exit from the mechanism on Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992. Amazingly, the British establishment did not seem to be aware of what the Germans knew only too well: namely that the historic reunification of Germany at around the time we joined the ERM would have serious inflationary consequences, because of the massive cost of absorbing the run-down East German economy. It was exactly the wrong time to subject Britain to what was effectively German monetary policy.John Major was prime minister, and he took the rap. Now, although some fanatics had been trying to reverse the result of the 1975 referendum (a two-to-one verdict in favour of remaining in the EEC we had joined in 1973) from the start, we can really date the onset of the cancerous growth of Euroscepticism in the Conservative party to the early 1990s. The general election of 1992 saw the end of the dominance of pro-Europeans in the parliamentary party and the rise of what the beleaguered Major termed the Eurosceptic ※bastards§.Meanwhile, after the ERM, the next supposed panacea for British inflation was central bank independence. While this period has coincided with low inflation, it has not necessarily caused it. Most industrial countries have had low inflation in recent times.However, central bank independence is but a sideshow when it comes to the major economic crisis of our times, which is the prospect of Brexit.Which brings us to David Cameron. I gather that Samantha Cameron has been quoted as saying words to the effect that ※Dave can rationalise himself out of anything§. To judge from reports of what our former prime minister , he is rationalising his disastrous decision to hold a referendum on the grounds that the Euroscepticism that was poisoning the Tory party had to be addressed.Well, it is an open question whether the poison has been neutralised. Quite apart from that, we are in the lamentable position where a Tory party that used to have the national interest at heart is now sacrificing everything to its own preservation. Yes: thanks to Theresa May＊s lame acceptance of the result of a referendum conducted on a false prospectus, the poison has now spread to the nation at large.We have a government that really is, in Angela Merkel＊s word, ※delusional§ about squaring the circle: obsessed by the immigration she failed to control at the Home Office, May wishes to leave the customs union and the single market while cherrypicking her way back into the best bits. This is impossible. As often happens, the people running this country do not seem to realise that our continental partners have their own interests, and tend to say what they mean.It is not too late to rethink. My old friend Lord Kerr, who drafted article 50 of the Lisbon treaty, says that it is not irrevocable. It is reversible. There is still an opportunity for our leaders to see sense, and own up to the people.I know the people have spoken. They spoke in 1945 and said one thing, and in 1951 and said another. Throughout the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1990s and the first decade of this millennium, they said one thing, and then another. To coin a phrase: it is a people＊s privilege to change its mind."															
"The  has called on political parties to spell out plans to spread prosperity to all Britain＊s regions after warning that economic activity is becoming ever more concentrated in London and the south-east.On current trends, the  said, the two most prosperous regions would account for 40% of national output by the end of the next parliament in 2022.Highlighting the big geographical shifts in the UK, the TUC said that in 1997  and the south-east accounted for a third of national output. That had risen to 37.7% by 2015 每 the last year for which data is available 每 and would continue rising to 40.1% by 2022.London, in particular, has expanded rapidly over the last two decades, from 18.7% to 22.7% of GDP between 1997 and 2015 and with a further increase to 24.8% of GDP by 2022.Other regions are expected to show relative decline.

"UK high streets are expected to be busy this  weekend, with forecasters predicting an increase in the number of people going out to spend money on food and drink.Mild spring weather and the fact that the bank holiday weekend falls not long after March＊s payday, are expected to lead to an 8.8% increase in the number of shoppers on the high street, according to the latest footfall predictions from retail analyst Springboard. In total, footfall to all outlets, including retail parks, is expected to be up by 5.4% year on year, in contrast to a 1.9% fall over Easter 2016.Springboard director Diane Wehrle said: ※Last year Easter took place on 25 March, a few days in advance of national payday for many shoppers. This combined with poor weather, impacted footfall, which declined across retail destinations from Easter Saturday onwards.§She added: ※Mild spring weather is forecast for this Easter, which falls after the national payday. This strongly indicates that more shoppers will visit retail destinations over the weekend compared with last year.§Springboard said retail footfall was up by 1.2% in March following six months of decline, but there was a move towards evening spending at food and drink outlets as shoppers prioritised experiences over goods. It said while, historically, 25% of sales in stores over the long Easter weekend were made in fashion retailers and 10% were at food and beverage outlets, this year it expected the figures to move towards 20% and 15% respectively.Separate figures from Visa show a modest rise in household spending in March, with the increase of 1% year on year slightly below February＊s figure of 1.6%. However, while spending on household goods, and clothing and footwear was down, spending on recreation and culture was up by 7.2%, while hotels saw a 4% boost.Springboard said its prediction that high streets would be busy over the holiday period was ※a reflection of their resilience over the year to date; their adaptability and diverse hospitality offering means they are able to expand and respond to trends more quickly than retail parks and shopping centres§.However, online sales will continue to grow much more rapidly than visits to retailers, with ecommerce data firm PCA Predict forecasting a 17% increase in transactions over the four-day weekend. Visa＊s figures also underlined the shift towards online shopping, with virtual retailers recording a 8.2% increase in spending in March, while the high street reported a 1.3% fall.Chris Harle at PCA Predict saidEaster Monday was typically one of the busiest days of the year for online shopping, and this year was unlikely to be different. He said customers were increasingly using mobile phones and tablets to do their shopping, and these channels were expected to account for 49% of online purchases over the weekend. ※With good weather in sight, it is likely that mobile shoppers will continue to make purchases out in the sunshine via smartphone or tablet ... We are also likely to see consistent mobile usage throughout the day, including over the dinner table, with few dramatic spikes.§"

Healthcare and food services showed big monthly gains.The unemployment rate moved up marginally to 4.4%, but remains at lows unseen since 2001 and rose as more people came off the sidelines and started looking for work.This month＊s numbers came as economists have worried that the US economy is struggling to create large numbers of new jobs despite Trump＊s promise of ※§US employers added just , the third month of relatively soft growth in the job market. But those figures were revised up this month to 152,000.Employment growth has averaged 180,000 per month thus far this year. In comparison, payroll employment growth averaged 187,000 a month in 2016 and 226,000 in 2015.The latest figures will increase the probability that the Federal Reserve will once again raise interest rates this year. The Fed raised short-term interest rates last month for the third time since December, with its chair, Janet Yellen, citing the ※very strong labor market§.June marked the 81st consecutive month of job growth in the US, but the recovery from the depths of the 2007 recession has been marked by slow wage growth and a worryingly large number of people in part-time work.Once again, the largest growth areas were in low-paying service industry jobs, and not in the higher-paying blue-collar industries Trump has pledged to support. Mining, an area in which Trump has promised to bring back jobs, added 8,000 positions over the month, but manufacturing and construction saw little change. Healthcare added 37,000 jobs over the month, while food services and drinking places added 29,000 jobs, in a sector that has added 277,000 jobs over the year.Wages once again grew only marginally in June, rising 2.5% from a year ago and little changed from prior months. These numbers are not adjusted for inflation, so ※real§ wage growth is close to 1%.Some 5.3 million people were employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers), little changed from previous months. The Bureau said these individuals, who would have preferred full-time employment, were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.※Overall, this morning＊s report shows a recovery continuing to chug along, but with wage growth below target levels, it is abundantly clear that we have a ways to go before we reach genuine full employment 每 where workers see better wage growth and workers who have been sitting on the sidelines see better job opportunities,§ wrote Elise Gould, senior economist with the  Policy Institute.Friday＊s government figures come a day after ADP, the US＊s largest private payroll processor, released its latest monthly tally of job gains. The report showed jobs growth slowed last month. According to ADP, the private sector added 158,000 new jobs in June; economists surveyed by Reuters had been expecting a gain of 185,000.Small businesses, a leading driver of job growth, added just 17,000 jobs in the month, with the smallest of small businesses, those employing one to 19 people, recording zero jobs added. Once again, the service sector was the largest new employer.Overall, hiring may be weakening because the number of available workers has declined with the  rate, now at a 16-year low. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody＊s Analytics, said: ※The job market continues to power forward. Abstracting from the monthly ups and downs, job growth remains a stalwart between 150,000 and 200,000. At this pace, which is double the rate of labour force growth, the tight labour market will continue getting tighter.§"															
															
"George Osborne, the editor of the Evening Standard and former chancellor of the exchequer, has added a sixth job to his portfolio 每 that of honorary professor of economics at the .On Thursday an email to staff announced that Osborne would be joining the university in an unpaid role. Starting in July, he will give a few lectures and masterclasses a year, building on his work on the  每 a project to devolve the economy away from London to Manchester and the surrounding area that he initiated as chancellor three years ago.Fellow project figureheads Lord O＊Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist, and Sir Howard Bernstein, former  city council boss, are also honorary professors.As well as running the London daily newspaper, Osborne remains chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP), a business lobby group he set up in September to boost the northern economy. The former MP for Tatton is also an advisor to Blackrock, the American fund management firm, where he works one day a week for ?650,000 per year.Additionally he gives speeches around the world with the Washington Speakers Bureau, and is a , a US thinktank.In a statement, Osborne said he was ※bowled over by this honour§. He said the University of Manchester was ※at the centre of so many things [he] tried to achieve as chancellor, from the promotion of new science to the building of the links between this country and countries like China§.Osborne described the university as ※one of the jewels in the crown of the northern powerhouse§.He said he remained committed to the idea that different communities in the north could work together ※so that the whole is greater than the parts§.※I believe more strongly than I ever did that the entire country, including our capital, would benefit from a stronger north,§ he said. ※That＊s why I remain closely involved as chair of the NPP 每 and look forward to playing a part in the life of the University of Manchester.§Announcing the decision, the university said Osborne was supportive of  and the university, particularly in supporting the National Graphene Institute and Henry Royce Institute as important centres for translating scientific discovery into economic growth.The university＊s vice-chancellor, Nancy Rothwell, also a member of the NPP, said: ※George＊s decision to accept our offer of an honorary professorship is very exciting news for the university.※He has been a leader at the top level of UK and world economic policy for many years and showed the vision to recognise the enormous economic and scientific potential of graphene to the UK.§Since Osborne took the helm of the Evening Standard, its coverage of Theresa May＊s government has been unashamedly pugilistic. He told the Andrew Marr Show shortly after the general election There has long been enmity between Osborne and May, who sacked him the day after she was elected Conservative leader, telling him to ※get to know the party better§.His newspaper has repeatedly attacked the government for its stance on Brexit, especially the apparent willingness in Downing Street to control immigration at cost to the British economy.As chancellor Osborne was an architect of austerity, the economic ideal that has come to define seven years of Conservative government. Leading economists including those from the IMF have warned that austerity policies, such as a slew of public sector cuts, can do more harm than good, an argument that has been picked up by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.One colleague of Osborne＊s told the Financial Times his appointment was a ※coup§ for Manchester University. ※I expect [students] will turn up in their Corbyn T-shirts and he will relish in it,§ the colleague said.The University and College Union (UCU) said the University of Manchester＊s appointment of Osborne was at odds with its decision to cut 171 jobs earlier this year.UCU regional official Martyn Moss said: ※The University of Manchester is currently planning to axe 171 jobs and around 1,000 staff don＊t know what their future holds. None of them will be reassured by the university＊s decision to offer a man with five jobs something else to do.※We hope that, as an economics professor, Mr Osborne will question how plans to slash local jobs and reduce the opportunities for students, particularly those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, fits in with his vision for a strong northern powerhouse.§"															
" 每 commonly used in the 1980s during the Latin American debt crisis 每 that would allow Greece to avoid a payment default next month on debt owed to European creditors. The reprieve also gives the IMF and its European partners time to sort out their technical differences on the struggling country＊s growth and budget outlook. But the fund＊s elegant compromise still leaves Greece under the shadow of an enormous debt overhang; reducing it requires that Europe find a way to set aside national politics and act on the basis of economic logic and necessity. and the IMF have been unable to reconcile two views of Greece＊s debt sustainability, with the two sides＊ differences spilling over into the public domain. Guided mainly by a cash-flow analysis, European authorities argue that low interest rates and long maturities have made the nation＊s debt sustainable. But the fund notes that, at almost 200% of GDP, Greece＊s stock of debt deters investment and capital inflows. For the IMF, meaningful debt reduction is critical for generating the confidence and credibility needed to break Greece out of a prolonged period of impoverishment.This is not the only area of disagreement between Greece＊s two major creditors. They also differ on the realism of some key economic projections, including the important nexus between growth and the government budget, with Europe adopting a much more optimistic perspective.For those of us who have been following the Greek economic tragedy for many years, much of the European view continues to defy economic logic 每 and for a simple reason: European politicians worry about the domestic political consequences of , especially ahead of Germany＊s federal election in September. Offering debt relief, it is feared, could undermine the credibility of governing parties and provide a boost to extremist movements.To be sure, debt forgiveness is tricky, raising complicated issues of fairness and incentives. Yet, in some cases, there comes a time when refusal to forgive debt is more damaging. European officials know as well as the IMF does that  has long been at this stage, turning the country into a permanent ※ward of the state§ within a eurozone that does not accommodate this outcome well. But they seem unable to act.With Europe and the IMF failing to agree, Greece has been robbed of the additional funding it needs to clear domestic arrears and meet its rather large external debt-service payments in July. Meanwhile, , despite the pickup in European economic performance as a whole. To overcome this bottleneck, the IMF has compromised, by reviving the practice of approving a financing programme ※.§An approval in principle signals the fund＊s endorsement of a country＊s economic policy intentions. This can unlock other funding (in this case, from Europe). But the IMF refrains from actually disbursing its own loans, pending a more satisfactory outcome on overall financing assurances (in this case, proper debt relief for Greece).It is a short-term compromise that acknowledges Europe＊s political calendar and constraints, helps Greece avoid a summer default, and safeguards the IMF＊s resources. The arrangement would shift more of the financing burden to Europe, where it properly belongs. And it even provides a signal of unity, despite the important disagreements that remain.But this is nothing more than yet another temporary solution 每 or, to be less generous, the continuation of what has come to be known as the ※extend and pretend§ approach. While the immediate funding issue is indeed addressed, not enough is being done to put Greece on a realistic path of medium-term growth and financial viability. It also risks exposing the IMF to even heavier political pressure, accentuating legitimate questions about the uniformity of its treatment of member countries.Having compromised, the IMF should now stick to its guns and refuse to make its arrangement for Greece operational until it is satisfied on both debt relief and technical assumptions. And, rather than declare victory, as they were inclined to do in a mid-June  by eurozone finance ministers, European officials should treat this compromise as the next step in softening its increasingly untenable stance on Greek debt.In the meantime, both sides would be well advised to undertake a careful analysis of previous experiences with programmes that were approved in principle, rather than becoming immediately operational. When defined well, including by specifying a short period for the prospective shift to being fully operational, such programmes can serve as a catalyst and conduit for relaxing a binding constraint on growth and financial viability. They need to be part of a constructive process. They do not work as standalone solutions.Notwithstanding some bumps along the way, the succession of such programmes in the 1980s helped avoid disruptive defaults, and culminated in meaningful reductions of debt and debt service obligations, which helped several Latin American economies restore high growth and financial viability. A few years later, the process was repeated successfully in the debt reduction programmes for low-income countries under the HIPC (heavily indebted poor countries) initiative.The grudging short-term compromise between the IMF and Europe comes after months of sometimes acrimonious discussions. For the sake of Greece, and for the credibility of their own future interactions, they should view it as a stepping stone to the (long-delayed) definitive resolution of Greece＊s economic and financial malaise. Greek citizens have waited, and suffered, long enough."															
"It was a surprise that . Markets hadn＊t expected so many votes for rate rises. On the same day as the vote was published we had very weak data on retail sales, which suggests that rising prices, which were higher than expected, are continuing to reduce living standards. , a deeper fall than the 0.8% forecast by economists. Oops!It seems to me that the three votes for a rise were in error. Indeed, it is clear that every vote for a rise since 2008 has been a mistake the economy could not have handled. Chances are the next move will have to be a cut. It matters to the central bank and all of us that there is no credible government and no dependable fiscal authority. We have no clue what economic policies the government will implement and whether failed austerity is dead and buried. It should be. Other post-election economic data have not been strong. The pound weakened on the election news. The Markit/CIPS UK purchasing managers＊ index for services missed expectations as a squeeze on household incomes began to make itself felt at consumer-facing businesses. Sales of new cars to private individuals were down 14%. It was the second month in a row that total sales were down after a record March when there was a rush for new cars before tax changes on vehicle emissions. Plus, the Bank of England＊s agents＊ summary of business conditions suggested that ※heightened uncertainty remained a drag on some businesses＊ willingness to invest§. They found that growth in total labour costs had remained subdued across sectors.

Inflation has risen because of the weakness of the pound and that has turned real wage growth from positive to negative. That, in turn, is squeezing consumer spending 每 which we are seeing reflected in sluggish growth in retail sales. Employment growth continues to be quite robust, however, so that offers a countervailing positive influence on the prospects for consumer spending.The world economy looks very resilient, though, and that is going to help the UK economy avoid the worst effects of the current squeeze on consumers. The three main regions of the world economy 每 North America, Europe and Asia 每 are growing at a reasonably healthy rate. That will support export growth and help the financial position of the many international businesses that operate here in the UK, giving them a breathing space to assess the full consequences of the  outcome.The net impact of these forces will be to create a modest slowdown in UK economic growth 每 to 0.2% to 0.3% a quarter. That will drag the average GDP growth rate for 2017 down to about 1.5%. In 2018, we should see a similar consumer-driven squeeze, offset by reasonably healthy world growth, with average economic growth also close to 1.5%.With , however, it is reasonable for members of the MPC to question whether they should follow the US Federal Reserve and start pushing up interest rates. Three MPC members voted for a rate rise in June, the highest number since 2011.  So the interest rate climate in the UK may now be shifting to the upside, despite the slowdown in economic growth."															
"Britain＊s vote to leave the EU has squeezed living standards, hit consumer spending and dampened the country＊s growth prospects, a Guardian analysis of economic news over the year since the referendum shows.One year since voters narrowly opted for Brexit, the  paints a gloomy picture, with households facing rising costs and firms fretting over falling demand and political uncertainty.The economy has so far avoided the recession predicted by some doomsayers at the time of the referendum, and in the months immediately following the  vote the UK outperformed most other advanced economies.But at the turn of the year the economy slowed markedly and the UK slipped to the .

But , losing momentum as firms cited a drop in demand.Sofa chain DFS became the latest business to  last week when it blamed a sharp drop in orders on the upheaval created by the general election as well as the general air of uncertainty hanging over the economy.

Surveys suggest vacancies were getting harder to fill with one poll by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation flagging . Other figures showed a  since the referendum.For individuals, the clearest economic impact of the vote so far has been higher prices, stemming from the pound＊s sharp fall against other currencies. The UK imports almost half of its food from overseas and a weaker pound raises the price of those imports and the cost of all the raw materials bought in by manufacturers.Those higher import costs and the rise in global oil prices have been gradually passed on to consumers.Inflation, as , hit 2.9% in May, well above the Bank of England＊s 2% target. It marks a rude awakening for households after virtually no inflation in the months running up to the Brexit vote.Wages have failed to keep pace with price rises, resulting in the biggest squeeze on living standards since 2014.But the weaker pound has had some positive side effects. It has attracted  and made exports from the UK more competitive in overseas markets. Some economists believe that will help offset some of the domestic pressures on growth.The effects of a sharply weaker pound 每 down about 15% against the dollar since the referendum 每 have left the Bank of England with a delicate balancing act.

"The lack of wage growth in Britain＊s economy is the result of turning the clock back to the days before the Industrial Revolution when there were no trade unions and self-employment was rife, the chief economist of the  has suggested.Andy Haldane said the had more in common with the period between 1500 and 1750 than in the subsequent period, because in the post-1750 era, collective bargaining and the expansion of full-time paid employment meant workers were able to secure generous pay awards when labour was scarce.※The move towards greater self-employment and less unionisation is, in some respects, a shift back to the future in the nature of work,§ Haldane said, harking back to the days before James Watt, a key figure in the emergence of the steam engine, and other pioneers began the transformation of Britain＊s largely agrarian economy. ※Prior to the Industrial Revolution, and indeed for some years after it, most workers were self-employed or worked in small businesses. There were no unions. Hours were flexible, depending on what work was needed to collect the crops, milk the cows or put bread on the table. Work was artisanal, task-based, divisible.§Haldane, , said the read-across from pre-industrial Britain to the 21st century was not exact but that there were parallels with today＊s gig economy. He added that there was evidence that changes in the nature of work had been a factor in explaining why wage growth was running at just 2% at a time when unemployment was the lowest since the mid-1970s.The chief economist said a period of ※divide and conquer§ had left workers less able to bargain for higher wages. ※There is power in numbers. A workforce that is more easily divided than in the past may find itself more easily conquered. In other words, a world of divisible work may reduce workers＊ wage-bargaining power.§Trade union membership has declined from 38% of employees in 1990 to 23% in 2016, and Haldane noted that the downward trend was likely to continue.※The fact that unionisation rates have been falling within each age cohort over time, and are lowest among the young, suggests the downward trend in rates of unionisation may still have some distance to travel.※For example, if unionisation rates were to continue to decline at the same average rate as over the past decade, then they are likely to fall to around 10% of employees, or 3 million people, within a generation.§Self-employment had increased from 8% of the workforce in 1980 to almost 15%, or about 4.25 million people. Only one in six of the self-employed hired other workers compared with 30% in 1990. The number of people on zero-hours contracts had increased from 170,000 (0.6% of those in employment) in 2010 to almost 1 million workers (3% of employees) by 2016. At the current rate of expansion, employees on zero-hour contracts would reach about 7% within a decade.Haldane said: ※Gigging can be fun for some. But not everyone wants to be a roadie when it comes to the world of work.§ "															
"UK inflation rose to a four-year high in May as the pound＊s sharp fall since the Brexit vote worked its way through the economy, intensifying the squeeze on household budgets.The increasing cost of computer games and package holidays helped push up inflation to 2.9% last month, above the expectation of economists that it would remain at the .

This continues a pattern of essentials becoming increasingly expensive, leaving households with less to spend on treats. Consumer spending has slowed as a result,  of overall economic growth.The TUC general secretary, Frances O＊Grady, said the inflation figures underlined the pressure on the new government to help households cope with rising living costs.※The election showed that working people are struggling. And the biggest price rises in four years won＊t provide any comfort,§ she said.※Working people are still ?20 a week worse off, on average, than they were before the crash, and now rising prices are hammering their pay packets again. The new government must stop the real wage slide. Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs all around the UK.§Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, said: ※Too often there is more month than money left after pay day. Ending the public sector pay freeze and making sure all workers are paid a decent wage is an absolute must and it needs to be on the agenda for the Queen＊s speech.§A Treasury spokesman said: ※The government is helping families with the everyday cost of living by keeping taxes low, freezing fuel duty and increasing the ＆national living wage＊.§Inflation remains higher than the  year on year in the three months to March. Wage figures due on Wednesday were expected to show the gap between underlying pay growth and the inflation increase widened further in April.The higher-than-expected inflation figure will intensify the debate over how long the Bank of England may leave interest rates at the . Inflation is well above the , but policymakers have said they are happy to tolerate some overshoot because they want to support growth and employment as the UK .The Bank＊s monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet this week to set interest rates and announce its decision at noon on Thursday.Oliver Kolodseike, a senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy, said: ※Under normal circumstances, the  would have a sufficient set of arguments to justify an interest rate rise.※That said, the recent rise in inflation was partly driven by external factors such as the oil price and the depreciation of the pound ... Another argument for the Bank to keep monetary policy on hold is that a rise in interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing, at a time at which consumers are already feeling a squeeze on their incomes as wage growth remains stubbornly low. ※Add to this uncertainty regarding the UK＊s future outside the European Union and it seems sensible for the Bank to keep interest rates at their current levels.§The ONS figures showed that its , CPIH, which includes owner occupiers＊ housing costs, hit a five-year high of 2.7% in May, up from 2.6% in April.Its measure of how much manufacturers are having to pay for raw materials and energy showed that these cost pressures continued to ease off last month. Input prices increased by 11.6% in the year to May, down from a 15.6% rise in the year to April. This took pressure off companies to raise the prices they charge customers, and factory gate inflation held at 3.6% in May for the third month in a rowJonathan Athow, the ONS deputy national statistician, said: ※The rate of increase in factory gate prices has levelled now that manufacturing input costs have started to fall back.§Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at consultancy Capital , said this pattern supported a view that the struggling pound had fed through faster than expected, rather than by a larger amount.※The effects of the lower pound already appear to be fading at the start of the production pipeline,§ he said.※Of course, it takes time for rises in producer prices to feed through to prices in the shops, and as a result, we think that CPI inflation will rise a bit further in the second half of the year, peaking at about 3.2% in the fourth quarter. But inflation is likely to drop back quickly in 2018 as the impact of the lower pound begins to fade.§"															
"The lack of a majority government means the  will probably have to ease austerity plans and boost spending on public services, the newly appointed environment secretary, Michael Gove, has said. Gove,  to Theresa May＊s new cabinet, said the party would need to push ahead on Brexit with ※the maximum possible consensus§, taking into account the views of remain voters.Discussions between May＊s team and the Democratic Unionist party over what concessions the Northern Ireland party will seek in return for propping up a Conservative government are scheduled for later on Tuesday.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster,  sectarian issues, such as Orange parades, as conditions under which her MPs would provide ※supply and confidence§ to a minority government, and instead focus on budget-based matters.The DUP has , including the bedroom tax, and mooted changes to some universal benefits for pensioners, such as the winter fuel allowance.Asked whether the Conservatives would need to give ground on this, Gove told BBC Radio 4＊s Today programme that some concessions were inevitable. ※We don＊t have a majority, and one of the things that I do think that we need to do is to make sure that when we bring forward a programme it commands the broadest possible level of confidence,§ he said.※And we also need to reflect on what the election result told us about the way people want to see the economy managed in the future. I think there is an important balance to be struck, and we need to get on with the job of reducing the deficit so that we do not saddle the next generation with a burden of debt.§While May＊s government would seek sustainable spending, Gove said, ※we also need to take account of legitimate public concerns about ensuring that we properly fund public services§.Asked whether the Conservatives＊ loss of a majority in last week＊s election could soften  plans, Gove said it was necessary to ※proceed with the maximum possible consensus§ and to take into account the views of people who voted for the UK to remain in the EU.Asked what this might mean in practice, Gove declined to elaborate and refused to say whether he would support any cross-party commission on Brexit: ※I don＊t think that I should specify, and I don＊t want to specify, the means by which we should involve everyone in a conversation.§ Gove was sacked from the cabinet when May entered No 10. The pair had fallen out when they were the education and home secretaries respectively.Saying he was ※naturally flattered§ to be asked back into government, Gove said there was no bad feeling between him and the prime minister: ※I＊m a huge fan of Theresa May＊s, and I have been throughout my political career, and I think that she was a great home secretary.§Gove, briefly and unsuccessfully, challenged for the succession to David Cameron, having suddenly withdrawn his support for Boris Johnson as he did so, scuppering the latter＊s chances.Asked on BBC Breakfast about his relations with Johnson, Gove said: ※Boris and I spoke at the weekend and we had a great, friendly conversation. He was kind enough to welcome me back to the cabinet with a very generous tweet. And we were chatting yesterday in the margins of cabinet.§In another media appearance, on ITV＊s Good Morning Britain, Gove was asked about a , Tom Watson, to May, asking if the media boss Rupert Murdoch had sought Gove＊s return to cabinet.Gove, who writes a column for the Murdoch-owned Times, said: ※Tom sees Rupert Murdoch＊s hand behind everything. I think Tom believes that Rupert Murdoch picks the England cricket XI and the rugby first XV as well as decide who is on Britain＊s Got Talent. This is par for the course for Tom when it comes to political mischief-making.§In a subsequent interview with LBC, Gove said that now he was back in the cabinet he would be giving up his column for the Times, but might still contribute articles without payment: ※I will no longer be writing there for money but if the editor of the Times ever wanted to take an article from me, I would always be happy to oblige.§ "															
"ven as their world came apart, the bankers clung to denial. By August 2007, the flagship hedge fund of Wall Street＊s most prestigious firm was tanking fast 每 and what explanation came from the man at Goldman Sachs? ※We were seeing things that were 25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row.§ The bank was getting hit by events that were only meant to happen once every 100,000 years 每 and they were happening every day of the week. Given a choice between blaming their models or reality, Goldman＊s bosses held the world at fault.You know the rest because, a decade later, you and I are still paying for it. How the banks died, the world economy collapsed and most of us got poorer. How the financiers, mainstream economists and regulators were so detached from reality that they swore blind that  每 even while it was under way.Their reputation has never recovered. And as an economics journalist, I look across at politics and see the same process at work. Brexit, Donald Trump, Jeremy Corbyn: time after time, the political class has completely failed to understand the world they were governing, policing and analysing. Allow me to be blunt: our political crisis is also a crisis for our political class. And it is one from which I doubt they can recover.At each major fork in the road, they have sped off down the wrong turning, while decrying the other as unimaginable. Each time, they have crashed. Before the EU plebiscite, a senior EU official remembers David Cameron strolling around a G20 summit, : ※We＊re going to win. Maybe by 70:30.§ He loses by 48:52 and quits. Theresa May calls an election, the sole point of which is to deliver her a landslide majority. Now the leader of the party that outlawed squatting is herself squatting in No 10.Their colleagues and outriders on the backbenches, in the press and running the thinktanks are just as badly wrong. The sheer back-scratching, tummy-rubbing self-agreement is as startling as it is mistaken. May is a winner; Corbyn is a born loser. The Tory manifesto gets a triple-A rating 每 until its  turns out to be toxic. Labour＊s proposals for renationalising the railways are dismissed as communism 每 until voters, snaggle-toothed fools that they are, turn out to quite like the idea of not being bled dry by Richard Branson.When the models go awry, it＊s always reality that cops it. During the credit crisis, economic analysts blamed the poor for taking out sub-prime loans. This time, the political analysts bash the young ＃ for exercising a democratic preference. The heathens in the  party who put forward a winning platform are written off as Trots, even though some of them were barely alive when the Berlin Wall was up.Over the worst recovery Britain has seen in centuries, ever more outlandish schemes are dreamed up to keep the show on the road.  and  are presented as part of the new normal. In one of the biggest constitutional crises ever seen in postwar Britain, May strikes a secret deal with the creationists of the Democratic Unionist party 每 and is still unable to start Brexit negotiations on time, or to do . The Tories are in government but they are no longer governing. But still: move along, nothing to see here.This isn＊t simply about calling . On such fortune-telling, whether in economics or politics, I＊m with the : ※It＊s hard to make predictions, especially about the future.§ Plenty doubted whether Labour could make the dramatic turnaround it pulled off last week; but the class of mainstream politicians and pundits didn＊t think it should. To their minds, any politics that deviated from that set out in the decade-and-a-bit spanning Tony Blair and Cameron, falling taxes and triangulation 每 a period described by Jeremy Gilbert as the Long 90s 每 was harebrained nonsense. Any questioning of an economic system in which the poor pay for the rich and the rest of the country subsidises London was futile.The fundamental problem here is not the cocksure forecasting, it＊s about the failure of understanding 每 in particular, to understand how much Britain has changed since the banking crash. This political crisis is a direct product of the decade-long economic crisis 每 which the political class has never fully understood. For them, the present is another country: they do things differently there.Take one example: to switch on  and the rest of the Sunday political programmes was to watch hours of guff about how this was a Brexit election. Yet Brexit was one of the arguments that never got ventilated in this campaign: both parties simply accepted it was happening and parked?the subject.Yet talk to the people around the Labour leadership about how a dead-cert race turned into a hung parliament, and the theme that keeps coming up is the party＊s anti-austerity platform. Slashed public spending, falling living standards, a ※national§ recovery really felt only in London and the home counties: such issues barely ever feature in the political class discourse, yet they shape our politics. I heard it in south Wales before the Brexit referendum, and I saw it in deindustrialised outer London in the run-up to this vote. The Resolution Foundation describes this as t, and what do the political class talk about? Whether Philip Hammond can keep his portfolio.Pundits leap on the importance of youth in this election 每 but fail to see that since the crash, age has become practically a proxy for class. To be a young graduate is to be saddled with debt, compelled to move to a major city, tout for unpaid internships, land a temporary job and have no hope of ever buying a house or retiring before 70. Go up the demographic tree and you see young and  whose jobs have been Uber-ised.Barely any of this gets discussed by our political class; hardly any time is spent thinking about solutions. But one result of both Brexit and last Thursday is that the political class which used to dictate the ※narrative§ and set the agenda is having those powers wrested off it. What was it that Goldman＊s executive said back in 2007? ※It makes you reassess how big the extreme moves can be.§ The political class should brace itself for many more extreme moves."															
"Employers in Britain are planning to take on new workers over coming months despite looming  negotiations and slower economic growth, according to a survey.A poll of 2,109 employers by recruitment agency ManpowerGroup found that a net balance of 5% were planning to increase staff levels rather than cut them over the July-to-September quarter. That was unchanged from the previous poll three months ago but down slightly from a  when the UK economy was still growing strongly. Since the start of this year,  as  amid rising cost pressures. The pound＊s sharp fall since the Brexit vote has made imports more expensive and official figures due on Tuesday are expected to show that inflation held at its  last month.ManpowerGroup said employers were still intending to increase their workforces on average in the coming quarter, with employers most optimistic in Yorkshire and Humberside, the south-east and West Midlands.※Employers have faced a triple whammy of uncertainty over the last few months 每 a snap election, the triggering of article 50, and weak economic data for the first half of 2017. You might have expected hiring confidence to have taken a real hit, but employers have been standing firm,§ said James Hick, the managing director of ManpowerGroup Solutions.The recruitment firm highlighted stark contrasts between sectors. Manufacturers were most optimistic about hiring but the outlook for the public sector was far gloomier, with a majority of employers looking to cut jobs. The poll, conducted during campaigning for the snap general election, found a net balance of 7% of manufacturers expected to increase their workforce over the coming quarter. ManpowerGroup put some of the strength down to investment, citing plans by the maker of Dulux paint, AkzoNobel, to . Hick also cited support for manufacturers which export thanks to the boost to competitiveness from a weaker pound. ※Manufacturing is the standout sector this quarter, driven by investment from outside the UK; following the shock election result, currency is cheap and sterling＊s weakness is manufacturing＊s strength,§ he said.The hiring balance for the public sector fell to a six-year low of -6%, suggesting employers were planning to shrink their workforces despite signs the next government would ease up on austerity. ※Both main parties pledged a rise in NHS spending. However, with the public sector outlook in the doldrums, employers don＊t seem to think that hiring is going up any time soon,§ said Hick.ManpowerGroup said the inconclusive election result could turn out to be positive for those employers, including in the NHS, which had been worrying about access to workers after Brexit. ※The election result throws into question the Conservative commitment to slash immigration to the tens of thousands and double the levy on non-EU workers to ?2,000,§ said Hick."															
"eremy Corbyn may score badly with the wider public, but for as long as I can remember the press have given even the most admired Labour leaders a hard time during election campaigns. A recent exception was Tony Blair, who 每 for a time 每 achieved rock star status with the media.Many reports have suggested that when presented with individual Labour policies 每 in what one might call a ※blind tasting§ 每 respondents have been much more enthusiastic than when the names of Corbyn and some of his colleagues come up.One peculiarity of this campaign is that policies such as caps on the charges made by energy suppliers were derided by the  when propagated by Corbyn＊s predecessor, Ed Miliband, but have now been brazenly filched by Theresa May. This is in accordance with the first law of Conservative dynamics: do anything to stay in, or regain, power.However, I did not get where I am today by going into every detail of political manifestos. What I find interesting about the broad thrust of the manifestos of both main parties is that, in their own way, the Conservatives and Labour are slowly abandoning the pretence that we can have Scandinavian levels of public service with US levels of taxation.I am not sure that this applies to the lunatic fringe of Tory Brexiters. They want to turn this country into a low-tax, Singapore-style entrepreneurial fantasy. (In my experience, these people have no idea of the history of Singapore, let alone how state-controlled it actually is.)In the past Labour has tied itself in knots with commitments ruling out increases in principal tax rates, resorting to all manner of subterfuge instead. The Tories have been no better. In which context, younger readers may be amused to learn that, during the 1979 election, there were persistent rumours that the Tories planned to double the rate of VAT from 8% to 16%. These were strenuously denied. Guess what? When they came in, they raised it to 15%.When May stated on 30 April that ※we have absolutely no plans to increase the level of tax§ it was time to start counting the spoons. It reminded some of us of George Bush Sr＊s remark: ※Read my lips. No new taxes.§Bush＊s words were widely misinterpreted: in fact, they left ample scope for raising the level of existing tax rates. In May＊s case, the sceptical listener will have rightly thought: ※Ah, yes. No plans until after the election.§May went on: ※We don＊t want to make specific proposals on taxes unless I＊m absolutely sure that I can deliver on?those.§ Note what journalists tend to call the ※vertical pronoun§: that regal ※I§. No wonder there has been intense speculation about the chancellor＊s future. Philip Hammond had made the point that running the economy demanded flexibility in tax policy. He knew all too well that the practice of ruling out increases in specific tax rates restricted the Treasury＊s room for manoeuvre. He seems to have made his point, but May is by all accounts someone who bears grudges.Tory chancellors have a habit of falling out with their prime ministers. Nigel Lawson fell out with Mrs Thatcher. Norman Lamont fell out with John Major. George Osborne fell out with May many times when she was home secretary but did not get the chance to confront her over policy when she became prime minister because she sacked him on day one.Didn＊t get a chance as chancellor, that is. As editor of the London , he falls out with May almost daily. Although he did not stand up against the very idea of that stupid referendum on  when in cabinet, he is doing his best to atone for it now.In an unsigned editorial last week Osborne revealed that no one else in the cabinet, not even the extreme Brexiters, agreed with May＊s manifesto aim to reduce net immigration to ※tens of thousands§. For Osborne, this policy is not only unachievable but also ※economically illiterate§.Quite right. When one considers the needs of the health service, education, research institutes and hosts of businesses, it is insane 每 but, I fear, all too typical of the absurdity and self-harm of the whole Brexit venture.It is depressing to hear there are people who say they voted Remain but who now say ※we might as well get on with it§. Get on with heading for the economic cliff? Are they men, women or mice? We should be told.Meanwhile, as leader of what has become the Conservative and Ukip party, May continues to pursue net immigration targets that she failed to achieve during all those years as home secretary. In a perceptive review of a recent biography of May, the writer David Runciman warned us that her main object as prime minister is to concentrate on this chimera of drastic cuts in immigration. It is utterly shameful that she is thus prepared 每 in her chancellor＊s words before article?50 was invoked 每 to make the country poorer by sacrificing our membership of the European customs union and the single market.The irony is that, however sincere she may be in wanting to change the ※nasty party§ into a more caring government, the impact of Brexit on the nation＊s finances will almost certainly frustrate her ambition. It will aggravate the ills of an economy that is already experiencing stagnant incomes and the continuing effects of a misconceived austerity policy.Finally, I note that the Brexiters, and others, are seizing on any emollient statement from , the chief negotiator on the other side. Well, I wonder. President de Gaulle made it difficult for us to join the EU and the French and the others are unlikely to make it painless for us to leave.Will this country ever wake up?"															
"UK factories have cashed in on the sharp fall in the pound since the  vote, with export orders at the joint highest level in three and a half years.The stronger than expected findings from a survey by the CBI, the UK business trade body, suggest manufacturers had a decent start to the second quarter, boosting hopes that the sector will help prop up the wider economy as a .※The summer sun has come out early for Britain＊s . Robust demand at both home and abroad is reflected in strong order books, and output is picking up the pace,§ said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI.Factories also enjoyed strong demand from domestic customers, driving total order books to the highest level in more than two years, according to the CBI＊s latest industrial trends survey.In a further sign of strength, output at Britain＊s factories grew at the fastest pace since December 2013, underpinned by the mechanical engineering and chemicals sectors. Firms expected production to rise again in the coming quarter.Of the 432 firms that took part in the survey, conducted between 25 April and 12 May, 22% said their export order books were above normal for the time of year, while 12% said they were below normal. That gave a balance of +10%, the joint highest balance since December 2013.Economists said strong export orders were a sign that manufacturers were benefiting from a drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote last June. The pound is about 13% lower against the dollar than it was on the day of the referendum, making British-made goods cheaper abroad.※The improvement in the export orders balance, to its joint highest since December 2013, indicates that the drop in the pound is still having substantial positive effects for manufacturing exporters,§ said Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital .※The upbeat survey supports our view that the manufacturing sector should perform well this year and help to offset some of the slowdown in consumer spending growth.§Manufacturers have reported factories working at full capacity in recent months to meet demand from overseas customers benefiting from the low pound. The EEF, which represents manufacturing firms, said last week that orders were improving as UK exporters enjoyed an improved competitive position ※vis-a-vis the pound depreciation§ and global growth picked up strongly from a dip last year.But there is anecdotal evidence that while manufacturers have boosted production, they remain reluctant to increase investment and expand capacity. Many remain nervous that the fallout from the Brexit negotiations may harm the economy. They are also concerned that sterling could rise, wiping out the benefit for exporters, should the Brexit talks proceed smoothly and the UK strike a beneficial trade deal with Brussels.The CBI pointed out that although orders and output were up at UK factories, manufacturers were facing higher costs for imported raw materials. As a result, firms were expecting to raise their selling prices.※On the other side of the coin, we have mounting cost pressures and expectations for factory-gate price rises are running high,§ said Newton-Smith. ※Boosting productivity is key to alleviating some of the cost pressures that manufacturers are facing. Sustained investment in innovation and education will be vital to shore up the success of British industry.§The CBI findings ended a mixed week for economic data. The latest official jobs figures show  in the first three months of the year, putting household budgets under increased pressure. But they also show record levels of employment, with unemployment at a 42-year low.Workers＊ average earnings rose by 2.1% year on year in the three months to March, while inflation was 2.3% in the same period., rebounding from a 1.4% fall in March as the warmer weather and Easter holidays encouraged shoppers back on to Britain＊s high streets. It was more than double the 1% increase predicted by economists, and suggested consumers were willing to put aside fears over falling living standards."															
"German industrialists have warned that British hopes of their support in  negotiations are misplaced and could backfire with dangerous consequences for international trade.Business leaders in Europe＊s biggest economy are instead calling on Conservatives to rethink their commitment to leaving the single market, even though the party has doubled down on this promise in its election manifesto.David Davis and Boris Johnson have repeatedly cited likely pressure from German exporters, such as carmakers, as a reason for thinking they can persuade European negotiators to maintain free trade access after Britain leaves.But the theory is increasingly rejected by those whose support they need most 每 scepticism relayed most forcefully by Steffen Kampeter, the chief executive of the German employers＊ federation, on a trip to the UK this week.※The top priority of European business is the integrity of the single market; the second priority is making good business with the UK. We will see if there is a conflict, but the message is: do not harm the single market by cherry-picking deals,§ he told a conference of British business leaders in London this week.※It＊s not the German carmakers that are directing the negotiations,§ added Kampeter, who said he knew of no one who thought a trade deal within 18 months was possible and called for ※rhetorical disarmament on all sides§.An independent panel of economists that advises the German government has also intervened by proposing a plan that would avert such a cliff-edge scenario, whereby Britain would temporarily rejoin Efta 每 the trading block that consists of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein 每 at the point when its EU membership runs out and therefore preserve its membership of the single market.Making such a ※reverse Efta§ a temporary stepping stone would avert irreparable damage to the British and German economy and allow Theresa May to satisfy the tabloid press＊s demand for a swift exit, argued Albrecht Ritschl, one of the four authors of the letter. May appeared to rule out this option in the manifesto by insisting Britain would leave the single market, but it is possible this could serve as the basis for a transitional deal that some Tories still support.Ritschl said some leading Brexit advocates＊ hopes of Angela Merkel forcing the EU to agree a free-trade deal before Britain officially dropped out of the EU in 2019 was based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between German politics and industry.※Of course  has a strong export industry, but even in Berlin people have over the last two years come to realise that an enormous export surplus can be a weakness as well as a strength§, he told the Guardian.※Above all, German industry knows that when it comes to dealing with international politics, you sometimes have to go with what the government decides. In any case, if businesses had to choose between maintaining exports to the UK and keeping the  together, it＊s obvious they would go with the latter.§Andreas Meyer-Schwickerath, director of the British Chamber of Commerce in Germany, said: ※My impression is that German companies are getting very concerned about the tone that has been whipped up by the election campaign in the UK. If we don＊t start tackling problems swiftly and pragmatically, then the whole debate could escalate beyond repair.§Some Whitehall veterans fear a lack of understanding of European commercial thinking is a major handicap for British negotiators. ※I worry about the lack of European experience in our team,§ said Jonathan Powell, a former Downing Street chief of staff. ※They do not have that granular experience of difficult negotiations and we will be really struggling to catch up with them.§At a speech on Wednesday, Merkel, the German chancellor, repeated her warnings about the economic cost of leaving the trade bloc.※This is not meant maliciously, but you cannot have all of the good things and then say there＊s a limit of 100,000 or 200,000 EU citizens allowed to enter the UK,§ she said. ※That won＊t work. At that point, we＊ll have to think about which restrictions we make on the European side to compensate for that.§ in Germany and other EU countries showed that eight in 10 people thought that the interests of the EU should be more important during negotiations than keeping intact economic ties to the UK.The German economists＊ letter, whose receipt was acknowledged by the economic ministry in Berlin on Thursday, warns that without a transitional solution such as the one offered by Efta, Germany would ※risk causing unnecessary damage to economic ties§.The Efta proposal comes at a time at which it is increasingly clear that concerns of German industry are not cutting through to German politics in ways in which British advocates of a hard Brexit have predicted. ※A phased Brexit using Efta as a stepladder to put integration with the EU into reverse would give Theresa May a symbolic clear break with the EU at an early stage of the exit process, since Britain would no longer be subject to the rulings of the European court of justice§, said Ritschl, who is also an economist at the London School of .※At the same time it would protect a legal framework for the further negotiating of a free trade deal, since Efta has its own court of arbitration in Berne.§The entry of the the UK and its 65 million people would be a radical change for Efta, a 13.5 million trading bloc of which the UK was a co-founder in 1960 until it joined the European Economic Community in 1973.Frank Bakke-Jensen, Norway＊s minister of EU and European Economic Area affairs, said on Tuesday Efta took an open approach to the question of UK membership, in contrast to doubts voiced by Norwegian ministers last year. ※We would like to be open-minded and find the best solution,§ he told journalists in Brussels.Questioned about how long it could take Britain to join Efta, he said: ※International cooperation is not a button you can turn on and off. It is complicated, so we will have to see. For the time being the question is not on the table, the UK has said ＆no thank you＊.§"															
															
"n the BBC＊s Question Time this week, a man in the audience claimed that people used food banks because they spent all their money on fags, booze and telly. The rest of the audience was scandalised. The gist of their annoyance was that the claim wasn＊t true.You could characterise the man as having a rightwing view, and his critics as having a leftwing view. If the banality didn＊t make your teeth ache, that is.Seriously? It＊s leftwing to insist that the recipients of charity are always deserving? Doesn＊t that imply that it＊s also leftwing to believe that if the wheels fall off people＊s lives because they consume too much of things that are bad for them, then they shouldn＊t be kept alive with handouts of food?The trouble with Question Time man＊s assertion, and the reaction to it, is that it focuses on whether people have personal failings or not. The nature of people＊s personal failings is not the central question of politics. We know, surely, that people do have failings 每 some more than others.The nature of systemic failure is the central question of politics. It doesn＊t matter why people are going to food banks; the fact that food banks exist is the problem. Frankly, I＊d rather we set up fag banks and booze banks. At least that way, people who like to judge and moralise could do it to their heart＊s content, safe in the knowledge that their targets are people whose desire for mind-altering stimulants is greater than their self-respect (though that wouldn＊t stop those critics from being a bit loathsome).People do like to judge and moralise. I like doing it myself, as much as I like booze, nicotine and telly. Which is a lot. Judging and moralising makes people feel productive. The rest 每 drinking, smoking, telly 每 that＊s consumption. The people whom Question Time man despises, whether real or imaginary, caricatures or ugly accurate portraits, are the purest of consumers, craving nothing except things that they want but do not need. They are pitiful.But they are not necessarily blameless. Sure, you could sit listening to the stories of many of the lives of such people, and find yourself understanding exactly the ghastly path that led them to that sofa, in front of that telly, fag ends nestling in the cans of white cider that litter the room. Maybe some would indeed be blameless, worthy recipients of the Ken Loach treatment.But guess what? Others would be without insight, oblivious or indifferent to the damage and neglect they have meted out to themselves and those who tried to help them 每 psychopathic, sociopathic, narcissistic.Human beings, despite the witless homilies of humanism, don＊t all start out good and kind and perfect, only to have it driven out of them by a cruel world. Cherished children sometimes grow up to be antisocial, gazing with dead-eyed contempt at the people whose love they exploit. There can be no human utopia, because there will always be humans in it.I do understand that the critics of Question Time man＊s sweeping and inhumane generalisations are well-intentioned. I know that people turn up at food banks because they have been referred to them by trained professionals who have studied the minutiae of their personal finances and?health records, and judged them to be in need. I know that wages often don＊t cover the cost of living modestly,?and even then cannot be counted on in this world of casual contracts. I know that these are the people for whom that man＊s assertions are simply another hammer blow they could do without.But here＊s the point. Even if humans could create a world in which everyone had the free will to make their own choices 每 instead of this one, in which we pretend there＊s free will and condemn people for failing to exercise it wisely 每 some people would still be the architects of their own misfortune or the misfortune of others. Which is not to say that the aim should not be making a freer, more fair world than this one. It＊s just to say that such improvements absolutely will not be achieved through binary arguments that predicate themselves on whether the poor are deserving or not.Victims are not always good. Messed-up people are not always good. Sometimes they＊re blissfully unaware that they＊re messed-up people. Do people ever think they＊re clever because they＊ve got a nice wee skunk-dealing business going but they still get food from the do-gooder suckers at the food bank? Of course. Privileged or socially excluded, some people are gits. The left just looks naive and childish when it asserts otherwise."															
" has filed for a form of bankruptcy in a desperate bid to stave off creditors and maintain essential services to its 3.4 million citizens, nearly half of whom live in poverty.Analysts lauded the decision by the insolvent US territory, which owes more than $70bn (?54bn) in public debt, as a way for the island to ※bring the debt back to sustainable levels, protect vulnerable communities and promote transparency§. But others 每  每 have deemed it little more than a bailout, with numerous Republicans in Congress demanding to know what went so wrong.※If Puerto Rico were a country, it would be the 13th most indebted country in the world,§ said Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA, an NGO that focuses on debt relief.※But this shows there really is some light at the end of the tunnel. This [bankruptcy] process is the first to deal with 100% of the [public] debt. It＊s unique in that it may set a precedent for how sovereign debt can be renegotiated in the world.§Puerto Rico＊s status as a US territory means that it is unable to restructure its debt as a state would, by invoking chapter nine of the US bankruptcy code.The government is instead initiating the insolvency process under the , a bill signed into action by former president Barack Obama, which calls for the bankruptcy case to be heard by a US federal judge.It is unclear how much of the debt would be restructured in court and what would be left to negotiate with bondholders. A fiscal plan indicates that Puerto Rico will now pay $800m a year in repayments, less than a quarter of what it owes, which has upset creditors.Puerto Rico＊s governor, Ricardo Rossell車, who announced the move on Wednesday after failing to convince creditors to accept a deal, said the territory had no other choice. ※We have reached this decision because it protects the best interests of the people of Puerto Rico,§ he said in a statement.A recession spanning decades 每 prolonged by the departure of multinational manufacturers, including ※big pharma§ companies 每 and the extensive brain drain to the US mainland has left Puerto Rico . Unemployment is twice that of the US and.On Friday, the Associated Press reported that Puerto Rico was closing 184 public schools in a bid to save millions of dollars. About 27,000 pupils will be relocated to other schools when the academic year ends this month.LeCompte said the restructuring could become a future example of how best to manage debt relief, particularly in developing countries that have high arrears and no means of paying them back.※This [could] promote transparency and enforce audits so we have a better understanding of what happened in Puerto Rico and how we got into this mess,§ he said. ※This is affecting an island where nearly 60% of the children are living in poverty 每 real, developing-world poverty, which is different from poverty in the mainland United States.§ But creditors have a very different view of the bankruptcy announcement, with some warning Puerto Rico could become  and others declaring it amounts to .Jon Borschow, a native Puerto Rican who created the Foundation for Puerto Rico, an NGO focusing on socioeconomic development, said the crises made filing for bankruptcy inevitable, but could spell a better future for the island.※We see a moving away from the export of physical goods, as we have done in the past, to the production of what we call ＆innovation＊ 每 the export of knowledge, technology and service, basically 21st-century exports,§ said Borschow. ※That＊s in the long term. In the short to medium term, we need to develop Puerto Rico as a destination, because we are a remarkably attractive destination for visitors from all around the world, and we believe we can readily double our visitor count over the next five years, generating an additional $7bn over that period.§Yet the most significant point raised for many Puerto Ricans has not been about solvency, but sovereignty.

"Low-income working families face significant reductions in income as a result of planned cuts to benefits,  (IFS).The thinktank says the freeze in benefit rates and cuts to child tax credit, coupled with the rollout of universal credit, which has become less generous as a result of changes to work allowances, signal ※large losses§ for low-income households.If the cuts announced in 2015 were fully in place now, nearly 3m working households with children on tax credits would be an average of ?2,500 a year worse off, with larger families losing more.The scheduled cuts for lower-income families come alongside tax breaks worth ?5bn a year that predominantly benefit middle- and higher-income households.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the IFS analysis showed the Conservatives posed a ※clear threat§ to working people＊s living standards, while the Liberal Democrats claimed the ※savage cuts§ would leave millions of households worse off. McDonnell said it revealed the ※stark choice§ facing voters between a Labour party that would stand up for the many and a Tory party that only looked after the privileged few: ※The Tories pose a clear threat to working people＊s living standards. Under Tory proposals cuts to in-work support will leave working families with children an average of ?2,500 a year worse off.§Although the average impact of tax and benefit changes since 2015 has been relatively small so far, planned benefit cuts will reduce government spending by about ?15bn a year in the long run, with the poorest working-age households facing losses of between 4% and 10% of income a year, the IFS says.The impact of the planned cuts on the poorest working-age families over the next five years will be much greater than those imposed during the 2010-15 coalition government. .Tom Waters, a research economist at the IFS, said: ※As suggested by the 2015 Conservative manifesto, the government have announced income tax cuts that mostly benefit middle- and higher-income households and working-age benefit cuts that mostly hit lower-income households. But while the tax cuts have largely already been delivered, most of the benefit cuts are yet to take effect.§The Lib Dem spokeswoman Susan Kramer said: ※Theresa May＊s plans for a divisive hard Brexit and savage cuts to benefits will leave millions of working families worse off. Three million households will be hit to the tune of ?2,500 a year as a result of cuts to tax credits, rising prices and the falling pound. ※The Brexit squeeze will hit people in the pocket across the country, with the poorest families hit hardest.§"															
															
"A proposal from the boss of the AA for drivers to receive an annual ※road miles§ allowance is among the ideas shortlisted for a ?250,000 competition to find new ways of funding the UK road network. , the president of the motoring organisation, has appeared on a shortlist of five entries to win the , this year awarded for ideas on how to fund better, more reliable roads.The submission, authored jointly with his wife, the business analyst Deirdre King, envisages a future where drivers receive an annual allowance of ※road miles§. As well as trading them, drivers could pay for the right to travel further by entering auctions or lotteries, which would raise more income to maintain the network. Other ideas include allowing companies to name roads after themselves as an incentive for them to ensure they are pothole-free.Additional road miles would be granted to drivers with special needs and those with the cleanest, greenest vehicles, King said. ※It＊s a way of giving free access to the road network but safeguarding further revenues rather than introducing a nationwide charging system that would be political suicide,§ he said.The Kings are joined on the shortlist by an eclectic mix of transport planners from Australia, a Hungarian graduate and a stay-at-home mother who is expecting her third child imminently. Sir John Kingman, the chairman of the judging panel, said that the hundred-plus entries, which were submitted anonymously to judges including the former Labour chancellor and transport secretary Alistair Darling, contained some ※quite funky ideas§, with a Harvard professor among those who had just failed to make the cut.He said the best entrants had thought deeply about the imminent technological future of , as well as the problem of how to fund roads with .

"he latest  released on Tuesday is the most positive for years, but it also highlights the continued risks from nationalistic and protectionist policies and the impact of policies and technology changes that reduce the share of income going to workers.For the past eight or nine years, the IMF world economic outlook has been pretty soul crushing. Dismal doesn＊t begin to convey the mood. Consider that the titles for the outlook have been such joyous reads as ※§, ※§, ※§, § and the one from April last year, ※§. So it is with some relief to see a bit of positivity infect the IMF. The most recent update, is titled, ※§The question mark of course lets us know that the folk at the IMF remain the sober pessimistic economists we know and love 每 and the blog post accompanying the report is titled ※§.But at least they do think things are on the improve 每 even if only for a while.In October last year the IMF was predicting Australia＊s GDP growing in 2017 by just 2.7% 每 they＊ve now increased that to 3.1% 每 the most optimistic they＊ve been since 2012.They are also more positive about growth in China, the US and very much so in the UK, where the worries of last year about the immediate impact of the  have been pushed out a few years:Across the world, the prediction is for global GDP growth of 3.5% this year 每 up from the prediction of 3.4% made last October. Most of the improvement is coming from a better outlook for advanced economies 每 especially in the Euro area:But the outlook beyond this year rather suggests that the answer to the IMF question about gathering momentum is ※nope§.The growth for 2018 is largely unchanged, except for the UK where there has been a big downgrade and the US, which has a big upgrade. The downgrade for the UK is due to the effects of Brexit, where the IMF predicts diminished medium-term growth prospects ※because of the expected increase in barriers to trade and migration§.And, crucially, the improvement in 2018 in the US is based on the assumption of ※a sizable fiscal stimulus in the United States, reflecting the anticipated changes in US federal government tax policy§.Given the difficulty Donald Trump apparently has doing anything other than finding his way to a golf course, and his utter incompetence in passing any major legislative measures, that is a very big assumption:Looking out to 2022 (which is so far off, that admittedly it is of limited worth), the IMF sees Australia＊s growth rarely going above the long-term average of 3%:The IMF however does predict the unemployment rate will fall below 5% 每 a much more optimistic outlook than it has had for the past two years:Mostly this increased optimism is because Australia exports iron ore, coal and gas. The IMF suggests that our economy will improve along with similar commodity-exporting nations like Norway and Canada. But this is based on the proviso that monetary policy remains ※accommodative§ (ie interest rates stay low) and there are ※supportive fiscal policies or infrastructure investment§ and ※less drag from declining investment in the commodity sector.§The IMF＊s outlook not only examined economic growth, it also researched the impact of economic policies and technological changes that have reduced the share of national income going to labour.The IMF found that over the past 25 years, the labour share of income has declined in 29 of the largest 50 economies:One measure of the labour share of income is the real unit cost of labour. In Australia there were substantial falls of this measure from 1999 until the GFC:The IMF suggests that across most nations, technological advancement is the main reason for the falls. It also found that the decline in share of income going to labour caused by technology and global integration ※has been particularly sharp for middle-skilled labour§ 每 with the biggest falls occurring in manufacturing.But while falling real unit labour costs are trumpeted by businesses as crucial for maintaining Australia＊s ※competitiveness§, the IMF found that there was a strong correlation between falling shares of income going to labour and increasing inequality.Looking at labour shares and  across advanced economies since 1961, the IMF found a clear link between the two 每 economies with lower shares of income going to labour were more likely to have higher levels of inequality:But crucially the IMF study also found that the differences were not just across different countries, but within countries. They found that as the labour share of income fell within countries, the level of inequality was also likely to rise:These results fit nicely with a new study  that found taxation ※reforms§ since the mid-1980s in Australia, New Zealand and Norway did nothing to improve economic growth, and instead just increased inequality 每 especially with more of the nations＊ incomes going to the richest 1%:The study＊s authors conclude, these tax reforms, which lowered the top tax rate and made the system less progressive, did not ※increase the size of the cake§, but did provide the wealthiest with a bigger share.In the period ahead, where the IMF, despite its muted optimism still predicts below average economic growth, the report highlights the importance of governments focusing on inequality. As the IMF outlook notes, ※inequality can fuel social tension, and recent research suggests that it can also harm economic growth.§Governments ignore inequality at their peril 每 not only because of the harm it will do to their own election prospects, but also the prospects to the economy.

"Growth in UK house prices has slowed but remains close to 5%, with faster growth seen outside , according to official data.House prices across the country increased 4.7% in the year to May, hitting an average of ?220,713, . The annual rate fell from 5.3% in April. Between April and May, prices were up 0.5%.House values rose in all regions, with the east of England still growing at the highest annual rate, of 7.5%, followed by the east Midlands at 7.2%.Analysts at Jefferies said: ※Despite the election and consistent doom-mongering, we note that house prices continue to increase.§The north-east registered the slowest annual growth, of 1.6%, followed by London at 3%. Prices in the capital are still more than twice as high as the UK average, at ?481,345.The most expensive borough to live in was Kensington and Chelsea, in west London, where the average property cost ?1.5m. In Burnley, Lancashire, the average house cost ?78,000. James Allen, head of alternative investments at financial services firm Walker Crips, said: ※It is clear that prime London may as well be a different country.§ He added that buyers in Kensington and Chelsea would need a deposit of ?450,000, based on a mortgage at 70% loan to value.※For a one-salary household, gross income would have to be ?222,000. The number of people in the UK earning more than ?200,000 is estimated to be 235,000 or 0.7%. When such a small proportion of the population can afford to live in a borough, demand must be coming from other quarters, namely foreign buyers.§The ONS uses data from the Land Registry. Its annual house price growth has slowed since mid-2016 but remains faster than the 2-3% growth reported by major mortgage lenders Halifax and . Analysts believe that a fresh slowdown is under way.Samuel Tombs of consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics is predicting that annual price growth will slow to 1.5% by the end of the year. He argued: ※Lenders are reporting that they will lend less in the third quarter and the recent pickup in wholesale funding costs suggests that they will not continue to cut mortgage rates. Meanwhile, the recent deterioration in consumer confidence, largely in response to the intensifying squeeze on real incomes, has made households less willing to make big ticket purchases.§The number of homes sold in the UK slumped 41% year-on-year in March, largely because the March 2016 figure was boosted by buyers rushing to complete before stamp duty changes the following month, the ONS said. In London, transactions fell even further, by 57% (and 62% in inner London).The housing slowdown means that the average home in Britain has increased just over ?3,000 in value (or ?16.79 a day) since the start of the year, according to analysis by Zoopla. The property website found the typical home was valued at ?304,469 as of 30 June, ?3,309 more than in January. By contrast, the average property value increased by ?13,852 in the same period last year.Belper in Derbyshire, Hove in East Sussex, Todmorden in West Yorkshire, Woodbridge and Sudbury in Suffolk are the towns that have seen the fastest house price growth since January, between 6.6% and 7.4%, according to Zoopla. Bexley and Swanley in Kent, Langport in Somerset, Worcester Park in south-west London and Holyhead in Anglesey round out the top 10 property hotspots, with price growth of more than 6%.However, values vary widely among the hotspots, from ?152,840 in Todmorden to ?492,850 in Worcester Park.Richmond in North Yorkshire, Leatherhead and Walton-on-Thames in Surrey, and Altrincham in Manchester were identified as coldspots, with the biggest percentage falls in values 每 at around 5%. Pwllheli in Gwynedd, Weybridge in Surrey, Southwell in Nottinghamshire, Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, Burnley and Pontefract in West Yorkshire have also seen prices fall since January, by more than 4%.Doug Crawford, chief executive of , said that despite the slight slowdown, ※the housing market is still simmering away nicely. Even though the overall growth rate has fallen, for first time buyers the slower rate of house price growth will be welcome, particularly with inflation running ahead of wages for many.§However, recent research conducted by his firm found that average deposits climbed to ?6,000 in the last year, with increases in some regions of more than 30%.Anne Baxendale of housing charity  said: ※While prices may be slowing in London, the idea of owning a home of your own is still just a fantasy for most people.※The government needs to change the rules of the game by introducing a fresh, new way of building homes that brings down the colossal cost of land and gives more powers to communities to deliver the genuinely affordable, high-quality homes that ordinary families are crying out for.§Rents are also going up.

Economists had expected the rate to be unchanged.The fall was mainly driven by lower petrol and diesel prices, reflecting weaker global oil prices. Fuel prices fell by 1.1% between May and June, compared with a 2.2% rise over the same month a year earlier. Lower prices of games and toys also contributed to the fall.However, at 2.6% inflation is still well above the Bank of England＊s 2% target, and signalled a sustained fall in real wages as prices rise faster than . , the TUC general secretary, said the government must act to halt the decline in living standards.※The government must stop this cost of living squeeze,§ she said. ※Many working people are caught in a vice as rising prices crush their pay. Ministers claim they are listening to struggling families. But now is the time to prove it. Britain needs a pay rise across the public and private sector.§A spokesperson for the Treasury acknowledged that some households were struggling financially.※While it is encouraging that inflation was lower this month, we appreciate that some families are concerned about the cost of living. That＊s why we have introduced the national living wage, which is helping to boost earnings by ?1,400 a year, and why we＊ve cut taxes for millions of people to help them keep more of what they earn. We are also increasing our free childcare offer to help 400,000 working parents.§Inflation has risen rapidly since the EU referendum in June last year, when the consumer prices index was just 0.5%. The surprise Brexit vote triggered  and drove up the cost of goods imported from abroad, making shop prices more expensive. The pound fell half a cent against the dollar to $1.3020 after the inflation data was published on Tuesday, as investors believed it lessened the likelihood of a rise in UK interest rates in 2017. The last time the  raised rates was in , before the global financial crisis took hold, and rates are currently at an all-time low of 0.25%.※Today＊s data casts doubt over a rate hike later this year,§ said James Smith, an economist at ING. ※Even if inflation does recover, the decision to hike rates still hinges on the growth outlook.※Bank of England governor Mark Carney recently suggested that the Bank needs to see stronger investment and a recovery in wage growth before tightening policy. But political uncertainty, the deteriorating outlook for consumer spending and rising cost bases from higher import prices mean that both look unlikely to materialise.§Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee and a senior economic adviser at the accountancy firm PwC, said inflation was likely to rise again in the coming months, reaching at least 3% in the second half of the year as the fall in the pound works its way through to shop prices. ※We have not necessarily passed the peak of inflation,§ he said. ※Consumers felt some respite from the inflation squeeze last month, but price rises are still likely to run ahead of wage increases for the rest of this year 每 continuing the current consumer squeeze and holding back economic growth.§Sentance said the Bank should follow the US Federal Reserve by starting to gradually raise interest rates.※If the Bank gradually raised interest rates that would help support the value of the pound so we would get less imported inflation and that might take some of the pressure off consumers,§ he told BBC Radio 4＊s Today programme before the inflation figures were published.However, David Blanchflower, another former member of the MPC and a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, said now is ※precisely the wrong time§ to raise UK rates.※Why would you want to have a self-inflicted wound at a time when  negotiations are taking place,§ he said. ※∫We have no idea how it＊s going to be resolved and that＊s obviously a big problem. Waiting and watching is sensible. My suspicion is this inflation is temporary and it will start to drop away.§"															
"n ideologically driven programme of cuts is almost certainly robbing us of life. Consistently rising life expectancy should be something we all take for granted. The UK, after all, is one of the wealthiest societies that has ever existed in human history. There are continuing dramatic improvements in medicine and technology. And yet new research by an ex-government adviser, Sir Michael Marmot,  每 a constant trend for a hundred years 每 has stalled since 2010. What happened that year, exactly? Was that not when David Cameron, George Osborne and their Lib Dem stooges began slashing public services with a false economic pretext?No, it＊s not that life expectancy is declining. That really would be the sign of a social calamity in a country as advanced as this. But we are still talking about the robbing of life. People＊s lives have been truncated, because they are not living as long as they should have done if the rate of increase had continued. And terrifyingly, this rate of increase is ※pretty close to having ground to a halt§, says Marmot. He is ※deeply concerned§ and ※expected it to just keep getting better§.Marmot does not make the claim that cuts are responsible. What he does say is that, in 2010, ministers made a ※political decision§ to cut spending; and he highlights the ※miserly§ recent spending on health and social care.Let us take a moment to reflect on what the Tories have done to this country. They made apocalyptic warnings of what would happen if they did not eliminate the deficit by 2015; they didn＊t get close, and now that target has vanished off to the distant mid-2020s. They added more debt then every Labour government. They battered disabled people with cuts and slashed support for the working poor. They presided over the longest squeeze in wages since the 19th century, and the worst peacetime record of housebuilding since the 1920s. And now we know they have presided over a fall in the rate of increase in life expectancy.And yes, the combined effects of the bankers＊ crash and austerity did kill in Britain. Until Lehman Brothers came toppling down, the . Then it began to climb again: hundreds of people died who 每 if the previous trend had continued 每 would still be with us today.

Human and social progress is grinding to a halt in Britain. Life is getting more insecure and poorer for millions 每 soon, it may even be getting shorter. That＊s why we don＊t just need a change in government in Britain, we need a change in how we organise our society.

"ou could call the men and women at  factory workers, but that wouldn＊t be the half of it. Try instead: some of the bravest people I＊ve ever met. Or: organisers of one of the most startling social experiments in contemporary Europe. And: a daily lesson from Greece to Brexit Britain, both in how we work and how we do politics.At the height of the Greek crash in 2011, staff at Viome clocked in to confront an existential quandary. The owners of their parent company had gone bust and abandoned the site, in the second city of Thessaloniki. From here, the script practically wrote itself: their plant, which manufactured chemicals for the construction industry, would be shut. There would be immediate layoffs, and dozens of families would be plunged into poverty. And seeing as Greece was , the workers＊ chances of getting another job were close to nil.So they decided to occupy their own plant. Not only that, . I spent a couple of days there a few weeks back, while reporting for Vice News Tonight on HBO, and it now looks like just an ordinary factory. Behind the facade, it has become the political equivalent of a Tardis: the more you look inside, the bigger the implications get.For a start, no one is boss. There is no hierarchy, and everyone is on the same wage. Factories traditionally work according to a production-line model, where each person does one- or two-minute tasks all day, every day: you fit the screen, I fix the protector, she boxes up the iPhone. Here, everyone gathers at 7am for a mud-black Greek coffee and a chat about what needs to be done. Only then are the day＊s tasks divvied up. And, yes, they each take turns to clean the toilets.Let that sink in. A bunch of middle-aged men and women who have spent their entire careers on the wrong end of barked orders about what to do and when to do it have seized ownership of their own workplace and their own working lives. They became their own bosses. And they immediately align themselves to principles of the purest equality possible.※Before, I was doing only one thing and had no idea what the others were doing,§ is how Dimitris Koumatsioulis remembers the factory when he started in 2004. And now? ※We＊re all united. We have forgotten the concept of ＆I＊ and can function collectively as ＆we＊.§The other massive change that has taken place is between the factory and its neighbours. When the workers ※recuperated§ their workplace (to use the local term), they could only do so with the help of Thessaloniki locals. Whenever representatives of the former owners came to requisition their equipment, as a court had given them permission to do, hundreds of residents would form a human chain in front of the plant (I contacted lawyers for Viome for comment but, despite assurances, no statement was forthcoming).When the workers consulted the local community about what they should start to produce, one request was to stop making building chemicals. They?now?largely manufacture soap and eco-friendly household detergents: cleaner, greener and easier on their neighbours＊ noses.Staff use the building as an assembly point for local refugees, and I saw the offices being turned over to medics for a weekly free neighbourhood clinic for workers and locals. The  by spending cuts, its handling of  sometimes atrocious; yet in both cases, the workers at Viome are doing their best to offer substitutes.Where the state has collapsed, the market has come up short and the boss?class has literally fled, these 26 workers are attempting to fill the gaps. These are people who have been failed by capitalism; now they reject capitalism itself as a failure.Another old-timer, Makis Anagnostou, talks of how their factory is proof ※that an alternative economy is feasible§. Contrast this with the way we normally think about work. At any large factory or office, security guards keep the outside world at bay. You check?your politics at the door, and listen to your line manager. We even talk about work-life balance as if the two were polar opposites. At Viome, they are combined. One of the results is a strong bond of?loyalty between the workers and their?community.The evening I arrived, swarms of people turned up for a fundraiser. They sat on plastic chairs in the middle of the storage warehouse and watched a play by Dario Fo, enacted by a national theatre company. The lead actress altered some of the lines to refer to this place and its business: ※They sell their soaps everywhere. And everyone is buying it!§ Cheers broke out among audience members, alongside some fervent dabbing of eyes.Viome is precious. It is also precarious. From the roof of the building, you can see the huge site owned by the parent company. It used to employ about 350 people; now the 26 men and women operate out of one small corner of the lot.They earn the same amount as they would receive in unemployment benefit. And when night falls, one of the workers stays on to stand guard 每 just in?case the old owners come back. During the day, a line of empty barrels acts as a barricade.For all its fragilities, Viome still  to any British visitor. In the year since the EU referendum, Britons have entered an era of bullshit sovereignty. Sofa-loads of politicians claim they ※get it§. They pretend to listen 每 yet hear only the answers they want. Dissenters are told they are ※talking Britain down§. Any actual outbreaks of democracy, such as members of the Labour party wanting more of a say over their representatives, are leapt upon as an instance of mob rule.Meanwhile, politics in Britain is retailed as what one said to another at some champagne reception.From Thessaloniki, you see all of that as the lie it is. Take back control? Just a means of allowing Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson some prime-time gurning. Referendums? Stuffed with lies and alarmism. If you＊re tired of ex-public schoolboys playing at populism, come and see what democracy looks like when exercised directly by the people themselves. Come to Viome."															
"Record levels of employment will fail to prevent the economy＊s growth rate slowing this year and next during a period when consumer spending will be squeezed by rising inflation and falling living standards, the consultancy firm  has predicted.PwC said action by the chancellor, , in his autumn budget would help offset weaker household spending and delayed investment by firms anxious about But it said the economy＊s growth rate was still expected to dip from 1.8% in 2016 to 1.5% this year and to 1.4% in 2018.John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said: ※Brexit-related uncertainty may hold back business investment, but this should be partly offset by planned rises in public investment. Fiscal policy could also be further relaxed in the 2017 autumn budget to offset the ongoing real squeeze on household spending power. ※There are still downside risks relating to , but there are also upside possibilities if negotiations go smoothly and the recent eurozone economic recovery continues. We expect the UK to suffer a moderate slowdown, not a recession, but businesses should be monitoring this and making contingency plans.§Like most forecasters, PwC was surprised by the resilience of the economy in the six months after the EU referendum in June 2016. Growth rates of 0.6% in the third quarter of 2016 and 0.7% in the fourth quarter meant expansion was stronger in the second half of the year than in the first half.But the consultancy firm said the economy had slowed markedly in the first half of 2017 and pointed to a sharp reduction in housing transactions as evidence of the blow to purchasing power caused by the decline in the value of the pound since the referendum.PwC said it expected house price inflation to fall from 7% in 2016 to 3.7% this year, with the previous property hot spot, London, receiving most of the backwash from the Brexit result.The London property market had been hit most by economic and policy uncertainty and the recent changes to stamp duty, the consultancy said. House price inflation in the capital in the first four months of 2017 was about 4% compared with about 13% in the same period last year. PwC said the city＊s housing market would continue to slow, with house prices likely to rise on average by 2.8% this year and by 3.8% in 2018. "															
															
															
"The government ran the first July budget surplus in more than a decade last month, as Britain＊s public finances recorded an unexpected leap back into the black with help from an increase in self-assessed tax payments. Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, was in surplus by ?184m, the first surplus in that month since 2002, . City economists had expected the government to record a ?1bn deficit. Receipts from self-assessed income tax increased by ?800m to ?8bn last month, compared with July 2016, giving the government the highest level of July self-assessed tax receipts since it started recording these payments in 1999. While the increase reflects rising numbers of self-employed workers, January and July are typically busier months for self-assessed returns. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said the figures were a welcome boost for the chancellor, , who now had a ※very decent chance§ of undershooting his 2017-18 fiscal target.※While a struggling economy and higher interest debt payments look likely to hamper the public finances over the coming months, the chancellor does look to have a very good chance of having some wiggle room in November＊s budget,§ he said.However, Britain is still in the red for the current financial year, as public sector net borrowing excluding state-owned banks increased by ?1.9bn to ?22.8bn in the four months to July, compared with a year ago. Analysts at Capital  expected the improvement last month to be a ※temporary blip§. ※Despite July＊s strength the chancellor may still find that he has little scope for any easing back on the planned fiscal squeeze in his November budget,§ said Ruth Gregory, UK economist., the Treasury＊s independent forecaster, expects ?58.3bn of public sector borrowing during the current financial year, an increase of ?13.2bn on the year ending March 2017.

"A drop in manufacturing output, a slowdown for the construction industry and a widening in Britain＊s trade deficit have doused expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates over the coming months.The pound dropped sharply against the dollar and euro on Friday after the latest signs that the economic resilience seen after last summer＊s Brexit vote has waned.A trio of  from the Office for National Statistics left traders scrambling to scale back earlier bets that policymakers could raise interest rates by the end of 2017 and perhaps as soon as next month. ※The data releases of the past week will help to dissuade the UK＊s monetary policy committee from a near-term rate hike,§ said Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec. ※Looking ahead, the household cash squeeze is set to remain a continued drag. And with the UK＊s more export focused manufacturing sector seemingly losing momentum, we see continued signs of a UK economy that is struggling to gain any serious pace.§The Bank＊s interest rate-setting committee has been  from their record low of 0.25% to keep inflation in check. Much of the debate has centred around whether  as households grapple with higher living costs.The latest figures showed exports did pick up between April and May but by less than imports. That meant the trade deficit widened more than expected, tempering hopes that the pound＊s sharp drop since the Brexit vote would drive a revival in exports because it made UK goods cheaper in overseas markets.Export volumes rose 2.5% in May while imports rose an even bigger 4.8%. That pushed the deficit on trade in goods to ?11.86bn in May from ?10.6bn in April.The deficit including trade-in services, which covers activities such as banking and legal services, widened by ?1bn to ?3.1bn, reflecting an increase in imports.※Net trade still is not compensating fully for the damage to households＊ spending power wrought by sterling＊s depreciation,§ said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ※The main problem remains that exporters have hiked their prices, blunting the boost to competitiveness from the weak pound.§The figures on manufacturing and the wider industrial sector, which includes utilities and mining, were all below economists＊ forecasts. Output fell on a monthly basis and also on the less volatile measure of three-months on three-months.For May alone, a drop in car production helped knock overall manufacturing output down by 0.2% from April, confounding forecasts for a 0.5% rise.The construction sector also suffered a slowdown in May, with output down 1.2% on the month, defying forecasts for a 0.7% pick-up. The figures follow news that . Business surveys since then have suggested that  as companies grapple with higher costs, weaker consumer spending and skills shortages.Friday＊s figures painted ※a rather bleak picture for the UK economy and underline the challenges lying ahead,§ said Kay Daniel Neufeld, senior economist at the Centre for  and Business Research consultancy.Based on the latest data, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimated the economy grew 0.3% in the second quarter, barely faster than the 0.2% expansion in the first quarter and well below the long-run trend of 0.6%.But Ruth Gregory at the consultancy Capital Economics said she was expecting growth to accelerate to 0.4% in the second quarter.She saw some encouraging signs in the trade figures with the three-month growth rate of goods export volumes in May outpacing growth in imports.※Meanwhile, the production and construction sectors only account for around 20% of the economy, and the hard data available for the services sector so far suggests that growth has rebounded strongly after a poor start to the year,§ she said."															
"The European Union is prepared to impose countermeasures within days if Donald Trump takes action to protect the US steel industry, the  president has said.In one of the most serious warnings of a tit-for-tat response if the US resorts to protectionist measures,  said the EU was ※in elevated battle mood§. Targets could include American whiskey exports.Speaking at the start of the  summit in Hamburg, he said: ※I don＊t want to tell you in detail what we＊re doing. But what I would like to tell you is that within a few days 每 we won＊t need two months for that 每 we could react with countermeasures.※I am telling you this in the hope that all of this won＊t be necessary. But we are in an elevated battle mood.§Buoyed by its , the EU is determined to defend the multilateral trade system, with officials warning the US not to take any measures against either Germany or China＊s steel industries.The EU, it is understood, is likely to retaliate by focusing on US agricultural products. Officials confirmed one target might be bourbon whiskey, one of the main exports of the state of Kentucky, the home of Mitch McConnell, the US Senate majority leader.The EU is hoping to divide the Republicans by warning that Republican protection for the rust best will lead to EU retaliation in the American farm belt.The EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr?m, has said she is ※extremely worried§ about a US threat to curb steel imports for national security reasons, saying the step could trigger protectionist reactions around the world.Trump launched an inquiry into steel imports in April that is likely to report in the coming days.US trade law allows the president to unilaterally ※adjust§ imports should the Department of Commerce find evidence of a national security threat from foreign shipments.Trump has ,  and .Malmstr?m has warned that any unilateral US action would lead to a reference to the World Trade Organization.The large global steel surplus has mainly been caused by China, even as Chinese steel exports to the US have been declining.Total US steel imports last year amounted to 26m tonnes, of which 3.2m were shipped from the EU by companies such as Thyssenkrupp AG, Salzgitter and Celsa Group. The EU shipments were worth 2.8bn ($3.1bn), according to the European Steel Association.EU officials insisted they were happy to examine allegations of Chinese steel dumping, but could not endorse any unilateral measures, even if only trained on China. ※Even if we are not the target, we will be collateral damage in this process, which is going to hit  very hard,§ Malmstr?m said. Other countries likely to be affected include South Korea and Japan.The dispute adds edge to the dispute under way between diplomats over the wording of the G20 communique on trade. The G20, normally an advocate of free trade, is likely to avoid a wording clash by referring to free and fair trade. The communique of the recent G7 in Sicily referred to support for fighting protectionism and a rules-based international order.Trump declared the opening of the steel investigation ※a historic day for American steel and most importantly for American steel workers§, suggesting he would like it to back protectionist measures.Only two US presidents 每 Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford 每 have granted relief under section 232 of the 1962 trade law, citing national security concerns stemming from the global oil crisis of the 1970s. The European council president, Donald Tusk, also revealed some members of the G20 were opposing words in the draft communique supporting sanctions, and asset freezes being imposed on Libyan smugglers of refugees. Neither Tusk nor his officials would identify the country mounting the resistance, but he described the culprit＊s actions as cynical."															
"t＊s a surreal to see an idea dreamed up in the pub by a bunch of your mates make national news. So I discovered yesterday, when the leaders of the  (SOS) campaign, accompanied by the actor Steve Coogan, delivered their ※message in a bottle§ to Downing Street in protest at the Tories＊ proposed . Anna Cole and Alison Ali, two of the women who founded the campaign in Brighton only a few months ago, handed in thousands of messages of love for their schools written by children from across the country, including contributions from Birmingham, Manchester and the Isle of Wight.As the parent of a child at a Brighton primary school, I have watched in admiration as a group of mums whom I bump into on the school run transformed their outrage about the planned ?3bn education cuts into a nimble, creative and highly effective political campaign.It all happened so fast: after that pub conversation last winter, they took the plunge and organised a launch in March. Within two weeks the campaign＊s  had 800 likes and 10,000 reactions to its posts. In May, parents and headteachers unfurled protest banners outside 55 schools across Brighton and Hove; and the campaign held a ※school assembly§ gathering in local parks that brought together 1,500 children, teachers and parents.It seems eminently possible that SOS, with its strong network of parents raising awareness at the school gates, influenced the general election result in Brighton Kemptown, where Labour＊s . Russell-Moyle said that school cuts were one of the biggest issues on the doorstep.None of the organisers 每 and they are all women 每 in the SOS core group had done any large-scale political organising before. ※Doing the campaign has made me think of the miners＊ strike, when women got radicalised, and came together,§ says Catherine Fisher, one of the founders. She and her fellow SOS-ers have used WhatsApp and video conferencing to organise around work and family commitments, texting and speaking after bedtimes, or getting together in the park after school.It seems that the grim old age of austerity has a flip side: we are living through a golden era of dissent. A study by David Bailey at Birmingham University has found that not only has the number of  in the years since 2008 (from 95 per year between 2000 and 2008, to an average of 154 per year between 2009 and 2016), but the kind of people involved in protests has changed. Back in the 1980s, political protest was dominated by organised labour, using tried-and-tested methods such as strikes and marches. Protest now is so much more colourful and various; Bailey describes an ecosystem of different protest groups, from workers and professionals to environmentalists and housing pressure groups. Their methods, too, have multiplied: OK, there are a lot of , but we＊ve also seen , and, and the anti-fracking group  baring their bottoms outside the Department for Energy and Climate Change.And that＊s exciting, isn＊t it? It＊s a far cry from the desultory years under New Labour, which now seem like a cultural black hole, protest-wise. Perhaps activism didn＊t feel so necessary then: society was less unequal and public services were better funded. Campaigns that did gain traction were either ignored 每 the impact and legacy of the government carrying on with its Iraq plans as if  can hardly be overstated 每 or, in the case of the G8 and anti-capitalism protests, kettled into submission.So I, for one, mean to enjoy this golden age to the full. As one of the SOS mums said to me, ※You just reach a point at which you think: if I don＊t do this, then who will?§ Ironically, this may be the very spirit of the ※big society§ that the Tories espoused, long ago. They are learning that you should be careful what you wish for."															
"atch Theresa May scramble in the shadow of no majority and the subsequent paper-thin Queen＊s speech and it＊s as if government as we know it has been entirely disbanded. While EU negotiations and a costly DUP deal take centre stage (and ?1bn of public money) a domestic policy agenda is missing in action.This would be disturbing at the best of times, but it is happening as Britain teeters on the edge of its worst living-standards crisis in modern politics.For proof, just look at two stories from the last week alone. More than 1 million households living in private rented accommodation are at risk of becoming homeless by 2020 because of rising rents, benefit freezes and a lack of social housing, . The Tory ideal of a family being able to buy their own home is near fantasy: this study shows that rising numbers of people can＊t pay even the lowest available rents to keep a roof over their heads.Meanwhile the University of Oxford has published the  每 a spotlight on poverty through Britain＊s food parcels. It found that four in five Trussell Trust food bank users are severely food insecure: that means skipping meals and going without eating 每 sometimes for days at a time. Over half couldn＊t afford heating or toiletries. One in five had slept rough in the last year. The Trussell Trust calls this ※multiple forms of destitution§: where a person can＊t afford deodorant, a hot meal, or the rent.I could think of a few other terms: perhaps a stain on the national conscious. That stain gets darker still when we see the people behind the figures. Three-quarters are suffering from ill health, or live with someone who does. A third are affected by mental health problems. Over half are disabled, or share a home with someone who is.※I can make a meal out of a tin of beans. Sometimes there＊s not a lot in the cupboard, you know?§ Richard, 57, explains from his one-bed flat in Kingston upon Thames. Richard has a degenerative spinal disease as well as arthritis and breathing problems: a walking frame is his only way to move around the flat, and he needs a ventilator at night. It＊s been over a decade since he was well enough to work 每 as a stager fitter and then a chauffeur 每 and his only income is disability living allowance. His wife is a nurse but with no pay NHS rise in years, in Richard＊s words, the two of them are ※absolutely broke§.Richard has gum problems but he can＊t afford a dentist. The rent on the flat alone sets them back ?1,100 a month. It＊s one of eight crammed into a converted Victorian house. The walls are so thin, Richard explains, that they can hear their neighbours＊ conversations at night. ※I paid ?35 a week in my teens round here,§ Richard tells me. ※Nowadays, people just think of a number and double it.§After rent, council tax, gas and electric, there＊s not much left for food. Richard stretches the basics: mince, potatoes, beans and toast, and a box of tomatoes from the local market. ※I＊ve turned into a good cook,§ he says, with a small laugh. Last November, they went to the local food bank 每 ※lovely people§, Richard says 每 after another evening with nothing in the kitchen. They haven＊t been back since: Richard says he＊s too embarrassed. ※My wife didn＊t like to, you know. Pride,§ he adds. ※But I know we might need to again ＃ It was nice to know someone cares.§When food banks first started to spread across Britain, there was rightful outrage that families in one of the richest countries in the world could ever need a charity food parcel. But the new scandal is that often food poverty is no longer a one-off emergency but rather a long-term way of living: eating cereal for dinner one week and then, next month, doing it again.Chronic hunger is the painful product of an era in which a full-time nurse 每 let alone someone stuck on a zero-hours contract, or who is too ill to work 每 has to battle between rent, food, and bills. Grimly, Oxford University found that the average income of families in the month before using a food bank is ?320. Some had no income at all.※It is sometimes scoffed at, but the fact is, there is much greater awareness of food banks than was the case previously,§ the new welfare and pensions secretary, David Gauke,  when asked about the rise in food bank use. Gauke was announcing that  despite rising food prices. With little sense of irony, he did it over a lobby lunch.As the details of the Tories＊ deal with the DUP comes out, this sort of policy and rhetoric is going to become increasingly unpalatable to the public. The message from May is clear: there＊s no money to ease the suffering of people going to food banks or losing their homes but plenty to keep herself and her party in power.In the coming months, Jeremy Corbyn 每 ever more comfortable in his role 每 can continue to present Labour as the only party willing to help families get a decent standard of living. May and ministers can pretend it is business as usual all they like. There is no starker sign of a government＊s decline than when it becomes normal for its citizens to go hungry."															
															
															
"The government＊s spending deficit is on course to worsen this year as official figures show the economic slowdown is beginning to take a toll on the UK＊s public finances.As ministers struggle with  on health, police and social care, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said public borrowing was narrowly lower in May than the same month last year. Public sector net borrowing excluding the nationalised banks was ?6.7bn, down from ?7.1bn a year earlier and slightly below the consensus expectation of ?6.8bn.But analysts said this still meant the government would fail to meet its previous plan of reducing the deficit in every year of the parliament, with the gap between government income and spending heading towards ?58bn, compared with ?47bn last year.The  since the start of the year as the prospect of  and the lower value of the pound fed through into increased inflation, causing .The chancellor, , revised the government＊s pledge to bring down the deficit in his autumn statement last year when he set a  by the middle of the next decade, rather than his predecessor＊s forecast of 2020.The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury＊s independent forecaster, expects public sector net borrowing to increase this year and then resume its downward path.Revisions by the ONS to last year＊s deficit show it was better than expected at 2.4% of GDP, compared with the previous estimate of 2.6%. Scott Bowman, the UK economist at Capital , said the 2016-17 figure was flattered by a series of one-off sources of revenue and the prospect for 2017-18 was for the deficit to increase for the first time since 2010.※We still think that borrowing for the fiscal year as a whole will increase by several billion pounds as a number of one-off factors that lowered borrowing in 2016-17 unwind,§ he said. ※What＊s more, the election result suggests that the planned forthcoming fiscal squeeze may be scaled back slightly.§Yael Selfin, the chief UK economist at accountancy firm KPMG, said: ※Since the ＆great recession＊ we have seen a period of gradual improvements, but expected headwinds are now likely to put significant pressure on public finances. ※A slowing economy, a potential hefty exit payment to the EU and an eventual gradual rise in borrowing costs are all coming the UK＊s way. Taken together, this may leave little room for the government to satisfy public demands for an end to austerity.§A Treasury spokeswoman said: ※We have reduced the deficit by three-quarters since 2010, but there is still further to go. We are committed to bringing the public finances back to balance by the middle of the next decade, building a stronger economy that can deliver higher living standards for people across the country.§Bowman said  earlier this week showed he intends to stick to the fiscal rules set out in the November autumn statement, meaning ※fiscal policy is still set to provide a significant drag on GDP growth over the next few years§.Ross Campbell, the public sector director at accountants＊ body ICAEW, said any easing of austerity should be directed at increasing growth. ※The hung parliament increases the uncertainty associated with Brexit, while also diverting resources and attention away from the economy. This could negatively impact the health of the public finances. As a result, and in order to deliver credible fiscal plans, it＊s important that government puts strong financial leadership at the top of its priority list,§ he said.※There have been signals from government that we are likely to see an end to austerity and therefore a possible increase in public spending. With the economy still in a fragile state, it＊s important that any increased expenditure is allocated to areas that will help to drive economic growth 每 infrastructure, training and fiscal stimulus.§The fall in borrowing announced on Wednesday was due to an increase in central government revenue of ?2.6bn outweighing higher expenditure of ?2.2bn. The strong revenue growth partly reflected a 4.3% rise in VAT receipts, although recent shopping trends appear to show this will weaken in the coming months.The  said in a separate report that  were leaving people with less money to spend on non-essentials such as furniture and eating out.Households were also starting to feel the pinch from increased clothing prices and utility bills,  from the Bank＊s team of regional agents, based on discussions with businesses across the UK."															
"The inconclusive outcome of Britain＊s snap election will complicate and probably delay  negotiations that were due to start next week, a leading credit rating agency has warned.Moody＊s, one of the big financial bodies that assigns credit scores to governments, said Theresa May＊s  would also hurt the UK＊s standing on international debt markets because it was likely to result in more public borrowing.As the pound fell for the second consecutive session on Monday, a senior economist at another ratings agency, Standard & Poor＊s, warned that  would be weakened further by the latest bout of political instability.※In terms of the outlook for growth, it＊s clear that things are not going in the right direction,§ S&P European chief economist Jean-Michel Six told the AJEF association of financial journalists in Paris.※This latest bit of instability can only weaken the business environment and consumer confidence,§ Six said, .He also played down a view in the markets that the Conservatives＊ reduced standing would lead to a soft Brexit deal. ※On the contrary, I think it＊s possible to imagine a scenario, likely but not certain, in which Mrs May seeks to push for a very hard line towards the EU to show to her own party that she＊s holding the course,§ said Six.Moody＊s, by contrast, said the UK could well end up with a soft Brexit deal on the back of last week＊s election result, which saw Labour significantly increase its number of seats in parliament. But the ratings agency also warned of a delay to Brexit talks due to start on 19 June or ※at least a period in which no substantive issues are discussed§. That would mean the UK loses precious negotiating time as the clock ticks towards an exit date set for March 2019 每 two years on from May triggering article 50.※The UK government will ＃ be under significant time pressure in these negotiations. Given the tight deadline, it will be imperative in our view for the government to secure an agreement for a transition period,§ said Kathrin Muehlbronner, senior vice president at Moody＊s investors service.She added that the election outcome would be widely interpreted as indicating a pronounced shift away from May＊s ※hard Brexit§ objectives, focused on exit from the single market and EU customs union, tightening of immigration rules for EU nationals and a rejection of the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.※While it is unclear at this stage which changes to its strategy the government will contemplate, it may be that ＆softer＊ versions of Brexit will now be considered,§ added Muehlbronner.Moody＊s  to put it one notch below at Aa1. on 24 June last year, the day after the EU referendum.In Monday＊s update, it said recent political developments were ※credit negative§ given that the government was likely to put plans to cut the deficit on hold.Economic indicators in the months following the referendum suggested businesses and consumers had shrugged off the result and the UK economy was  in 2016.

"The governor of , Ricard Rossell車, has announced that he is to visit Washington in the next phase of his campaign to turn the island into the 51st state of the United States.Rossell車 will go to the US capital armed with a 97% backing for statehood from voters in  on the future of the stricken US colony. But he faces an uphill struggle impressing his case on the US Congress, which holds ultimate power over Puerto Rico, given the historically low turnout of the vote and the boycott staged by opposition parties.The governor, a 38-year-old member of the ruling Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP), insisted the referendum sent a clear and strong message to Washington. ※From today, the federal government will no longer be able to ignore the voice of the majority of the American citizens in Puerto Rico. It would be highly contradictory for Washington to demand democracy in other parts of the world, and not respond to the legitimate right to self-determination that was exercised today in the American territory of Puerto Rico,§ he said after the vote.But observers of Puerto Rico＊s long and tortured relationship with its vastly more wealthy and powerful overlord scoffed at the idea that the plebiscite would have any impact. They pointed to a  of the territory＊s 2.3 million registered voters 每 a dismal figure on an island that regularly has participation rates of 60% or 70%.As the columnist of , Wilda Rodr赤guez, put it: ※Until yesterday, the participation of Puertorriquenos in elections was a cause of national pride. After yesterday it＊s officially trivial.§In Sunday＊s referendum, the final tally stood at 518,199 overall voters. Of those, 97% voted to become the 51st state, 1.5% voted for full independence or a form of sovereignty, and 1.3% in favour of the status quo.The tiny vote for the two alternative positions on the ballot forms were in no small part a reflection of the boycott launched against they plebiscite by the opposition Partido Popular Democr芍tico (PPD) and the independence movement.The standing of this tropical Caribbean island in relation to the US has been , and dominant topic of local conversation, ever since it was handed to Washington as war booty at the end of the Spanish-American war of 1898. In 1917, the islanders were granted US citizenship, but they continue to labour under a political half-life in which they can elect their own local government and governor but cannot vote in federal elections.Several glaring anomalies arise from this colonial pact. One of the more poignant is the fact that Puerto Ricans can serve in the US military and be sent into battle by a president whom they cannot elect.The constraints placed on the population by a distant colonial power have had a particularly destructive impact in the last few years when Puerto Rico＊s lack of economic flexibility has contributed to a devastating financial crisis. The debt burden combined with unmet pensions now stand at more than $120bn, and  have been imposed by a fiscal control board that exerts federal oversight over the budget.The likelihood that the US Congress will want to take on Puerto Rico as a fully-fledged state of the union at the time of such financial meltdown is seen by most observers as slight to none. On top of that comes the nature of Puerto Rico linguistically, culturally and racially in terms of its integration with the larger power.※This brings out the worst in the US Congress,§ said Dr Amilcar Barreto, a specialist in Puerto Rican politics at Northeastern University in Boston. ※To be blunt, it brings out the racist side of Congress. To admit to the union a Spanish-speaking, racially-diverse population 每 hell no.§"															
"ne of the most crucial things we will be deciding  is who we want running our economy and with what economic policies behind them.But a  suggests that millions of us don＊t feel we have the information we need to do so. As many as 55% of us feel the information we receive from the media about the economy during election time is not useful enough to allow us to cast our vote with confidence. Furthermore, 54% feel uncertain about what impact the economic stories we do come across will have on us.You only need to look at Wednesday＊s  to see how many abstract metaphors and jargon-filled phrases make their way into political campaigns at election time.Take Amber Rudd＊s incessant repetition of the phrase ※We need a strong economy§. If an economy is simply the collective result of the efforts of our workers and the resources we have available for the goods and services we need to survive, the adjective ※strong§ does little to clarify how the Conservatives will improve it. Beyond a nod to ※good wages for public servants§, Rudd did little to shed light on the precise policies her party proposed, despite asking viewers for their trust and their vote.Jeremy Corbyn＊s response to a question on how Labour would handle Brexit was no better at explaining in clear terms what the British people could expect from his government. His exact words were that Labour would ensure ※tariff-free access for a growing economy§ 每 a phrase likely to mean little to the vast majority of the country. Tariffs are simply taxes added to goods and services being sold abroad. British businesses are understandably concerned about whether exiting the EU will harm their ability to sell goods to European markets. For the majority of people, the question of Brexit is not about achieving a ※growing economy§ 每 a 2015 survey on economic understanding showed that 60% of the population doesn＊t know what GDP is, let alone think about it day to day. Assuring Britons that their businesses, jobs and wages will be protected by Brexit is a far more important message than what it means for ※growth§.It＊s not hard to see how this has happened. Young people are not taught economics at school, and few economists are taught to communicate with the public. Meanwhile, journalists work under challenging time pressures to unpick and translate obfuscating messages from politicians, complex reports from thinktanks and financial institutions, and jargon-tastic analysis from economists.But research shows people want to feel equipped with the tools to engage. A  for the Economics Network and ING last month showed that over 75% of the UK public think economics should be taught to all children in schools. A  for the  revealed that among those who speak about the economy no more than two or three times a month, only 1% see it as unimportant.※It just doesn＊t grip you,§ said one participant in a recent focus group convened by Economy, a charity I work for that tries to make economics more accessible. ※You have to, sort of, break yourself into the news, find all these words out, find out what they mean, go back to the news, read it again and then you might have a full understanding of it,§ says another. Another says: ※They don＊t seem to speak in English, they don＊t seem to speak in terms that I can understand.§People directly connect this sense of confusion about the language surrounding economic policies to a feeling of powerlessness in the political system. When asked how much power they felt they had in relation to the economy, another focus group member responded: ※Not powerful at all. I feel my vote is not worthy＃ They never explain how they＊ve reached the conclusion they have, or why.§The next generation of economists is increasingly aware of the need to learn better communication skills. Economics undergraduates have formed the  to challenge their lecturers to debate how the subject should be taught; they aim to take it away from the dry mathematical formulae that dominate teaching, and include discussions about the financial crisis and more down-to-earth areas that affect the public.My charity has spoken to everyone from 10-year-olds to 65-year-olds about what they want from economics, and from the politicians, economists and journalists who communicate about it in the public sphere.It＊s on all of us to start talking about the economy in a clear way, so that everyone can get involved in the conversation. It is the single most repeated request in every focus group we convene 每 ※Just tell me how it all affects me, in my language§.We＊ve got a week left until the election. That＊s plenty of time for everyone to make sure that messages on the economy are engaging, accessible and empowering."															
"The shops were full of punters. Online retailers coined it in. Spring brought with it an end to the winter consumer spending blues.That at least is what the official figures suggest. , smashing City expectations. It was enough, in combination with Donald Trump＊s political woes in Washington, to send the pound back through the $1.30 level to its highest since last September.But hang on a minute. This is the same Office for National Statistics that said earlier this week that  because wages were failing to keep pace with prices. Something doesn＊t quite add up.One explanation is that the ONS has got its seasonal adjustment wrong. The late timing of Easter this year would be expected to lead to a rise in spending between March and April and the ONS tries to make an allowance for this. But it is not an exact science, which is why the monthly movements in retail sales often look quite dramatic. April＊s big rise followed a 1.4% fall between February and March.The weather also has an impact, particularly for certain sectors of retailing. April was a relatively warm month, which tends to increase footfall in the high street. Garden centres seem to have done especially well.A less benign explanation is that consumers are either ignoring the squeeze on their real incomes or are oblivious to it. If so, expect to see an increase in consumer debt over the coming months.This, though, does not square with what happened in the first few months of 2017, when consumers did seem to be tightening their belts after spending freely in the second half of 2016. Despite record levels of employment and ultra-low interest rates, there was a marked slowdown in retail activity.All of which suggests that the April increase in retail sales should be treated with some caution. The ONS always suggests that looking at retail sales over the latest three months is a better guide to what＊s happening than a single month＊s data, and that advice is particularly apposite here.Between the three months ending in January and the three months ending in April, retail sales volumes rose by 0.3%. That looks about right and fits with the general picture of an economy that is not about to plunge into recession but is not exactly firing on all cylinders either.has much to say about consumer protection. Action is pledged to help motorists, rail passengers, leaseholders and phone users. Despite the derision heaped on Ed Miliband when he proposed the self-same policy two years ago, there will be a price cap on energy bills, which ministers estimate would be worth ?1.7bn a year to households.There is, though, one big omission from the list: help for people buying their own homes on standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages, who could save themselves money by moving to a cheaper home loan deal.This is curious for three reasons. Firstly, the savings are considerably higher than for the energy cap. Banking analysts at Bernstein note that it is possible to get a two-year fixed rate mortgage at 1.4% while the 35% of mortgage payers on SVRs are paying 4.2% (on average). If they remortgaged at the market interest rate of between 2.2% and 2.6% they would save themselves between ?5bn and ?7bn a year. Lloyds, by virtue of owning the Halifax, would stand to be the biggest losers.Secondly, savings of this size would ease the pressure on living standards and help the economy through its current sticky patch. The evidence suggests that those on SVRs tend to be lower-income households in the poorer regions of Britain. They would spend any windfall they received from a lower mortgage rate.Finally, there is a simple mechanism by which the government could effect change. Competition in the mortgage industry means that people are coming off SVRs albeit at a slow rate. But lenders that are charging what are effectively rip-off mortgage rates have received more than ?100bn in cut-price funding from the Bank of England in recent years. That provides the government with considerable leverage. It should not hesitate to use it.Returning to Lloyds, the government＊s disposal of its stake in the bank - which once stood at 43% 每 has prompted speculation that its boss Ant車nio Horta-Os車rio will now consider it job done and head for the exit. The Portuguese banker seems to be trying to quash such talk: he spent ?36,000 on shares on Wednesday, not usually the actions of an executive about to walk."															
"A surprise surge in retail sales in April helped push the pound to its highest level in eight months as Britain＊s consumers shrugged off .Warm weather and the Easter holidays encouraged shoppers back onto UK high streets, with retail sales up 2.3% over the month according to the . It was more than double the 1% rise forecast by economists, and the biggest monthly rise since January 2016.April＊s rise was a significant rebound compared with March, when sales fell 1.4%, easing fears of an imminent consumer slowdown and signalling a decent start to the third quarter. The stronger-than-expected figures were at odds with broader expectations of a slowdown in consumer spending this year, as prices begin to outpace wage growth, putting increasing pressure on household budgets.Falling real pay is already a reality for UK workers, with  每 slower than the 2.3% rate of inflation in the same period.※The latest data showed shoppers continued to shrug off any Brexit and political uncertainty with retail sales beating even the most optimistic expectations,§ said Richard Lim, chief executive of the consultancy Retail .※Despite the surge in inflation and squeeze on households＊ finances, consumers were out in force during the Easter break with the warm weather driving sales across the sector.§The UK has relied heavily on consumers to drive growth since the financial crisis, with other sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and construction taking a bigger hit.However, with inflation expected to pick up to about 3% and pay growth expected to remain weak, household budgets are likely to come under increasing pressure.Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said that despite the strong retail figures in April, he expected the consumer slowdown to materialise in the coming months, which in turn would weigh on the wider economy. ※With inflation likely to continue accelerating sharply, the headwinds facing the consumer will intensify, which in turn is likely to slow the pace of consumer spending later in the year. We therefore remain of the view that the pace of GDP growth has further downside into the end of the year.§The rise in April was fairly broad based, with sales in non-food stores up by 2.3% and sales at supermarkets and other food stores up by 1.3%. However, department store sales were down by 0.9%.The April jump helped retail sales over a broader three-month period grow by 0.3%. This followed a brief period of contraction. The annual rate of growth doubled to 4% from 2% in March.The stronger-than-expected figures pushed the pound as high as $1.3045 at one point on Thursday 每 its highest against the dollar since 29 September last year 每 partly as traders brought forward their expectations for an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. The pound has fallen sharply since the Brexit vote last June, and at $1.30 it is still 13% lower against the dollar than it was on the day of the referendum.Sterling＊s strength on Thursday was also a story of dollar weakness, as US investors grew increasingly nervous about the controversy surrounding .Investor jitters spread to European stock markets, with most major indices closing down. In the UK, the FTSE 100 closed down 0.9% at 7,436, while Germany＊s DAX and France＊s CAC were down 0.3% and 0.5% respectively.In the US, markets were slightly higher after suffering their biggest one-day fall since September on Wednesday.※European equities are now fully entangled in the Trump-related sell-off. On Wednesday the US market bore the brunt of the move but now it has gone global,§ said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK.※The gains that were made at the beginning of the month are quickly evaporating, and dealers are looking to dump their stocks. Trump has been close to controversy for some time now, but a story like this will hang around, and that is precisely the reason why traders want to exit the market.§"															
"Theresa May said she wanted to be honest about the ※difficult decision and trade-offs§ that the country faces as she unveiled a plan to make older people and their families pay more of the costs of social care.She  to change the care system with three ※connected§ measures that expand the current system of charging for those looked after in residential homes to those who who are looked after in their own homes.At the moment people who are looked after in residential homes must pay for their care if they are judged to have assets worth more than ?23,250 and those assets include their property. The thinking behind this was mainly practical. The person affected must leave their home to obtain the care they need and the care is very expensive. This justified the forced sale of the main residence. Thousands of people every month are forced to sell their homes to pay for residential care under the scheme.Those people who are able to stay in the home receive domiciliary care. Until now they have had to pay if their savings total more than ?23,250, and their property was excluded.Care is free when an individual＊s total savings fall below a lower limit of ?14,250 with a sliding scale of contributions towards care costs between the lower and higher limits.Under the new scheme, those people who use residential and domiciliary care will face the same charging structure. They will be assessed to get a picture of their finances and if their combined savings and property are valued at more than ?100,000, they will need to pay for their care.If they want to hang on to their home, they can defer payment. The state will deduct the cost from their estate when they die. Local authorities already offer a Deferred Payment Agreement (DPA) which allows people to secure care fees against their home once the property is sold, which can be on their death, or sooner, if they choose. The cost includes interest payments charged by the council.The House of Commons library noted in March that the overall adult population grew by 10% between 2001 and 2011 but the number of adults aged over 65 grew by 11% and those aged 85 rose by 24% in the same period. People aged over 85 are most likely to need care. A report by King＊s College London said the number of people dying from dementia is expected to rise from 59,000 in 2014 to 219,000 in 2040.A social care precept was introduced to allow local authorities to increase council tax levels 每 initially by up to 2% extra, later by up to 3% 每 while reforms to a housebuilding scheme freed up a further ?240m for an ※adult social care support grant§ for 2017/18. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, sought to raise ?2bn for social care by hiking national insurance contributions for the self-employed. But this was scrapped within days, amid claims it broke a 2015 manifesto pledge to cap the main tax rates. The government has scrambled since then to find an alternative.It is not clear whether an interest rate will be applied to charges if payment is delayed until death. It is not clear how care will be provided when it is largely carried out by foreign-born labour and the manifesto pledges to cut immigration to the tens of thousands. It is not clear how people receiving care will be protected from over-charging by private domiciliary care providers, which may seek to exploit clients who can pay more once their home is included in the calculation of savings and wealth.The Tories are likely to to face criticism for making those people unlucky enough to lose out in the lottery of serious illnesses in old age being penalised again by having all their assets above ?100,000 being sequestrated by the state.Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green party, was among many to call the move a ※dementia tax§ because someone with dementia who stays at home or enters residential care could find that their suffering is multiplied by state charges of between ?200,000 to ?300,000 after a four- or five-year stay.Social services chiefs have warned that the new charges could discourage the elderly from seeking support from their local authority, preferring instead to wait until they need nursing care, which is free under the NHS.In the 2015 election, when the Labour party put forward plans for a surcharge on estates to pay for social care, its plan was based on everyone sharing the cost. The Conservatives said a 15% ※death tax§ in addition to the inheritance levy of 40% on estates worth more than ?330,000 could mean a levy of ?46,000 for the average Briton.The Tories said the Labour plan penalised families with large homes or other substantial assets.Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary at the time, said pensioners ※deserve better§ than a ※secret tax bombshell§.Opposition spokesman Andy Burnham, now the mayor of Manchester, said a tax on estates which everyone contributes to would act as ※insurance§ for people who fear punitive care costs when they get older.Sir Andrew Dilnot＊s major report in 2011 suggested a ?35,000 cap on care costs. His plan encouraged individuals to save towards long-term care costs, but the government scrapped the plan, believing it would be difficult to persuade people to save in addition to setting aside funds for a pension. Dilnot said the new Tory approach meant they are ※tackling completely different questions§. In essence, those who suffer the most debilitating long-term illnesses will lose the most from May＊s initiative while those who win in the health lottery will win big, especially as the inheritance tax threshold for a couple is due to rise to ?1m."															
"The UK economy has shown signs of picking up over recent weeks as strong demand from overseas helped offset moribund consumer spending at home, according to a survey that will welcomed by Theresa May＊s government as next month＊s election approaches. News that Britain＊s services sector enjoyed its fastest growth for four months in April follows  signalling similar improvements for the smaller manufacturing and . Together they will soothe fears around the UK economic outlook after official figures showed  in the first quarter. But behind the positive headlines there were continued signs that  as . Hotels and restaurants were among the consumer-facing businesses feeling those effects in April, the services report showed.The main business activity reading on the  (pdf) rose to 55.8 in April from 55.0 in March. That was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and confounded forecasts for a dip to 54.5 in a Reuters poll of economists.Job creation also picked up, according to the survey, which excludes government services and retail but still covers half of the overall services sector. It found services were confident about their prospects for growth over the year, although the degree of optimism moderated for the third month running.The survey compilers also noted that in the face of rising costs, companies were putting up their prices at the fastest pace since July 2008, adding to pressures on consumers. Costs have risen due to higher crude oil prices and because the pound＊s drop since the Brexit vote makes imports more expensive.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the PMI report compilers, IHS Markit, said the polls for services, construction and manufacturing together pointed to GDP growth accelerating at the start of the second quarter. ※While we expect consumer spending to slacken in coming months, with the April survey highlighting continued weakness in sectors such as hotels, restaurants and other household-facing businesses, there＊s good reason to believe that at least 0.4% GDP growth can be achieved in the second quarter as a whole,§ he said.In the first quarter, GDP growth slowed to 0.3% from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016.The services report said April＊s pick-up in activity was partly down to resilient business-to-business demand, which includes activity such as a firm hiring legal or consultancy services. There was also support from new product launches and, in some cases, another rise in sales to overseas clients.The authors said new business expanded at a faster pace in April and that ※anecdotal evidence from survey respondents suggested that greater business-to-business sales had helped to offset subdued discretionary consumer spending§.Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the survey ※probably overstates the buoyancy of growth§, noting that it excludes the retail sector, which has been hurt by weaker consumer spending in recent months.※Pretty much everyone is expecting growth to slow this year because of a weakening consumer,§ he added.※Still, I＊d be minded to think that GDP rebounds a little bit into the second quarter, probably up from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter to 0.4-0.5% quarter-on-quarter during the second quarter.§The reports will provide more mixed signals for the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee to debate when it meets to set interest rates and publish its latest forecasts for the UK economy next week.The Bank, under governor Mark Carney, has repeatedly said it faces a trade-off between keeping inflation under control and supporting growth and jobs. Most economists have taken that as a signal interest rates will be held at their record low of 0.25% well beyond the end of this year. But one member voted against the other eight at the last meeting, calling for a rate rise.※The MPC likely will place much more weight at next week＊s meeting on the weak official data for the first quarter than on April＊s better PMIs, and we expect Kristin Forbes to remain alone in voting to raise interest rates,§ said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics., also published on Thursday, hinted at a slowdown in consumer spending and confidence. They showed approvals for mortgages dipped to a six month low in March, the latest sign of a softening housing market. Consumer borrowing also grew at a slower annual pace."															
"The White House has announced that the United States will not unilaterally withdraw from Nafta, the landmark free trade agreement with  and Mexico, after multiple reports that Donald Trump was planning to pull out of the deal.In a readout of calls between Trump, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday, the White House said: ※President Trump agreed not to terminate Nafta at this time.§ However, the statement added ※the leaders agreed to proceed swiftly, according to their required internal procedures, to enable the renegotiation of the  to the benefit of all three countries§.The news came after reports on Wednesday that Trump was planning to sign an executive order that would trigger the process for the United States to withdraw from the deal, which was negotiated by the George HW Bush and enacted by Bill Clinton in 1994. The US would have to give six months＊ notice to withdraw from the free trade agreement and the executive order would start the clock in what the White House viewed as a negotiating tactic to force more favourable terms for renegotiation from Canada and . However, a White House official told the Guardian on Wednesday that the situation was ※more complicated§ than reported.On Thursday Trump characterized the discussion with Pena Nieto and Trudeau as a request from the two leaders for him not to pull out of the trade pact. ※I received calls from the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada asking to renegotiate NAFTA rather than terminate,§ the president wrote on Twitter. ※I agreed ... subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA. Relationships are good - deal very possible!§One of Trump＊s key themes during his presidential campaign was his scepticism of free trade, in particular, the ※bad deals§ which he believed the United States had negotiated with other countries. Nafta had long come under particular scorn from Trump. In  last week with the Associated Press, Trump described the pact as ※a catastrophic trade deal for the United States§ and said ※I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.§Trump has had recent tensions with America＊s neighbours. Mexican foreign minister Luis Videgaray  for a border wall between the United States and Mexico as ※a hostile act§ on Tuesday and insisted yet again, contrary to Trump＊s campaign promises, that Mexico would not pay for the wall. With Canada, Trump announced a new tariff on softwood lumber on Tuesday that triggered concerns of a potential trade war between the two countries. He warned that ※people don＊t realise Canada＊s been very rough on the United States ... they＊ve outsmarted our politicians for years§.The initial reports that Trump was considering pulling out of the trade agreement brought a horrified reaction from a number of top Republicans. John McCain  that ※Withdrawing from #NAFTA would be a disaster for #Arizona jobs & economy 每 @POTUS shouldn＊t abandon this vital trade agreement§. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska issued a statement saying ※scrapping Nafta would be a disastrously bad idea§."															
															
"In areas with both county and district councils, districts are under huge stress (, 25 April). Here in Pendle, in the Lancashire Pennines, our spending ability in the 10 years up to 2020 is being slashed by about half. With a net budget of about ?14m, we face another ?5m of cuts in the next three years.In 2010, we employed 450 people, a number that is now down to about 260. We have cut all useful but non-essential jobs, slashed the top management structure and pay, and seen many staff take a voluntary cut in working hours. We have refinanced some of our main buildings, turning dearer rents into cheaper mortgages.We＊ve handed lots of local services to town and parish councils and local groups 每 community centres, local town halls, children＊s play areas, bus shelters, town centre CCTV systems, roadside seats, pieces of amenity land, Christmas decorations, and local events. We are now hoping to hand over our parks.After seven years we are down to the bone. Basic services we have protected are now at risk. Street sweeping, litter collection, refuse collection and recycling, environmental health, housing standards, planning, and all the?operation of local democracy in local communities. It＊s a disaster. John Harris is right that charity is no substitute for state services, and charitable giving can sometimes seem to ※normalise§ inadequate state provision (, 21 April). But there are two important points that he misses.Firstly, campaigning for better services, and showing how they might be improved, is precisely part of what many charities do, with the approval of the Charity Commission. When Harris gets out his credit card for many charities, he is supporting such advocacy, so that the vulnerable are given visibility and voice. In the fields he mentions like international development, education, health and medicine and disability, many leading charities champion, rather than undermine, a rights-based approach.Secondly, as Beveridge recognised, state services alone will never be sufficient to meet all needs justly, to innovate as society changes, or give sufficient opportunities for participation and influence. Under any scenario of public spending, there will be ample space for a vibrant, assertive voluntary sector. Keep?giving, John."															
"onald Trump＊s is straight out of the Ronald Reagan playbook. According to the current occupant of the White House, the reduction from 35% to 15% will pay for itself because US companies will invest more.The argument is that higher levels of investment will raise the growth rate and, in turn, raise corporate profits. Consequently, the tax take will be no different at 15% than it was at 35%.George HW Bush had a description for this approach when Reagan first floated it during the 1980 election campaign. He called it , which is was it turned out to be. Reagan＊s tax cuts and higher defence spending were certainly accompanied by higher growth but they did not pay for themselves. Far from it. The US ran high budget deficits and the national debt spiralled.Viraj Patel, of ING bank, said Trump＊s tax arithmetic is wishful thinking and unlikely to impress the deficit hawks on Capitol Hill. ※If it were that easy, everyone would do it,§ he said. ※Though some positive effect on short-term growth is possible from tax cuts, this is likely to be inadequate to boost revenues to outweigh the costs.§In the end, Trump will only get his corporate tax cut implemented with the agreement of Congress. Both Republicans and Democrats will want to know how the president intends to make up for the loss of revenue that a cut of this magnitude will cause. On current projections, the US government expects the tax take from corporation tax to double from $290bn (?226bn) a year in 2016 to $580bn by 2020.Trump has also promised personal tax cuts, which will further add to the deficit. So one of three things is going to happen: first, Trump＊s plan may indeed lead to a doubling of the US growth rate and be self-funding, although recent economic history suggests otherwise.Second, the president will have to find cuts in spending to balance the loss of tax revenue. The proposal to boost investment in America＊s infrastructure would look highly vulnerable in those circumstances.Finally, Congress could decide that the plan is simply too flaky and refuse to pass it."															
															
"The global economy is gaining momentum which should be good news for Australia＊s commodities-based economy.But the International Monetary Fund has again raised concerns about a growing shift towards trade protectionism and a breakdown of international economic collaboration which took root after the second world war.In its latest world economic outlook released In Washington overnight, the IMF has raised its global growth forecast for 2017 to 3.5% after expanding by 3.1% last year.Australian growth is predicted to rise to 3.1% this year after 2.5% in 2016, which should see the unemployment rate shrink to 5.2% from 5.9% now.The IMF says commodity-exporting economies such as Australia are set to recover, especially given the average 20% increase in coal prices.※The acceleration in activity will be supported by accommodative monetary policies, supportive fiscal policies or infrastructure investment, improving sentiment following the upturn in commodity prices, and less drag from declining investment in the commodity sector,§ it says in the report.But IMF economic counsellor Maurice Obstfeld said while there is a chance economic growth will exceed expectations, significant downside risks continue to cloud the medium-term outlook.※One salient threat is a turn toward protectionism, leading to trade warfare,§ he says.※The global economy seems to be gaining momentum 每 we could be at a turning point 每 but even as things look up, the postwar system of international economic relations is under severe strain despite the aggregate benefits it has delivered.§"															
"gnore . Part of the decline occurred before the lectern had even been placed in Downing Street. Part of the rest can be explained by a stronger pound, which tends to depresses the value of the many big dollar-earners in the index. The real question is why sterling, which hit a six-month high, reacted so strongly to .It was because investors calculated 每 counter-intuitively at first glance 每 that a bigger Tory majority in the Commons, if that＊s what follows, will mean a softer form of Brexit. This argument was best expressed by Deutsche Bank＊s analysts, who reckon the election is ※a game-changer§ for the pound and the Brexit negotiations. A bigger majority would set  free from the ※unrealistic timetable§ set by the eurosceptics in her party, they argue.First, the 2019 deadline for delivering a ※clean§ Brexit will be less pressing because there won＊t now be an election the following year. Second, the influence of hard Brexiters will be diluted and the government will be able to compromise over transitional agreements. Third, May can fall into step with the EU＊s desire to settle the divorce bill first and then negotiate the detail of Brexit. ※This sequenced approach materially reduces the ＆crash risk＊ of Brexit negotiations as well as strengthening the prime minister＊s hand in pursuing an orderly (and very lengthy) withdrawal,§ argues Deutsche.Up to a point, this line seems legitimate. If delivering a ※successful§ Brexit involves making a few pragmatic compromises 每 which is surely the lesson from the initial skirmishes with the EU negotiators 每 you can＊t blame May for seeking cover from the hard-liners in her own party. And kicking out the next election until 2022 seems a smart political move: it would allow time for a three-year transitional phase before UK voters go back to the polls, which could take the edge off any economic shock at the moment of Brexit in 2019.So, yes, it was fair for investors to take some comfort in the idea that a market-friendly ※soft§ Brexit is now easier to imagine. Just don＊t get too carried away with the idea. Investment uncertainties rarely evaporate so easily. If the election delivers a messy result 每 even a barely improved Tory majority 每 what would really have changed?The late Sir Richard George, the businessman who built Weetabix as a family company before selling it to a private equity firm in 2003, understood he was selling a product with limited international appeal. ※Mothers tend to wean their children on Weetabix and people in Britain tend to grow up with an in-built liking for them,§ he said. ※That＊s not the case in other countries 每 it＊s very hard to sell them in Germany for instance.§The Chinese attempt to disprove this theory has, to nobody＊s great surprise, ended in failure. The Weetabix that Chinese state-backed Bright Food group is selling looks very like : 75% of revenues are in the UK and the 20% that comes from North America is mainly generated from products with a US heritage. The big idea of persuading breakfast diners in Shanghai and Beijing to enjoy the delights of wheat biscuits hasn＊t moved the dial. Weetabix＊s overall revenues of ?400m-ish and top-line earnings of ?120m have gone sideways for the past half-decade.In the circumstances, Bright Food should count itself lucky that it has found a buyer willing to pay a price that allows it to exit with financial respectability. , versus the ?1.2bn that Bright Food shelled out.Post, as it happens, is also talking about ※bringing much-loved brands to significantly more customers globally§. But words are easy to utter. Once suspects the US acquirer perfectly understands that Weetabix is a niche product outside the UK. What it really likes, apart from the undoubted strong cash flows, is the potential for removing a claimed ?20m a year in costs. That sounds a more realistic plan.Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, refused to mention Jes Staley or Barclays when asked about whistleblowing. But his response was exactly what you＊d expect: it＊s important for regulators and society that whistleblowers are protected. Staley＊s  is being investigated by various authorities, including the FCA. It＊s hard to see how the report can be less than damning. Staley＊s survival as chief executive is not guaranteed."															
"The UK needs to prepare itself for weaker economic performance, two major forecasting groups have said, in the latest studies predicting the downsides of the  vote.Fragile business sentiment linked to Brexit-related anxiety, domestic political uncertainty and squeezed consumer budgets have caused UK business confidence to drop to its lowest point for almost six years, the economic consultancy IHS Markit reports.Meanwhile, Britain＊s economic growth will continue to weaken this year due to a Brexit-related consumer-spending squeeze and muted earnings growth, the EY Item Club said in the latest downgrading of its forecasts.Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit, said: ※Companies have become increasingly worried about the business outlook, largely as a result of heightened political uncertainties and the potential impact of Brexit.§He added: ※Business optimism about future prospects has sunk to its lowest for nearly six years, adding to a growing body of data which points to a slowing economy.※The drop in confidence pushed the level of UK optimism below that seen in the eurozone for the first time in seven years, and contrasts with multi-year high levels of optimism in the United States and Japan. As such, the survey results suggest the UK is at risk of falling behind in an otherwise solid-looking global economic outlook.§ In a report published on Monday, IHS Markit said the ※net balance§ of UK firms expecting a rise in business activity over the next 12 months stood at +35% in June, markedly down from +52% in February and the lowest reading since October 2011.However, the headline figure masks vastly different views of the world depending on the respondents＊ business sector. The service sector recorded a score of +32%, while more upbeat manufacturing firms, who are hoping for gains in new export markets, scored a balance of +49%.Meanwhile, the EY Item Club nudged down its forecast of GDP growth from 1.8% to 1.5% in 2017. Peter Spencer, the group＊s chief economic adviser, said: ※The outlook for this year has deteriorated since our spring forecast.§He said consumer spending, the economy＊s main engine of growth, would continue to lose momentum as the pound＊s collapse since the Brexit vote continued to stoke inflation. ※The inflationary squeeze on consumers has been painful and shows little sign of easing any time soon,§ he said.Sterling＊s sharp drop is yet to fully feed through to the consumer price index, with inflation expected to reach up to 3.3% this autumn 每 well ahead of the growth in average earnings. Real household disposable income is forecast to fall by 0.2% in 2017, before recovering by 1.1% next year, while with the household saving ratio at a record low of 1.7% in the first quarter of 2017, consumers will have limited scope to mitigate the impact."															
"Lloyd＊s of London has warned that a serious cyber-attack could cost the global economy more than $120bn (?92bn) 每 as much as catastrophic natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy.Published two months after  and hit nearly 100 countries, a 56-page report from the world＊s oldest insurance market says the threat posed by such global attacks has spiralled and poses a huge risk to business and governments over the next decade.The most likely scenario is a malicious hack that takes down a cloud service provider with estimated losses of $53bn, according to Lloyd＊s. This is the average estimate, but because of the uncertainty around calculating cyber losses it estimates the figure could be as high as $121bn or as low as $15bn.At the upper end, the cost would outstrip the damage wreaked by  in 2005, estimated at $108bn (including $80bn of insured losses). Hurricane Sandy in 2012 is estimated to have caused economic losses of $50bn-$70bn.Inga Beale, chief executive of Lloyd＊s, said: ※This report gives a real sense of the scale of damage a cyber-attack could cause the global economy. Just like some of the worst natural catastrophes, cyber events can cause a severe impact on businesses and economies, trigger multiple claims and dramatically increase insurers＊ claims costs. ※Underwriters need to consider cyber cover in this way and ensure that premium calculations keep pace with the cyber-threat reality,§ she said.The second-most likely threat stems from attacks on computer operating systems run by a large number of businesses around the world, which could cause losses of up to $28.7bn (the ※mass software vulnerability scenario§). The majority of these losses are not insured, leaving governments and businesses vulnerable if cyber-attacks happen. The uninsured gap could be as high as $45bn for the cloud services scenario, and $26bn for the mass vulnerability scenario.Trevor Maynard, Lloyd＊s head of innovation and co-author of the report with the cybersecurity firm Cyence, said the global cyberattack in May ※showed us that these sorts of attacks are absolutely possible§. Financial services is most at risk, followed by software and technology, hospitality, retail and healthcare.Cyber cover is a relatively new type of insurance that has emerged in the last few years 每 Lloyds＊s accounts for about a quarter of global premiums 每 and harder to model and understand than natural catastrophe cover. Where people are involved, risk changes quite rapidly, Maynard said, from cyber-attacks to terrorism and political risk. However, climate change remains the biggest challenge in the long run. ※From year to year, risk varies relatively little but climate change in the end will be far larger as a risk,§ he said. ※It affects the global economic structure, food, water. [It＊s like] trying to turn a supertanker around 每 we can＊t start in 30 years when things are going bad, we have to start now.§"															
"Low-paid workers in the private sector should see their wages restricted to inflation-only rises, according to business leaders, who have said that without the real-terms freeze, they could be forced to make job cuts.The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the ※national living wage§ (NLW) should rise by a maximum of 2.7% in its response to the Low  Commission＊s call for comments on minimum wage levels, which are due to be set in the autumn.In a move that will alarm unions, the BCC said it wanted the commission to agree a rise to help low-paid workers deal with the consequences of inflation, but ※without pricing people out of jobs§.The government is committed to raising the NLW, which is currently ?7.50 for workers aged 25 and over, to almost ?9 an hour by 2020. In April, the rate increased by 4.2% from ?7.20, while the national minimum wage for those aged 21-24 increased by 1.4% to ?7.05.BCC spokeswoman Jane Gratton said low-paid workers should be protected against inflationary pressures that were eroding their spending power. ※Setting the national living wage must be done cautiously, comprehensively taking into account economic circumstances, so that people are not priced out of jobs. The government＊s current policy was set before the EU referendum and so does not reflect the uncertainty caused by Brexit.※Businesses are facing high costs when it comes to employing staff 每 including the , pensions auto-enrolment and skills charges. The rise in the national living wage in April this year brought a further increase in wage bills for business across a wide range of sectors, with the need to retain wage differentials multiplying their costs further.§The BCC＊s call comes as official figures to be released on Tuesday are expected to show that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation will stay at 2.9% in June, leaving inflation at a near four-year high.  is expected to stay above 2.7% for much of the year, having already hit 2.9% in May and June.The figures will extend the squeeze on household finances as inflation outstrips wages, with the CPI having soared as the Brexit-hit pound pushed up the price of imported goods. Road fuel prices are believed to have dropped by around 1.1% month-on-month in June, according to estimates by Scotiabank, while core items such as clothing, household and recreational goods continued to rise in price. Alan Clarke, head of Scotiabank＊s European fixed income strategy, said food prices and air fares likely made the most notable gains last month, alongside smaller increases in alcohol costs, restaurant prices and package holidays. One of the main effects of rising inflation has been to cut disposable incomes, which, along with sluggish wages growth and rising debt levels, has meant the biggest decline in consumer confidence in more than two years, according to the  from Deloitte. The quarterly survey of 3,000 people, carried out from 16-18 June, saw overall consumer confidence fall to -10% in the second quarter of 2017, deteriorating from -7% in the first quarter. Spending on essential items and discretionary spending fell compared with the previous quarter. In further evidence that the experience economy is feeling the impact of the increased mood of consumer caution, the report said spending on extras such as eating out and the cinema fell back for the second quarter in a row 每 ※in a sign that the recent upward trend in leisure spending has also been hit§.

"Rafael Behr＊s commentary on Matthew Taylor＊s ※gig economy§ report is too kind by half (, 12 July). Both in the report and in interviews, Taylor seems more concerned to preserve the gig economy business model than worried about the resultant exploitation. The?business owners＊ excuse, that they couldn＊t run their business otherwise, is exactly the same old excuse used right back to the slave owners.If the only way the business model can work is by denying workers＊ rights, rights hard-won by generations of struggle, then that flawed model has no place in any kind of decent, fair society. The Orwellian rebranding of the workers＊ title ※dependent contractors§, or some such nonsense, should tell you all you need to know about how flawed Taylor＊s proposals are. It really is that simple. Rafael Behr agonises over the trade-off facing the gig economy, between having a flexible labour market and guaranteeing a minimum hourly income for people who work flexibly.The Taylor review posits that people in the gig economy who choose to work at off-peak times should not necessarily be entitled to the minimum wage. But?when I raised this in the House of Commons, the minister could not have been clearer in her assurance: ※Minimum wages rates are sacrosanct. There will be no trade-off when it comes to ensuring that everybody is paid at least the minimum wage.§This is a clear undertaking from the government. The House＊s job now is to ensure that undertaking is honoured in any subsequent legislation. If gig companies are required by law always to abide by the minimum wage, even if that means a loss in flexibility, they will need to regulate the supply of labour or pay from their profits the minimum wage when there is not the level of demand to pay all workers at that rate. Theresa May doesn＊t need to introduce new laws to protect workers in the gig economy: British employment law is fair and robust already. But what she could do is ensure that the basics of the law and economics are explained to everyone before they start working, preferably at school, so they can assess the viability of an ※offer§ themselves.Most of these workers are actually not self-employed, so are entitled to holiday pay, statutory sick pay and the other benefits of payrolled employment, while the rates their employers offer are not economically viable as a sole income.A properly self-employed worker has to charge many times more per hour than their waged colleagues in order to achieve parity of income. Until this is explained to school leavers, this type of?exploitation will continue. Can you be self-employed if you only have one employer? The taxman once had a rule that you couldn＊t. Who?changed that? The Guardian has been conducting investigations into the gig economy over the past few months. The publication last Tuesday of the Taylor report into the same topic therefore ought to have justified more than the usual level of coverage. Instead, what did we get? Theresa May, Rebecca Long-Bailey and the GMB offer their reactions to the report, Robert Booth gives us , we get another two tales from the gig economy, and there is  along with a .What we do not get is a proper report of the report itself, its main recommendations, its findings and some key excerpts from it. When the facts of the matter are supplanted by a flurry of opinions from all and sundry, you do your readers a disservice. I＊d like to know what Taylor says, after which opinions can be aired. Wortley Hall, the self-styled ※workers＊ stately home§ on the outskirts of Sheffield, is a wonderful monument to the co-operative movement and the trade unions and has been lovingly restored to its former glory. Is there any need for it to hire staff on zero-hours contracts? In defence of freelancing stewards at Lord＊s (, 12 July), while I appreciate the reasons that led Rick Hall to resign his Tate membership in sympathy with the staff on zero-hours contracts, the case at Lords is rather different. The Tate has a permanent exhibition and therefore a relatively constant need for a certain number of staff, but the number of stewards required at a Test cricket ground varies vastly. While crowds of over 20,000 can be expected to enter Lord＊s on up to 15 days of the year, there will seldom be a 20th of that number for the other 350 days. For at least five months of the year there will be no spectators at all. To expect the MCC to employ full-time staff on that basis is maybe a little exaggerated. I am a chef and a father of four children. Today in the world of UK hospitality, working hours laid down in our contracts are 48 per week, but we are bound by signing an extra clause to our contract that commits us to work more as required by the establishment 每?which usually means a working week of between 55 and 60 hours.This evidently leaves little or no room for any quality life. Of course, you feel obliged to sign this clause as this is part and parcel of the job offer but you soon realise that it is a trap. You live a life of modern-day slavery in which you don＊t see your family, you have poor quality sleep and you never get enough rest. In short, you are exploited to the maximum. Needless to say, turnover is extremely high in the hospitality business among chefs.In our job we know when we start our shift, but not when it ends. Why do we have to be different from any other profession that has reasonable eight-hour shifts?The hospitality industry currently receives recognition in the form of star rankings from various reviewing bodies 每 depending on the quality of menus, their creativity and presentation, prices, the excellence of service and so on.But who is taking responsibility to ensure that cooks and chefs have a balance between work and family and living any sort of quality life? Surely, we are more important than the star rankings? Many people in this industry are suffering and they have no other choice as no law is protecting them."															
"Want to know where the economy is heading? Then read my lips. The boss of John Lewis has pointed to a return of ※the lipstick effect§ 每 when a rise in sales of beauty products heralds a consumer squeeze.With , shoppers are holding off on buying big ticket household items like sofas, beds and washing machines. But tough times also encourage shoppers to treat themselves, and history has shown that sales of cheap thrills 每 from lipstick to takeaway coffee, expensive perfume, skin cream and sparkling wine 每 can do well in a downturn.※The backdrop is very uncertain and it was made worse by the tragic events that happened across British cities over the last few months,§ said Paula Nickolds, managing director of the John Lewis department stores chain, referring to the terror attacks in London and Manchester. She said John Lewis＊s middle England customers were now feeling ※uncertain and worried about what the circumstances will mean for their future financial prosperity§ and so are beginning to change their shopping behaviour. ※It＊s the more considered categories, the arguably deferrable spend, that we＊re seeing most affected by the uncertainty in the macro conditions 每 so those big ticket categories are currently trading just behind last year,§ said Nickolds. However, Nickolds said trading in ※spontaneous§ categories, was holding up robustly. Beauty product sales are up more than 7% on last year and womenswear is up 4.4%. Sales of lipstick rose 31% in the three months to the end of June against the same period last year with Instagram-friendly brightly coloured summer lip shades especially highly sought after※Perhaps [it＊s] the lipstick effect as we might have called it back in the recession [of 2008],§ Nickolds said. . When an executive at Est谷e Lauder noted that sales of expensive lipsticks soared in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, he dubbed it the Lipstick Index 每 an alternative economic indicator that sees make-up sales rise in a downturn. In the four years from 1929 to 1933, industrial production in the US halved, but sales of cosmetics rose.※It＊s not always lipstick that benefits,§ said Toby Clark at Mintel. ※In the last recession premium fragrances did really well. Beauty is just a really good example of an indulgent purchase that is relatively affordable so you can treat yourself without breaking the bank.§He said that when spare cash is tight, people try to save on dull basics, going for budget shampoos, milk from a discount chain or holding on to an ageing bed or washing machine, in order to afford feel-good treats where they believe they get more value for money. In the last downturn home baking goods sold well, even though it can be more expensive to make a cake at home.※In many ways, home baking is a luxury purchase but you don＊t just get cakes§ Clark added. ※You get an experience, the satisfaction of making something and family time,.※Even if you spend more than you would on a tray bake from the local supermarket you feel you get more bang for your buck.§People search for better value for money in a host of different ways. They look beyond their regular supermarket chain to budget outlets. They switch from eating out at restaurants to going out only for a coffee and cake or eating a premium ready meal at home and they will trade down from branded goods to own labels. Market research group Kantar recently reported that supermarkets＊ own label sales were up 6% year on year in contrast to just a 0.6% rise in branded products.They also try to cut down on waste 每 leading to higher sales of frozen food.Holidays abroad are also likely to suffer 每 especially since the slumping pound has made European destinations more expensive. But holidays are considered an essential by most families so British resorts 每 and especially campsites 每 are set to benefit this summer. Staycations boomed and Britons took nearly 3m more camping and caravanning holidays in 2009, the height of the last downturn, than they did in 2008.The sharp change in spending behaviour noted at John Lewis comes amid growing signs of a consumer slowdown. Official data published last month showed British workers＊ earnings after inflation . Last week credit and debit card provider Visa noted the fastest fall in household spending in almost four years as shoppers  每 down 3.4% and 1.2% respectively.※It＊s clear that inflation is beginning to affect shopping habits too, with consumers diverting their spending to essentials,§ said Kevin Jenkins, UK & Ireland managing director at Visa.Last month , blaming falling consumer confidence for a slump in the number of visitors to its stores. Online kitchen appliances specialist AO World has also warned of a slowdown."															
"Kate Maltby＊s analysis of the Conservative party＊s disarray (, 17?July) fails to see that its neoliberals are the equivalent of what the Trotskyists were in the Labour party of the past. Neoliberals are an entryist group standing for a body of economists＊ ideas that can＊t be implemented in a real, living diverse society with complex people in it, because it is a simple imaginary theory, totally anti-statist and individualist, as opposed to the far-left totally statist and collectivist version. Both are essentially authoritarian, not democratic.What Maltby ought to recommend to?the Conservative party is paying more attention to the continental version of?conservatism, which has continued its success as exemplified in modern Germany, strongly statist to ensure a hierarchical integrated society with a powerful but decentralised state to provide the social and logistical infrastructure for the economy of modern business and industry as well as social order for the population.The real political distinction in the UK at present is the conservatives＊ unequal social and economic hierarchy (and individualised competition everywhere, partly under neoliberal pressure) versus the left＊s focus on equalities (and equal rights and collaboration). That would give us plenty of political difference in policies to fight about, without all the authoritarian neoliberal economic theorising to confuse the arguments. Can I suggest another conservative political philosopher other than Edmund Burke that should be essential reading for the political reformers of the Conservative party and that is Michael Oakeshott. He would have been horrified that the party he loved had embarked on a reckless period of social experimentation known variously as either public choice theory, neoliberalism or Randian economics. He said ※to be a conservative ＃ is?to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried§.When the party of traditional values abandons them in the name of social revolution, it can be no surprise that it is unable to speak with authority on the great issues of the day. The ethos of constant changes fits ill with the party of tradition. It is now the party of fractious groups all competing to claim ownership of the party. The result is the unappealing squabble of a group of largely middle-aged men and women over who has ownership of a set of policies that were the revolutionary policies of their youth, not realising that time has passed them by."															
															
"here＊s an element of ※back to the future§ about this current parliament.  with a bang, after 25 years away, and with it has come a retro vibe to the economic debate too. There＊s talk of  such as energy, water and railways; proposals for more public spending and an ; accusations of financial black holes, and soaring borrowing. You can practically hear the coffin lids creaking as Thatcher-era warriors from the political left and right rise from their graves to re-fight old battles.But it isn＊t quite like that. The issues may look similar, but they＊re different in their modernity. Economic history isn＊t repeating itself, although at the moment it rhymes.Take housing. Eight years of quantitative easing-driven ultra-low interest rates and 30 years of not building enough homes have pushed  way out of reach of most people in their 20s and 30s. The new divide isn＊t between white- or blue-collar workers, or working classes against middle or upper, but instead it＊s between asset-owning older people and the insecure, struggling generation behind them. Student loans are steadily eroding the old middle-class stitch-up of access to higher education, but Jeremy Corbyn＊s policies to reduce student debt still resonated on polling day. The quest for social justice is morphing into a search for generational fairness as we watch.Government debts create huge generational questions too, because they pile up IOUs that have to be repaid by our children and grandchildren, rather than by us. If we borrow to pay for today＊s spending, we＊re expecting future generations to pay the bills for our lifestyle today. The traditional remedy of letting economic growth take care of the problem, by making the bills more affordable as the country gets richer, won＊t work here. Most of the IOUs are embedded in our pay-as-you-go state pension and benefits scheme. They dwarf the government bonds that make up the rest of the debt. And it＊s structural, so even if we grow our economy, the pension and benefits schemes＊ liabilities won＊t get more affordable. They will just grow with us.And this is where today＊s economic climate rhymes with our history most strongly. Because if most government borrowing looks increasingly unfair for future generations, there are only two other ways left to fund good, reliable public services: either more , or . But the answers of the 1980s are incompatible with the situation we find ourselves in today. There are limits on how far you can raise taxes in a world that＊s gone global, because trade, companies, jobs and people are far more mobile than they used to be. If we push taxes up too far, a lot of them will simply move. And if we choose the wrong taxes to raise, they will feed through into higher prices in everyday essentials, which will hit the least well-off hardest.Having said that, those Thatcher-era warriors shouldn＊t start licking their lips, because continuing austerity poses problems too. Our public services are miles more efficient than they used to be, so a lot of the easy savings have already been made. The next rounds of finding new ways to do more with less are undoubtedly necessary, but they will be a grindingly slow, painstaking process rather than a sudden gush of cash. There＊s no magic money tree here.So we will need to look elsewhere, to find new answers. A UK sovereign wealth fund is a good option, where those whopping IOUs in the state pension and benefits systems are funded by a big pool of investments just like a company pension scheme. It wouldn＊t only be generationally fair, but socially just too. We＊d create an asset-owning society, where high and low earners alike have equal stakes and rights in the investment fund that underpins their pensions and benefits. And we＊d have a cushion against the next big economic shock, so we could rebound faster and afford stronger and better public services.Or we could improve . Getting even slightly more efficient, so our economy does more with less, would be worth billions. It would unlock extra cash without having to raise taxes and make austerity less painful. Prices would be lower, so hard-pressed families could afford a better standard of living. Our exports would be more competitive, so we could thrive in a post-Brexit global economy. There＊d be no need to refight those 1980s battles after all.The trouble is, at the moment we＊re . We save less, invest less and build less economically vital, growth-promoting infrastructure (things such as roads, rail and ports) than other countries. It takes a German worker four days to produce what we Britons make in five, so we work longer hours for lower pay.Brexit could help here, by letting us import things more cheaply once the EU＊s high tariff barriers are gone. Building lots more houses, so it costs less for young people to rent or buy, will be essential. Ending on everyday utilities such as gas or electricity, by making them fight harder to keep their customers, will cut costs for companies and hard-pressed families alike. The  should make low-paid work more secure and less exploitative. A sovereign wealth fund would provide the patient capital that Britain＊s infrastructure projects need. And relentlessly modernising everybody＊s skills, as new technologies make existing ones redundant two, three or more times in a working lifetime, will be essential.So the stakes are pretty high, but it would be a mistake to revisit the conflicts of the 1980s. The strongest historical rhyme is with the postwar governments that created new institutions such as the  and the , helping to forge a new society and build a new nation.Whether we voted for it or not,  offers a similar chance for our generation to match the hopes and ambitions of our forefathers. This government will be the first post-Brexit administration, with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to recast the kind of society and economy we want Britain to be.We can create a new, stronger, more socially just and generationally fair society; a better Britain with the financial strength to use its post-EU independence effectively, as an international force for good in the world. Attlee, Beveridge, and perhaps even Churchill himself, would be proud."															
															
"Signs of a deepening rift on the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee have emerged after Threadneedle Street＊s chief economist revealed he seriously considered opposing the governor, Mark Carney, and voting for an interest rate rise earlier this month.Just 24 hours after Carney said the state of the economy and the uncertainty caused by Brexit meant , Andy Haldane said it would be prudent to tighten policy before the end of the year.The June meeting of the MPC resulted in a , with both the Bank＊s governor and its chief economist voting with the majority.But Haldane, previously one of the most doveish members of the committee, said the balance of risks had shifted so that the dangers of moving too late outweighed those of raising interest rates too soon.Sterling rose on the foreign exchanges after Haldane spoke, with the City reassessing its view that interest rates would stay unchanged well into 2018. At one point, the pound was up three quarters of a cent against the US dollar to $1.27 before later falling back.※The risks of tightening ＆too early＊ have shrunk as growth and, to lesser extent, inflation have shown greater resilience than expected. And if policy tightened ＆too late＊, this could result in a much steeper path of rate rises later on, contrary to the MPC＊s collective expectation that Bank rate would increase ＆at a gradual pace and to a limited extent＊,§ Haldane said in a speech in Bradford.The  in the wake of last summer＊s Brexit vote, but Haldane said that, despite the possibility that the economy could suffer as a result of Britain＊s departure from the EU, the time for the first increase in borrowing costs in a decade was fast approaching, and would come much more quickly than the City was expecting.※As the balance point between these risks has shifted over the past nine months, that has left me judging that a partial withdrawal of the additional policy insurance the MPC put in place last year would be prudent relatively soon, provided the data come in broadly as expected in the period ahead. Certainly, I think such a tightening is likely to be needed well ahead of current market expectations.§The Bank official said he had voted for no change at the MPC＊s meeting for two reasons. First, he said there was evidence that deunionisation, rising self-employment, and the ※gig economy§ had resulted in weaker wage growth than in the past. Second, the election result had thrown up a dust cloud of uncertainty.※Financial markets-wise, that is manifesting itself in a weaker exchange rate. It is unclear what twists and turns lie ahead, with potentially important implications for asset prices and, at least potentially, confidence among businesses and consumers. I do not think adding a twist or a turn from monetary policy would, in this environment, be especially helpful in building confidence, at least until the dust cloud has started to settle.※Provided the data are still on track, I do think that beginning the process of withdrawing some of the incremental stimulus provided last August would be prudent moving into the second half of the year.§Haldane said the first rate rise since before the deep recession of 2008-09 should be welcomed rather than feared. ※As and when the MPC begins this process of normalising monetary policy, it will be a sign of the economy itself having begun to normalise. Far from being a cause for concern, starting the process of withdrawing some monetary policy insurance should serve as a signal of the MPC＊s confidence in the UK economy＊s resilience and in inflation returning sustainably to its 2% target.§ Lena Komileva, of G+Economics said:The growing split on the MPC signals a much higher risk of tightening this year than previously expected in the markets. With two new members joining the MPC in the second half of the year, an active policy debate on the merits of tightening, against the optics of a strong inflation overshoot, overheating consumer credit growth, and a tight labour market, may well tilt the vote in favour of a rate hike by the year-end.§"															
"n all major economies, the so-called productivity puzzle continues to perplex economists and policymakers: output per hour is significantly lower than it would have been had the pre-2008 growth trend continued. The figures are stark, particularly so in the UK, but also across the . And while it goes without saying that economists have many ingenious explanations to offer, none has yet proved persuasive enough to create a consensus.According to the UK＊s Office for National Statistics, output per hour in France was 14% lower in 2015 than it would have been had the previously normal trend growth rate been matched. Output was 9% lower in the US and 8% lower in Germany, which has remained the top performer among developed economies, albeit only in relative terms. If this new, lower growth rate persists, by 2021 average incomes in the US will be 16% lower than they would have been had the country maintained the roughly 2% annual productivity gain experienced since 1945.The UK exhibits a particularly chronic case of the syndrome. British productivity was 9% below the OECD average in 2007; by 2015, the gap had widened to 18%. Strikingly, UK productivity per hour is fully 35% below the German level, and 30% below that of the US. Even the French could produce the average British worker＊s output in a week, and still take Friday off. It would seem that, in addition to the factors affecting all developed economies, the UK has particularly weak management.Some contributing factors are generally acknowledged. During the crisis and its immediate aftermath, when banks＊ efforts to rebuild capital constrained new lending, ultra-low interest rates kept some firms＊ heads above water, and their managers retained employees, despite making a relatively low return.On the other hand, new, more productive, and innovative firms found it hard to raise the capital they needed to grow, so they either did not expand, or did so by substituting labour for capital. In other words, low interest rates held productivity down by allowing heavily indebted zombie companies to survive for longer than they otherwise would have done.The  has acknowledged that trade-off, estimating that productivity would have been 1% to 3% higher in the UK had it raised interest rates to pre-crisis levels in the recovery phase. But they believe the consequences 每 slower income growth and higher unemployment 每 would have been unacceptable.This argument has now been extended beyond the banking system, to the capital markets themselves. Critics of central banks have claimed that a sustained policy of exceptionally low interest rates, reinforced by huge doses of quantitative easing, have caused asset prices to rise indiscriminately. That has not only had adverse consequences for the distribution of wealth; it has also muted the ability of capital markets to distinguish between productive, high-potential firms and others that deserve to fail. According to this view, a rising tide lifts even fundamentally unseaworthy boats.This argument has some explanatory power, though it says little about the value added by highly paid asset managers and whether they really are prepared to put their money to work simply on the basis of a monetary-policy effect on relative prices, paying no attention to individual companies＊ strategies and performance. But the key question the argument raises is what to do about it.Would it really have been preferable to tighten policy far earlier, to kill off weaker companies in the interests of improving productivity? The BoE has given an explicit answer, and the other major central banks implicit answers, to that question. They do not think so.A preferable approach to resolving the problem might be more vigorous use of the tools available to market regulators. These authorities tend to focus more on investor protection than on the allocational efficiency of the markets they oversee. Investor protection is important, of course, but as the Nobel laureate Eugene Fama , ※the primary role of the capital market is allocation of ownership of the economy＊s capital stock§.A regulator focused on that objective would be especially rigorous in overseeing the transparent disclosure of information, and would seek to promote vigorous competition among companies and also, crucially for this objective, among investors. It should not be acceptable for asset managers to earn extravagant returns for following a market benchmark.There are, no doubt, other dimensions to the productivity puzzle. Maybe we are not measuring output well. As developed economies become more service-based, our measures of output become less objective. In many service industries, outputs are effectively measured by inputs. Maybe we are not measuring enhancements in quality, which may mean that output increases are understated. Maybe we have reached a point at which the productivity boost from internet-based technology has been cashed, and we need another technological leap to move forward again.But one key challenge for central banks, as we edge towards the normalisation of interest rates, will be to develop a framework for thinking about the impact of monetary policy on the allocation of capital. The task is urgent, as the social and political implications of a prolonged period of no productivity or real wage growth may be very serious. Indeed, arguably they have been factors behind the political upheavals in the US and the UK already."															
"The government＊s plan to provide 30 hours＊ free  has been criticised by a leading global education expert for failing to target the most disadvantaged families whose children stand to gain the most.Andreas Schleicher, education director of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), welcomed the , which he said would bring England up from the bottom of the international league in terms of hours offered to an average position.But he questioned the government＊s decision to target the offer at working parents, who can earn up to ?100,000 each and still be eligible, rather than prioritising access for the most deprived families who may not qualify.From September, three- and four-year-olds of working parents in England will be eligible for 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week. To qualify, each parent 每 or the sole parent in a single parent family 每 will need to earn at least the equivalent of 16 hours per week working at the national minimum or living wage. The Conservative initiative has been widely welcomed by working parents among whom it was a clear vote winner in the 2015 election, but Labour has warned that low-income families in insecure employment or on zero-hours contracts, who may be unable to guarantee how many hours of work they will get from one month to the next, will lose out.In addition,  每 with the funding being made available.Schleicher, who made his comments at the launch of an  report comparing early education in the world＊s industrialised countries, said he understood the importance of supporting parents to get back into the workforce. But he added: ※It＊s not just the 30 hours 每 it＊s making sure those children who need it most get the best provision.§Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said his organisation had long argued that, given limited resources, the government should focus its spending on where it was needed most.※As it stands, a family with a household income of nearly ?200,000 will be eligible for the scheme, while another where, for example, one partner works 15 hours a week at the minimum wage in addition to volunteering, training, or further education, will not. How is this an effective use of government funding?※The OECD report rightly argues that when it comes to early years care and education, real efforts must be made to reach out to the most deprived families 每 and yet the fact remains that these are the very families who are likely to gain little to no benefit from current government early years policies.§The report, published on Wednesday, provides evidence that children who have received high-quality early childhood education experience better outcomes later in life.On an academic level, they get significantly better scores in international Pisa tests at the age of 15. After accounting for student and school-level socioeconomic status, students who had attended early childhood education for a year or more scored an average of 25 points higher in the Pisa science assessment compared with those who had not 每 30 Pisa points is the equivalent of a school year.In countries where the proportion of under-threes in formal education and care is high, there is less obesity.Schleicher said the UK, like other OECD countries, had made considerable advances in early years care and education. There remained, however, wide variation in enrolment rates and the number of hours available per week.Countries such as Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Latvia and Poland provide several hours per week to a small proportion of under-threes 每 Latvian children get 38 hours a week, for example. In the Netherlands and New Zealand, fewer hours per week are provided 每 20 or less 每 to a much greater proportion of children. Spending levels have risen, with countries such as Denmark and Norway investing most in their youngest.Over the past two decades, many countries have taken initiatives to increase access for disadvantaged children but Schleicher, launching the report in London, said disadvantaged families in many countries still found it harder to secure early years education for their child, particularly ※of the quality they need and deserve§.Of the cohort of 15-year-olds who took part in the 2015 Pisa tests, 72% of disadvantaged students said they had attended early years education for at least two years compared with 82% of their wealthier peers. The differences in enrolment between advantaged and disadvantaged students are the largest (15-30 percentage points) in Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, Turkey and the United States. Leitch said: ※Over recent years, government policy in England has been increasingly preoccupied with making more, cheaper, places available to parents, with nowhere near enough attention paid to whether or not these places are of good enough quality.※As this report highlights, early years education can have a significantly positive impact on children＊s long term attainment, but only if the quality of the services being provided is sufficiently high.§A Department for Education spokesperson said the government was investing more than ever into childcare, spending ?6bn by 2020. ※We are also supporting the most disadvantaged families with 15 free hours per week for two-year-olds, our pupil premium which is worth more than ?300 a year per child and our new disability access fund, providing ?615 per eligible child.§"															
"hen  called the general election at the end of April, the UK economy was struggling, inflation was on the rise and Brexit talks were looming. Seven weeks later, seemingly nothing has really changed.The economy is still struggling. May went to the country when Britain was officially the  for the first time since the mid-1990s. It was announced during the campaign that , and Brexit negotiations are supposed to start in a week＊s time.In reality, however, everything has changed. May has been politically wounded, almost certainly fatally, by her failure to secure the whopping mandate that initially seemed possible. She hoped that Michel Barnier, the EU＊s chief negotiator, would be impressed by the size of her landslide majority. Instead, she looks weak and vulnerable.Britain＊s EU partners were left baffled by the result of the general election, and no wonder. The  campaigned for the right to strike a hard bargain and failed to get it. The Liberal Democrats campaigned for a second referendum and failed to get that either. Labour perhaps best captured the confused mood of the voters by insisting that while the result of the referendum should be honoured, the aim should be to continued membership of the single market. Some voters want a clean break. Some voters want Brexit in name only. Some voters want to have their cake and eat it.May＊s position is not helped by the fact that the UK is at the bottom of an economic cycle while the eurozone is going through one of its better periods. There＊s no real secret as to why that is. The European Central Bank has belatedly discovered the joys of full-blown quantitative easing and growth has subsequently picked up. In Britain, the stimulus was provided much earlier and the effects have gradually worn off, exposing the long-standing problems  and an over-dependence on a booming housing market to support consumer spending.Growth in the UK is likely to pick up from the 0.2% recorded in the first quarter, but not by much. The weaker pound is underpinning manufacturing but hurting consumption by making imports dearer. Political uncertainty has given businesses another reason to defer investment decisions. Yet the anti-austerity mood and the distinct possibility that there will be a second election before too long suggests that there will be more public spending to boost growth.But there is little in the economic outlook to give the Conservatives hope of a feelgood factor. On the contrary, living standards will continue to fall for the rest of this year and perhaps longer. In these circumstances, repeatedly telling voters that the economy is strong and stable was asking for trouble.In reality, this is the most difficult economic position any government has faced since Harold Wilson became prime minister in 1974 with Britain on a three-day week and inflation heading skywards. May faces the most crucial negotiations in Britain＊s recent history with a shredded reputation, a divided party, a slowing economy and the clock ticking away.February 1974 was a good election to lose for the Conservatives. It was Labour that had to deal with the 25%-plus inflation unleashed by the quadrupling of global oil prices during the Yom Kippur war. It was Labour that had to call in the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan in 1976, and it was  that was in power during the winter of discontent.Indeed, Labour has a history of coming into power after the Conservatives have made a right old mess of things. May has done Jeremy Corbyn a favour by cobbling together a deal with the DUP that keeps her in office, if only just.Labour could try to piece together a rainbow coalition to allow it to pass legislation, but it would require the unlikely support of every other party, including the DUP. If a minority Corbyn government ever looked like becoming a realistic possibility, the financial markets would take immediate fright. The increased political uncertainty would push the pound lower and inflation higher. Plans for extra government borrowing would lead to interest rates going up. Labour would have to conduct devilishly difficult Brexit talks at a time when people were getting poorer. Far better to let the Tories clear up their own mess.Here＊s the position. There was no clamour for a referendum when David Cameron pledged to hold one. The then prime minister gave the promise to . Having called the referendum, Cameron assumed he wouldn＊t need to do much to win it and was oblivious to the fact that millions of voters 每 particularly in the north and Midlands 每 were deeply unhappy and now had a way of expressing their discontent.as soon as the referendum was lost. May, who had provided only lukewarm support for the remain side during the campaign, was quickly installed as a safe pair of hands. She has proved to be anything but.The election result leaves her with a huge problem. On the one hand, her lack of an overall majority and the presence in her own ranks of pro-Europeans such as Ken Clarke and Nicky Morgan will make it much harder to get a hard Brexit deal through parliament. On the other, many Conservative MPs would not accept a deal that involved staying in the single market if it meant the government making concessions on the free movement of labour and accepting the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.The pro-EU wing of the Tory party is small but, just like the DUP, has become more influential in a hung parliament. May＊s position is that ※no deal is better than a bad deal§, but that is a slogan not a policy. Strong lobbying from the CBI, the City and international investors will discourage Britain from walking away from negotiations. As George Osborne pointed out on the Andrew Marr Show, a ※no deal§ outcome would not be acceptable to the DUP because it would mean a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and some Tories would be content with a compromise deal. Many Tories would not be. All the ingredients are there for a Conservative schism not seen since the repeal of the Corn Laws in the 1840s. Then, as now, the Tories were divided, on that occasion between its free trade and protectionist wings. The split damaged the Tory party so badly that it was unable to form a majority government for 28 years. All Labour needs to do is sit back and watch events unfold. As Napoleon once said, never interfere with an enemy that＊s in the process of destroying itself."															
"he YouTube video artist Cassetteboy made his anti-Brexit stance clear last week when he  with the words: ※It is wrong to believe the fable that Theresa May belongs at the negotiating table.§It is a sentiment echoed by millions of voters, many of them newly registered millennials, who used the general election to demand many things from MPs, including a softer Brexit than the one planned by May.＊s video was viewed almost one million times in the two days before the election. It＊s not the first time his cut-up edits of prime ministerial speeches have proved a hit, but this time it seemed to resonate with 18- to 25-year-olds just as they were signing up in droves to vote.Rob Wilson, the ousted Tory MP for Reading East, who accused No 10 of running a disastrous campaign, said that the university students who populate his side of the city played a large part in the 16% jump in Labour＊s local vote.May＊s response has been to accuse Labour of pork-barrel politics. Her lieutenant Amber Rudd accused  of buying votes with promises to the young of free university education, higher spending on schools and better mental health service provision 每 something college-age students make increasing use of.But to accuse Labour of bribing its way to electoral success is to miss an important point about the young. It is undoubtedly true that a simple and popular policy like tuition fees will get the attention of young people.How could they not notice an offer to wipe out ?40,000 to ?50,000 of loans, and with it the possibility of paying more than ?400,000 in extra tax by the time they are 50 years old to pay them back?But the criticism of sky-high student fees is not so much around the principle of students paying something towards their education. The focus of student anger was directed at the astronomical size of loans under the new scheme and the barely understandable tax system used to claw them back. Then there was the likelihood that the next generation would be saddled with billions of pounds of unpaid debts.It is all of a piece with the Cameron/Osborne policy legacy, inherited by May, that manufactures ways to kick debts down the road while professing to tackle them here and now.It has taken time for the implications here to sink in, despite plenty of warnings about the rocketing levels of , where student loans have become the second highest consumer debt category 每 behind only mortgage debt 每 at $1.3tn.Unhappiness with student fees chimes with the concerns that young people have over the Tories＊ plan to quit the European Union and cut the UK off from the continent, while cutting taxes on business and imposing steep cuts to public services.As , director of the Resolution Foundation, wrote following the vote, a bleak vision of young people＊s future was brought into sharp focus by the election campaign.※In the past two decades, young people have seen the dream of home ownership pushed further out of reach 每 the number of young families owning their own home has halved since the 1990s in places as far-flung as Bristol, Manchester and Leeds. This is not just a London problem,§ he said.※Young people experienced the tightest pay squeeze in the wake of the financial crisis 每 with real pay falling by 13%. A decade on, they are still moving jobs less frequently than they used to, and those born in the late 1980s are the first cohort in living memory to earn less than the one born 15 years before them,§ he added.It seems obvious that millennials, even just taking an impressionistic view of the party＊s manifestos, would consider Labour to be ※on their side§. The shock was that so many of them were among the two million people who registered to vote before the poll and went into the polling booths to mark their preference. But the young must stay vigilant: another lesson of the campaign was that there are vast numbers of older voters who still demand that the government fund their retirements with universal benefits.It was a disaster for May when the Tory manifesto threatened a tax on social care that became the ※dementia tax§ and a vague commitment to means-test the winter fuel allowance. Wilson says it was the spark that ignited the Labour campaign.Corbyn＊s answer was to give pensioners everything they wanted, too. He promised to maintain the triple lock and winter fuel allowance for all pensioners, and freeze the pension age at 66.But a high financial safety net for pensioners will prove to be hugely costly without some deep thinking about the state＊s responsibility to fund health, housing and social care for this group.Caring for the old is one of the biggest drags on growth across the developed world. Labour promises to deal with the problem out of general taxation. Unfortunately, that won＊t leave much money for the young. There are choices to be made."															
															
" It has been many a year since one of the two main political parties has gone into an election on a platform that is unashamed about the virtues of tax and spend.The document sketches out a picture of Britain in which the size of the state is bigger 每 apart from during the special circumstances of the financial crisis 每 than at any time since the 1980s. You would have to go back even further 每 to the early 1950s 每 to find a time when tax as a share of the economy will be as high as it would be under Labour＊s plan for 2021-22.. Scrutiny of the documents suggests it is based on three key assumptions 每 and one sleight of hand.Assumption number one is that in an era of anti-politics everything has to be costed. So John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has insisted that current spending commitments have to be matched by tax increases:  Assumption number two is that the public will wear tax increases because they will only be levied on companies and the better off. The gamble is that on tax, if not welfare or immigration, Britain has moved to the left over the past decade, with bubbling public anger at ※fat cat§ pay and the widening gap between rich and poor.Almost half of Labour＊s proposed tax increases come from corporation tax (?19.4bn) and another ?6.4bn comes from a 45% income tax for those earning more than ?80,000 a year and a 50% rate for those earning more than ?123,000 a year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that those earning between ?80,000 and ?100,000 a year will be paying between zero and ?1,000 in extra tax a year, while somebody earning between ?123,000 and ?150,000 will be paying between ?2,725 and ?5,425 more a year. That assumes that people don＊t change the way they behave as a result of the higher taxes and that companies don＊t shift their operations out of the UK. has made an allowance of ?4bn for possible losses that might occur as a result of behavioural change, but on the side of the ledger has included ?6.5bn from a crackdown on tax avoidance 每 a traditional recourse for politicians seeking to make their sums add up.The excessive pay levy (the fat cat tax) will generate relatively little extra revenue (?1.3bn) because only a tiny proportion of people will pay for it. Even then, the cost is unlikely to be borne by Premier League footballers 每 one group that would be eligible 每 but by the club＊s supporters through dearer tickets and higher-priced merchandise.The Institute for Fiscal Studies doubts whether Labour will raise ?48.6bn 每 or anything like it 每 from the proposed tax changes. Paul Johnson, the thinktank＊s director, says ?20bn to ?30bn would be closer to the mark.The third assumption is that Britain is ready to move on from the age of austerity and will accept some extra borrowing. That gamble is necessary because Labour＊s tax increases only cover day-to-day spending and not investment in public infrastructure of ?25bn a year.Labour believes that the failure of the Conservatives to get the budget deficit down despite year after year of austerity has made it possible to make the case for a different approach under which McDonnell would take advantage of low interest rates to borrow to invest. The economic case for higher spending on infrastructure projects has been made by . It remains to be seen, however, whether voters in key swing seats are ready for it.Finally, there＊s the sleight of hand. Labour＊s manifesto does not include costings for renationalising the railways, water, the Royal Mail and energy. This will be an expensive business: the water industry alone is valued at more than ?60bn. How would Labour pay for this? From even higher taxes? From the ?25bn of borrowing it has earmarked for public infrastructure? From additional borrowing in addition to the ?25bn? The manifesto was silent on this and it was telling that one shadow cabinet member, Sarah Champion, said the water proposal was an ※intent§. Certainly, the upfront cost of acquiring a private company would then see the state obtain an income stream. But if Labour＊s aim is to use nationalisation to, for example, keep water bills down, that stream of income will be lower. Perhaps caught unawares by the timing of the election, the nationalisation programme does not appear to have been fully thought through."															
"  suggests that not only has the automation of work barely begun but that the ways in which we measure the effects of technology on employment are inadequate to the task.The authors argue that to understand how automation is transforming our workplaces, we need better ways of tracking technological change. Put simply, they are saying that if we are what we measure 每 that is, if policy is driven by the information we collect 每 then we are collecting the wrong information. ※Data on many of these trends are elusive, reflecting [the] changing nature of society and the economy, and gaps in [the] statistical infrastructure,§ the report says.It points out, for instance, that we don＊t have a regular source of information about workers in part-time and other sorts of casual employment. Nor do we have good information about investment in computer technology at either the level of the company or of any given occupation. Also lacking is long-term information about the way in which skills within particular jobs are changing, as well as data on how effective educational practices are in preparing people for work. Such information gaps undermine our ability to respond appropriately to technological change and its effects on employment.This is a huge wake-up call for governments and businesses around the world who are proving slow to engage with the changing nature of work and who have tended to hide behind the mantra of ※jobs and growth§, as if that will take care of everything. It is a reminder to all of us that we are long way from understanding what the future of work really looks like.The authors call for three new indices to be developed, tools that can be used to plug holes in conventional measures such as GDP, productivity and the unemployment rate 每 a technology progress index, an artificial intelligence progress index and an organisational change and technology diffusion index.They set out the parameters of each in some detail and, in so doing, open up a much-needed discussion about the data used to help form public policy. We tend to think of measures like GDP and productivity as eternal truths of economics and, indeed, they have proved their worth over time. Nonetheless, some of them are not only reasonably recent inventions, dating from around the second world war, but are designed to measure activity in an economy of mass manufacturing, a sector increasingly being displaced by the information economy as the primary source of global wealth. This means the measures themselves are also increasingly irrelevant.As the economics professor : ※The IMF model suggests Australian unemployment falling to 5.2% ＃ in 2017 and to 5.1% in 2018. But that is a pre-2008 model of how the labour market and macroeconomy interrelate. Maybe that＊s still the right model but I wouldn＊t bet on it.§As the entrepreneur and founder of Wired Magazine : ※Productivity is for robots. Humans excel at wasting time, experimenting, playing, creating and exploring. None of these fare well under the scrutiny of productivity. That is why science and art are so hard to fund. But they are also the foundation of long-term growth.§To help understand the point Kelly is making, consider that a quarter of Britain＊s top actors have been . So although JK Rowling may be a billion-dollar industry, her value as a contributor to national wealth does not improve by subjecting her to a stopwatch and increased output to improve her productivity.What Kelly is saying is that, if you can measure a job＊s productivity, you can probably replace that job with a machine, so that when it comes to humans in the workplace we should be measuring different things. ※[Our] notions of jobs, of work, of the economy don＊t include a lot of space for ＃ experimenting, playing, creating and exploring,§ Kelly says, but those are the very skills that are likely to become more valuable in the workplaces of the future.So the value that humans will increasingly bring to the workplace is to be not a robot, which will mean measuring our contribution by something other than inputs and outputs.The National Academies report is not arguing for a wholesale replacement of traditional measures of economic activity but it is saying we need vast new supplementary data to better understand the ways in which new technologies are affecting the work that we do. Until we develop and implement these measures, it will mean that, on everything from education to welfare to employment policy, governments are flying blind. The concerns of the report＊s authors are being driven by their belief that the technological disruption of employment has barely begun. They write: ※Opportunities for digitising and automating tasks are far from exhausted. In particular, the workforce will be increasingly affected as more and more cognitive tasks become fully or partly automatable ... and as advances in robotics yield enhanced physical dexterity, mobility and sensory perception in machines. These trends will almost surely change the demand for the workers performing these tasks and the nature of the organisations in which they work.§And so the sooner we start accurately measuring what is happening, the better."															
"A post-Brexit trade deal should be governed by a new court system that is fairer to workers, the TUC＊s general secretary has said.Frances O＊Grady said Britain and the EU had a chance to take a different approach to arbitration courts that make judgments on trade disputes.The investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), a little-known system for resolving trade disputes that has existed since the 1960s, underpins thousands of European contracts. Critics, led by trade unions, have long argued it awards too much power to corporations at the expense of the public interest, and does not give enough protection to workers and consumers.O＊Grady said there was a chance to change the system when Britain negotiates a trade deal with the EU. Britain will not be in position to sign a trade deal until it leaves the EU, most likely in 2019, but unions want to put the issue on the agenda now.※There is an opportunity to do this one differently, to ensure that workers＊ rights are seen as a core standards rather than an add on, that any arbitration mechanism is not only transparent but fair,§ she said. ※I hope people have learned lessons from trade deals like TTIP and Ceta, and public concern over arbitration mechanisms,§ she said, arguing that such agreements treated workers and consumers like second-class citizens.The European commission has strongly rejected claims that it downgrades workers＊ rights. The comprehensive and economic trade agreement with Canada was described as the gold standard of global trade deals, with more government oversight than any earlier agreement.Responding to critics of the ISDS system, the EU trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstr?m, devised a new kind of special court for resolving disputes, where judges would be appointed by governments rather than disputing parties.O＊Grady said that the arbitration mechanism in Ceta was ※better than those that came before§ but had not fundamentally addressed unions＊ concerns. ※If you are going to have standards for goods and services, why not have standards for labour as well, to make sure there is a level playing field and you don＊t get competition on the back of workers being treated badly.,§ she said. O＊Grady was speaking to the Guardian in Brussels, where she also called on Theresa May to face down ※Brexit fundamentalists§ in the Conservative party who want to use Britain＊s EU departure to start a bonfire of regulations.Speaking between meetings with EU officials, she said she was pleased with the EU＊s  guidelines and the European parliament＊s resolution, which both put European negotiators on guard against unfair competition from Britain. The EU draft guidelines 每 to be agreed by EU leaders at the end of April 每 call for safeguards against ※unfair competitive advantages through ＃ fiscal, social and environmental dumping§.The TUC＊s trickier task is arguably to lobby the British government, as debate rages about what kind of economy post-Brexit Britain should be.On the steps of Downing Street in her , May promised to fight the ※burning injustice§ of poverty, but the government＊s message was clouded when Philip Hammond suggested .Amid concern that Brexit will drown out the government＊s domestic agenda, O＊Grady said she didn＊t expect much from this year＊s Queen＊s speech, but stressed the prime minister would be under pressure to deliver on her Downing Street speech after raising expectations about help for people from an ordinary working-class family. ※She is going to have to have something compelling to inspire confidence that people＊s lives are going to get better.,§ she said.The prime minister could not afford ※another hiccough§ such as the  O＊Grady said last year＊s proposals were ※disappointing§ but the issue was not ※completely dead yet§."															
"very week for the past few months, news has emerged from across the US that  supporters are suffering. In February it was farmers in California＊s Central Valley, a demographic who voted heavily for Trump, who are now discovering that their workers 每 70% of whom may be in the country illegally 每 are threatened by Trump＊s executive orders on immigration.In March, we discovered that those who stand to lose most in the way of tax credits under Trump＊s new tax plan are, by a heavy percentage, his own low-income voters. A few days ago, the New York Times columnist  and found that threatened cuts to local services 每 for the unemployed and the elderly 每 will effect schemes that many of them rely on.To the non-Trump supporter, these dispatches have brought on some visceral responses. ※Serves you right§ and ※hahaha§ are hard rejoinders to justify in adulthood, but the sense of release can be irresistible. ※Why is building a wall more important than educating people?§ asked one Trump voter, whose government-funded training scheme had been earmarked for elimination, and to which one could only reply: what took you so long?What＊s interesting about this reaction is that, irrespective of the issues at stake, it suggests Trump haters can, in their way, be as guilty of emotional self-indulgence as Trump supporters. One of the lofty observations that gets made by the better-off about the less well-off is that they frequently act against their own basic interests, in favour of more cathartic and irrational returns, a category into which any version of ※serves you right§ surely falls. By mocking and belittling the idiocy of Trump supporters, they 每 we 每 increase the likelihood of Trump being re-elected.Because here is the depressing thing: Kristof, canvassing people who are almost certainly going to suffer at the hands of the man they elected (and one of whom, it was impossible not to notice, was called Tarzan), discovered that they would not renounce their support of Trump. Most said they would vote for him a second time.There is a sunken cost bias at work here, like falling for a conman: it is humiliating and the only way to preserve one＊s dignity is to double down on the original mistake 每 but there is also a sense that any commitment by Trump voters to defend their bad choice will only increase with schadenfreude from the left.Ivanka Trump , and was widely ridiculed for her remark: ※I don＊t know what it means to be complicit.§ She then gave an outline of what she thinks it might mean: ※I hope time will prove that I have done a good job and much more importantly, that my father＊s administration is the success that I know it will be.§This added to the definition of ※complicit§ she gave, some months ago, when first asked about complicity with her father＊s regime: ※If being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I＊m complicit.§This is, obviously, not what is meant by complicit, which the people at Merriam-Webster helpfully cleared up by tweeting the actual definition: ※Helping to commit a crime or do wrong in some way.§What struck me about Ivanka＊s words was that they were less redolent of weasily avoidance than of a genuine blank in her make-up. ※Amoral§ is an overused term, but with Ivanka, as with her father, one gets a sense of someone who simply can＊t conceptualise wrongdoing. There is making money, and there is not making money, and there is nothing in between.A friend furthers a novel theory: that Trump is suffering from , the microscopic parasite that breeds in cats but can embed itself in other mammals, including humans, as carriers. The cat parasite, if you have it 每 and apparently 350,000 people do in Britain alone 每 can guide behaviour towards paranoid, irrational neuroticism, an enemy agent more powerful than the Russians."															
															
"The contrasting fortunes of rich and poor in the decade since the start of the financial crisis are starkly illustrated by a new report showing the young and those renting homes struggling while the top 1% have now recouped all the ground they lost during the world＊s worst post-second world war slump.New research from the showed that households with incomes of ?275,000 or more quickly recovered from the impact of the deep recession and have seen their share of national income return to the level seen before the global banking system froze up in the summer of 2007.But while the rich have been thriving, the thinktank said the other 99% of UK households had found it more difficult to make ends meet.It added that the year running up to last month＊s had seen weaker wage growth, higher inflation and frozen welfare benefits and that these offset any gains from rising employment.Groups that strongly supported Labour in the election 每 those aged under 35 who have been frozen out of home ownership by low wages and high prices 每 have fared particularly badly. They are the only group that had so far failed to see incomes return to pre-crisis levels.The thinktank said the report highlighted a country increasingly divided by age, by housing tenure and by 每 and that all three factors had been important in the shock election result in which Labour gained 30 seats and deprived the Conservatives of an overall majority.The foundation added that the surprise was not that the groups faring badly had turned out 每 both in last year＊s EU referendum and in the recent general election 每 to reject the status quo, but that it had taken them so long to do so.Sterling＊s fall since the vote in June 2016 has pushed up inflation by making imports dearer, but the Resolution Foundation said the current squeeze on living standards for the ※just about managing§ previously championed by the prime minister, Theresa May, was a continuation of a longer-term trend.Families on low and middle incomes had seen their living standards rise by just 3% since 2002-03. Once housing costs had been taken into account they were no better off than they were 15 years ago. Two in five said they were unable to afford to save ?10 per month, while 42% say they could not afford a week away on holiday at least once a year, up from 37% before the financial crisis.Adam Corlett, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ※The incomes of the top 1% took a short, sharp hit following the financial crisis. But they＊ve recovered rapidly since and the very richest households have now seen their share of the nation＊s income return to very high pre-crisis levels.※In contrast, for millions of young and lower-income families the current slowdown comes on top of a tough decade for living standards, providing a bleak economic backdrop to the shock election result.※Over the last 15 years and four prime ministers, Britain has failed to deliver decent living standards growth for young families and those on low incomes. Rising housing costs have added further financial pressures. The big surprise of the recent election and EU referendum wasn＊t that many of those families turned out to vote against the status quo, but rather why it＊s taken so long for that to happen.§The share of national disposable income for the richest 1% of households rose steadily after Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979 and reached a peak of 8.5% on the eve of the financial crisis. The Resolution Foundation＊s report showed that after dipping to 7% during the recession that followed, the top 1% again have 8.5% of national income.The thinktank 每 which focuses on those on middle and lower incomes 每 said Theresa May had been right when she entered No 10 to emphasise the need for the economy to work for the young and those on low pay. However, the foundation＊s annual audit of living standards found that real incomes for these groups had fallen over the past year.It said a shortlived boom in the UK in the two years ahead of the 2015 general election won by David Cameron had come to an abrupt end in 2016-17, when real income growth for the typical household income had halved to 0.7% a year. Low and middle-income families fared even worse, with income growth of 0.4%.※This is the big challenge facing Britain today,§ said Corlett. ※Not only do we need to get incomes growing again but we need to ensure that growth is spread evenly across the country, across generations and between rich and poor.§Recent evidence had suggested that living standards 每 usually a key factor in deciding which way people vote 每 were actually falling when the prime minister decided to call the June election.The Resolution Foundation said the disappointing recent performance of the economy meant that the incomes of young families 每 those under 35 每 were no higher than they were 15 years ago. The incomes of pensioners 每 a group that overwhelmingly voted Conservative last month 每 have grown by 30% in real terms over the same period.Britain has had ultra-low interest rates since 2009, but the report said the benefits had gone to those who owned property, not renters. Incomes of those with a mortgage grew by an above-average 1.7% in 2016 while private and social renters experienced income growth of 0.2%. The report said differences between those with mortgage and renters went beyond the security and wealth associated with home ownership and extended to families＊ day-to-day living standards.Fast-rising disposable incomes for the top 1% had been the sole driver of rising inequality since the mid-1990s, the Resolution Foundation said. The gap between rich and poor for the other 99% of the population had actually fallen over the same period, it added."															
"he annual January gathering of the World Economic Forum in  is usually a placid affair: a place for well-heeled participants to exchange notes on global business opportunities, or powder conditions on the local ski slopes, while cradling champagne and canapes. This January, the ultra-rich and the sparkling wine returned, but by all reports the mood was one of anxiety, defensiveness and self-reproach.The future of economic globalisation, for which the Davos men and women see themselves as caretakers, had been shaken by a series of political earthquakes. ※Globalisation§ can mean many things, but what lay in particular doubt was the long-advanced project of increasing free trade in goods across borders. The previous summer, Britain had voted to leave the largest trading bloc in the world. In November, the unexpected victory of , who vowed to withdraw from major trade deals, appeared to jeopardise the trading relationships of the world＊s richest country. Forthcoming elections in France and Germany suddenly seemed to bear the possibility of anti-globalisation parties garnering better results than ever before. The barbarians weren＊t at the gates to the ski-lifts yet 每 but they weren＊t very far.In a panel titled , the economist , otherwise a well-known supporter of free trade, forthrightly asked the audience to accept that ※there have been significant losses§ from globalisation. ※It is not clear to me that we are going to be able to remedy them under the current infrastructure,§ she added. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, : ※more redistribution§. After years of hedging or discounting the malign effects of free trade, it was time to face facts: globalisation caused job losses and depressed wages, and the usual Davos proposals 每 such as instructing affected populations to accept the new reality 每 weren＊t going to work. Unless something changed, the political consequences were likely to get worse.The backlash to globalisation has helped fuel the extraordinary political shifts of the past 18 months. During the close race to become the Democratic party candidate, senator Bernie Sanders relentlessly attacked Hillary Clinton on her . On the campaign trail, Donald Trump openly proposed tilting the terms of trade in favour of American industry. ※Americanism, not globalism, shall be our creed,§ he bellowed at the Republican national convention last July.  in the regions of the UK devastated by the flight of manufacturing. At Davos in January, British prime minister Theresa May, the leader of the party of capital and inherited wealth, improbably picked up the theme, warning that, for many, ※talk of greater globalisation ＃ means their jobs being outsourced and wages undercut.§ Meanwhile,  has been warning against free movement of people as well as goods. Following her qualifying victory in the first round of France＊s presidential election, ※the main thing at stake in this election is the rampant globalisation that is endangering our civilisation.§It was only a few decades ago that globalisation was held by many, even by some critics, to be an inevitable, unstoppable force. ※Rejecting globalisation,§ the American journalist George Packer has written, ※was like rejecting the sunrise.§  could take place in services, capital and ideas, making it a notoriously imprecise term; but what it meant most often was making it cheaper to trade across borders 每 something that seemed to many at the time to be an unquestionable good. In practice, this often meant that industry would move from rich countries, where labour was expensive, to poor countries, where labour was cheaper. People in the rich countries would either have to accept lower wages to compete, or lose their jobs. But no matter what, the goods they formerly produced would now be imported, and be even cheaper. And the unemployed could get new, higher-skilled jobs (if they got the requisite training). Mainstream economists and politicians upheld the consensus about the merits of globalisation, with little concern that there might be political consequences.Back then, economists could calmly chalk up anti-globalisation sentiment to a marginal group of delusional protesters, or disgruntled stragglers still toiling uselessly in ※sunset industries§. These days, as sizable constituencies have voted in country after country for anti-free-trade policies, or candidates that promise to limit them, the old self-assurance is gone. Millions have rejected, with uncertain results, the punishing logic that globalisation could not be stopped. The backlash has swelled a wave of soul-searching among economists, one that had already begun to roll ashore with the financial crisis. How did they fail to foresee the repercussions?n the heyday of the globalisation consensus, few economists questioned its merits in public. But in 1997, the Harvard economist  published a slim book that created a stir. Appearing just as the US was about to enter a historic economic boom, Rodrik＊s book, Has Globalization Gone Too Far?, sounded an unusual note of alarm.Rodrik pointed to a series of dramatic recent events that challenged the idea that growing free trade would be peacefully accepted. In 1995, France had adopted a programme of fiscal austerity in order to prepare for entry into the eurozone; trade unions responded with the largest wave of strikes since 1968. In 1996, only five years after the end of the Soviet Union 每 with Russia＊s once-protected markets having been forcibly opened, leading to a sudden decline in living standards 每 a communist won 40% of the vote in Russia＊s presidential elections. That same year, two years after the passing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), one of the most ambitious multinational deals ever accomplished, a white nationalist running on an ※America first§ programme of economic protectionism did surprisingly well in the presidential primaries of the Republican party.What was the pathology of which all of these disturbing events were symptoms? For Rodrik, it was ※the process that has come to be called ＆globalisation＊§. Since the 1980s, and especially following the collapse of the Soviet Union, lowering barriers to international trade had become the axiom of countries everywhere. Tariffs had to be slashed and regulations spiked. Trade unions, which kept wages high and made it harder to fire people, had to be crushed. Governments vied with each other to make their country more hospitable 每 more ※competitive§ 每 for businesses. That meant making labour cheaper and regulations looser, often in countries that had once tried their hand at socialism, or had spent years protecting ※homegrown§ industries with tariffs.These moves were generally applauded by economists. After all, their profession had long embraced the principle of comparative advantage 每 simply put, the idea countries will trade with each other in order to gain what each lacks, thereby benefiting both. In theory, then, the globalisation of trade in goods and services would benefit consumers in rich countries by giving them access to inexpensive goods produced by cheaper labour in poorer countries, and this demand, in turn, would help grow the economies of those poorer countries.But the social cost, in Rodrik＊s dissenting view, was high 每 and consistently underestimated by economists. He noted that since the 1970s, lower-skilled European and American workers had endured a major fall in the real value of their wages, which dropped by more than 20%. Workers were suffering more spells of unemployment, more volatility in the hours they were expected to work.While many economists attributed much of the insecurity to technological change 每 sophisticated new machines displacing low-skilled workers 每 Rodrik suggested that the process of globalisation should shoulder more of the blame. It was, in particular, the competition between workers in developing and developed countries that helped drive down wages and job security for workers in developed countries. Over and over, they would be held hostage to the possibility that their business would up and leave, in order to find cheap labour in other parts of the world; they had to accept restraints on their salaries 每 or else. Opinion polls registered their strong levels of anxiety and insecurity, and the political effects were becoming more visible. Rodrik foresaw that the cost of greater ※economic integration§ would be greater ※social disintegration§. The inevitable result would be a huge political backlash.As Rodrik would later recall, other economists tended to dismiss his arguments 每 or fear them. , who would win the Nobel prize in 2008 for his earlier work in trade theory and economic geography, privately warned Rodrik that his work would give ※ammunition to the barbarians§.It was a tacit acknowledgment that pro-globalisation economists, journalists and politicians had come under growing pressure from a new movement on the left, who were raising concerns very similar to Rodrik＊s. Over the course of the 1990s, an unwieldy international coalition had begun to contest the notion that globalisation was good. Called ※anti-globalisation§ by the media, and the ※alter-globalisation§ or ※global justice§ movement by its participants, it tried to draw attention to the devastating effect that free trade policies were having, especially in the developing world, where globalisation was supposed to be having its most beneficial effect. This was a time when figures such as the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman had given the topic a glitzy prominence by : chatting amiably with the CEO of Monsanto one day, gawking at lingerie manufacturers in Sri Lanka the next. Activists were intent on showing a much darker picture, revealing how the record of globalisation consisted mostly of farmers pushed off their land and the rampant proliferation of sweatshops. They also implicated the highest world bodies in their critique: the G7, World Bank and IMF. In 1999, the movement reached a high point when a unique coalition of trade unions and environmentalists  the meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle.In a state of panic, economists responded with a flood of columns and books that defended the necessity of a more open global market economy, in tones ranging from grandiose to sarcastic. In January 2000,  to denounce the ※trashing§ of the WTO, calling it ※a sad irony that the cause that has finally awakened the long-dormant American left is that of 每 yes! 每 denying opportunity to third-world workers§.Where Krugman was derisive, others were solemn, putting the contemporary fight against the ※anti-globalisation§ left in a continuum of struggles for liberty. ※Liberals, social democrats and moderate conservatives are on the same side in the great battles against religious fanatics, obscurantists, extreme environmentalists, fascists, Marxists and, of course, contemporary anti-globalisers,§ wrote the Financial Times columnist and former  economist Martin Wolf in his book Why Globalization Works. Language like this lent the fight for globalisation the air of an epochal struggle. More common was the rhetoric of figures such as Friedman, who in his book The World is Flat mocked the ※pampered American college kids§ who, ※wearing their branded clothing, began to get interested in sweatshops as a way of expiating their guilt§.Arguments against the global justice movement rested on the idea that the ultimate benefits of a more open and integrated economy would outweigh the downsides. ※Freer trade is associated with higher growth and ＃ higher growth is associated with reduced poverty,§ wrote the Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati in his book In Defense of Globalization. ※Hence, growth reduces poverty.§ No matter how troubling some of the local effects, the implication went, globalisation promised a greater good.The fact that proponents of globalisation now felt compelled to spend much of their time defending it indicates how much visibility the global justice movement had achieved by the early 2000s. Still, over time, the movement lost ground, as a policy consensus settled in favour of globalisation. The proponents of globalisation were determined never to let another gathering be interrupted. They stopped meeting in major cities, and security everywhere was tightened. By the time of the invasion of Iraq, the world＊s attention had turned from free trade to George Bush and the ※war on terror,§ leaving the globalisation consensus intact.Above all, there was a widespread perception that globalisation was working as it was supposed to. The local adverse effects that activists pointed to 每 sweatshop labour, starving farmers 每 were increasingly obscured by the staggering GDP numbers and fantastical images of gleaming skylines coming out of China. With some lonely exceptions 每 such as Rodrik and the former World Bank chief and Columbia University professor  每 the pursuit of freer trade became a consensus position for economists, commentators and the vast majority of mainstream politicians, to the point where the benefits of free trade seemed to command blind adherence. In a 2006 TV interview, Thomas Friedman was asked whether there was any free trade deal he would not support. He replied that there wasn＊t, admitting, ※I wrote a column supporting the Cafta, the Caribbean Free Trade initiative. I didn＊t even know what was in it. I just knew two words: free trade.§n the wake of the financial crisis, the cracks began to show in the consensus on globalisation, to the point that, today, there may no longer be a consensus. Economists who were once ardent proponents of globalisation have become some of its most prominent critics. Erstwhile supporters now concede, at least in part, that it has produced inequality, unemployment and downward pressure on wages. Nuances and criticisms that economists only used to raise in private seminars are finally coming out in the open.A few months before the financial crisis hit, Krugman was already confessing to a ※guilty conscience§. In the 1990s, he had been very influential in arguing that global trade with poor countries had only a small effect on workers＊ wages in rich countries. By 2008, he was having doubts: the data seemed to suggest that the effect was much larger than he had suspected.In the years that followed, the crash, the crisis of the eurozone and the worldwide drop in the price of oil and other commodities combined to put a huge dent in global trade. Since 2012, the IMF reported in its , trade was growing at 3% a year 每 less than half the average of the previous three decades. That month, Martin Wolf argued in a column that globalisation had ※lost dynamism§, due to a slackening of the world economy, the ※exhaustion§ of new markets to exploit and a rise in protectionist policies around the world. In an interview earlier this year, Wolf suggested to me that, though he remained convinced globalisation had not been the decisive factor in rising inequality, he had nonetheless not fully foreseen when he was writing Why Globalization Works how ※radical the implications§ of worsening inequality ※might be for the US, and therefore the world§. Among these implications appears to be a rising distrust of the establishment that is blamed for the inequality. ※We have a very big political problem in many of our countries,§ he said. ※The elites 每 the policymaking business and financial elites 每 are . You need to make policy which brings people to think again that their societies are run in a decent and civilised way.§That distrust of the establishment has had highly visible political consequences: Farage, Trump, and Le Pen on the right; but also in new parties on the left, such as Spain＊s Podemos, and curious populist hybrids, such as Italy＊s . As in 1997, but to an even greater degree, the volatile political scene reflects public anxiety over ※the process that has come to be called ＆globalisation＊§. If the critics of globalisation could be dismissed before because of their lack of economics training, or ignored because they were in distant countries, or kept out of sight by a wall of police, their sudden political ascendancy in the rich countries of the west cannot be so easily discounted today.Over the past year, the opinion pages of prestigious newspapers have been filled with belated, rueful comments from the high priests of globalisation 每 the men who appeared to have defeated the anti-globalisers two decades earlier. Perhaps the most surprising such transformation has been that of Larry Summers. Possessed of a panoply of elite titles 每 former chief economist of the World Bank, former Treasury secretary, president emeritus of Harvard, former 每 Summers was renowned in the 1990s and 2000s for being a blustery proponent of globalisation. For Summers, it seemed, market logic was so inexorable that its dictates prevailed over every social concern. In an , he held that the cheapest way to dispose of toxic waste in rich countries was to dump it in poor countries, since it was financially cheaper for them to manage it. ※The laws of economics, it＊s often forgotten, are like the laws of engineering,§ he said in a speech that year at a World Bank-IMF meeting in Bangkok. ※There＊s only one set of laws and they work everywhere. One of the things I＊ve learned in my short time at the World Bank is that whenever anybody says, ＆But economics works differently here,＊ they＊re about to say something dumb.§Over the last two years, a different, in some ways unrecognizable Larry Summers has been appearing in newspaper editorial pages. More circumspect in tone, this humbler Summers has been arguing that economic opportunities in the developing world are slowing, and that the already rich economies are finding it hard to get out of the crisis. Barring some kind of breakthrough, Summers says, an era of slow growth is here to stay.In Summers＊s recent writings, this sombre conclusion has often been paired with a surprising political goal: advocating for a ※responsible nationalism§. Now he argues that politicians must recognise that ※the basic responsibility of government is to maximise the welfare of citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good§.ne curious thingabout the pro-globalisation consensus of the 1990s and 2000s, and its collapse in recent years, is how closely the cycle resembles a previous era. Pursuing free trade has always produced displacement and inequality 每 and political chaos, populism and retrenchment to go with it. Every time the social consequences of free trade are overlooked, political backlash follows. But free trade is only one of many forms that economic integration can take. History seems to suggest, however, that it might be the most destabilising one.Nearly all economists and scholars of globalisation like to point to the fact that the economy was rather globalised by the early 20th century. As European countries colonised Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, they turned their colonies into suppliers of raw materials for European manufacturers, as well as markets for European goods. Meanwhile, the economies of the colonisers were also becoming free-trade zones for each other. ※The opening years of the 20th century were the closest thing the world had ever seen to a free world market for goods, capital and labour,§ writes the Harvard professor of government Jeffry Frieden in his standard account, Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the 20th Century. ※It would be a hundred years before the world returned to that level of globalisation.§In addition to military force, what underpinned this convenient arrangement for imperial nations was the gold standard. Under this system, each national currency had an established gold value: the British pound sterling was backed by 113 grains of pure gold; the US dollar by 23.22 grains, and so on. This entailed that exchange rates were also fixed: a British pound was always equal to 4.87 dollars. The stability of exchange rates meant that the cost of doing business across borders was predictable. Just like the eurozone today, you could count on the value of the currency staying the same, so long as the storehouse of gold remained more or less the same.When there were gold shortages 每 as there were in the 1870s 每 the system stopped working. To protect the sanctity of the standard under conditions of stress, central bankers across the Europe and the US tightened access to credit and deflated prices. This left financiers in a decent position, but crushed farmers and the rural poor, for whom falling prices meant starvation. Then as now, economists and mainstream politicians largely overlooked the darker side of the economic picture.In the US, this fuelled one of the world＊s first self-described ※populist§ revolts, leading to the nomination of William Jennings Bryan as the Democratic party candidate in 1896. At his nominating convention, he gave a famous speech lambasting gold backers: ※You shall not press down upon the brow of labour this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.§ Then as now, financial elites and their supporters in the press were horrified. ※There has been an upheaval of the political crust,§ the Times of London reported, ※and strange creatures have come forth.§Businessmen were so distressed by Bryan that they backed the Republican candidate, William McKinley, who won partly by outspending Bryan five to one. Meanwhile, gold was bolstered by the discovery of new reserves in colonial South Africa. But the gold standard could not survive the first world war and the Great Depression. By the 1930s, unionisation had spread to more industries and there was a growing worldwide socialist movement. Protecting gold would mean mass unemployment and social unrest. Britain went off the gold standard in 1931, while Franklin Roosevelt took the US off it in 1933; France and several other countries would follow in 1936.The prioritisation of finance and trade over the welfare of people had come momentarily to an end. But this wasn＊t the end of the global economic system.he trade system that followed was global, too, with high levels of trade 每 but it took place on terms that often allowed developing countries to protect their industries. Because, from the perspective of free traders, protectionism is always seen as bad, the success of this postwar system has been largely under-recognised.Over the course of the 1930s and 40s, liberals 每 John Maynard Keynes among them 每 who had previously regarded departures from free trade as ※an imbecility and an outrage§ began to lose their religion. ※The decadent international but individualistic capitalism, in the hands of which we found ourselves after the war, is not a success,§ . ※It is not intelligent, it is not beautiful, it is not just, it is not virtuous 每 and it doesn＊t deliver the goods. In short, we dislike it, and we are beginning to despise it.§ He claimed sympathies ※with those who would minimise, rather than with those who would maximise, economic entanglement among nations,§ and argued that goods ※be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible§.The international systems that chastened figures such as Keynes helped produce in the next few years 每 especially the Bretton Woods agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) 每 set the terms under which the new wave of globalisation would take place.The key to the system＊s viability, in Rodrik＊s view, was its flexibility 每 something absent from contemporary globalisation, with its one-size-fits-all model of capitalism. Bretton Woods stabilised exchange rates by pegging the dollar loosely to gold, and other currencies to the dollar. Gatt consisted of rules governing free trade 每 negotiated by participating countries in a series of multinational ※rounds§ 每 that left many areas of the world economy, such as agriculture, untouched or unaddressed. ※Gatt＊s purpose was never to maximise free trade,§ Rodrik writes. ※It was to achieve the maximum amount of trade compatible with different nations doing their own thing. In that respect, the institution proved spectacularly successful.§Partly because Gatt was not always dogmatic about free trade, it allowed most countries to figure out their own economic objectives, within a somewhat international ambit. When nations contravened the agreement＊s terms on specific areas of national interest, they found that it ※contained loopholes wide enough for an elephant to pass§, in Rodrik＊s words. If a nation wanted to protect its steel industry, for example, it could claim ※injury§ under the rules of Gatt and raise tariffs to discourage steel imports: ※an abomination from the standpoint of free trade§. These were useful for countries that were recovering from the war and needed to build up their own industries via tariffs 每 duties imposed on particular imports. Meanwhile, from 1948 to 1990, world trade grew at an annual average of nearly 7% 每 faster than the post-communist years, which we think of as the high point of globalisation. ※If there was a golden era of globalisation,§ Rodrik has written, ※this was it.§Gatt, however, failed to cover many of the countries in the developing world. These countries eventually created their own system, the United Nations conference on trade and development (UNCTAD). Under this rubric, many countries 每 especially in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia 每 adopted a policy of protecting homegrown industries by replacing imports with domestically produced goods. It worked poorly in some places 每 India and Argentina, for example, where the trade barriers were too high, resulting in factories that cost more to set up than the value of the goods they produced 每 but remarkably well in others, such as east Asia, much of Latin America and parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where homegrown industries did spring up. Though many later economists and commentators would dismiss the achievements of this model, it theoretically fit Larry Summers＊s recent rubric on globalisation: ※the basic responsibility of government is to maximise the welfare of citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good.§The critical turning point 每 away from this system of trade balanced against national protections 每 came in the 1980s. Flagging growth and high inflation in the west, along with growing competition from Japan, opened the way for a political transformation. The elections of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were seminal, putting free-market radicals in charge of two of the world＊s five biggest economies and ushering in an era of ※hyperglobalisation§. In the new political climate, economies with large public sectors and strong governments within the global capitalist system were no longer seen as aids to the system＊s functioning, but impediments to it.Not only did these ideologies take hold in the US and the UK; they seized international institutions as well. Gatt renamed itself as the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the new rules the body negotiated began to cut more deeply into national policies. Its international trade rules sometimes undermined national legislation. The WTO＊s appellate court intervened relentlessly in member nations＊ tax, environmental and regulatory policies, including those of the United States: the US＊s fuel emissions standards were judged to discriminate against imported gasoline, and its  was overturned. If national health and safety regulations were stricter than WTO rules necessitated, they could only remain in place if they were shown to have ※scientific justification§.The purest version of hyperglobalisation was tried out in Latin America in the 1980s. Known as the ※Washington consensus§, this model usually involved loans from the IMF that were contingent on those countries lowering trade barriers and privatising many of their nationally held industries. Well into the 1990s, economists were proclaiming the indisputable benefits of openness. In an influential 1995 paper, Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner wrote: ※We find no cases to support the frequent worry that a country might open and yet fail to grow.§But the Washington consensus was bad for business: most countries did worse than before. Growth faltered, and citizens across Latin America revolted against attempted privatisations of water and gas. In Argentina, which followed the Washington consensus to the letter, a , precipitating an economic collapse and massive street protests that forced out the government that had pursued privatising reforms. Argentina＊s revolt presaged a left-populist upsurge across the continent: from 1999 to 2007, leftwing leaders and parties took power in Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, all of them campaigning against the Washington consensus on globalisation. These revolts were a preview of the backlash of today.odrik 每 perhaps the contemporary economistwhose views have been most amply vindicated by recent events 每 was himself a beneficiary of protectionism in Turkey. His father＊s ballpoint pen company was sheltered under tariffs, and achieved enough success to allow Rodrik to attend Harvard in the 1970s as an undergraduate. This personal understanding of the mixed nature of economic success may be one of the reasons why his work runs against the broad consensus of mainstream economics writing on globalisation.※I never felt that my ideas were out of the mainstream,§ Rodrik told me recently. Instead, it was that the mainstream had lost touch with the diversity of opinions and methods that already existed within economics. ※The economics profession is strange in that the more you move away from the seminar room to the public domain, the more the nuances get lost, especially on issues of trade.§ He lamented the fact that while, in the classroom, the models of trade discuss losers and winners, and, as a result, the necessity of policies of redistribution, in practice, an ※arrogance and hubris§ had led many economists to ignore these implications. ※Rather than speaking truth to power, so to speak, many economists became cheerleaders for globalisation.§In his 2011 book , Rodrik concluded that ※we cannot simultaneously pursue democracy, national determination, and economic globalisation.§ The results of the 2016 elections and referendums provide ample testimony of the justness of the thesis, with millions voting to push back, for better or for worse, against the campaigns and institutions that promised more globalisation. ※I＊m not at all surprised by the backlash,§ Rodrik told me. ※Really, nobody should have been surprised.§But what, in any case, would ※more globalisation§ look like? For the same economists and writers who have started to rethink their commitments to greater integration, it doesn＊t mean quite what it did in the early 2000s. It＊s not only the discourse that＊s changed: globalisation itself has changed, developing into a more chaotic and unequal system than many economists predicted. The benefits of globalisation have been largely concentrated in a handful of Asian countries. And even in those countries, the good times may be running out.Statistics from , a 2016 book by the development economist Branko Milanovi?, indicate that in relative terms the greatest benefits of globalisation have accrued to a rising ※emerging middle class§, based preponderantly in China. But the cons are there, too: in absolute terms, the largest gains have gone to what is commonly called ※the 1%§ 每 half of whom are based in the US. Economist Richard Baldwin has shown in his recent book, The Great Convergence, that nearly all of the gains from globalisation have been concentrated in six countries.Barring some political catastrophe, in which rightwing populism continued to gain, and in which globalisation would be the least of our problems 每 Wolf admitted that he was ※not at all sure§ that this could be ruled out 每 globalisation was always going to slow; in fact, it already has. One reason, says Wolf, was that ※a very, very large proportion of the gains from globalisation 每 by no means all 每 have been exploited. We have a more open world economy to trade than we＊ve ever had before.§ Citing The Great Convergence, Wolf noted that supply chains have already expanded, and that future developments, such as automation and the use of robots, looked to undermine the promise of a growing industrial workforce. Today, the political priorities were less about trade and more about , as technology renders old jobs obsolete and transforms the world of work.Rodrik, too, believes that globalisation, whether reduced or increased, is unlikely to produce the kind of economic effects it once did. For him"															
 this slowdown has something to do with what he calls ※premature deindustrialisation§. In the past	 the simplest model of globalisation suggested that rich countries would gradually become ※service economies§	 while emerging economies picked up the industrial burden. Yet recent statistics show the world as a whole is deindustrialising. Countries that one would have expected to have more industrial potential are going through the stages of automation more quickly than previously developed countries did	 and thereby failing to develop the broad industrial workforce seen as a key to shared prosperity.For both Rodrik and Wolf	 the political reaction to globalisation bore possibilities of deep uncertainty. ※I really have found it very difficult to decide whether what we＊re living through is a blip	 or a fundamental and profound transformation of the world 每 at least as significant as the one that brought about the first world war and the Russian revolution	§ Wolf told me. He cited his agreement with economists such as Summers that shifting away from the earlier emphasis on globalisation had now become a political priority; that to pursue still greater liberalisation was like showing ※a red rag to a bull§ in terms of what it might do to the already compromised political stability of the western world.Rodrik pointed to a belated emphasis	 both among political figures and economists	 on the necessity of compensating those displaced by globalisation with retraining and more robust welfare states. But pro-free-traders had a history of cutting compensation: Bill Clinton passed Nafta	 but failed to expand safety nets. ※The issue is that the people are rightly not trusting the centrists who are now promising compensation	§ Rodrik said. ※One reason that Hillary Clinton didn＊t get any traction with those people is that she didn＊t have any credibility.§Rodrik felt that economics commentary failed to register the gravity of the situation: that there were increasingly few avenues for global growth	 and that much of the damage done by globalisation 每 economic and political 每 is irreversible. ※There is a sense that we＊re at a turning point	§ he said. ※There＊s a lot more thinking about what can be done. There＊s a renewed emphasis on compensation 每 which	 you know	 I think has come rather late.§ Follow the Long Read on Twitter at 	" or sign up to the long read weekly email ."""
"Britain＊s public finances are in worse shape to withstand a recession than they were on the eve of the 2007 financial crash a decade ago and face the twin threat of a fresh downturn and Brexit, the Treasury＊s independent forecaster has warned.The  每 the UK＊s fiscal watchdog 每 said another recession was inevitable at some point and that Theresa May＊s failure to win a parliamentary majority in last month＊s election left the public finances more vulnerable to being blown off course than they were in 2007.In its first in-depth analysis of the fiscal risks facing Britain, the OBR said its main message was clear: ※Governments should expect nasty fiscal surprises from time to time 每 because policy can only reduce risks, not eliminate them 每 and plan accordingly. ※And they have to do so in the context of ongoing pressures that are likely to weigh on receipts and drive up spending and a variety of risks that governments choose to expose themselves to for policy reasons. This is true for any government, but this one also has to manage the uncertainties posed by Brexit, which could influence the likelihood or impact of other risks.§The OBR said the size of the UK＊s Brexit divorce bill 每 currently a matter of dispute between London and Brussels 每 would have little impact on the public finances. But it noted that even a small fall in Britain＊s underlying growth rate after departure from the EU would lead to a big increase in the country＊s debt burden.If a knock to trade with the rest of Europe caused productivity to slip by just 0.1 percentage points over the next 50 years, tax receipts would be ?36bn lower. With spending growth left unchanged, the debt-to-GDP ratio would end up around 50 percentage points higher, the OBR added.The campaign group Open Britain said the OBR＊s report showed ※a hard Brexit poses a real threat to our economy. People voted for ?350m a week for the NHS, not a ?36bn black hole in the public finances that could mean severe cuts to the NHS§.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said years of austerity and the decision to gamble on a general election victory had left Britain in a weaker position going into the Brexit talks. ※The Tories want to blame Brexit for their failures on the economy. But what this report really reveals is that one of the biggest risks to our economy is Theresa May＊s weak government and the last seven years of economic failure,§ he said.The Liberal Democrat spokesman Vince Cable warned that the underlying weakness of government tax receipts and a ※reckless approach to Brexit§ were a toxic recipe likely to damage the economy. ※Even a small deterioration in growth could mean billions of pounds less funding for our public services in the long term,§ he said.The OBR noted that Brexit was not the only threat to the government＊s aim of eliminating the UK＊s budget deficit. It said a hung parliament and ※austerity fatigue§, alongside longer-term developments such as a rapidly ageing population, were also factors putting upward pressure on the deficit.The almost inevitable likelihood of a recession in the years ahead, along with higher interest rates and inflation, also posed significant risks to the public finances, threatening to put them on an ※unsustainable path§.Robert Chote, the OBR＊s chairman, explained that government could be landed with a higher interest bill on its debt mountain after selling billions of pounds worth of bonds with an interest rate linked to the retail prices index. A rise in inflation would add billions of pounds to the cost of financing the UK＊s debts, he said.The warning comes as the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, prepares the ground for his autumn budget, which he has already said should stick to current plans to bring down the deficit by the mid-2020s.Ministers are known to have begun lobbying for more funds to give additional support to creaking services and offset the most painful cuts in welfare spending. The deficit is due to rise from 2.4% last year to 2.9% this year following a deterioration in the economic outlook and could go higher if pressure on the Treasury to open the spending taps is successful.The OBR said: ※Ongoing challenges must be faced while negotiating Brexit and in an environment of ＆austerity fatigue＊. [The government] also faces them from a starting fiscal position that is more vulnerable than that which prevailed on the eve of the crisis 10 years ago.§Hammond described the report as a ※sober analysis§ and a ※stark reminder of why we must deliver on our commitment to deal with our country＊s debts§. He added: ※The Labour party would ignore these warning signs from the OBR, adding to the bill that our younger generation will have to pay.§To judge the sensitivity of the public finances to shocks, the OBR replicated the Bank of England＊s stress tests earlier this year on high street banks, which checked their finances were sound and they were holding sufficient reserves to guard against nasty shocks.A stress test of the government＊s plans to manage the public finances revealed that the annual deficit could rocket back to 8.1% and the debt to GDP ratio could match Italy＊s at 114%. The annual deficit for the last financial year was 2.6% of GDP 每 the lowest since 2007-08 每 and the debt-to-GDP ratio is 85%.Compared with the OBR＊s forecast in March, the risks add ?66.2bn to the deficit in 2017-18, rising to ?158.5bn higher by 2021-22. It said that extra spending by the government would account for almost all the shortfall.A series of measures dropped from the recent finance bill also played a part, the OBR said. The government scrapped 17 measures that were designed to yield ?3.5bn for the Treasury. ※It is no longer clear when they will return to parliament to be legislated,§ it said."															
"The  should resist increasing interest rates while the direction of the economy remains unclear, according to one of the central bank＊s senior policymakers, an announcement that reduces the chances of a rate hike this year.Ben Broadbent, , said he was not ready to raise interest rates while the the bank＊s monetary policy committee (MPC) found it ※very difficult§ to judge whether there had been a significant improvement. ※In my opinion, it is a bit tricky at the moment to make a decision [to raise rates]. I am not ready to do it yet,§ the deputy governor said.His comments contrasted with those made by the head of the US central bank, Janet Yellen, who said the US economy was strong enough for rates to continue increasing, though to a historically low natural rate, thought to be between 2% and 3%.Yellen＊s remarks to Congress sent global stock markets soaring, with the Dow Jones Industrial index reaching a fresh all-time high of 21,535 while the UK＊s FTSE 100 index jumped 83 points to 7,416. The German Dax and French CAC leapt by more than 1.5%.Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at spread betting firm IG, said Yellen＊s comments were seen as dampening expectations of a steep rise of US rates. ※Stocks are back in the swing of things, with the Dow hitting new record highs in the wake of a dovish testimony from Janet Yellen in Washington,§ he said, in . ※To some extent Yellen provided a relatively hawkish statement given her declaration that rate hikes should continue despite falling inflation. However, in speculating that it would not take many more hikes for the Fed funds rate to be neutral, Yellen has essentially signalled that there will be a finite amount of rate rises around the corner. Markets are now looking for a December rate hike at the earliest, and crucially just one rate rise in 2018.§The US and UK have experienced strong jobs growth, but relatively weak increases in average wage growth. The Federal Reserve has pushed ahead with four increases since 2015 that have raised the base rate by 1%, while the UK base rate remains at 0.25%. British policymakers came close last month to raising interest rates for the first time in a decade after three members of the MPC voted for an increase. Investors have keenly awaited Broadbent＊s stance on rates, after chief economist Andy Haldane, who voted to keep rates on hold, later hinted that he  later in the year. Several analysts have said the views of Broadbent 每 deputy governor for monetary policy 每 would be key to assessing the chances of a first BoE rate hike in a decade.Broadbent said economic growth had been ※OK§ during the last six to 12 months and pointed to rising employment and inflation. ※There is reason to see the [monetary policy] committee moving in that direction [towards higher interest rates] 每 but there are still a lot of imponderables,§ he said.Broadbent said many companies would remain nervous about their prospects while they were ※one or two years down the road§ from knowing what Brexit means.

"lthough America＊s rightwing plutocrats may disagree about how to rank the country＊s major problems 每 for example, inequality, slow growth, low productivity, opioid addiction, poor schools, and deteriorating infrastructure 每 the solution is always the same: lower taxes and deregulation, to ※incentivise§ investors and ※free up§ the economy.  is counting on this package to make America great again.It won＊t, because it never has. When Ronald Reagan tried it in the 1980s, he claimed that tax revenues would rise. Instead, growth slowed, tax revenues fell, and workers suffered.

But, unlike his administration＊s approach to healthcare legislation, lack of transparency will not help him. While many of the 32 million people  under the current proposal don＊t yet know what＊s coming, that is not true of the companies that will get the short end of the stick from Trump＊s tax reform.Here＊s Trump＊s dilemma. His tax reform must be revenue neutral. That＊s a political imperative: with corporations sitting on trillions of dollars in cash while ordinary Americans are suffering, lowering the average amount of corporate taxation would be unconscionable 每 and more so if taxes were lowered for the financial sector, which brought on the 2008 crisis and never paid for the economic damage. Moreover, Senate procedures dictate that to enact tax reform with a simple majority, rather than the three-fifths supermajority required to defeat an almost-certain filibuster by opposition Democrats, the reform must be budget-neutral for 10 years.This requirement means that average corporate-tax revenue must remain the same, which implies that there will be winners and losers: some will pay less than they do now, and others will pay more. One might get away with this in the case of personal income tax, because even if the losers notice, they are not sufficiently organised. By contrast, even small businesses in the US lobby Congress.Most economists would agree that America＊s current tax structure is inefficient and unfair. Some firms pay a far higher rate than others. Perhaps innovative firms that create jobs should be rewarded, in part, by a tax break. But the only rhyme or reason to who gets tax breaks appears to be the effectiveness of supplicants＊ lobbyists.One of the most significant problems concerns taxation of US corporations＊ foreign-earned income. Democrats believe that, because US corporations, wherever they operate, benefit from America＊s rule of law and power to ensure that they are not mistreated (often guaranteed by treaty), they ought to pay for these and other advantages. But a sense of fairness and reciprocity, much less national loyalty, is not deeply ingrained in many US companies, which respond by threatening to move their headquarters abroad.Republicans, partly out of sensitivity to this threat, advocate a territorial tax system, like that used in most countries: taxes should be imposed on economic activity only in the country where it occurs. The concern is that, after imposing a one-off levy on the untaxed profits that US firms hold abroad, introducing a territorial system would generate a tax loss.To offset this, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, has proposed adding a tax on net imports (imports minus exports). Because net imports lead to job destruction, they should be discouraged. At the same time, so long as US net imports are as high as they are now, the tax would raise enormous revenues.But there＊s the rub: the money must come from someone＊s pocket. Import prices will go up. Consumers of cheap clothing from China will be worse off. To Trump＊s team, this is collateral damage, the inevitable price that must be paid to give America＊s plutocrats more money. But retailers such as Walmart, not just its customers, are part of the collateral damage, too. Walmart knows this 每 and won＊t let it happen.Other corporate tax reforms might make sense; but they, too, imply winners and losers. And so long as the losers are numerous and organised enough, they are likely to have the power to stop the reform.A politically astute president who understood deeply the economics and politics of corporate tax reform could conceivably muscle Congress toward a reform package that made sense. Trump is not that leader. If corporate tax reform happens at all, it will be a hodge-podge brokered behind closed doors. More likely is a token across-the-board tax cut: the losers will be future generations, out-lobbied by today＊s avaricious moguls, the greediest of whom include those who owe their fortunes to scummy activities, like gambling.The sordidness of all of this will be sugarcoated with the hoary claim that lower tax rates will spur growth. There is simply no theoretical or empirical basis for this, especially in countries like the US, where most investment (at the margin) is financed by debt and interest is tax deductible. The marginal return and marginal cost are reduced proportionately, leaving investment largely unchanged. In fact, a closer look, taking into account accelerated depreciation and the effects on risk sharing, shows that lowering the tax rate likely reducesinvestment.Small countries are the sole exception, because they can pursue beggar-thy-neighbour policies aimed at poaching corporations from their neighbours. But global growth is largely unchanged 每 the distributive effects actually impede it slightly 每 as one gains at the expense of the other. (And this assumes that the other does not respond and fuel a race to the bottom.)In a country with so many problems 每 especially inequality 每 tax cuts for rich corporations will not solve anyof them. This is a lesson for all countries contemplating corporate tax breaks 每 even those without the misfortune of being led by a callow, craven plutocrat."															
" and less generous state benefits have made it harder over the past year for families on tight budgets to enjoy what the public considers a decent standard of living, according to one of Britain＊s leading thinktanks.The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) said that despite an above-inflation increase in the ※national living wage§, low-income families were falling further behind a minimum income standard.The thinktank said  had made life tougher for all low-income families with children, and that lone-parent single-breadwinner families were the hardest hit.Each year, the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University provides a minimum income standard for the JRF, which acts as a barometer of living standards for households on low incomes.While not a measure of poverty, the minimum income standard is based on feedback from the public on what it thinks people need to achieve a decent living standard. It includes money for school trips, Christmas presents and swimming lessons, and is updated annually to take account of economic trends and policy changes.The research found that despite the national living wage rising from ?7.20 to ?7.50, the gains had been offset by the rise in the cost of living, the freeze on tax credits and benefits, and wage increases being clawed back through reduced in-work benefits.The JRF said a single person now needed to earn ?17,900 a year to reach the minimum income standard. A dual-earner couple with two children needed to earn ?20,400 each, while a lone parent with a preschool child had to earn ?25,900. Developments over the past 12 months had made achieving these targets more difficult.According to the report, a single-breadwinner family was ?120 a week short of achieving the minimum income standard this year, up from ?103 a week in 2016. An ?11.24 pay rise from the national living wage had been offset by a ?9.03 reduction in tax credits and housing benefit, and a ?1.25 increase in tax and national insurance payments. The resulting 96p a week increase in pay had been dwarfed by a ?17.75 rise in living costs, widening the gap between income and outgoings by ?16.79 a week.A lone parent was ?55 a week short of the minimum income standard in 2016, but the shortfall widened to ?67 a week in 2017. An ?11.24 pay rise from the national living wage had been offset by a ?3.51 reduction in tax credits and housing benefit, and a ?1.44 increase in tax and national insurance payments. Net pay rose by ?6.29 a week, but living costs added ?18.55 to weekly expenditure, widening the gap with the minimum income standard by ?12.26 a week.The JRF said the gap for a working couple on low incomes had widened from ?50 to ?59 a week over the past 12 months.Campbell Robb, chief executive of the JRF, said: ※Struggling families tell us, as well as juggling the bills, it＊s things like after-school clubs and swimming lessons that have to be sacrificed to cover the essentials.※With the Bank of England forecasting inflation will increase even higher this year, families are facing no respite. We need the government to take action and ensure living standards do not fall backwards. Lifting the freeze on working-age benefits and tax credits must be the start, along with allowing people to keep more of their earnings.§Frances O＊Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: ※The government needs a proper plan to get wages rising. Ministers must stop holding down the pay of public sector workers, and give them their first proper pay rise in seven years. The minimum wage needs to rise faster, to reach ?10 an hour as soon as possible.§"															
"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over whether the tragic deaths of 80 people in  is ※one of the disastrous effects of austerity§ or has been developing as a result of decades of neglect dating back at least to Tony Blair＊s government in the 2000s.Corbyn enraged Tory MPs by linking the deaths to Tory spending cuts since 2010 but his criticism was actually quite specific. His general case rested on two points: the first being that if local authority budgets are cut by 40%, as they have been as a result of the 2010 austerity budget, and fire service cuts have resulted in 11,000 fewer firefighters then there is likely to be a ※price paid in public safety§.But Corbyn didn＊t just make a general case, he made specific accusations. He said local authority cuts had led to fewer building control inspectors and fewer planning inspectors and that the recommendations of a coroner＊s report into the Lakanal House tower block fire in Southwark in 2009 had not been acted on and building regulations had not been overhauled. He said these ※terrible consequences of deregulation and cutting corners§ stemmed from a ※disregard for working-class communities§.May responded by insisting that this was a matter that had been developing over decades and happened under governments of all complexions and under councils of all political persuasions. ※The cladding of tower blocks began under the Blair government,§ said May, adding that the key issue was not the laws involved but how inflammable materials that did not comply with building regulations were put up in at least 120 tower blocks.In particular, she pinpointed the 2005 regulatory reform (fire safety) order introduced under Blair＊s government that shifted the responsibility for fire inspection from the fire brigade to the local council. She claimed it had ※ended the practice of routine fire inspections§.Corbyn is right to say that since 2010 fire safety audits and inspections were cut by a quarter as fire authority budgets were cut. But Home Office figures published on Tuesday show that fires in high-rise, purpose-built flats fell by 40% from 1,261 to 714 between 2010 and the Grenfell Tower tragedy. The number of deathsfell from 12 to three over the same period. The fire statistics do confirm that fire safety audits in England fell by 20% from 77,532 to 63,201 over the same period, though the number of audits in flats of four storeys or more were prioritised and actually rose from 2,944 to 3,534. In London, audits fell from 14,091 in 2009-10 to 13,709 in 2015-16, while safety audits on blocks of four storeys or more rose from 1,307 to 2,507.The Lakanal House coroner recommended the government encourage all local councils to consider retrofitting sprinkler systems in their tower blocks. The government says it wrote to councils about this but refuses to release the letter or the responses.The Lakanal House coroner also recommended that the impenetrable building regulations be simplified, but stressed the need for ※clear guidance regarding the spread of fire over the external envelope of the building and the circumstances in which attention should be paid to whether proposed work might reduce fire protection§. The building regulations have yet to be updated in these ways.While the number of building control surveyors in England and Wales has fallen by 1,000 to 3,000 during the past decade it doesn＊t seem to be relevant in the case of Grenfell Tower. The building was inspected at least 16 times by Kensington and Chelsea council over two years while the ?10m refurbishment project was under way  that the building was clad in material effectively banned by the government. This substantiates the local Labour MP＊s claims that enforcement of the building regulations had become so poor in recent years that they were treated as guidelines rather than regulations.The public spending squeeze has required local authorities to place price over quality. In the case of Grenfell Tower, Kensington and Chelsea Council  an ?11.3m bid for the refurbishment from the original contractor, Leadbitter, in 2012 which said it couldn＊t meet the council＊s target price of ?9.7m. Rydon, the successful contractor, offered to do the same work for ?8.7m. Rydon＊s work rapidly became controversial with tenants and is now the subject of police investigation. So the need to cut costs could be a key factor.But the five Camden council blocks that have been evacuated were built in 2006 每 before the Tory coalition austerity budgets 每 as part of a housing pathfinder private finance initiative. This method of financing meant the risk and capital was raised by the private and not the public sector with a profit incentive. One result was that the contractors rather than the architects were left in the driving seat for the project.May pressed this claim in the Commons, quoting a 2005 fire safety regulation that switched the responsibility for fire risk assessments from the fire brigade to the local council. But her focus on this was misleading.The Lakanal House coroner did raise this issue in 2013 but said there was confusion about whether they should extend to the interior of flats in high-rise towers to check whether fire could spread easily within the building and its ※compartmentation§ had been breached. The government disagreed that the existing guidance needed clarifying. The same coroner＊s report noted that until 1985 it had been compulsory to use cladding that was FR60 每 flame resistant for 60 minutes 每 but that had become discretionary as a result of Margaret Thatcher＊s mid-1980s ※bonfire of red tape§. The problem does go back decades, as May claims, but Tory cuts,  privatisation, and council parsimony of all stripes have had a role to play."															
"Booming sales of ice-cream, gin and cider during the heatwave have combined with a jump in inflation to deliver the biggest rise in supermarket sales in more than five years.Sales revenue rose 5% in the 12 weeks to the end of June, the biggest increase since March 2012, in stark contrast to the 0.2% decline a year before, according to the latest market share data from Kantar Worldpanel.Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: ※The market＊s robust performance this period is partly down to particularly weak sales growth last year and a continuing increase in like-for-like grocery inflation, which is now running at 3.2%. That＊s an extra ?133 on the average household＊s annual shopping bill.§ Rising prices of products such as butter, fish and instant coffee were partially offset by falling prices elsewhere, including cooked poultry. The Kantar figures are not the official inflation figures but are based on 75,000 identical products compared year on year in the proportions purchased by shoppers. The most recent government figures showed .The spell of warm weather 每 even before the most recent heatwave 每 also helped the grocers. Sales of ice-cream rose 12% and cider 16%, according to Kantar.※The early summer weather gave supermarkets a much needed shot in the arm,§ said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at analysis firm Nielsen UK, who found that soft drinks were up 9.1%, alcohol up nearly 7% and frozen food up 7%, led by a 24% leap in sales of ice-cream lollies. One of the strongest growth areas was gin which recorded a 35% jump in sales, partly due to Father＊s Day.Watkins added that the good weather meant outdoor dining was back on the agendawith sales of fresh produce up 3.4% and sales of quiches up 11%. He said the warm weather was likely to fuel further sales growth. came out among the top four grocers 每 which includes Tesco, Sainsbury＊s and Asda. All four achieved growth for a third consecutive period. Tesco＊s sales rose by 3.5%, its fastest rate since April 2012 as the chain attracted 369,000 extra shoppers. However, all four lost market share as  and  increased sales by more than 18%, fuelled by new store openings.Fears are growing that traditional grocers will face increasing competition from Amazon, which . Kantar revealed that Amazon controls less than 1% of online grocery sales in the UK, less than Ocado, which has a 1.3% market share.But Kantar highlighted Amazon＊s potential, saying online grocery sales were rising by more than 10% a year. Just 7.6% of groceries are bought online.There are several reasons for the increase:- a fall in production and processors exporting more since the fall in the value of the pound; - higher demand as shoppers switch from margarine, on changing health advice;- a large amount of butter is imported, so prices are pushed up by the decline in sterling.The result of rising sugar prices as a result of poor harvests, changes in EU production rules, and a fall in the value of the pound which has piushed up the cost of imported ingredients and packaging.Due to the rising price of wheat, used to bulk up products, and of imported packaging.A poor harvest last year is only now feeding through to instant coffee which is also affected by the declining value of the pound.Largely the result of the rising cost of importing fruit such as bananas, which are priced in dollars Industrial action in Iceland and a serious outbreak of salmon lice in Scotland and Norway has hit production, while the decline in sterling has increased the price of imports."															
"hile the ideological certainties underpinning the  may seem to be unravelling, the day-to-day reality is that it is pretty much business as usual.The  might mark a turning point, but for public services, austerity will be a long time ending. Some of the latest round of austerity measures proposed in the Conservative manifesto 每 a , means-testing of the winter fuel allowance, for example 每 may be conspicuous by their absence from the Queen＊s speech on Wednesday. It seems we must , however, to see how serious the Conservatives are about actually reversing cuts. A ? Unfreezing benefits? Proper ? Any of these would be positive shifts; but in themselves they don＊t challenge the profound and particular sense of austerity-fuelled unfairness and official neglect that has emerged from the Grenfell tragedy.Interestingly, one of the first acts of the government last week was to provide a special and unusual exemption for homeless Grenfell Tower residents from the consequences of its own welfare policies. It is a welcome commitment, and the public would expect no less, but the specificity of the  is revealing: under normal conditions anyone made homeless in Kensington and Chelsea is unlikely to be rehoused in the borough. Ministers clearly felt they could not leave Grenfell?tenants to the routine harshness and?inadequacy of their housing and benefits?policy.Currently, at least three-quarters of homeless residents in the borough are sent outside, many to the eastern edge of the capital many miles away. High rents and tight benefit caps mean there is practically no affordable property in the west London borough. It may shock the public that the council has committed  in outer London and beyond to temporarily house some of its expanding cohort of homeless families, but that is the ongoing logic of welfare reform. Nor is it just a peculiar effect restricted to the UK＊s richest borough; the  and  means that out-of-borough rehousing is  in many parts of England.Austerity is not just about money, however, but mindset. The low status and shrinking supply of social housing in Kensington and Chelsea  that forces councils to sell off high-value social homes when a tenancy ends to enable the government to pay for right-to-buy subsidies to housing association tenants., the council would be expected to sell off ?50m worth of council homes each year. Until now, few Tories have cared about the ; the implicit belief that ※if you can＊t afford to live here, you shouldn＊t live here,§ has largely prevailed. Will that now change?K&C has been justifiably  over its inept response to the Grenfell blaze. But until disaster struck, the Tory council was  as the pioneer of a new municipal order. Under its ※tri-borough§ corporate experiment it merged services with two neighbouring councils in an ※efficiency§ programme. Hands-off management, contracting out, and cost-cutting were its watchwords. Grenfell residents were well acquainted with this kind of austerity in practice.I saw a glimpse of it three years ago, when the tri-borough was forced to apologise to parents after a botched, done-on-the-cheap contracting out of home-school transport services for severely disabled children . Council papers showed officials had chosen the cheapest option, with contract evaluation criteria weighted 70% for price and 30% for quality. As a local headteacher said at the time, ※I feel that we＊re just waiting for a disaster to happen§."															
"Australia＊s manufacturing industry could be poised for recovery, according to a new report, which says the sector is enjoying its largest improvement in employment conditions in a decade.It says Australian manufacturing jobs have swelled by 40,000 in the past 12 months 每 the second-largest number of new jobs created in any industry 每 and productivity has returned to near its previous peak.At the same time, a new poll has found a majority of voters reject the idea that manufacturing is an outdated industry that will inevitably continue to shrink in Australia.It found more than two-thirds of Australians reject the idea that government support for manufacturing is a waste of taxpayers＊ money.The report, Manufacturing: A Moment of Opportunity, has been prepared by the Centre for Future Work, part of the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute.It has been released to coincide with the , hosted by the two organisations at Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday.The report says several economic indicators suggest Australian manufacturing may be poised for recovery.It says since 2008, the manufacturing sector＊s real output has declined by 13% (compared to its pre-financial crisis peak), and employment by a similar proportion, but the industry appears to have stabilised, and it remains one of Australia＊s most important.In the past 12 months, trend employment data from the Bureau of Statistics show there has been an increase of 40,000 manufacturing jobs, surpassed only by public administration and safety jobs (80,000 new positions). The report says profit margins for Australian manufacturers were hammered during the GFC, with the soaring currency doing major damage to the sector, but since 2014, profits have begun to regain some of the lost ground.Quarterly gross operating profits reached nearly $8bn in the March quarter, the highest in several years, which may soon encourage future increases in capital spending and more hiring.The report says the value of Australian-made manufactures sold to international markets has also grown dramatically in recent years, from a low of $80bn in 2009 to a record high of more than $100bn in the past 12 months.Recent data also indicate the sector allocates almost 5% of its sector value-added to new R&D expenditure, more than any other sector - including the scientific and professional services sectors.The report argues this presents an important political opening for leaders from all parties to recommit to manufacturing, and grant the sector greater priority in economic policy-making.※There is more economic space than at any time in recent years to expand investment, production, and employment in value-added manufacturing,§ the report says.※And the public will support active measures that are consistent with this goal.§The Australia Institute＊s Centre for Future Work also conducted a nationally representative poll of 1,408 people 每 between 26 April and 5 May 每 regarding their views about manufacturing in Australia.It found that despite low levels of understanding of the importance of manufacturing to Australia＊s economy at the moment, there is wide support for manufacturing across all age and voting groups.Manufacturing employs 915,000 people in Australia, making it the sixth-largest employer by industry in Australia, accounting for around 8% of all employment.But when asked to name the largest employer out of manufacturing (915,000 jobs), public administration, defence and the law (828,000 jobs), banking and financial services (433,600 jobs), wholesale trade (376,400 jobs), agriculture (293,100 jobs), and mining (240,800 jobs), only 10% of respondents correctly picked manufacturing.Most respondents (38%) thought public administration, defence and the law was the biggest employer, while more respondents chose mining (13%) and finance (11%) than the correct answer.※The importance of manufacturing jobs appears to be widely underappreciated among Australians, perhaps because of the steady stream of negative headlines that have dominated most news about the sector in recent years,§ the report says.However, there was widespread support for the view that manufacturing exports are important for Australia＊s economy, with 76% agreeing or strongly agreeing that success in global trade requires strong manufacturing exports, and 71% agreeing or strongly agreeing it was better to add value to natural resources through manufacturing than to export raw commodities.Earlier in the week the governor of the Reserve Bank .Philip Lowe said Australia＊s economy was suffering a ※crisis§ in wage growth, and workers ought to realise the relatively low unemployment rate meant they could start asking for a larger share of the nation＊s economic pie."															
															
"ell then. Nobody knows anything any more, do they? Michael Gove was mocked for saying that everyone was sick of experts (or thereabouts), and I＊ve always been sympathetic to that mocking, but it is starting to seem as though 每 in political predictions at least 每 he has a point. There＊s so much received wisdom about how to win a key marginal, and what will alienate the middle ground, and why you ignore this demographic or that at your peril. And yet, after the shock of Thursday, none of that received wisdom seems to be so wise any more.I＊ll admit it. I was sceptical. Despite seeing evidence of great enthusiasm for Corbyn among the young (we all saw it: rallies, fashion, ), I was cynical about whether that would translate to turnout. I thought it would be bigger, but maybe not huge. We don＊t know just how high the 18-24 turnout was yet, and won＊t do so for around a week, so don＊t believe that 72% stat doing the rounds on social media. But it＊s clear that young people flocked to the polls more than ever before, breaking a trend that has existed in UK politics since 每 well, for ever. Let＊s hope that this enthusiasm among young people lasts. As Laura Kuenssberg said on the BBC last night: ※This is the election where young people started voting. And it may seem that for all the political parties the demographics of who they have to please might be shifting.§Well, well, well. Poor Dacre. Poor Murdoch. Paul Dacre, the Daily Mail＊s editor and Theresa May＊s cheerleader, has seen his savage, relentless campaign against Labour fall flat. This is a paper that the day before the polls ran 13 pages of febrile anti-Labour content, and splashed: ※§ on page one. This is a lot, in the wake of two terrorist attacks. It＊s a lot, whatever you think of Corbyn＊s associations in the past, to scream all of that about a man who stood on a stage in Manchester at a memorial for the dead. In other words: read the room, Mail. The hyperbole and frenzied attacks may well have been too much for some people to stomach. Ditto the Sun＊s consistent bile towards Diane Abbott, which echoed the Tory party＊s rhetoric. (Murdoch was  so incensed at how the election played out he stormed out from an office.)Sure, the Mail has a circulation of . I argued just the other day that having those sorts of headlines above the fold, in newsagents across the country, is a huge advantage 每 perhaps I was wrong. Could this be another blow to the dominance of the rightwing press? ? Labour, to a certain extent historically, but especially after the Tories tried to pin the global financial crash on Brown＊s administration, has been viewed as not, to coin a phrase, strong and stable on the economy. It＊s always the party that is seen as the strongest on the economy, the most responsible with the purse strings that wins. And actually, that is true of this result, but who expected Labour to give such a run for its, er, money. If Corbyn＊s Labour can do this well in the polls despite the voters being told every single day that he was recklessly profligate and endless talk of a ※§, then that represents a shift.

Even the exit polls underestimated Labour＊s strength. The pundits were wrong. People like me didn＊t think Corbyn could do this well, I admit it. Talking heads shook them, and said never in a million years. Even the politicians themselves got it wrong 每 until late last night, Labour itself was braced for something of a wipeout, with talk coming from aides that Labour candidates were drafting concession speeches. It＊s become obvious that there＊s a whole chunk of the electorate that polling, canvassing, aides and tellers aren＊t picking up on. They might be hiding (shy voters fudging answers in polls, and so on), or they might be hiding in plain sight (see Corbyn＊s massive online army, for instance).This one is more specific to this one election, but a big surprise to many was the collapsing vote going in many cases to Labour, , the Tories. It＊s possible that some Ukippers aren＊t happy with how Brexit is shaping up, but perhaps more likely that they are coming to grips with austerity. Broxbourne showed a particularly big Ukip-to-Labour swing. All of this means it is possible that pollsters, politicians, journalists and staffers have been relied on too much to fortune-tell, and that the political analysis model is broken.

"The pound fell to an eight-week low and shares in housebuilders, banks and retailers lost ground after the shock election result, which increased uncertainty over both the forthcoming Brexit talks and the UK＊s economic prospects.But the currency recovered from its worst levels as Theresa May announced  and vowed to press ahead with Brexit negotiations. So after falling 2.5% to $1.2635, its lowest since 18 April, sterling stood at $1.2737, down 1.65%, when London trading closed. Against the euro, it slumped to a seven-month low of 1.1289 but recovered to 1.1380, down 1.5%.Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread betting firm Spreadex, said: ※Though the current chaos is bad news for the instability-averse pound, if it leads to a softer Brexit it may end up working in the currency＊s favour. Of course, that is a big if, meaning for now sterling is focused firmly on the latest bout of political turmoil.§On the stock market the FTSE 100 每 packed full of companies with big overseas earnings which benefit from a weaker pound 每 rose just over 1% to 7527.33 while the  250, down initially, recovered after the DUP talks to close up 0.13% at 19,769.But UK-focused companies were hit by concerns about a further squeeze on consumer spending following the latest fall in the pound and the fallout from the election. Analysts at UBS said: ※Such significant political uncertainty will further dampen sentiment and confidence, exacerbating the weakness we have already been starting to see over recent months.§Among the market＊s leading fallers were Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments, and retailers Marks & Spencer and Next. Construction groups such as Balfour Beatty dropped sharply on worries that a hung parliament could slow down the award of government contracts.Meanwhile business leaders called for a new government to focus its efforts on the economy and the Brexit discussions. CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn said: ※There has never been a more important time to refocus on the economy and plan with confidence and ambition. The next government needs to deliver an open, competitive and fair post-Brexit economy that works for everyone across all our nations and regions.※With only 10 days before Brexit talks begin, the UK needs to be fast out of the blocks. Agreeing transition arrangements and guaranteeing EU citizens＊ rights should be early priorities to get the talks off to a good start and show to the world that trade and people come first.§Dr Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the electorate＊s split decision would generate further uncertainty for businesses ※who are already grappling with currency fluctuations, rising costs, and the potential impacts of Brexit§.He said companies had been doing their best to screen out political noise for months to focus on their own operations, but warned: ※This result will prove much harder for UK businesses to ignore.§Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers＊ organisation the EEF, said business had got used to political uncertainty in recent years but warned it was now essential that politicians ※put industry first§.Scuoler added: ※The Brexit negotiating strategy requires a careful rethink. Industry should be at the table ＃ to help ensure we have the right negotiating position, which is something that＊s been sadly lacking until now.§Ratings agencies warned of further possible downgrades to the UK＊s credit rating. Standard & Poor＊s, which a year ago stripped Britain of its prized triple-A rating, after the Brexit vote, said: ※a further downgrade or downgrades could be in the wings .Kathrin Muehlbronner, a senior vice-president at Moody＊s and lead UK sovereign analyst, said: ※The future path of the UK sovereign rating will be largely driven by two factors: first, the outcome of the UK＊s negotiations on leaving the European Union and the implications this has for the country＊s growth outlook. Second, fiscal developments, given the country＊s fiscal deficit and rising public debt.§A third credit ratings agency, Fitch, said a second poll could not be ruled out: ※While [the DUP deal] would avoid a prolonged period of coalition talks, the terms of the agreement are unclear and another election in the near term is possible.§"

But after almost seven years of severe austerity, when financing for many services has been cut by 50%, some councils have privately warned that income might not match spending and, hence, they will be unable to set a legal budget, which they have a legal duty to do.Three months ago, Rob Whiteman, the chief executive of the normally cautious  (Cipfa), warned that insolvency is looming for some. ※There is a law of financial gravity here. And no matter how hard they try 每 after Herculean efforts over six years 每 a force is bearing down on them which they cannot control,§ said the former chief executive of the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham council. ※Some are close to the edge ... you can＊t defy gravity.§Against the backdrop of this unprecedented assault on local government finances, in which the survival of some councils is at stake, the . They will lead to a new breed of combined authorities in six areas of England (elsewhere,  in 34 English counties and unitary councils, 32 councils in Scotland and 22 in Wales).These emerging combined authorities are a mixed bunch: Greater Manchester, the Birmingham-centred West Midlands, Liverpool city region, Tees Valley (Teesside plus Darlington) and the West of England (around Bristol) make some geographic sense; Cambridge and Peterborough arguably less so.They represent the last government＊s vaunted devolution agenda, with . Other devolution deals 每 notably a Sheffield city-region 每 are on offer, provided local councils endorse the concept of a metro mayor, a precondition for the government authorising extremely modest sums to get new mayor-led combined, or metro authorities up and running. The north-east, centred around Tyne and Wear, refused the mayoral offer. So no deal. In Whitehall jargon, the deals are?※bespoke§ 每 in short, varying in significant details 每 with Greater Manchester getting responsibility for a . Interestingly, Andy Burnham, the former Labour minister and , opposed the package when shadow health minister on the logical grounds that it might both presage the end of a truly national NHS while, handily, making the new authority shoulder the blame for future (government-imposed) cutbacks. And there＊s the rub.This brand of devolution, while welcome, has limitations. It promises some power and responsibility 每 but neither much money, nor additional revenue-raising, to back it up (the West Midlands, for instance, has been promised just ).Nothing can disguise the real crisis in local government. With councils facing a  每 when, ominously, they are all supposed to move towards self-financing, without direct government grants 每 the Local Government Association has warned that even if councils abandoned road repairs, stopped maintaining parks and open spaces, closed all libraries, museums and children＊s centres, and stopped funding bus services, they might still not plug the hole.Recently, the  warned that the government was not on track to make councils self-sufficient, with the ※financial sustainability§ of English local government at risk through poor (central) planning. With councils due to retain income generated from all business rates 每 currently raised locally and redistributed nationally 每 there＊s little forthcoming from ministers on how the councils with low tax bases can be expected to survive.So, while metro mayors can certainly champion their areas and help coordinate services such as public transport, job creation and economic growth, in truth they are a sideshow in a wider battle: saving local government and the diminishing services it provides."															
															
"or some time now , by which they mean central bank rates more like 4%-5%. And it＊s not just about earning more on their savings. This protest against the current 0.25% base rate also has a broader, altruistic bent. At least that is what they honestly believe.They argue that higher interest rates will restore a lost balance in the economy 每 taking it back to the way it was before the financial crisis, when things were so much better.And why wouldn＊t they? Plenty of mainstream economists express the same concerns, including policymakers at the , the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and the World Bank.After several years of year-on-year growth, runs the argument, higher interest rates will deter banks, insurers and even hedge funds and private equity funds from taking excessive risks to improve their profits. Low rates mean they need to generate huge volumes of business to make the equivalent profit, forcing them to embrace sub-prime borrowers, as they did in the early part of the century to such disastrous effect.A higher return on lending will strengthen the banking sector＊s financial standing and give them the funds to spur investment and help in the all-important task of improving the nation＊s output and productivity.At the same time, higher interest rates will benefit ordinary investors. With a cute and cynical emphasis, the focus is on the ordinary investor because they can be said to be deserving of everyone＊s support 每 especially those who put money aside in a pension. Who can argue against higher interest rates if they prevent the collapse of final salary pension schemes?At the International Monetary Fund＊s spring meeting this week, managing director Christine Lagarde is expected to highlight how another decade of ultra-low interest rates will depress growth and pose dangers for global financial stability.The IMF will warn that risks to growth remain on the downside as low interest rates sit in the column marked potential disasters alongside Brexit, Donald Trump＊s emotional response to presidential decision-making, and Vladimir Putin＊s drive to undermine western democracies ., which will give Philip Hammond a chance to catch up with his counterparts from around the world and countless central bank officials, the Washington-based lender of last resort said low interest rates in the UK, US and Europe meant the west was heading in the same direction as Japan and faced the prospect of decade after decade of low growth. It backed the savers＊ argument that if there was much more of this, the developed world＊s pension funds would be in jeopardy.But the IMF, like the influential Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which sits in judgment on the policies of central banks from its Swiss headquarters, can＊t find a way to get from a low-interest-rate world to one where base rates are 4% and mortgage rates 6%.One problem is that they cannot agree on the reason for the current predicament. Claudio Borio, head of the BIS, . He rejected the argument put forward most forcefully by Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, that baby-boomer saving, excessive by historical standards, has created a mismatch of supply and demand in financial markets and that with a surfeit of funds chasing a handful of investment opportunities, it was inevitable lending would yield low returns.Higher taxes on wealth and stratospheric incomes are the answer to this trend. It would allow governments to upgrade their crumbling infrastructures with cash, and reduce their need to borrow 每 something Borio worries is at its limit. He accepted much of Summers＊s thesis, but favoured those who say a better explanation is the weakness of the banks following the financial crisis and subsequent steep cuts in interest rates.However, the BIS, like the other international economic organisations, is impotent when urging that higher rates are a cure for the ills besetting the west, and to some extent the developing world.Many Brexiters argue that quitting the European Union provides the economic reset needed to achieve a better balance, at least for the UK. A permanently lower pound could spur growth and employment, and combined with lower immigration, could lead to higher wages. In response the Bank of England could justify putting up interest rates, and allow the economy to support a thriving banking sector that in turn supports a Goldilocks economy 每 that is neither too hot or too cold.Unfortunately for the Brexiters, a currency devaluation is also the option favoured by China, the eurozone and the US as a route to stronger growth and higher interest rates.  shows that he is thinking the same way. With everyone pursuing the same goal, there is little chance of lasting success. So we are left with keeping interest rates low, probably for another decade.While Lagarde (and her contemporaries) could accept the logic of wealth and income redistribution as a route to rebalancing, that seems unlikely. She is a rightwing politician with a final salary pension."															
															
"Matthew Taylor＊s report into modern working practices makes some important recommendations that, if implemented, could make a real difference to thousands of people. However, the report falls short of solving the most pressing issue facing the UK＊s flexible labour market 每 clarifying what self-employment is.Flexibility needs to work both ways, Taylor says, and he is absolutely right. British consumers, businesses and the wider UK economy have greatly benefited from the flexibility offered by freelancers, gig economy workers, those on zero-hours contracts and the self-employed. That flexibility helps businesses to cope with peaks and troughs in demand and enables them to be more innovative. It gives consumers the option to hail a cab at any time day or night, or have whatever they want to eat delivered to wherever they are at any time. It also generates a lot of money and it attracts foreign investment 每 international companies like setting up a base here because they see the advantages that our flexible labour market can bring to their business.Self-employment should mean being able to decide when and how you work, fitting it around other commitments and responsibilities such as childcare. The number of freelancing mothers has  (pdf) 每 far faster than the growth rate for the self-employed overall. Beyond that, it is often an empowering and rewarding way of working. This came across clearly in Taylor＊s report. However, instances where individuals are misclassified as self-employed must be resolved. Taylor goes some way towards it 每 the report calls for clearer legislation on status 每 but what＊s really needed is a statutory definition of self-employment. Currently self-employment is a default category assigned to those who are neither employees nor workers. If we are to have any meaningful understanding of who is genuinely self-employed, we first need to be clear about what self-employment is.Taylor wants to rename worker status dependent contractor＊. This might bring some benefits, insomuch as it might help individuals to self-identify as being within this category 每 but how will we be absolutely clear who falls into this group? According to Taylor it will still be up to the courts to rule on employment status, which is a big hurdle for individuals who suspect their status is different to what their employer sets out, like the recent . It is also a problem when HMRC challenges a person they believe to be falsely self-employed. These cases can be lengthy and HMRC hasn＊t always got it right. For example, Mark Fitzpatrick, a freelance designer from Bristol, was  before he was cleared of all wrongdoing by a tribunal. Giving self-employment a clear definition will make us less reliant on court decisions.In the ＊s (IPSE) submission to the Taylor Review, a list of criteria was put forward, against which employment status could be judged. The list took many factors into account, including the matter of whether or not the worker is controlled by their employer 每 which Taylor appears to think should be the sole determining factor. This is too simplistic an approach to take. Looking at the entire picture of working arrangements is a better, fairer way to determine someone＊s employment status. Factors such as the ability to choose when and where to work, and whether the work is project-based need to be considered.What comes through strongly is a recognition that, on the whole, people like being self-employed. We will now have to wait and see how much appetite there is to legislate. The Prime Minister, while welcoming the report, fell short of making a firm commitment to do this.There can be no doubt that the way people work is changing and the UK must catch up. If we are to fulfil our potential as a country, there is no other option."															
"The British film production boom, including the Han Solo spin-off from Star Wars and a live action remake of Disney＊s Dumbo, is helping boost services industry growth as other sectors flag.※Motion picture activities§ 每 including production activity and income from box office hits such as Wonder Woman, Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 每 were singled out by the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday as playing a significant role.The 8.2% surge recorded in the second quarter by the wider film, TV and music sectors 每 mostly accounted for by the boom in motion picture activity 每 made it the second largest contributor to the 0.5% increase in services GDP reported by the ONS, after the retail industry. The ONS figures show that since 2014 the economic value of the UK＊s film, TV and music industries has grown 72.4%, compared with just 8.5% across the European Union.This boom is being fuelled by Hollywood studios increasingly choosing to shoot big-budget films in the UK, attracted by significant government tax breaks, as well as access to top-class on- and off-screen talent and studio facilities. Pinewood, the home of the James Bond franchise, which is in the process of doubling its size, is currently filming Tim Burton＊s live action version of Dumbo, starring Colin Farrell, and the second Star Wars spin-off after Rogue One, focusing on the early life of Han Solo and featuring Woody Harrelson and Emilia Clarke.The UK box office is also on a roll, with takings up 13% year on year and admissions up 6%, according to comScore.※The UK cinema industry is enjoying a period of exceptional success,§ said Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association. ※UK audiences are responding positively not just to a diverse and high quality film slate, but also it seems to unprecedented levels of investment in all aspects of the cinema-going experience.§The TV production industry is also , with deep-pocketed new arrivals such as Netflix pouring ?100m into royal series The Crown and Amazon investing in Jeremy Clarkson＊s The Grand Tour and historical drama Outlander. This investment has rocketed due to a film-style tax credit introduced in 2013 for shows costing at least ?1m an episode.The slide in the value of the pound following the EU referendum has added an extra carrot luring foreign film and TV production investment into the UK.In May, the French maker of lavish TV period drama Versailles, the most expensive French-language drama ever made,  in a move influenced by the weakening of the pound since the Brexit vote.Last week, the government revealed that it  to the makers of films and big budget TV productions that passed a ※cultural test§ that qualified them as British-made.On Wednesday, the culture department said that employment in the creative industries was growing at four times the rate of the wider UK workforce. The DCMS said that employment levels in the sector have grown 5% year on year to almost 2 million people, compared with just 1.2% growth for the wider job market."															
" has admitted that consumers are suffering from the pound＊s sharp post-referendum fall, after what government statisticians have called a ※notable slowdown§ in growth in the first half of the year.The following 0.2% expansion in the first three months of the year, Office for National Statistics figures showed.The chancellor, who says businesses and households are being affected by the lack of clarity about Brexit, put the sharp easing of growth in the past six months down to the squeeze on the cost of living caused by dearer imports.※Consumers are being affected by the inflation that was created by the depreciation of the currency in the autumn of last year. That will pass through the economy, but I absolutely recognise it＊s painful as it＊s passing through the economy,§ Hammond said in an interview with ITV News.The expansion in the three months to June was in line with City expectations that the weakness of the economy meant no chance of an increase in interest rates by the Bank of England next week.showed that of the three big sectors of the economy, only services were bigger at the end of June than in March.Services, which account for almost 80% of the economy＊s output, posted growth of 0.5% over the quarter. Industrial production, which includes manufacturing, fell by 0.4%, while construction was down by 0.9%.When adjusted for a rising population, Britain＊s economic growth came to a virtual standstill in the first half of 2017. Growth per head was up 0.1% in the second quarter after being flat in the first quarter. Over the year since the Brexit vote, GDP per head has risen by 1% and is only 1.9% higher than it was before the economy plunged into recession in early 2008. Darren Morgan, head of national accounts at the Office for National Statistics, said: ※The economy has experienced a notable slowdown in the first half of this year. While services such as retail, and film production and distribution showed some improvement in the second quarter, a weaker performance from construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth.§ last June, posting stronger growth in the second half of 2016 than in the first half.The fall in the value of the pound has pushed up inflation and made life tougher for consumers since the turn of the year.Retail activity was the biggest single contributor to growth in the second quarter but this followed a fall in the first quarter. The ONS said spending in the shops and online was broadly flat in the first half of the year.The ONS said the film industry played a significant role in the modest rise in GDP from the first quarter, adding almost 0.1 percentage points to growth.A spokesman said the boost to film production was the biggest factor, but added that ticket sales for Wonder Woman and the latest in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise also played a part.Despite buoyant survey evidence, the hard economic data from the ONS showed manufacturing was struggling. UK factories saw production fall by 0.5% during the second quarter, largely due to a drop in motor vehicle output.In the year to the second quarter, the economy grew by 1.7%, down from 1.9% in the first quarter. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: ※Today＊s GDP figures reveal weak growth under a weak government, and expose the last seven years of Tory economic failure.※Growth for the first half of 2017 is below expectations, and it follows continued data showing working families are being squeezed with wages not keeping up with prices. The truth is that the Tories＊ austerity cuts have undermined working people＊s living standards and weakened the UK economy.§ Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: ※These meagre growth rates indicate that the economy has lost momentum in 2017, and will consequently fail to achieve the 1.8% expansion seen in 2016.※The second quarter growth was below the 0.4% expansion anticipated by the Bank of England, and therefore suggests we will see the central bank revise down its forecasts for the economy next week from the 1.9% growth it has currently penciled in."															
"The switch to electric cars poses a big financial problem for the government 每 because every time a driver switches from a petrol or diesel car to an electric vehicle, the government at every fill-up. In total, duties on petrol and diesel add up to almost ?28bn a year for the exchequer. Worse for the chancellor of the day, petrol and diesel sales make a contribution to VAT. VAT is charged at 20% of the wholesale price plus the duty, which equates to 16.7% of the final price. That＊s a form of double taxation and explains why more than 65% of the cost at the pumps goes to the exchequer.An electric car charged from the grid will currently generate just 5p in VAT for every pound spent. If the car is charged directly from solar panels on a garage roof, the Treasury is likely to go empty-handed.To help plug the gap, the Treasury could increase VAT on energy to 20%. Road tax could also be increased with an emphasis on larger and less fuel-efficient cars 每 even more than now. But a tax on car ownership is unlikely to be popular, especially with green campaigners, who would prefer to tax the  of cars.Mike Hawes, head of the car industry body, the SMMT, said it was likely that the government would look to road pricing in some form to take over from fuel duty. He said the technology already existed to track vehicles and charge drivers per mile. Kevin Nicholson, head of tax at PwC, said the government would need to move quickly to reverse a decline in fuel duty that is already under way. The Treasury＊s official forecaster, the , has predicted a decline of a fifth in receipts by 2020/21.※The government will need to find alternative sources of tax revenue. And it would be a mistake to simply look for ways to plug the hole left by fuel duty. The fourth industrial revolution, with new technologies like artificial intelligence, is going to continue to shake up the tax base.※More immediately, Brexit will force change to the tax systems as rules need to be revisited. The need for a fundamental review of the UK tax system can no longer be ignored,§ he said."															
"Polly Toynbee (, 25 June) claims it is wrong to suggest the EU prevents state ownership and gives as an example how European rail networks remain state-owned; she should have added ※for now§. The market pillar of the fourth rail package, as agreed in April 2016, mandates ※more competition and performance targets for public service contracts, so as to improve cost-efficiency and get better value for money for taxpayers§, which sounds wearingly familiar. And with 2020 as the target date.Given that the EU court of justice has deliberated that article 106 of the Single Market Act 每 the one prohibiting renationalisation 每 gives private companies the right to argue before their national courts that services must remain open to private-sector competition, it is hard to see any wriggle room there when  seeks to implement his manifesto.She goes on to ridicule the assertion that the act bans state aid; has she forgotten the Redcar steelworks in October 2015, when the government refused to intervene in the liquidation process as it would be contrary to article 87? The people of Redcar didn＊t the following June, when they voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU. For the 31 years of its existence, the Single Market Act has given rightwing governments (of whatever stripe) carte blanche to sit back and watch millions of people across Europe lose their livelihoods. And people are supposed to believe it is the sole guarantor of our prosperity. The furore over chlorine chicken (, 25 June) is symbolic of much deeper politics around the future of Britain. By suggesting he＊s open to accepting food with lower regulatory standards than we currently enjoy, Liam Fox shows his clear preference for moving Britain towards the North American trading bloc, with its focus on deregulated markets. Fox＊s statements on liberalisation of data, which risks handing more control of our personal privacy to gigantic hi-tech companies, confirm his stance.But every step we take towards the US orbit is a step away from the EU, because trade deals today are about regulation more than tariffs. If we go with US standards, we say goodbye to retaining integration with our neighbours in the EU. This has huge impacts for consumer protection, environmental standards, public services and social welfare. Fox may indeed think chlorine chicken is a small detail, but it＊s emblematic of major decisions that are being made in secret, without the full implications being properly understood by the British public."															
"The European Union and Japan are on course to sign a trade deal on Thursday, after talks gained impetus in the wake of Donald Trump＊s  Cecilia Malmstr?m, the European trade commissioner, announced she had reached a political agreement with the Japanese foreign minister, Fumio Kishida: ※We ironed out the few remaining differences in the EU-Japan trade negotiations,§ she tweeted. ※We now recommend to leaders to confirm this at summit.§Japanese prime minister Shinz身 Abe will meet Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, presidents of the European council and commission respectively, for a one- day summit in Brussels, before the .The timing is no coincidence, as Germany plans to make free trade one of the summit priorities.In a sign of high hopes, Malmstr?m and Kishida exchanged , armless, headless round figures associated with persistence and luck. A part of Zen Buddhist culture, people typically paint one eye when they make a wish and the second when the goal has been reached. Malmstr?m and Kishida posed for the cameras, as they coloured in the second eyes on two dolls emblazoned with the EU and Japanese flags.But officials might be looking for divine intervention to overcome the final hurdles.Despite a likely agreement on Thursday, the sensitive subject of a court system to settle investor disputes remains open.  has not accepted the EU＊s preferred alternative to the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), a system for resolving trade disputes that has been criticised by unions and activists for giving too much power to corporations. Under pressure from NGOs, the EU proposed a new kind of trade court, where judges would be appointed by governments rather than disputing parties. But Tokyo has not come round to this idea.EU sources declined to speculate on how quickly the deal could come into force, but fine-tuning and translating the legal text, as well as getting it agreed by all EU member states could take many months. It took the EU and Canada three years to sign a final text, following the agreement in principle in October 2013, which parallels the latest EU-Japan milestone. The Canada deal almost collapsed when a Belgian region threatened to veto the treaty. Now mostly in force, the EU-Canada deal still needs to clear the final hurdle of ratification by at least 38 national and regional assemblies.The timetable means it is likely the UK will have left the EU by the time the Japan treaty comes into force.When negotiations began with Tokyo in 2013, Britain was one of the biggest cheerleaders. The then UK trade minister described talks as an ※important step towards liberalising trade between two of the world＊s largest economies§. Following the Brexit vote, Theresa May has vowed to leave the customs union, meaning British exporters .The deal means Japan will drop tariffs on many valuable European imports, including chocolate, pasta and some types of cheese. In return for liberalisation of Japan＊s highly protected dairy market,  has compromised by agreeing to lower tariffs on Japanese imported cars, although new rules will be phased in to help European carmakers deal with the change.Services and an array of technical standards are also covered by the treaty, which negotiators say goes far further than old-style tariff-cutting agreements."															
"Theresa May raised the spectre of a Greek-style economic collapse if Britain fails to press ahead with tackling the deficit on Wednesday, as she was challenged repeatedly by  over the public sector pay cap.With intense political pressure on the prime minister 每 including from her own cabinet colleagues 每 to ease the strain for cash-strapped public servants, including nurses and teachers, she warned MPs about the risks of loosening the purse strings.※This is not a theoretical issue. Let us look at those countries that failed to deal with it. In Greece, where they have not dealt with the deficit ... What did we see with that failure to deal with the deficit? Spending on the health service cut by 36%. That does not help nurses or patients,§ she said.Comparisons with Greece were repeatedly used by George Osborne in 2010 to justify public spending cuts, as riots erupted on the streets of Athens over the stringent bailout conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the eurozone. But the analogy represented a significant ratcheting up of the pro-austerity argument from May.A Conservative spokesman emphasised remarks afterwards, saying: ※There are siren calls from Labour to abandon any kind of fiscal restraint whatsoever. What happens, we＊ve seen as a case study, is what happened in Greece.§ He added: ※I think she was suggesting if Jeremy Corbyn＊s  party got the chance to impose its fiscal policies on the United Kingdom that is a very real threat.§A spokesman for Corbyn described the claims as ※preposterous§. ※The situation in Greece is tied up with the eurozone and the management of the eurozone banks 每 we＊re not remotely in that situation. Our manifesto and our pledges were costed, unlike the government＊s,§ he said.Many Conservative MPs have returned to Westminster after the bruising election campaign, determined to urge the government to allay some of the concerns about spending cuts they heard from voters 每 including on school funding, as well as public sector pay.Some would like to see May give a clear signal before parliament breaks up for the summer recess on 20 July that the 1% across-the-board cap will be lifted.The chief secretary to the Treasury, Liz Truss, must write a letter to the independent pay review bodies shortly, setting out their remit and would be expected to reinforce the 1% cap.The Labour leader used all his questions to the prime minister at their weekly head to head to pressure her over issues of pay, accusing her of presiding over ※a low-pay epidemic§ in the UK, and claiming she had presided over ※a week of flip-flopping and floundering§.May outlined the process by which a series of pay review bodies recommend rises for NHS staff, teachers and others, and said the government would ※consider those reports very carefully§. But she added: ※We will always recognise the need to makes those decisions against the need to live within our means.§ Both she and Corbyn valued the contribution of public sector workers, May said but added: ※The difference is, I know we have to pay for them.§Several other ministers and aides went on to echo the comparison with Greece in a sign there is a concerted effort by the  to stress their desire for ※sound money§ and attack Labour on the issue of economic competence.Truss said the cap on public sector pay was the ※responsible thing to do§ in response to an urgent question from Labour., who has admitted that he would have liked the economy to play a more central role in the election campaign, has resisted pressure to ease up on austerity, warning his cabinet colleagues that money to fund extra spending pledges would have to come from cuts elsewhere or tax increases.One suggestion is that the Treasury could cancel planned tax cuts, including to the rate of corporation tax, as the Labour manifesto mooted. At 19%, the tax is already one of the lowest among major economies, but it is due to be reduced further, to 17%, in a move introduced by Osborne.A thinktank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, calculates that scrapping the public sector pay cap altogether, as Labour would like to do, would cost government departments and local government ?6.3bn per year compared with the government＊s plans 每 increasing to ?9.2bn per year by 2021每22.Corbyn will give a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce on Thursday, calling for economic reform 每 including a greater role for the state in developing and promoting new technologies, to prevent another ※lost decade§ of weak growth.He will argue that technological development, ※can＊t be left to the market§. ※Technological change, from automation to decarbonisation, means that many jobs and industries will disappear or shrink in the coming years and decades. But I am not one of the doom-mongers, who believe that will inevitably herald an era of mass unemployment.※At every stage of economic and industrial history, jobs, industries and skills have been lost, replaced and transformed. But whether that happens at huge social cost, as it did, for example, in the early days of the Industrial Revolution and the Luddites, or is embraced and benefits everybody, depends on managing and planning for technological change. We can＊t simply leave it to the market.§"															
															
"The governor of the  has sent the pound higher on the foreign exchanges after he warned that the continued growth in the UK economy would eventually lead to higher interest rates. Sterling rose by almost a cent against the dollar to stand at a post-election high on remarks seen as bringing forward the date of the first increase in the cost of borrowing since the start of the financial crisis 10 years ago.Although Carney broadly reiterated his ※wait and see§ approach to interest rates, the pound was trading at just below $1.30 amid speculation that the Bank＊s monetary policy committee would over the coming rescind the emergency quarter-point cut in interest rates after last summer＊s  vote.The governor stressed that certain conditions needed to be met before he would side with MPC members pressing for higher rates, and hinted that he would not change his vote at their next meeting in August.※When the MPC last met earlier this month, my view was that given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, it was too early to judge with confidence how large and persistent the slowdown in growth would prove,§ Carney said at a gathering of central bankers in Portugal. ※Moreover, with domestic inflationary pressures, particularly wages and unit labour costs, still subdued, it was appropriate to leave the policy stance unchanged at that time.※Some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary if the trade-off facing the MPC continues to lessen and the policy decision accordingly becomes more conventional. The extent to which the trade-off moves in that direction will depend on the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, including business investment, whether wages and unit labour costs begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to both tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations. These are some of the issues that the MPC will debate in the coming months.§Carney＊s cautious approach to raising interest rates was supported earlier by one of the Bank＊s deputy governors in an interview on BBC Radio 4＊s Today programme. Sir Jon Cunliffe said consumer spending was slowing as households＊ real incomes were squeezed by higher inflation. ※We expect some of that slowing to be offset by growth in business investment, growth in exports. And I want to see how that plays out.※[We] do have to look at what＊s happening to domestic inflation pressure, and I think that, on the data we have at the moment, [it)] gives us a bit of time to see how this evolves.§The remarks by Carney and Cunliffe contrast with the more hawkish comments by the Bank＊s chief economist, Andy Haldane, and suggest that battle lines are being drawn before the August MPC meeting. The committee voted 5-3 in favour of leaving rates on hold at 0.25% at its most recent meeting, but the City was taken aback when . as measured by the consumer prices index is 2.9% and expected to rise further above the government＊s 2% target over the coming months.The three MPC members who voted for a rate rise believe the lowest unemployment rate since the 1970s will generate pressure for higher wages and that, unless policy is tightened now, there is the risk that a more aggressive stance will have to be announced later. One of the three 每 Kristin Forbes 每 is no longer an MPC member and has been , whose views on the necessity of a rate rise are unknown.With Haldane indicating that he might join Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders in voting for higher borrowing costs, and Cunliffe siding with Carney, the result will be decided by deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, Jan Vlieghe, the former hedge fund economist, and Tenreyo.The MPC normally has nine members but is down to eight as a result of the resignation of Charlotte Hogg for failing to declare that her brother worked at Barclays. In the event of a 4-4 tie, Carney would have the casting vote."															
"o you resign yourself to public opinion as it is now, or do you attempt to change it? That is a question that has long divided Britain＊s left and produced two competing strategies. The ※centrist§ approach is one that amounts to resignation. Voters are where they are, and it is largely futile to campaign to change minds when Labour is in opposition. It will simply render the party out of touch. A longstanding centrist argument was that the public believes , and so economic credibility is defined by signing up to spending cuts. Labour＊s left, on the other hand, refutes this pessimism. Public opinion can change 每 and dramatically so 每 if the counter-arguments to rightwing orthodoxy are heard loudly and forcefully.The annual  is a source of vindication for the left＊s strategy. One of the greatest hindrances to its political advancement has been a negative attitude to benefit claimants. A widespread view that benefit claimants are ※scroungers§ wounds the left for a number of reasons.?It redirects anger away from the powerful to those at the bottom of society. It undermines faith in state intervention. It chips away at support for social security. It fuels opposition to public spending and for raising taxes to pay for it: your money is being wasted on the undeserving, the Tories would have you believe. So a dramatic shift in attitudes to benefit claimants is very good news indeed. While 35% of Britons?agreed dole claimants were ※fiddling§ in 2014, the level fell last year to 22% 每 the lowest for three decades.Attitudes to public spending are being?transformed, too. Fewer than three in 10 Britons now support slashing spending to help the economy: in 1996, it was 43%. Nearly half the population advocate increasing taxes and spending more 每 14 percentage points higher than 2012. It is Labour＊s case for investment, rather than cuts, that is winning the battle for public opinion.Imagine, in 2015, Jeremy Corbyn had not become Labour leader. It was just months after Labour MPs had infamously been whipped to , a decision justified on the basis that the party could no longer defy public opinion. Another leader might have undertaken passionate tirades against benefit claimants who were playing the system. It is entirely plausible that Labour would?have achieved nothing except to?help exaggerate the problem of benefit fraud in the minds of the electorate, in defiance of where public opinion was ultimately heading.Instead, Labour now has a leadership that has enthusiastically made the case for public investment. It has encouraged people to punch up, not down: it has said that tax avoiders, reckless bankers and poverty-paying employers, not benefit claimants and immigrants, are more deserving of Britain＊s anger. For the whole of the last?parliament, George Osborne 每 whose  is not enough to rehabilitate him 每 led attempts to trash Labour by . But social security is no longer at the centre of political debate: Labour has shifted discussion to the behaviour of powerful vested interests championed by the Tories. Years of campaigning by activists, as well as people＊s lived experience 每 the longest squeeze in wages since the 19th century 每 have undoubtedly changed attitudes, too. But Labour＊s refusal to support cuts or demonise benefit claimants was bold 每?and is changing minds.What＊s so striking about these figures?is that the research was conducted many months before the general election. It was this election, after all, that granted Labour a public and relatively unmediated platform to set out its vision, leading to an almost unprecedented turnaround in support. The party＊s call for the  to allow proper investment in?public services resonated with millions. In contrast, Theresa May＊s  who had suffered years of real-term pay cuts 每 that there was no magic money tree 每?helped seal her fate.Just as public attitudes shifted against collectivism and statism in the late 1970s, the Tories themselves sense the winds are changing. We are, potentially at least, in a moment of transition from one era to another. A resurgent and emboldened Labour party has  to the Queen＊s speech calling for an end to the public sector pay freeze. Discipline is breaking down in a deeply shaken Conservative party, and prominent Tories such as  and  have both suggested the freeze could end. ※We know people are weary§ of years of cuts, a humbled No 10 . But the Tories should not bank on being saved by surrendering to Labour＊s arguments. They are merely validating positions better embodied by their opponents.None of this should breed complacency on Labour＊s part. The party should not simply assume that an inevitable shifting is under way. But the British Social Attitudes survey shows the left was right to be bold and firm in its arguments. Now that Labour has a renewed confidence, a unity that was previously missing, and?Corbyn has emerged a greatly strengthened figure, the party＊s potential impact on public opinion is even greater. Voters are being exposed to arguments that have not been aired in?the mainstream for decades. Prophetically 每 on the eve of Corbyn＊s first leadership triumph 每  that Tories should not congratulate his victory, because it ※would become acceptable again to call for nationalising vast swaths of industry, for massively hiking tax and for demonising business. The centre-ground would move inexorably towards a more statist position.§This is the  每 which defines the range of ideas and policies that are palatable at any given moment 每 at work. Its movement allows us to change the narrative from cuts and bashing people at the bottom of society to investment and challenging vested interests at the top. In 2015, Labour＊s members were offered a choice. One was pessimism: you might not like where the public is but tough, you＊re going to have to accept it. The other was optimism: that while the public did agree with the left on, say, public ownership and hiking tax on the rich, they could be persuaded on public investment and social security. Optimism has triumphed. Like?Margaret Thatcher in 1979, Corbyn＊s?Labour is both the beneficiary and cause of a changing public mood. And that＊s the prize: not just electoral victory, but the building of a new political settlement that would long outlast a Corbyn premiership."															
"The  is to force banks to strengthen their financial position in the face of a rapid growth in borrowing on credit cards, car finance and personal loans.The intervention by Threadneedle Street means banks will need to set aside as much as ?11.4bn of extra capital in the next 18 months and is intended to protect the financial system from the 10% rise in consumer lending over the year.The Bank is also bringing forward the part of the annual stress tests on banks that scrutinises their exposure to consumer credit by two months to September. The Bank＊s Prudential Regulation Authority and the City regulator, the , will also publish next month how they expect lenders to treat borrowers in the consumer credit market. also set out measures to rein in the riskiest mortgage lending, highlighted the risks associated with the UK＊s exit from the European Union and said commercial property prices were ※at the top end of sustainable valuations§.While the Bank found risks to financial stability were neither ※particularly elevated nor subdued§ it warned that there ※pockets of risk that warrant vigilance§.※Consumer credit has increased rapidly. Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier. And lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions,§ said , governor of the Bank of England.Carney said the decision to call on banks to hold more capital 每 which is largely a rejig of their current resources rather than raising new funds 每 was taken after domestic risks returned to ※standard§ levels. A year ago, after the Brexit vote,  每 using new tools it was given after the financial crisis 每 and is now reversing that decision.Carney distinguished between interest rates 每 cut to a record low of 0.25% after Brexit 每 and financial policy instruments. ※Monetary policy is the last line of defence to address financial stability issues,§ he said, with monetary policy focused on keeping inflation at its target rate of 2% rather than controlling lending. He said earlier this month that . Debt charities warned of the consequences for the 8.8 million individuals using credit for essential household bills if the Bank＊s measures led to lenders increasing rates. ※Any increase in borrowing costs could tip households, many of which are already on a financial knife-edge, into serious financial hardship,§ said Mike O＊Connor, the chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity.Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said there had been an 8% rise in the number of people using its national debtline this year and that the Bank was right to act.The fastest- growing component of consumer credit is car finance, which has been rising at 15% a year, while credit card lending is rising at 9% and personal lending at 7%.The Bank calculates there is ?58bn of car dealership finance, including ?24bn from banks; ?67bn in credit cards, including ?52bn from banks; and ?72bn in loans and overdrafts, of which ?62bn originates from the banking sector. The UK consumer credit market is valued at about ?200bn 每 a seventh of the size of the ?1.4tn mortgage market but with write-offs several times larger than mortgages.Threadneedle Street is also monitoring mortgage lending, which has risen by a more moderate 2.8% but where there are signs of an increase in riskier lending, measured by the size of the loan to an individual＊s income. Affordability tests are being tweaked so lenders must test that borrowers can afford a three percentage point increase in their standard variable rate (SVR) 每 a rise to about 7%. This is tighter than the current requirement for a three percentage point rise in the base rate, which allows lenders some discretion by assuming they will not pass on the full rate rise in their SVR. that limit high-risk lending to 15% of a lender＊s overall lending.The additional capital requirements come in two phases; an 0.5% rise in a special pot of capital known as a the countercyclical capital buffer in June 2018 and another 0.5% the year after that. Each 0.5% increase amounts to about ?5.7bn of extra capital in the system and does not necessarily mean banks would have to raise fresh amounts of cash but rather reallocate existing capital.Andrew Wishart of Capital  said: ※The policy change is unlikely to make much difference to overall lending given that the majority of banks are already better capitalised than required.§On Brexit, the Bank said it was continuing to ※identify and monitor UK financial stability risks so that preparations can be made and action taken to mitigate them§. Carney said risks, including those from a hard Brexit, were being assessed, and he warned of the costs of fragmenting Europe＊s financial markets."															
"The deal to spend an extra ?1bn over two years in  will do little to disturb the public finances.Of the funds, about ?400m will be directed at new physical infrastructure, ?150m on better broadband, and ?40m will tackle deprivation. Another ?350m will be spent on health and education services. Treasury forecasts show the government will spend ?802bn this financial year and ?817bn in the next. In this context, pumping an extra ?500m a year into Northern Ireland＊s public services and the local economy is small beer.As Carl Emmerson, deputy head of the , said: ※The size of the UK＊s public finances means you can give away ?1bn a year and it＊s not much more than a rounding error.§But the demand by the Democratic Unionist party that Theresa May rescue the  and the  from Philip Hammond＊s chopping board gives the chancellor a bigger headache.At the moment, qualifying pensioner households automatically receive a single winter fuel payment, ranging from ?100 to ?300. About 12.3 million people received the tax-free allowance in 2015-16, at a total cost of just over ?2bn.The Tory manifesto failed to say how much of this ?2bn the incoming government planned to save, but the IFS was not alone in guesstimating that the manifesto writers were targeting at least half.A ?1bn saving, if that is what was planned, was not priced into the Treasury＊s forecasts and therefore its loss is academic. And yet the money would have come in handy this year, when Hammond has conceded that the budget deficit will increase for the first time since 2010.The triple lock guarantees pensioners a rise in the basic state pension of at least 2.5%, the rate of inflation or earnings, whichever is the higher. Hammond wanted to switch to a double lock that dispensed with the 2.5% minimum. Projections for the next five years showed either inflation or earnings would rise at more than 2.5%, so the government stood to gain little or nothing from the move over the life of the parliament. But in the longer term, the double lock was due to pay dividends.The ?1bn DUP deal itself, while small in relation to the Treasury＊s overall spending, could spark a round of special pleading that wrecks Hammond＊s forecasts.Nicola Sturgeon was first out of the blocks with a claim that Scotland is due about ?2.9bn based on the way the Barnett formula works for UK government spending. Downing Street said the formula does not apply to the new money, as it is being provided as an addition to the Northern Ireland executive＊s block grant.In a similar way, the formula did not apply to city deals in Wales and Scotland 每 the latter of which has seen ?500m spent on Glasgow and ?125m in Aberdeen 每 or previous packages of support for Northern Ireland, a No 10 source said.About 1.8 million people live in Northern Ireland and they will receive the equivalent of approximately ?537 each. Based on population size, this is the equivalent of an extra ?1.6bn in Wales, an extra ?2.8bn in Scotland, or an extra ?28.5bn in England.When London was given the Olympics at a cost of ?9bn, the UK version of pork barrel politics resulted in very little for the nations and regions of the UK.Emmerson said the main threat to the public finances, apart from a Brexit-induced economic slowdown, comes from the demands for extra spending on health and education and other big Whitehall budgets.The government has already pumped more money into prisons and social care after cuts were considered to have gone too far. ※So it＊s not like the Osborne/Cameron financial settlement has held firm,§ said Emmerson.※If there is pressure to increase spending on health and education in other parts of the UK, that is where you are talking about big money.§"															
															
"A  deal that puts jobs and prosperity first is the only way the UK will be able to deliver the strong growth that will enable it finally to escape from the long years of austerity, the chancellor has said., Philip Hammond said a comprehensive trade agreement, a transitional deal after the 2019 deadline for the end of talks, and a commitment to keep borders open should form a three-point Brexit plan for Britain.There would be ※audible sighs of relief§, he said, if the  ended with a business-friendly agreement.Hammond said in a speech at Mansion House in the City of London: ※I have said before, and I remain clear today, that when the British people voted last June, they did not vote to become poorer or less secure.※They did vote to leave the EU. And we will leave the EU. But it must be done in a way that works for Britain. In a way that prioritises British jobs, and underpins Britain＊s prosperity. Anything less will be a failure to deliver on the instructions of the British people.§Hammond, who campaigned for remain in the referendum and has been arguing in cabinet against the idea of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, said the result of the general election had shown that the country was .But he added that funding for public services could only be delivered by higher taxes, higher borrowing or stronger economic growth. The chancellor said the latter was the only long-term sustainable solution for this country in the face of the pressure of an ageing population.Hammond said the future of the economy was inexorably linked to the kind of Brexit deal reached with the EU.He told the audience of financiers: ※I am confident we can do a Brexit deal that puts jobs and prosperity first, that reassures employers that they will still be able to access the talent they need, that keeps our markets for goods and services and capital open, that achieves early agreement on transitional arrangements so that trade can carry on flowing smoothly, and businesses up and down the country can move on with investment decisions that they want to make, but that have been on hold since the referendum.※The collective sigh of relief will be audible. The benefit to our economy will be huge, in established sectors like manufacturing, the car industry, financial services, and pharmaceuticals; in emerging areas like biotech, and fintech; in the housing market; in the services sector; in the travel industry; in companies, large and small, right up and down our country, employing, between them, millions of people.Hammond said his three-pronged approach involved:The chancellor said achieving this while sticking to the government＊s long-term objectives would be challenging.※It will almost certainly involve the deployment of new technology. And therefore we＊ll almost certainly need an implementation period, outside the customs union itself, but with current customs border arrangements remaining in place, until new long-term arrangements are up and running.§ Hammond has been lobbied by the financial sector to ensure the City is not frozen out of EU markets after Brexit. ※Let＊s be honest, we are already hearing protectionist agendas being advanced, disguised as arguments about regulatory competence, financial stability and supervisory oversight. We can have no truck with that approach.§The chancellor said fragmentation of financial services would be damaging to both the UK and the EU, and he called for the talks to deliver a regulatory regime that was transparent, based on international standards, that made a priority of financial stability, and was permanent.Responding to Hammond＊s speech, the EU＊s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, warned the UK will have to stay under the jurisdiction of the European court of justice for years to come if the chancellor wants to secure a transitional period to protect businesses after the UK leaves the EU in 2019.The former French minister added that the EU side needed further clarity over what the British government hoped to secure by the end of the negotiations, although he noted the British delegation had been clear with him that the UK still wished to leave the single market and the customs union.Speaking to reporters after briefing EU ministers in Luxembourg on the first day of formal negotiations between the UK and the EU, Barnier said: ※I have always stated that the issue of transitional periods, their nature, their duration, short duration in any case, and indeed hypothetical short duration of such periods would be within a framework of the overall structure of supervisory regulation of the European court of justice. The time for that has not yet come. I have always stated that there may well be the need for certain transitional periods. Some phasing out, others phasing in.§Expressing some frustration at the British government＊s stuttering start to its withdrawal from the bloc, he added: ※In order to work on this subject we need to be enlightened more on the nature of future relations, which obviously will have repercussions on the content and dimensions for such transition periods, but the time has not yet come for us.§"															
"s the flames that engulfed Grenfell Tower died down, the blame game had already begun. One thing everyone has pointed to is the new facade on the building. Residents called it ※the plastic§. It has since emerged that similar , and is banned from use in tall buildings in the US 每 and the UK,  (though this is denied by those who installed it).But ※the plastic§ was not the only potentially dangerous facade at Grenfell Tower. Residents saw the installation of the cladding as part of deeper processes of gentrification and even . Lacklustre concerns around fire safety were another facade. Following a fire at  in Camberwell, London, which killed six people, the authorities knew there were . Instead of responding immediately, the government created another facade 每 and came to conclusions that were not fully acted on. And then there was the facade of accountability, such as forums set up by the local council to listen to local residents. The council did very little listening and, as a consequence, repeated .Following the blaze, the authorities have hastily thrown up other facades. The council assured everyone that it is doing all it can. It even promised to develop an ※individualised housing plan§ for each displaced resident. Government ministers have mechanically repeated how ※saddened§ and ※shocked§ they are. But it took more than a day for senior politicians to show up on the scene and talk to emergency service while the cameras rolled.It took three days for a comprehensive system to help residents to be put in place. The government has promised to hold an inquiry, but this is also likely to be another carefully managed facade. It will probably take years to complete. A few individuals will probably serve as scapegoats. Some incremental changes will be identified while the substantive issues will probably remain untouched.Once we start to look at the vast administrative facade around this tragedy, the flammable facade of the tower begins to look less out of place. What make this all the more tragic is such administrative facades are all too familiar to us. We have all seen public authorities spending their stretched resources putting up a facade.A problem with the police? Introduce new management jargon while cutting officer numbers. Issues with education? Rebrand schools while reducing the number of teaching aides. Sluggish economy? Showcase a few moderately successful startups while ignoring the tens of thousands of struggling small businesses. Finding it difficult to maintain libraries? Develop a strategic vision while closing library branches. Problems in the elderly care system? Introduce a rankings exercise while underpaying care assistants. Hospitals strained by increased demand? Hire a ※transformational leader§ who can give a great presentation. Facing a large-scale accident? Scramble government ministers to the nearest TV studio and promise to pass ill-thought new laws that create more problems than they solve.There are some good reasons that governments like putting up administrative facades. It＊s easier and cheaper to generate a nice image than deal with costly and underlying difficult. But facades can make people uncomfortable. When there is a big gap between image and reality, we start to doubt public institutions and their leaders. A deep cynicism towards government can set in and people may start to reject government institutions, even when they are genuinely doing the right thing.Administrative facades detract time and resources away from the real work a public agency is supposed to do. When this happens, you get defence forces that are more interested in running rebranding campaigns than military training exercises. When public institutions become more obsessed with their facades, they can lose sight of the fact they exist to serve the public. When this happens, public services becomes full of people polishing the shop-front and no one working inside to actually deliver the service.Administrative facades can create hazardous conditions for those inside. If one part of the facade is questioned, the rest can quickly come tumbling down. The fire has shown up serious failures in the government＊s administrative facade such as poor leadership, slow responses to an emergency, lacklustre planning laws and much more. As these shortcomings have become evident, the whole edifice is in danger of crumbling. It remains to be seen who will be crushed in the aftermath.If we learn one thing from the , it is not just that we should think carefully about the facades we add to our buildings 每 although we should. The real lesson is that we should try to avoid adding too many facades to our government. Administrative facades can be just as dangerous as physical facades."

But the UK＊s deficit has also been associated with markedly weak investment and latterly with rapid consumer credit growth. This is not an imbalance that is, as yet, funding its eventual resolution.※Moreover, despite the large depreciation around the referendum, the extent to which the UK＊s deficit has moved closer to sustainability remains an open question, one whose answer depends crucially on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. ※Most fundamentally, the UK relies on the  at a time when risks to trade, investment, and financial fragmentation have increased.§ "

By the end of the week the Metropolitan police had released its annual figures for last year, . National figures, which will soon follow, are likely to show a less pronounced but nonetheless sustained uptick in knife crime.There have over the years been a number of explanations for both the existence, prevalence and growth in knife crime among the young. David Cameron laid some of the responsibility  and its hip-hop output; Tony Blair just : ※We won＊t stop this by pretending it isn＊t young black kids doing it.§ Gangs, drugs, culture, lenient sentencing, absent fathers, police being too sensitive to be effective 每 and police being insufficiently sensitive to be trusted 每 have all been suggested at various times. In an editorial this week the : ※education and better parenting, coupled with greater responsibility from the minority of retailers who still sell knives to juveniles, offer the best solutions.§Some of these explanations make sense.

Research indicates that once social class is taken into account, black kids are no more likely to be involved than their white counterparts. Of the 11 children and teens who have been killed by knives so far this year, most have been white 每 but in the national press the term ※knife crime§ has only been used when black people are killed.But it seems there is one enduring explanation for why things have been deteriorating among young people in particular in recent years: austerity. In 2011, the government , the ?30 weekly grant to low-income students who are in school or college. Funding for the education of 16- to 19-year-olds  between 2010 and 2014, leaving sixth-form colleges struggling for survival. Since 2010 there has been a , and between 2012 and 2016 .

Only . ※We＊re leading to a very serious conclusion regarding the potentially perilous state of policing,§ said Zo?

A large red flag.§Police say that young people who are carrying knives increasingly ; youth workers say they are scared and don＊t trust the police to protect them. In short, as a nation we are actively and consciously underfunding our kids.Few would make the claim that there is a direct, seamless, causal link between these cuts and the rise in violent crime. Government policy does not put a knife in a child＊s hand and encourage them to use it. But any insistence on personal responsibility must be weighed against the collective responsibility societies assume when it comes to keeping children safe.Nor could anyone reasonably claim that this is the exclusive reason for the increase 每 the causes of knife crime are multilayered and complex and  before its recent rise. But as the cuts go deeper, leaving vulnerable people more desperate, the contextual connection is compelling. If you make it harder for young people to stay in education, harder for them to get treatment if they are mentally ill, harder for them to find safe and productive places to spend leisure time with each other and with adults who are trained to work with them, then we should not be surprised to see an increase in social problems among the young 每 including social violence in general and knife crime in particular. has become such an established feature of our political economy that many are becoming blind to its ramifications.

I say prospect because it hasn＊t happened yet and could still be avoided, despite the fact there seem to be a lot of people around who think it  already happened.The ※best face§ and rationalisation process has already begun. Last week saw inspired reports that, on her trip to Saudi Arabia, Theresa May was  towards a ※hard Brexit§.As more evidence becomes apparent of the consequences of abandoning the single market that the heroine of the Tory right, one Margaret Thatcher, did so much to help create, the unfortunate truth must have dawned on May that no deal is the worst possible outcome.Our counterparts on the continent have known this all along. As the European council president, Donald Tusk, has pointed out, they do not need to ※punish§ us: by rashly accepting the result of an unbinding, consultative referendum, our leaders are inflicting on this nation enough punishment on their own. They are also running the risk of fomenting centrifugal forces in Europe that threaten to undo the good work of the post-second-world-war settlement.As Guy Verhofstadt of the European parliament said last week, the referendum was the result of ※a catfight in the Conservative party that got out of hand§. By calling the referendum in the first place, Cameron was offering a sop to the Cerberus of the Tory Brexiters. But in Greek mythology Cerberus was never satisfied, and demanded more.Cameron seems to be coming out in his true colours, blithely declaring on a trip to Kiev that he never much cared for certain things ※European§ anyway. His view is that the poison that was infecting the health of the Tory party . Personally I don＊t think the rampant Brexiters, whose views on Europe are chronically poisonous, will ever be satisfied. Meanwhile the poison will spread to the entire British economy.It is not good enough to derive comfort from the way reality is dawning and concessions are already in the diplomatic pipeline over the phasing of ※transitional arrangements§. To anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear, it is abundantly clear that many expats, both continental and British, are extremely worried about their future status and freedom to travel around Europe 每 as, for that matter, are many of us who are not expats.And multinational firms and banks are making strategic decisions now: they cannot afford to wait, and rely on promises and statements from the government which seem to change tone with remarkable rapidity., Ed Miliband and Hilary Benn wrote that, for those who voted Leave, the result represented ※a deep sense that the country wasn＊t working for them, and that politics hadn＊t been providing good enough answers for a long time§.Well, one can agree with that. The irony is that the protest vote should have taken place in the general election, which took place after five years of unjustifiable austerity 每 a policy and outcome which contributed hugely to that feeling that the country was ※not working§ for so many.But my impression is that the swing vote in the referendum was determined by comfortably off people 每 of whom I have met many 每 well into their late middle and old age, who swallowed all that misleading, indeed lying, propaganda about the evils of regulation attributed to Brussels but almost always approved, and often initiated, by British governments. The same goes for all that nonsense about regaining sovereignty, which we have never lost.Alas, the British electorate was hardly assisted by years and years of anti-EU attitudes manifested by both major political parties. When Cameron went to Brussels for a ※last supper§ after the referendum, it was put to him rather forcibly: what did you expect after all that hostility?All right. The positive case for the EU was never made strongly or widely enough, and it is no use crying over spilt milk. But the positive case for European cooperation and reconsideration of Brexit may be made as the rather frightening implications of the world views of Putin and Trump become more evident. When Harold Macmillan, prime minister 1957-63, made his famous remark that what he feared most was ※the opposition of events, dear boy§, he was also having a go at the weakness of the divided Labour opposition at the time.It is a commonplace that Jeremy Corbyn was lukewarm at best in support of the Remain campaign, and one can hardly move in this country without people complaining that ※there is no opposition§.So what hope is there, other than ※events§ 每 which may not be welcome in themselves, but which might provoke a rethink about this colossal waste of time and resources being devoted to Brexit? (I should much rather be writing about something else, by the way, but I regard this as the biggest crisis of my journalistic career.)Well, one hope is that there might be a revolt of the young, who stand to lose far more than the comfortably off ※sovereignty§ brigade. It is part of the democratic process for losers in an election to start fighting back the day after the result. Nigel Farage did not accept the people had spoken in 1975, and was on the rampage for decades.If there is a sufficient movement of the young against Brexit, and if it is sufficient to sway the opinion polls, than perhaps there may be a groundswell for the nation to have a rethink. I have not given up hope, and am heartened by the number of people I meet who haven＊t either!"

Moody＊s said the government appeared to be pursuing objectives pointing towards a hard exit and said growth prospects over the medium term could be ※materially weaker§ if the UK fails to sign a trade deal allowing access to the single market. Kathrin Muehlbronner, a senior vice president at Moody＊s, said: ※The likelihood of an abrupt 每 and damaging exit 每 with no agreement and reversion to [World Trade Organization] trading rules has increased compared to our expectation after the referendum, with the government so far pursuing objectives that imply a hard exit.§Weaker public finances could lead to a ※further delay in reversing the rising tend of public debt§, the agency warned in a report. However, it said the Bank of England＊s credibility should ensure financial stability, with exchange rate flexibility giving support for exports.Another ratings agency, Standard & Poor＊s, also predicted a fall in the UK＊s growth rate 每 from 1.8% in 2016 to 1.4% in 2017 and 0.8% in 2018 每 adding that the outlook might be even worse if the Brexit talks between Britain and the EU go badly., S&P said the weakness of the economy would result in borrowing costs being left on hold at 0.25% for another two years.S&P＊s senior economist, Boris Glass, said: ※Given demand weakness, the temporary nature of imported inflation, moderate domestic wage pressures, and Brexit uncertainties, we expect the Bank of England＊s current ultra-accommodative stance to continue over the medium term and expect a first rate hike to occur only in mid-2019.§S&P said the better-than-predicted performance of the economy in 2016 had been the result of ※extraordinarily robust consumer spending§ but added that the pressure on households from prices rising more rapidly than wages was likely to persist for the rest of 2017 and into 2018.Figures due out on Wednesday will show whether the lowest unemployment since the 1970s has started to have an upward effect on earnings, which are currently growing by just over 2% a year. Inflation as measured by the .The depreciation of the pound would make UK exports more competitive but would only add between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points to growth from 2017 to 2020. S&P said a study of the data showed that some UK exporters had taken advantage of the fall in sterling to raise their prices rather than to break into new markets. The agency said that while the price increases were to some extent a matter of choice, they were likely to have been necessary for firms that relied on imports which had become more expensive as a result of the falling exchange rate. With firms making Brexit contingency plans, investment was being shelved rather than given the go-ahead. ※Our forecasts for slower growth are subject to considerable downside risks, stemming mainly from Brexit uncertainties,§ Glass said. ※For example, the staging of the negotiations, with the ＆divorce＊ settlement being negotiated before any future relationship with the EU is addressed, means that should the separation negotiations stall, there would be less time left for negotiating the future trade relationship, risking a cliff edge.※In general, should negotiations stall for an extended period, this could translate into a further significant depreciation of sterling and a consequent rise in inflation.§ a sharp drop in UK trade with the EU after Brexit would be bad for the economy.In a speech in Aberdeen that focused on the benefits of international trade, Broadbent said: ※Put simply, a significant curtailment of trade with Europe would force the UK to shift away from producing things it＊s been relatively good at, and therefore export to the EU, and towards the things it currently imports and is relatively less good at.§A number of MPC members 每 including the governor, Mark Carney, and the Bank＊s chief economist, Andy Haldane 每 have given their views on the outlook for borrowing costs in recent months.Broadbent voted for official interest rates to remain on hold at the MPC＊s last meeting in June and his failure to mention monetary policy was seen by the City as a sign that he will vote the same way again in August. The pound fell slightly after Broadbent＊s speech and closed in London at $1.2850."															
															
															
"New car sales in the UK went into reverse for a third month in June in the latest sign that consumers are becoming increasingly reluctant to commit to major spending decisions.Sales fell by 4.8% year on year last month to 243,454, following an 8.5% drop in May and a 19.8% slide in April, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). In the first half of the year overall, new car sales fell by 1.3% to 1.4m vehicles, which was still the second biggest first half on record.In the second quarter overall, new car sales fell by 10.3%, the biggest quarterly drop in more than six years.The slowdown in recent months follows five years of growth in new car sales, which has helped to underpin consumer-led growth in the wider economy. Unions have warned that UK households face  leaving consumers with less money to spend.※Demand for new cars has started to cool following five consecutive years of solid growth but the numbers are still strong and the first half of the year is the second biggest on record,§ said Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive. ※Provided consumer and business confidence holds, we expect demand to remain at a similarly high level over the coming months.§The strong first-half performance was skewed by March, the biggest month for new car sales since the trade body started collecting data in 1976. Analysts said it was a bumper month because consumers to avoid a rise in vehicle excise duty on 1 April. An explosion in cheap car finance deals has fuelled growth in consumer credit to such an extent that the sector has  and the .The Bank＊s governor, Mark Carney, warned last week that the rapid increase in consumer credit was among ※pockets of risk§ in the financial system. While broader consumer credit is growing at a rate of about 10% a year, car finance is growing by 15%. Tamzen Isacsson, a director at the SMMT, said finance deals were an affordable and flexible way for motorists to buy a range of cars.She added: ※The motor finance market is highly competitive and governed by strict rules but given the recent growth in the popularity of motor finance it is understandable that regulators want to know how the market is operating in more depth. We look forward to engaging in this process.§Smaller cars, typically powered by smaller petrol engines, were most popular among buyers in June, with superminis and small family cars accounting for almost 60% of the market.Diesel car sales fell by 14.7%, while petrol car sales rose by 2.5% and sales of alternative fuel vehicles jumped 29% to 10,721. Demand dropped among all types of customers, including private buyers, business and fleet.※It＊s encouraging to see alternatively fuelled vehicles experiencing rapid growth but adoption is still at a relatively low level and more long term incentives are required if this new generation of vehicles is to be a more common sight on British roads,§ Hawes said."															
"atriotic? Who? Not the Tory Brexiteers who have brought this country so alarmingly low. While EU politics are rebooted with , our government is only . Ignominy doesn＊t get much more mortifying than that.Britain has not sunk so far in international esteem since the , that fantastical last gasp for colonialism. Indeed, the buccaneering dreams of Liam Fox and Boris Johnson to make Britain great again by trading with our bemused ex-colonies smacks of that same imperial delusion.Those who told harsh truths about Anthony Eden＊s blundering expedition to seize back the Suez canal were castigated as unpatriotic. In the same way now, as  flounders, those who ask hard questions that risk revealing cake-and-eat-it is not on the menu are again damned for lack of patriotism.The menace from the leader of the Commons to the BBC went straight to the heart of the Brexiteers＊ state of mind. ※It would be helpful if broadcasters were willing to be a bit patriotic, because the country took a decision and the government is determined to deliver on that decision,§ said Andrea Leadsom, as an . Newsnight＊s Emily Maitlis stood her ground with admirable aplomb. Leadsom is a comical figure, but as the going gets tougher expect more sinister pressures.Patriotism-failure is a challenge Theresa May threw down in her party conference speech last year, addressing  with the claim that ※politicians and commentators§, the fabled metropolitan elite, ※§. That was a prod at Jeremy Corbyn＊s , and Emily Thornberry＊s .Nor need May quote George Orwell＊s complaint that ※intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality§. What the Brexiteers knew at the referendum was that those who own patriotism usually win at the ballot box. Brexit patriotism was a bogus product, a sham union flag draped on the coffin of Britain＊s real interests, yet their campaign sang the better song. Remainers lost because they had no song either about Britishness or our common European identity, only . The Brexit result did show a yearning for something more than everyday electoral bribery, a seeking of patriotic identity.But in the year since, the tide has turned: patriotism, a mercurial shape-shifter, is slipping from the government＊s grasp, ripe for the taking by Labour. Love of one＊s country is universal 每 a sense of home and a shared history, culture and institutions, best reflected in the NHS and, yes, the BBC. That＊s why Leadsom is wildly out of step: she doesn＊t understand patriotism.Seven years of state-shrinking austerity have rekindled a desire for things only the state can provide, things people see stripped away all around them. The NHS is stretched beyond bearing; parents see schools shedding teachers; while bin collections, potholes, a lack of police, sardine-packed commuter trains and scores of everyday public-service failings press in on the public. The  is widely seen as a symbolic failure by the state to provide the most basic protection.Patriotism 每 pride in the country 每 is undermined by every failure in the public realm. Since 2010, this government and its coalition predecessor have followed an ideology of cuts, intent on reducing the state to a pitiful , far below any equivalent EU country. Leadsom, hear this: shrinking the state is the opposite of patriotism 每 a betrayal of country and people. Sajid Javid,  and local government department, chooses  as his cultural icon. What guidance has Rand about the great failure of social housing exposed by mass decanting from dangerous towers?Patriotism is not the puny, mean-minded Daily Mail mentality that only finds its own identity in hating foreigners. Waving union flags only has meaning when it celebrates the pride in all the public things the nation creates together 每 parks, science hubs, museums, hospitals, Olympic stadiums, monuments, swimming pools, galleries, libraries, schools and colleges to glory in. Patriotism is made of collective endeavour, joint identity, memory and common values that still bind, despite fractious divisions of class and region.Patriotism should belong to the left＊s ideals for the public realm: it doesn＊t belong to the Thatcher, Cameron, Osborne, May and Hammond politics of cut, scrimp, outsource and privatise. Consider the extraordinary sale of all our national utilities: trains, buses, water and energy are now mainly owned by foreign states. George Osborne sold the  to the Chinese and French governments at far greater cost than borrowing the money to build it ourselves. With the ink hardly dry, already the .Contracting out to Capita, Virgin, Bupa or Sodexo fragments and undermines the idea of public service. Some services may indeed be better outsourced, but the right has been dogmatic in shedding and shredding services, regardless of profits draining out of the country and losses to public ownership. Patriotism? It has verged on treason.Old Conservatism once understood the value of the public: in Joseph Chamberlain＊s civic pride, , or Michael Heseltine＊s grand regenerations. But the anti-public service dogma that has gripped that party since 1979, still there in Philip Hammond＊s budget, has lost any claim to patriotic pride.Let Labour seize the flag and wave it cheerfully and, yes, sing our ludicrous old national anthem too, mixing pride with laughter at all one＊s country＊s foibles. There is nothing dangerous about a celebratory patriotism.Nationalism is the war-starting ideology, the fascist-tinged foreigner-hating passion that thinks your own country superior to all others. May trod perilously close with her speech despising  as ※citizens of nowhere§: purging Jews, Stalin talked of ※§. If her patriotism excludes closeness to other countries, if Leadsom goes unrebuked for branding the BBC ※unpatriotic§, we should fear May＊s approach to Brexit negotiations."															
"Consumer confidence slumped in the 12 days after the general election to its lowest level since the aftermath of last year＊s  vote, as households were unnerved by the impact of a hung parliament.A poll by YouGov found that consumers feared the unstable political situation would hit house prices and , which have already come under pressure in recent months from high inflation and sluggish wages growth.The consumer confidence index showed a ※pronounced collapse in consumer confidence following the election§ after it fell from 109.1 in the week before the vote to 105.2 in the period immediately after it.For June as a whole, consumer confidence dropped to 106.9, its second-lowest level since the summer of 2013.YouGov said the steep fall was almost as severe as the dive in consumer confidence , when it plummeted from 111.9 in the weeks before the referendum to 104.3 in the days after it.Soon afterwards the Bank of England to cut the base interest rate to its lowest ever level of 0.25% and the government signalled a relaxation of its plans for further cuts to public spending.Since last August, when confidence surveys recovered some lost ground, the index, which was carried out for the economic consultancy CEBR, has tracked lower, largely in response to uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations.Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov, said: ※Consumer confidence has been generally ticking downward since last autumn but the events of the past month have placed it under greater pressure. ※The hung parliament seems to have further dampened consumers＊ spirits, which were already sinking following the continued squeeze on household finances. ※But the real cause for alarm will be the cooling of the property market as this is one of the key things that has propped up consumer confidence over the past few years,§ he added. Inflation hit its highest level for nearly four years in May at 2.9%, tightening the squeeze on consumers already struggling due to low wage growth, which is averaging 2% to 2.5%. YouGov said that although a score over 100 shows more consumers are confident than not, the index has yet to get back to its level before last June＊s referendum. Douglas McWilliams, the deputy chairman at the CEBR, said: ※It looks as though the indecisive result of the election has seriously affected economic prospects already dampened by Brexit uncertainty. ※The data shows a sharp drop in consumers＊ confidence about their own financial situation and even more so about house prices. This will affect spending in the high street, in shopping centres and online.§ McWilliams added that business confidence is also likely to have dropped, with the country to be spared a recession by strong international trade. However, YouGov said the data suggested that the job security and business activity measures, both for the last 30 days and the next 12 months, were proving relatively resilient.A report by the British Bankers＊ Association showed consumer spending using loans and credit cards eased back last month as shoppers to rein in their spending. Consumer credit growth was 5.1% in May, compared with 6.4% in the previous month.Mortgage approvals also fell 3.3% in May as the housing market suffered the effects of the election uncertainty and Brexit negotiations. At 40,347 in May, mortgage approvals were 9% below January＊s peak level of 44,327.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: ※Stuttering housing market activity has recently been weighing down on house prices. May data from the Halifax showed annual house price inflation at a four-year low of 3.3% in the three months to May, while it was at a 35-month low of 2.1% on the Nationwide measure.※The fundamentals for house buyers could deteriorate further over the coming months with consumers＊ purchasing power squeezed even more by a combination of higher inflation and muted earnings growth.※It is also possible that the labour market will increasingly falter despite its current resilience. Additionally, housing market activity is likely to be hampered by soft consumer confidence and reduced willingness to engage in major transactions,§ he added."															
"One third of non-British workers are considering leaving the UK, with highly skilled workers from the EU most likely to go, according to .The consultancy firm Deloitte found 47% of highly skilled workers from the EU were considering leaving the UK in the next five years. In a report on Tuesday, it warns of serious implications for employers, raising the pressure on ministers to come up with sensible immigration plans and to find ways to improve the skills of UK workers and make better use of robots in the workplace.Overall, 36% of non-British workers in the UK said they were thinking of leaving within the same period, representing 1.2m jobs out of 3.4 million migrant workers in the UK. Just more than quarter (26%) said they were considering leaving within three years.The research chimes with  that the Brexit vote has prompted some  or consider going. This is partly because of uncertainty around the UK＊s economic outlook and because any money those workers earn in pounds is now worth less in euros for them to send home. The pound  and is  compared with the day of the vote.Deloitte surveyed 2,242 EU and non-EU workers, half living in the UK and half living outside, to assess their views on what makes Britain attractive and how likely they would be to come to, or leave, the country.The survey, conducted before this month＊s inconclusive election result, found the UK was still an attractive place to work for overseas residents but the referendum had shifted perceptions among those already here.For respondents based outside the UK, the country was ranked as the most desirable place to work, with 57% of respondents placing it in their top three destinations. That put the UK ahead of the US, Australia and Canada for popularity.But among workers already in the UK, 48% said they saw the country as being a little or significantly less attractive as a result of . Only 21% of workers outside the UK shared that view.※The UK＊s cultural diversity, employment opportunities and quality of life are assets that continue to attract the world＊s best and brightest people,§ said David Sproul, chief executive of Deloitte north-west .※But overseas workers, especially those from the EU, tell us they are more likely to leave the UK than before. That points to a short- to medium-term skills deficit that can be met in part by upskilling our domestic workforce but which would also benefit from an immigration system that is attuned to the needs of the economy.§The referendum effect was strongest among highly skilled EU workers in the UK, with 65% describing the country as less attractive since the Brexit vote. Among less-skilled workers, 42% of EU nationals and 25% of non-EU nationals said the UK was now less attractive.

"Business group the CBI has warned the UK economy will shift down a gear as  talks get under way and households are squeezed by rising prices.However, the cautious outlook was accompanied by an increase in the CBI＊s growth forecasts for this year and next, due to a stronger than expected performance in 2016 when the economy defied expectations to grow strongly in the wake of the vote. The employers＊ body is now forecasting the UK economy will expand by 1.6% this year and 1.4% in 2018, up from its  for 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively. That would still mark a slowdown from 1.8% growth in 2016.The group, which repeatedly , said economic growth would be subdued over the next two years.※The UK economy has proved hardy in recent times, with firms up and down the UK getting on with what they do best by investing and creating jobs. Growth should be steady, if restrained, over the next couple of years as the pace of the economy shifts down a gear,§ said Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general.Fairbairn warned the strain on households was likely to continue as the pound＊s weakness since the Brexit vote pushed up the cost of imports and stoked inflation. But the pound＊s weakness was likely to help exporters by making their goods and services more competitive in overseas markets.※While the country＊s exporters should emerge as a real catalyst of growth, rising inflation and stubbornly low wage growth mean that people are already starting to feel the pinch. Tighter purse strings mean slower household spending growth and uncertainty is likely to weigh on the minds of those making major investment decisions.§The forecast followed official figures showing GDP growth  after relatively strong expansion of 0.7% in the final quarter of 2016. ※Even accounting for weaker growth at the start of 2017, the momentum from last year gives us more of a lift as we move ahead, and this explains our higher annual growth forecast relative to November,§ said Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI＊s chief economist.※But very little has changed in our view of the nature of the outlook. Growth will be slower in the years ahead as living standards are hit by rising inflation; and after some initial strength, uncertainty will weigh on business investment.§Early economic indicators following the Brexit vote confounded gloomy forecasts for a sharp slowdown. But a year on from the referendum and as , the effects of a weak pound and uncertainty over future trading agreements are being felt.Inflation has risen to its , , businesses have reported that consumers are cutting back and the . Pay growth has weakened and fallen behind inflation, meaning .The CBI said its latest forecast was for average quarterly GDP growth of 0.3% from the second half of this year 每 unchanged from its November outlook. That is half the average pace of growth from 2013 to 2016. It expects wage growth to remain below inflation in 2017 and broadly match it in 2018. Consequently, household spending is forecast to slow markedly. Business investment was expected to hold up over the near term, with CBI surveys pointing to an improvement in investment intentions since the referendum. ※But with uncertainty still holding back larger spending projects, we expect investment to wane over the course of 2018,§ the outlook added.The forecasts were compiled before the general election, which resulted in Theresa May losing her parliamentary majority. Some economists have said that has weakened May＊s hand in Brexit talks.Fairbairn said the CBI and other lobby groups were pushing the government to give the business community a stronger say and more formal role in talks about future trade deals for the UK outside the EU. She said imitating countries such as Australia and Canada, where business groups are formally consulted in trade negotiations, would be a major benefit to Britain.※They have confidential and formal structures and we have been calling for exactly that here. I think that we＊re seeing real signs of progress,§ Fairbairn said."															
"A ?2.3tn windfall for those lucky enough to own their own homes during the property boom of the 1990s and early 2000s has opened up a deep and widening inequality gap between the generations, a thinktank has warned. Rising that have enriched older generations have priced the young out of home ownership, said the Resolution Foundation, adding that the pattern whereby each generation was wealthier than the previous one had broken down., the thinktank noted that the born in the 20 years after the second world war were the big beneficiaries of rapidly rising house prices, but had amassed most of the wealth through no skill of their own. Wealth disparities would have ※worrying consequences§ for the living standards of younger generations, it added.Laura Gardiner, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ※Britain＊s pre-crash property boom created a huge, unearned and largely tax-free ?2.3tn housing wealth windfall for those old enough and lucky enough to be home owners at the time. But while the property bubble hugely benefited many of Britain＊s baby boomers, it has also driven generational wealth progress into reverse by pricing younger people out of home ownership.※Property, pension and financial wealth can provide security and opportunities for families, as well as a decent income in retirement. The failure of younger generations to accumulate wealth in the way that earlier generations have been able to is therefore a huge living standards concern for us all.§The report found that 82% of housing wealth increases between 1993 and 2012-14 were due to the property boom, which saw the average price of a residential property in the UK rise threefold, rather than through any active behaviour 每 such as buying, moving house or paying off mortgages. At the boom＊s zenith in 2003, one in six of all working property-owning adults were earning more from the rising value of their homes than from their jobs.Those born in the 1940s and 50s were the main beneficiaries of the great housing wealth windfall, since they were most likely to be homeowners at the start of the property boom, with each generation born after the mid-1950s less wealthy than the previous one. A typical adult in the second-youngest baby boomer cohort born from 1956 每60 had 7% less wealth at age 55 than the cohort at the same age five years previously. Between 1993 and 2012-14, the average property wealth gain for those born in the 1950s was ?80,000. This was more than double the ?35,000 windfall for those born in the 1970s, because the smaller percentage of those who managed to become homeowners benefited only from the later years of the housing boom.The report found that a typical adult born from 1981 to 1985 had half as much total net wealth at age 30 than a typical adult at the same age five years before them.  The report also found that baby boomers had benefited from a second wealth windfall because they were much more likely to be the beneficiaries of defined benefit pension schemes than young generations. Fewer than one in 10 workers born in the 1980s are active members of defined benefit pension schemes, compared with nearly two-fifths of those born in the 1960s when they were at the same age. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: ※Too often our public debates ignore the huge and very unequally shared wealth of our nation. We need to better understand the scale and causes of 21st-century wealth gaps 每 not only between rich and poor, but between different generations 每 if we are to ensure we fairly address the challenges Britain faces in the years ahead. We can start by recognising that today＊s young are not accumulating wealth at anything like the rate of older generations. This isn＊t because they save less, but because of the bad luck of being born too late, and our collective failure on big policy areas from housing to pensions. It＊s time we all took responsibility for putting that right.§The thinktank said the government needed to take into account the ※unrepeatable§ property and pensions windfalls as it made plans to deal with the pressures on the public finances as the baby boomer generation retires.

"An economics professor from the London School of  who warned against Brexit has been appointed to the Bank of England＊s interest rate-setting committee.Silvana Tenreyro was  ahead of the referendum last year stating it would be a ※major mistake§ for Britain to leave the EU. She will replace the US economist Kristin Forbes who leaves the monetary policy committee (MPC) this month.Tenreyro joins at a time of  over whether to leave interest rates at their record low to shore up growth as Brexit talks unfold, or to raise them in order to keep a lid on rising inflation. Forbes was one of three members voting for an increase in borrowing costs at this month＊s meeting. The other five, including the governor, Mark Carney, voted to leave interest rates at 0.25%.The LSE professor, who has British, Argentine and Italian citizenships, was appointed to the MPC by the chancellor, , as one of four external members who supplement the expertise of those policymakers working at the Bank full-time. Her appointment is for an initial three-year term starting in July.Tenreyro, the only woman on the MPC, will get her first chance to vote on interest rates at the committee＊s next meeting in August. In the meantime, investors will be poring over her previous comments on monetary policy to gauge whether she will tend towards a ※hawkish§ stance 每 being more likely to push for higher rates to curb inflation 每 or err the other way as a so-called ※dove§.Martin Beck at the consultancy Oxford Economics said Tenreyro＊s appointment meant the MPC＊s ※arch-hawk§ had been replaced by an unknown quantity.※Professor Tenreyro＊s academic background does not offer any clues as to what her attitude might be towards the stance of UK monetary policy. However, she does replace someone who has recently been the most hawkish member of the MPC. Ms Forbes used the last three successive committee meetings to vote for a hike in Bank rate,§ said Beck.※Given that it is very much the pattern for newly appointed committee members not to vote against the consensus view, it seems likely that Professor Tenreyro＊s appointment will shift the MPC＊s balance in a dovish direction, at least in the next meeting.§Tenreyro has a PhD in economics from Harvard University and at the LSE has specialised in macroeconomics and monetary economics, teaching in those subjects since 2004. She also has previous experience in monetary policy setting having worked as an economist at the US Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and served as an external member on the monetary policy committee at the Bank of Mauritius 每 attending many of its quarterly meetings via video conference.Carney, who has been , welcomed Tenreyro＊s appointment.※Her extensive and varied academic experience 每 on the monetary transmission mechanism, the dynamics of productivity, trade, housing issues as well as wage dynamics, to name just a few ?每 will be invaluable to the committee as it seeks to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom through maintaining monetary stability,§ Carney said in a statement.Hammond commented: ※I am confident that Professor Tenreyro will be a strong addition to the MPC, bringing a wealth of economic experience and academic rigour to the committee＊s deliberations.§ In  after the Brexit vote, Tenreyro she said she felt the causes for the result were ※multiple§. She indicated that some politicians had played on the immigration issue. ※Immigration certainly played a role in the exit vote, and many voters (partly encouraged by misleading politicians) thought immigration was to be blamed for their problems, while those problems are more complex and date longer,§ she said in the July 2016 comments.※Skill-biased technological progress, globalisation, and the fall of unions have created winners and losers, and the latter have not been compensated for their losses. They saw their standards of living deteriorate since the late 1970s, while at the same time salaries at the top of the distribution rocketed. Inequality is a critical issue in the UK and the west that needs to be addressed. Brexit was mostly an angry vote against the lack of progress of the bottom half.§"															
"usterity has been . The result of the general election shows that it has now failed politically as well. Deficit reduction continues, but will no longer dominate the agenda. Theresa May＊s failed gamble marks the end of a seven-year experiment.Both the 2010 and 2015 elections were fought on ground of the Conservative party＊s choosing. David Cameron and George Osborne made sure the debate was about which party could be trusted to balance the books. Yet over the past seven weeks, deficit reduction has barely featured. In part, that＊s because the Conservatives proved incapable of hitting their own targets. But more importantly it was because Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell made the election about investment in schools , and the impact of  on the fight against terrorism.That was much more fertile territory for Labour than an austerity virility contest it could never win. Indeed, it was the investment rather than tax cuts battleground on which Tony Blair and Gordon Brown successfully fought the 1997, 2001 and 2005 elections.Put simply, economic policy in the UK has moved to the left. In 2010 and 2015, the Conservatives could count on voter support 每 even if reluctant 每 for their hardline approach. Cameron and Osborne pinned the blame for the  on Gordon Brown, even though it was a global rather than a domestic affair. Similarly, they made it sound like common sense for the government to be tightening its belt when consumers and businesses were tightening theirs 每 even if it was .It was nonsense economics because if everybody 每 consumers, companies and government 每 decides to cut their spending at the same time, the result will be weaker growth and a slower pace of deficit reduction, unless the Bank of England is in a position to negate the impact of belt-tightening with lower interest rates. But Threadneedle Street was not able to do this because borrowing costs were already at rock-bottom levels.Even so, it took time for voters to turn against the politics of austerity. The Conservative line held in 2015 because Osborne engineered a recovery in the housing market and because the collapse in oil prices led to sharply lower inflation and rising living standards. But it was a short-lived recovery and the election was fought against a backdrop of a renewed squeeze on real incomes. It became commonplace during the election campaign to say that on this occasion it was ※not the economy, stupid§ 每 but in fact it was.Voters protested about the fact that their wages bought them less than they did a decade ago. They protested about the meanest  since the NHS was created in 1948. They protested about cuts in spending per pupil in education and they protested about food banks and rising inequality.Politically, austerity doesn＊t work if applied for too long, because fatigue sets in. That was true of Britain in the late 1940s and early 1950s and it is true again today. One illustration of austerity fatigue was the way in which the  on Labour＊s tax and spending plans seemed to have precious little effect.In 2010, and even in 2015, the Tories would have been able to make great political capital out of the IFS＊s charge that Labour＊s budget sums didn＊t add up. This time the attacks bounced off Corbyn and McDonnell, who were upfront about plans to borrow an extra ?250bn over the next 10 years for public investment.May＊s precarious position at the head of a weakened minority government is the final nail in austerity＊s coffin. It is not just that Northern Ireland will get some shiny new infrastructure as the price of  to get Conservative bills through parliament. There will be more money for the NHS, no abandonment of the triple lock on pensions and no means-testing of the winter fuel allowance.Deficit reduction did not feature once in the  today, but opportunity, fairness and ensuring nobody is left behind all did. May＊s problem is that voters clearly do not trust her to deliver those things. The wind is blowing from a different direction."															
"The  after the shock election result raised questions over the  and prospects for the UK economy.Sterling fell 2% to $1.2670 while shares in Lloyds Banking Group were down, along with those in Royal Bank of Scotland and the housebuilders Barratt and Taylor Wimpey. Shares in the fashion retailer Next were also lower on fears that consumer confidence would take a knock.But with the pound at its lowest level since since Theresa May  on 18 April, the FTSE 100 was pulled higher as the international companies that dominate the blue chip index stand to benefit from weakness in sterling. The City was wrongfooted by the election result, which was expected to return an increased majority for May rather than the hung parliament declared just before the London markets opened.The  that stunned traders when it was published at 10pm on Thursday, described by Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, as a ※thunderbolt§.※Britain＊s inconclusive election means it is a question of when, not if, the country heads to the polls again in the near future,§ said Tombs. All eyes were on the pound, which has been the focus of City attention since the vote for Brexit a year ago, amid warnings that a hung parliament could drive the currency lower. While sterling＊s weakness pulled up the FTSE 100, which gained around 40 points, or 0.5%, it failed to cushion the domestically focused FTSE 250, which fell by almost 1%, or 180 points. For analysts at UBS there were concerns about the impact of the election result on the economy. ※Such significant political uncertainty will further dampen sentiment and confidence, exacerbating the weakness we have already been starting to see over recent months,§ the UBS analysts said.A debate was also raging on City dealing floors about whether the election outcome was more likely to lead to a soft Brexit, with the UK able to retain access to the single market, and whether talks would start as planned later this month.Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg, said: ※Markets might perceive the near-term uncertainty to be worse than it was after the Brexit vote. However, if a hung parliament forces a cross-party compromise, it could lead to a softer Brexit strategy, and may turn out to be positive in the long run after some serious initial confusion.§ But, he added: ※The UK gets weak and wobbly government at the worst possible time, that is, when it has to renegotiate its position in Europe and the world. The Brexit clock is ticking ... Until parliament gets its act together the UK will be in no position to start serious Brexit talks on 19 June. After the UK wasted the first three months of the two-year divorce period, why should the EU agree to extend the deadline?§The employers＊ body, the CBI, immediately called on the politicians to keep the political wrangling to a minimum. Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said: ※This is a serious moment for the UK economy. The priority must be for politicians to get their house in order and form a functioning government, reassure the markets and protect our resilient economy.§The pound＊s slide had been signalled from the moment the shock 10pm exit poll was published, when it dived 2% almost instantly. But it stabilised through the night while dealers tried to gauge the accuracy of the exit polls. By the time trading began in London hours, it was clear that a hung parliament was inevitable.Jeremy Cook, the chief economist at World First, said sterling was moving as each seat was called through the night, with the currency staging brief recoveries every time it looked as if the poll had overemphasised Conservative weakness in the polls. ※It is fair to say that the political uncertainty in the UK is rising again and thus might have implications for financial investments,§ said Christoph Riniker, the head of equity strategy research at Julius Baer.But while the UK market was focused on the uncertainty created by the outcome of the election, analysts at the financial firm IG noted that other markets were calm. Traditional safe havens such as gold and the yen were lower. ※It＊s something that felt like something of catastrophe ＃ but no one seems to care apart from the UK,§ said Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG."															
"isitors to these American shores 每 if they squint and look real close 每 may be forgiven for thinking that they＊ve stumbled back into socialism. We still have a federal post office. We have a national railroad 每 ok, it＊s not much. And here in Texas, I pay my water, sewer, and electric bills to the local government, send my kids to the public schools (free, with orchestras) and teach at a state university. At 65, I have reached the age of social security and Medicare without working a day in the private sector. infrastructure is the backbone of the private economy, as any developer knows. Public infrastructure isn＊t only, or even mainly, ports, airports or pipelines (which are often enough private in this country), so it doesn＊t have all that much to do with productivity or competitiveness. Instead, commuter roads make possible exurban sprawl 每 large houses on cheap land, the foundation of America. And all that commuting sells cars, so that between selling cars and building houses we have what we call ※economic growth§. It can be no surprise that our Developer-in-Chief has been a big-spending Democrat on this issue, however rightwing on all other questions.But Donald Trump＊s infrastructure plan, the darling of his campaign, the cynosure of his inaugural address and and the sparkling gem of his first speech to Congress, doesn＊t actually exist. The Republican leaders of Congress killed off that plan months before Trump ever reached the Oval Office. Why? Because under the laws of accounting, federal spending requires either debt or taxes. And also, most of the infrastructure is in cities, which is where Democrats tend to live.So what we see this week is a shallow farce, beginning with a plan to  run by the airlines. Can the airlines run air traffic control safely? Perhaps they can, although they are taking a large risk: with the very first crash, if there ever is one, confidence in the system and their business will collapse. But can the airlines be trusted to run air traffic control in the public interest, and not in their own? If you think that, there is the proverbial Brooklyn Bridge, and for 10% I＊ll be happy to get you a good price.The rest of Trump＊s plan involves 每 you guessed it 每 ※leverage§. That means trying to persuade the world＊s suckers that state and local governments and private companies will invest $4 for every one put up by the federal taxpayer, a miracle of loaves and fishes in the form of bridges and roads, turning a mere $200bn over a decade into a full trillion dollars. And that these entities will thereby assume the debt that the federal government is blocked from taking on.There are just two problems. First, not every state or city can issue new debt at reasonable cost, even if it wants to. The cities with the greatest needs (think Flint, think water) are the poorest, oldest, blackest ones, not the new and the rich and the white. Second, local governments fund local projects. They don＊t think about national problems, let alone those of the planet. You will never get the green energy equivalent of the transcontinental railroad or the interstate highway system in this way.And local governments are controlled by developers. So what we will get from this, if anything, is more toll roads, toll bridges, more sprawl, more cars, more rake-offs and in the end, more financial trouble and more bail-outs. We might also get more reckless deregulated electric utilities (think Enron), more private water systems, more pay-through-the-nose communications. Of course, there will be some economic growth along the way. But in the meantime? Trust me, I live in Texas, well known as ※Mississippi with roads§. We＊ve been pioneering this sort of scam for years and years."															
"hen it closed for business on election day, the City of London was in confident mood. Theresa May was Margaret Thatcher. Jeremy Corbyn was Michael Foot. Labour＊s manifesto was, if not , the second longest. Opinion polls were pointing to a Tory majority of about 100, which is what Thatcher got in her second general election victory.By 10pm when the results of the exit poll were released, it dawned on the City that this was not a rerun of 1983 but of 1974. May was not Thatcher, she was Ted Heath, a prime minister lacking the human touch who had called an election when there was no need to do so. With a hung parliament pointing to the possibility of a second general election within months 每 another echo of 1974 每 the .The City hates uncertainty but it has now got uncertainty in spades. Brexit talks are supposed to start the week after next and it is uncertain whether May will still be leading the team by then. May＊s plan to strengthen her hand in the negotiations by increasing her majority has been an abysmal failure. There are now obvious and serious questions being asked about what the final deal will look like and whether the  can be completed within the two-year deadline. Unsurprisingly, the CBI expressed concern at an outcome that is bound to make business warier about investing.Life is only going to get more difficult for the Conservatives, assuming that they manage to cling on to power as a minority government. One reason May lost rather than won seats was that the country has had enough of austerity and is fed up with working ever harder for little reward.Political history suggests that sitting governments tend to do well when living standards are rising 每 as they were in 2015 - and badly when they are falling. On that basis, this was a supremely daft time to hold an election, because prices are going up more quickly than wages, which are still lower in real terms than they were seven years ago. Far from helping the Conservatives, the terrorist attacks in Manchester and London merely served to make voters wonder about the wisdom of in an attempt to hit deficit-reduction targets that have not been met.Certain things are clear despite the fog of uncertainty. First, the idea of balancing the budget has retreated further into the distance. A minority government will be looking to hand out goodies to the voters rather than squeeze them further. Second, the fall in the value of the pound will intensify the squeeze on living standards, making it even more likely that there will be soft-pedalling on austerity. Third, Philip Hammond is safe in his job because May is not strong enough to sack him. Finally, the prospect of a  deal under which the UK stays in the single market has increased."															
"The 2017 general election will be fought at a time when voters are getting poorer. That was the big message from the latest official figures for the cost of living showing that Earnings growth is running at around 2%, which means that living standards are going down. And there is worse to come. The gap between price increases and wage rises is going to get wider over the coming months.Views differ on just how bad things are going to get, but it is unlikely the squeeze on living standards will be as great as that five years ago, when inflation topped 5% on the back of oil prices close to $150 a barrel.This time, there is reason to believe the peak will be lower. Part of the increase in the cost of living in April was due to one-off factors: the timing of Easter pushed up air fares, while budget tax changes added more to inflation this year than in 2016.What＊s more, the recent rise in the value of the pound 每 if sustained 每 will help limit future price increases by making imports a bit cheaper. The separate Office for National Statistics data  suggests that the peak impact from the weakness of sterling and rising global oil prices occurred at the turn of the year.None of which will be of much comfort to those whose real incomes are falling. Ultra-low inflation in 2015 and the first half of 2016 resulted in two good years for living standards but these now look like the exception rather than the rule. The last decade has been the worst for real wage growth since the .As Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank has noted, . The last prime minister to go to the country when living standards were falling was Gordon Brown, and things didn＊t turn out well for him.The opinion polls suggest it will be a different story for Theresa May. But if she wins, she will do so without the help of a feelgood factor."															
"I still recall a comment in my first economics lesson that there is no obvious limit to human wants. Lugubrious US comic Steve Wright provided a perfect retort: ※You can＊t have everything; where would you put it?§ It is encouraging to see that more economists (, 12 April) are realising that a system which boils down to everyone making more money and buying more stuff will ultimately collapse in a heap.

"Falling retail sales and lower inflation in the US have added to signs that the world＊s biggest economy has lost momentum in recent months, casting doubt over how many more times the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.Stronger takings at clothing and electronics stores in March were not enough to offset a continued drop in demand for cars, according to  (pdf). As a result, retail sales fell for the second month running.The 0.2% drop was deeper than forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists and followed a bigger than previously reported decline of 0.3% in February.Sales were also hurt by lower demand for building materials in March, chiming with a sharp slowdown in construction hiring as parts of the US were hit by severe snowstorms. Petrol station takings also dipped in March as fuel prices fell. The few bright spots were a 2.6% rise in takings at electronics and appliance stores and a 1% rise in clothing sales.The drop in fuel prices in March echoed a  following a fall in global oil prices last month. Cheaper pump prices were also a key factor in softer US inflation. A measure of prices in the US fell for the first time in more than a year, dipping 0.3% in March, according to . It said falling fuel prices and mobile phone charges drove the decline in the consumer price index (CPI) and were only partially offset by rising food prices. As a result, inflation 每 or the pace of price changes over a year 每 eased to 2.4% in March from 2.7% in February. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, eased to 2% from 2.2% in February and was the weakest since November 2015.The retail sales and inflation data follow news of a sharp slowdown in job creation in the US in March as the poor weather, a government hiring freeze and a faltering retail sector all appeared to . But the unemployment rate declined to 4.5%, the lowest rate in a decade.The latest indications that the economy slowed in the opening months of the year will give policymakers at the US central bank more to debate as they decide when to next raise interest rates.In March, the US Federal Reserve , taking the base rate from 0.75% to 1%. It also indicated a series of further rises were still to come this year to keep inflation in check. The Fed＊s chair, , said at the time of March＊s rate rise that a wide range of indicators showed the US economy was in rude health, clearing the path for policymakers to take rates back towards historically normal levels.Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at the consultancy Capital , said the Fed still looked on course to tighten monetary conditions further this summer.Responding to the latest retail and inflation data, he commented: ※Some Fed officials will be disturbed by the unexpected drop back in core CPI inflation in March, but this won＊t prevent a June rate hike, particularly as the fall was partly due to one-off changes and weather effects.§He said the retail sales figures suggested real consumption ※barely increased at all over the first quarter§ but noted that the underlying picture was still fairly robust. ※The death of the US consumer is much exaggerated,§ Ashworth added."

While he condemned North Korea＊s provocations, Putin said further sanctions would be useless and ineffective, describing the measures as a ※road to nowhere§.China, too, opposes any measure 每 namely an oil embargo favoured by the US and Japan 每 that could foment a domestic crisis big enough to topple North Korea＊s leader, Kim Jong-un, and potentially end the country＊s status as a buffer between China and , where US forces are based.Japan＊s prime minister, Shinz身 Abe, is expected to broach sanctions with Putin when they meet in Vladivostok on Thursday.※We have to make North Korea change its current policy and understand that there is no bright future if North Korea continues the present policy,§ Abe told reporters before he left Tokyo.The US president, Donald Trump, said military action against North Korea was not a first choice after what he called a strong and frank discussion with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, about the issue.※President Xi would like to do something.

"urricane Harvey was such a distraction last week that Donald Trump forgot to tweet about his country＊s . When the news came that US second-quarter GDP, when extrapolated over a year, showed the country growing at the fastest rate in the G7, he was busy flying down to Texas to support the relief effort.Trump and his Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin have promised to deliver 3%-plus growth and here was the first indication that the president＊s arrival in the White House had made a difference. In a way, it is just as well he missed the opportunity to brag. The headline figures may look good, but a peek under the bonnet of the  makes for disturbing reading. In a report last week a senior City analyst, Albert Edwards, showed that the Trump effect is quite the opposite and much of the life has been sucked out of the American economic juggernaut in the last six months.Edwards＊s chosen measure of the economy＊s lifeless state is inflation, which has tumbled since the beginning of the year. Not so much the headline inflation figure, but the measure of core inflation that strips out oil prices and other volatile elements.Core inflation is considered a key indicator of an economy＊s health. To the ranks of central bankers it reveals how much domestic pressure there is on prices from long-lasting factors such as wages, and not external shocks to prices that can disappear as fast as they emerge. Edwards argues that the slump in inflation knocks out the Federal Reserve＊s arguments for a rate rise beyond the current 1% to 1.25% range currently in place.This is an important consideration, when most of the world＊s governments and central bankers have braced themselves for another round of interest rate rises from the Fed that could see a flight of cash from their banks to New?York.Without a rate rise, weaker nations can relax, safe in the knowledge that the flows of international capital will still come in their direction. Until recently Fed boss Janet Yellen was  that there would be at least one more rate rise this year and another couple in 2018. , as she admitted to Congress that the Fed had missed its 2% inflation target for the last five years and that core inflation stood at?1.4%.Edwards says his preferred measure of core inflation shows it standing at 1.2% and on a downward trajectory. ※If I were a Fed governor,§ he said, ※I?would be pretty shocked/concerned/bemused at inflation developments this year. However confident the Fed is of a self-sustaining-recovery, there is growing evidence of a slide into outright deflation even ahead of the next recession which will likely unambiguously take us deep into deflationary territory.§Edwards is one of many who believe the business cycle in the US, as elsewhere, is running out of steam and will soon go into recession. Japan is only growing, just like the eurozone, with huge amounts of central bank money injected each month. Britain has its outlook clouded by Brexit, but nevertheless, even the modest growth of the last six months would probably be zero or worse without the ultra-low interest rates on offer from the Bank of?England.Like many in the City, Edwards believes that the only option is to let the next US recession take its course without heavy Fed intervention, because to continue with ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing is to store more trouble and invite an even bigger crash.But as usual the debate in the City excludes the potential that governments have to support the economy with much-needed day-to-day spending and investment. Trump says that is exactly what he has in mind, but his reckless budget proposals look like being a rerun of the George W Bush tax cuts 15 years ago that favoured the rich and wrecked Bill Clinton＊s efforts to balance the books.To step in and allow the Fed to wind down its stimulus efforts, the US Treasury needs to raise more in tax. But not just any tax. One that targets those who are currently hoarding their winnings from the postwar boom. That puts baby boomers firmly in the frame along with their gains from property and pensions.It is a global phenomena that this group have steadfastly refused to pay the tax needed to keep their governments and economies afloat. The Japanese government regularly runs 10% budget deficits and now has a debt-to-GDP level approaching 250% after the middle class switched to loaning its government funds rather than gifting a higher proportion of its income through tax.The Germans hoard cash, which they then expect the rest of the world to borrow and pay interest on to keep them in a bountiful retirement. Britain and the US are among the countries where richer baby boomers vote to offload the problem to younger, lower-income groups, who must now borrow excessively just to make ends meet. Like it or not, low interest rates will be around for a decade or more unless older voters sanction their governments filling the void with taxpayer?cash."															
"hile accepting the Nobel prize for economics, Friedrich Hayek made an astonishing admission. Not only were economists unsure about their predictions, he noted, but their tendency to present their findings with the certainty of the language of science was misleading and ※may have deplorable effects§.This revelation, made about 40 years ago, is a crucial one and yet it has been largely forgotten or ignored. One of the most striking comments before the EU referendum was from Michael Gove. He claimed people in Britain had had enough of experts. This has since become something of a mantra, and polling does indeed suggest that most people place little trust in expert predictions and pronouncements.One of the problems with economic forecasting is that a small change in a few variables can make predictions almost impossibly complex. To understand how quickly the maths can become complicated, Prof Sir Michael Berry tried to forecast the path of a snooker ball after it was hit. Guessing where the first ball would go was easy; the second impact became more complicated, but still possible. The problem was that to correctly forecast the ninth impact, you would need to take account of the gravitational pull of someone standing nearby. To predict the 56th, you would need to include the effect of every single particle in the universe.So how do you make good predictions? I met ※superforecaster§ Michael Story, who was ranked 18th best among the 20,000 people who formed the Good Judgment team. The team took part in a competition conducted by the US intelligence community to find the world＊s best forecasters. Launched in 2011, the four-year contest required the group to provide forecasts on 500 questions ranging from the future for oil prices to the financial outlook. The Good Judgment team won the tournament, reportedly outperforming even professional intelligence analysts with access to classified data.The grading of their volunteers＊ forecasting abilities was key to why Good Judgment did so well. People knew how well they were performing and were driven to improve. They were also encouraged to correct their biases and alter their world view amid changing circumstances. This self-analysis and willingness to adapt, they believe, was crucial to the team＊s success.In a world in which we rate restaurants on TripAdvisor and the effectiveness of hair straighteners on Amazon, it is curious, and perhaps dangerous, that we fail to rate the economists who provide us with the forecasts on which world-changing decisions are made. Would it not make sense to have a reliability measure for economists as we do for any number of small consumer products? That way it would offer clues as to whether a forecast was reliable.Prakash Loungani at the IMF analysed the accuracy of economic forecasters and found something remarkable and worrying. ※The record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblemished,§ he said.His analysis revealed that economists had failed to predict 148 of the past 150 recessions. Part of the problem, he said, was that there wasn＊t much of a reputational gain to be had by predicting a recession others had missed. If you disagreed with the consensus, you would be met with scepticism. The downside of getting it wrong was more personally damaging than the upside of getting it right.Not only have we been bad at forecasting, but there is not much sign of improvement. Mark Pearson, deputy director for employment, labour and social affairs at the OECD in Paris, said: ※We are getting worse at making forecasts because the world is getting more complicated.§Increased complexity is not the only problem 每 forecasts are also made less trustworthy because of a feedback loop. So if a meteorologist says it will rain, the fact that you take an umbrella out with you does not affect the weather. But if an economist forecasts that inflation will rise by 3% and we react by asking for at least a 3% rise in wages, we have changed the basis on which the forecast was made. Inflation is now likely to rise by more than 3%. The fact that the forecast exists changes the reality it is trying to predict.Perhaps what we need is economists to say something like: there is a one in two chance that this will happen, but I can＊t be sure. In other words, they should embrace the uncertainty, not be embarrassed by it. Weather forecasters have started doing this. The Met Office has a precipitation probability measure that reveals how accurate a forecast is likely to be.The Good Judgment team believes part of the problem is that we misunderstand the science of forecasting and look to the wrong people for predictions. If we want to know what＊s happening to the economy, we think the obvious thing to do is ask an economist. But Storey says that may be the wrong approach. Forecasting is an art that is separate from the need to have specific subject knowledge. The people who were best at predicting the Arab spring, he said, were not Middle East experts. They were people who studied eastern Europe and had seen similar patterns develop there. We don＊t need subject experts, we need people who are great at forecasting anything.As we enter unknown economic waters, it is important to reassess how we use forecasts. Not only should forecasters reveal how confident they are, we also need to understand the limitations of the forecasts on which we are basing our businesses, votes and well-being. "															
"The  recorded a sharp fall in job creation in August, raising questions over whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year. Economists had expected the US to add about 180,000 jobs over the month. But the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a marked slowdown on the previous month, with a rise of 156,000 jobs. The figure for July was revised down to 189,000 from an initial 209,000, while for June number was reduced from 231,000 to 210,000, compounding the weaker picture. The figures made for disappointing reading for Donald Trump, who hasput jobs and wage growth among the top priorities for his administration. There was a modest rise in the unemployment rate from 4.3% to 4.4%, as the number of unemployed people in the  stood at 7.1 million.Average hourly earnings rose by 3c to $26.39 (?20.34), after rising by 9c in July. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 65c, or 2.5%.The August jobs report showed the rate of growth in US employment to be below the average of 176,000 per month so far this year 每 the average gain in 2016 was 187,000. The services sector had the weakest growth, as employment increased by only 95,000, little more than half the size of gains made in recent months.The August report, however, may have included statistical anomalies that will be ironed out in future. The data will probably be revised a couple of times and may end up showing a brighter picture, according to Ian Shepherdson, founder of research consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. ※We expect a rebound in September,§ he added. While the figures for last month were disappointing, there is potential for an even weaker outlook for the US economy, should damage from  continue to linger. The Department of Labor said there was ※no discernible effect on the employment and unemployment§ rate from the storm last month because the survey was compiled before it hit.While it could still be too early to do a full damage assessment, Harvey has the potential to have a negative effect on the US economy in the third quarter. The storm means there will be zero economic output in the affected states of Texas and Louisiana, which could hurt the wider economy. With a weaker outlook for employment, the August jobs report adds an additional problem for the Federal Reserve to consider as it weighs a further interest rate rise before the end of the year. There are still some expectations for an increase in December, although a slowing jobs market, the fallout from Harvey and low levels of inflation could build a case for maintaing the status quo. Dennis de Jong, managing director at currency trading firm UFX, said: ※A stronger than expected reading would have made that almost a certainty, now it＊s very much up in the air.§Investors have been looking for a better sense of the next Fed policy move by it chair, Janet Yellen, who gave away few clues last month at a meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. There are further potential pitfalls ahead, as Washington faces a showdown over the debt ceiling, a statutory limit on how much money the US can borrow that can only be increased by Congress, which could rattle markets, and delay action by the Fed.

"A graduate transport planner has won a ?250,000 prize for a plan to improve Britain＊s ailing roads with a proposal to scrap fuel and vehicle taxes and replace them with a pay-per-mile charging scheme. (pdf), with the ?27bn received annually from fuel duty now jeopardised by electric vehicles.Gergely Raccuja, 27, said that allocating 20% of funds directly for road repair would raise enough money to eradicate the UK＊s potholes in five years, persuading the judges of the 2017 , which asked for proposals for funding better, safer roads in a fair way while benefitting the economy and the environment.Raccuja＊s proposal argued that abolishing fuel duty and vehicle excise duty in favour of a simple distance-based charge, with heavier and more polluting vehicles paying more, would be fairer and restore trust between government and motorists. It would also ensure revenues in an era of electric and autonomous vehicles. The charge would be collected by insurers, based on mileage and model, potentially monthly using telematics or as an annual charge.The founder of the prize, Next fashion chain boss Lord Simon Wolfson, said it was a ※groundbreaking, yet simple§ solution. Raccuja beat competition including a proposal for tradeable road miles from the , head of the AA motoring organisation. Other shortlisted entries suggested rewarding people for changing their driving habits to beat congestion, and using different technologies to impose variable charges for journeys.Raccuja said: ※The key to our entry was to keep things simple, yet come up with an answer that was sophisticated enough to deal with an upheaval in cars and road transport which hasn＊t been seen since the introduction of the motor car well over a century ago. I hope I can persuade our politicians too that everything to do with our roads could be better.§Steve Gooding, the director of the RAC Foundation, which provided input to Raccuja＊s final submission, said the clock was ticking for policymakers as existing models of tax and spending on roads faced becoming redundant: ※The common themes of several entries have been both the pressing need for change and the belief there is a better option to balance what drivers contribute to the finances of the country and what they get in return.§"															
"John Rapley quotes the belief of Nobel laureates George Akerlof and Robert Shiller that ※storytelling is a ＆new variable＊ for economics, since ＆the material frames that underlie people＊s decisions＊ are shaped by the stories they tell themselves§ (, 11 July). Rapley refers to one story that the ※comfortable§ tell themselves about their privileged existence being the ※reward of life in a meritocratic society§. Raoul Martinez in his Creating Freedom counters that story with a far more convincing one.Rapley then quotes the American economist Wassily Leontief, also counselling against the dangers of self-satisfaction, calling for economists ※to work more closely with other disciplines§. Kate?Raworth in Doughnut Economics does just that, offering, for example, a lovely quotation from Janine Benyus, ※a leading thinker and doer in?the field of biomimicry§ who writes: ※We are big-brained animals, but we are newcomers on this planet, so we are still acting like toddlers expecting Mother Nature to clean up after us.§ And?the wonderful storyteller  concludes her No Is Not Enough with: ※Here is what needs to be understood in?our bones: the spell of neoliberalism has been broken, crushed under the weight of lived experience and a mountain of?evidence.§These eminently readable books offer frame-shaping joyful stories for summer reading. Not heavy, just inspiring. John Rapley misses the point. As we show in our book Who Needs the Cuts: Myths of Economic Crisis, economics has lost its origins in moral philosophy. Adam Smith was, in fact, professor of moral philosophy, and from Bentham, Mill, Malthus, Pareto and right up to Keynes, economists sought basic principles not in money but in social ethics. Marx was, of course, the most prominent example. Leading contemporary economists (we would exclude such as Stiglitz, Sen and Krugman) put money first and then make their peace with the kind of society that unfolds 每 often at one with resulting inequities. Rapley is wrong. It is precisely the loss of spiritual, ethical and moral concerns that defines the modern pathology that is economics.  ※Economics ＃ moves in cycles,§ writes John Rapley. So too should money, the lifeblood of the economy. The problem is that the government has had its rightful place at the heart of the economy supplanted by powerful elite members directing money to select parts of the economy, withering other parts through deficit and causing economic imbalance.If the government were to regain its cardinal position to direct the flow of money to all parts of the nation and receive it back again by taxation, it could nourish the whole country and abolish a great number of taxes. This could be achieved, in the main, by an excess wealth tax on corporations and individuals and a basic universal citizen＊s income. I once researched some American writers who had been influenced by Henry George and discovered that his ※single tax§ on land values was considered a heresy among ※proper economists§. As John Rapley remarks, Milton Friedman was then ※one of the most influential economists of the late 20th century§ but his belief that the single tax on land values was ※the least bad tax§ went unnoticed by admirers Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, and their countries subsequently suffered near terminal property price crashes. John Rapley＊s comparison of economics with religion omits one interesting detail. The University of Chicago＊s department of economics is now based in what was previously the university＊s theological seminary. I wondered when I walked past whether the chapel had been converted into a shrine for Milton Friedman, but it appears to be a student common room. As I read John Rapley＊s essay I kept wondering: ※When will he speak of the 2009 Nobel economics prize winner, the late Prof Elinor Ostrom?§I wondered in vain. Why was her work, so based upon society and the altruism that is built into respected institutions, not seen as the template for an economic ※church§ that did not exploit selfishness? Your long read, an edited extract of John Rapley＊s , prompts a consideration of neoliberal economics. Essentially, free markets are always right, once you have decided that the general population is entirely dispensable. As the Aztecs decided centuries ago, human sacrifice makes the world go around."															
"hen the Russian president, , meets his US counterpart, Donald Trump, at this week＊s G20 summit in Hamburg, he will not be doing so from a position of economic strength. To be sure, despite the steep drop in oil prices that began three years ago, Russia has managed to escape a deep financial crisis. But while the economy is enjoying a modest rebound after two years of deep recession, the future no longer seems as promising as its leadership thought just five years ago. Barring serious economic and political reform, that bodes ill for Putin＊s ability to realise his strategic ambitions for Russia.Back in 2012, when Putin appeared  with the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman at a Moscow bank conference, Russia＊s 1998 economic crisis seemed a distant memory. With oil prices well over $100 a barrel, the government＊s coffers were bursting. So Putin could proudly contrast Russia＊s government budget surplus with the large recession-driven deficits across the west. He surely delighted in having Russian audiences hear Krugman＊s view that western democracies had come up badly short in handling the global financial crisis.In a , Russian academic economist  (who later had to flee the country) argued there was no hope for diversification of Russia＊s resource-based economy as long as institutions such as courts were so weak. Too many key decisions rested with one man. Speaking in the same session, I emphasised that without fundamental reforms, a sharp drop in global energy prices would create profound problems.Inevitably, , with prices plummeting from $119 in February 2012 (for Brent crude oil in Europe) to $27 in 2016. Even the current level (under $50 in early July 2017), is less than half the 2011-2012 peak. For a country that depends on oil and natural gas for the lion＊s share of export revenue, the price collapse has been a massive blow rippling through the economy.The fact Russia has avoided a financial crisis is remarkable 每 and largely due to the efforts of the Central Bank of . Indeed, Elvira Nabiullina, the CBR＊s governor, has twice won international central banker of the year awards.But the burden of adjustment has largely fallen on consumers, owing to a  in the ruble＊s value relative to the dollar; real wages and consumption both . As one Russian put it to me, he used to take 1,000 rubles to the supermarket and come home with two bags; now he comes home with one.The shock to the real economy has been severe, with Russia suffering a  in 2015 and 2016 comparable to what the  during its 2008-2009 financial crisis, with the contraction in GDP totalling about 4%. Many firms went bankrupt, and in 2016 the International Monetary Fund estimated that almost 10% of all bank loans were non-performing (a figure that surely understates the severity of the situation).In many cases, banks chose to re-lend funds rather than take losses on to their books or force politically connected firms into bankruptcy. At the same time, though, the CBR moved aggressively to force smaller banks to raise capital and write down bad loans (something European policymakers have taken forever to do). And, in the face of intense lobbying by powerful oligarchs, the CBR kept interest rates up to tame inflation, which had reached more than 15% but has since fallen to close to 4%.Of course, western sanctions 每 particularly restrictions on banks 每 have . But the media tend to over-emphasise this aspect of Russia＊s economic woes. All countries that rely heavily on energy exports have suffered, especially those, like Russia, that have failed to diversify their economies.In a western democracy, an economic collapse on the scale experienced by Russia would have been extremely difficult to digest politically, as the global surge in populism demonstrates. Yet Putin has been able to remain firmly in control and, in all likelihood, will easily be able to engineer another landslide victory in the presidential election due in March 2018.Russia＊s state-owned media juggernaut has been able to turn western sanctions into a scapegoat for the government＊s own failures, and to whip up support for foreign adventurism 每 including the seizure of the Crimea, military intervention in Syria, and meddling in US elections. Most Russians,  by their country＊s schools and media, are convinced that conditions are much worse in the west (a hyperbolic claim even in the era of ※fake news§).Unfortunately, such disinformation is hardly a recipe for generating reform. And, without reform, there is little reason to be optimistic about Russia＊s long-run growth trend, given its poor demographic profile, weak institutions and abject failure to diversify its economy, despite having an enormously talented and creative population.Where will future growth come from? If the world continues to move toward a low-carbon future, Russia will confront an inevitable choice: launch economic and political reforms or face continuing marginalisation, with or without western sanctions. No meeting between the US and Russian presidents can change that reality."															
"Britain＊s economy has moved sideways over the past decade. That＊s the main message from the latest set of official figures for productivity which, once again, are dismal.It is not just that the performance in the first three months of 2017 was poor.  meant productivity fell back below where it was in the last quarter of 2007, the period immediately before the economy nosedived into recession.Such a long period without any productivity growth is unprecedented in modern times. Normally what happens is that productivity falls in the early stage of a recession but then bounces back and returns to its pre-slump trend. That, though, hasn＊t happened since 2007, with profound consequences for living standards.Rising productivity means that a society is finding new and better ways of providing goods and services. Broadly speaking, more is produced with less effort. Societies have the choice of consuming more or having more leisure time. Usually, they opt for a bit of both.The  says that, had productivity in the UK returned to its pre-recession trend, it would be 20% higher than its current level. Britain would be one fifth better off.. Economic output fell sharply during the recession of 2008-09 and subsequently recovered modestly so that it is some 8% higher than its previous peak. But the number of people employed has also been going up, so the amount produced per worker per hour has remained unchanged.There are plenty of explanations for why productivity has flatlined. One factor has been the shift in economic output and labour from high productivity industries in recent years. While the number of people working on North Sea oil and gas rigs has gone down, the number of people employed by supermarkets to fill shopping baskets for home deliveries has gone up.Governments have also used a carrot-and-stick approach to get the jobless back to work. They have tightened up eligibility for unemployed benefits while simultaneously providing tax credits to boost low wages. This, together with a big increase in migration, has increased the supply of low-skill labour, much of which has ended up doing low-productivity tasks.Businesses are in a strong financial position. The rate of return on capital is the highest it has been since the boom years of the late 1980s. This would normally be the cue for firms to spend more on innovation and new machines, both of which would lead to higher productivity.But, with labour so plentiful and the outlook murky, it is less risky for firms to respond to any pickup in demand by hiring some cheap workers rather than by investing in some new kit. But until investment does pick up, the UK will be stuck in a low-productivity trap."															
"Slowing growth across Britain＊s services companies in June completed a ※triple whammy§ of disappointing economic news this week that also saw growth in the construction and manufacturing industries fade in response to Brexit uncertainty and .Activity in the services industry, which accounts for almost 80% of economic activity, fell to a four-month low in June, dragging down the all-sector IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers index (PMI) from 54.5 in May to 53.9 in June, the lowest since February.Some analysts said the weak set of figures indicated a broad softening in activity across the economy that was likely to dent the enthusiasm of Bank of England policymakers who have proposed increasing interest rates.Earlier this week,  and Ian McCafferty said persistent inflation and strong employment growth needed to be calmed by higher interest rates. Chief economist Andy Haldane recently indicated that he could vote for a rise later this year should the economy continue to expand.Chris Williamson, Markit＊s chief business economist, said: ※A slowing in services sector growth completes a triple-whammy of disappointing PMI survey readings. ※Although the three PMI surveys are running at levels that are historically consistent with GDP growing by around 0.4% in the second quarter, it＊s clear that the economy heads into the third quarter losing momentum.§Williamson said the surveys of business optimism revealed a steep decline following the general election and commencement of  negotiations.※At the same time that households are battling against rising inflation, the indications are that the economy＊s resilience is being tested,§ he said.※It would therefore be a surprise to see policymakers vote for a rate increase. According to historical comparisons, the current PMI reading would be more consistent with the Bank of England cutting interest rates rather than hiking.The surveys show there are pockets of growth in financial services and business services, but the overall picture is one of business spending, investment and exports failing to provide sufficient impetus to fully offset the consumer slowdown.Inflation has climbed to 2.9% while wages are only rising by little more than 2%, leaving millions of households .GDP growth is expected to recover in the second quarter to between 0.4% and 0.5% after stumbling in the first quarter to just 0.2%. However, the lack of momentum in output and deteriorating expectations of a business-friendly outcome from the Brexit negotiations means the UK economy could stagnate in the third quarter.※Given the deterioration in the forward-looking indicators, such as business optimism and order book growth, the risks are tilted towards the economy slowing in the third quarter,§ said Williamson.Scott Bowman, UK economist at the consultancy Capital , said the gloom cast by the PMI was overdone and the economy remained resilient.※The three-month average of the all-sector PMI is still consistent with quarterly GDP growth of 0.5% or so in the second quarter. And while the PMI overestimated growth in the first three months of the year, it excludes the retail sector 每 which performed poorly in the first quarter but looks likely to have recorded a stronger performance in the second. ※What＊s more, hard output data for March and April have set a fairly good base for growth in the second quarter. Accordingly, we still think that GDP growth will accelerate to close to 0.5% in the three months to June, from the first quarter＊s 0.2% rate.§"															
"One of the key architects of David Cameron＊s austerity programme has suggested the government must consider tax rises and increased spending on public services to respond to overwhelming pressure on social care, schools and the ., former chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster who was Cameron＊s head of policy, said he believed most people were prepared to see a modest rise in tax bills in order to fund investment in public services, but stopped short of saying that should mean an end to the public sector pay cap.※It may well be, in one way or another, a large number of people will have to pay a little more tax if we are going to maintain the trend towards reduced deficits and yet spend a little more on the crucial public services that do need more spent on them,§ the MP said.On Wednesday, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and members of the shadow frontbench will , calling for cuts to emergency services including the police and the fire service to be reversed, and for an end to the 1% cap.Letwin said the priority should be investment in services, such as social care, rather than pay rises for staff. ※I think what is at stake here in the first place is the quality of the delivery of public services,§ he said.In its manifesto, Labour pledged that it would only increase taxes for those earning more than ?80,000 a year, the top 5% of earners. Though the Conservative manifesto made no such firm commitment, Theresa May and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said repeatedly during the election campaign that the Tories were the ※party of low taxes§.However, Letwin suggested modest tax rises should also be considered for middle earners. ※Some taxes can be raised in a careful way without provoking massive problems for families,§ he said.※Those of us who are lucky enough to have higher incomes will have to bear more one way or another the costs of any increase in public service expenditure. But I＊m not at all suggesting you can restrict to only dealing with whatever Mr Corbyn defines as the very rich.§Letwin said voters had sent a message at the general election that they were concerned about pressures on underfunded services. ※We all found that on the doorsteps,§ he said. ※I talked to hundreds, around 3,000, of my electors face to face; I got the same sense from almost every colleague: people were much more concerned at this election about spending on schools, spending on health and social care 每 crucial public services which now seem to be under strain.§However, Letwin said the government should not row back on its commitment to deficit reduction. ※The truth is we need to maintain, as a country, for the sake of all of us, credibility with investors,§ he said. ※We need to be sure that when the next downturn comes, we are well protected rather than exposed. We have to continue the programme of restoring fiscal credibility and getting back to balanced budgets.※That is very important, but it is compatible with easing up a little, not a great splurge, but easing up on spending on key public services if one is prepared to bite the bullet of carefully judged and carefully presented tax increases.§"															
" To the surprise of the City, tax receipts were higher than public spending. Not by much, but a surplus is still a surplus even if in the context of a ?1.8tn economy it is small change.This, though, was a classic case of one swallow not making a summer. For a start, the deficit in the first four months of the financial year 每 a much better guide to the trend than a single month＊s figures 每 was higher this year than last.Moreover, despite strong growth in employment, PAYE receipts last month were only 1.6% higher than in July 2016. That is entirely consistent with an economy in which workers struggling to secure a decent pay rise are not paying very much tax.The first July surplus since 2002 was an improvement on a small ?400m deficit in July 2016. But close examination of the suggests that was the result of an ?800m jump in receipts from self-employment.As a number of analysts pointed out, in 2016 the deadline for the self-employed fell on a weekend, with the result that many payments were not processed until August. To judge whether there has been any real improvement in self-employment receipts we will have to wait for the August data to come out.The bigger picture is this. On current trends, the public finances are likely to be in the red by about ?50bn for the 2017-18 financial year as a whole 每 a bit worse than last year when the figures were flattered by a couple of one-off factors.Ministers will doubtless say that they have cut the deficit by two-thirds from its peacetime high of more than ?150bn in 2009-10, but the real story is that repairing the hole in the public finances after the financial crash is taking a lot longer than it did after previous recessions.Seven years after the trough of the 1980-81 recession, the public finances were so strong that Nigel Lawson was able to cut the top rate of income tax from 60% to 40% and the standard rate from 27% to 25%. Seven years after the trough of the 1990-91 recession, Gordon Brown was running a budget surplus.On current plans, it will not be until the middle of the next decade before the books are finally balanced. That＊s not because the government has been less assiduous in implementing austerity measures than the administrations in the 1980s and 1990s. It is because the initial shock from the financial collapse was more severe and the subsequent recovery, in large part due to ill-timed and excessive austerity, has been much weaker.Eric Daniels was running Lloyds Bank when it received a ?20bn bailout from the UK taxpayer in 2008. The 66-year-old American was chief executive when the high street lender was up to its neck in the protection payment insurance scandal, the mis-selling of which has so far cost Lloyds ?18bn in compensation. He left the bank with a ?5m pension pot in 2011 but, as the PPI bills mounted, As tends to be par for the course, Daniels subsequently picked up a portfolio of new jobs: here a role with a boutique investment bank, there a non-executive directorship with a private equity firm. He has been doing all right for himself and could have decided to continue living in lucrative obscurity.每 running into hundreds of thousands of pounds 每 that he says he should have received for hitting performance targets. Daniels can certainly afford the very best legal advice and he has no doubt been told that, by the terms of his contract, he has a case.But unless Lloyds decided to settle quietly out of court, it is hard to see what Daniels expects to gain from his action. Even if he is right by the letter of the law, he is wrong in every other way.The public was disgusted by the way in which the bankers behaved before, during and after the financial crash 每 and understandably so. There was a sense, as ordinary voters paid for the mistakes and malfeasances of the City, that the financiers simply didn＊t get it. Daniels＊ decision to sue Lloyds suggests that they still don＊t."															
"here＊s a joke, beloved of American economists, that has a chief executive, a member of the conservative Tea Party movement and public-sector employee?sitting at a table eyeing a plate of 12 biscuits.The chief exec grabs 11 of them, before turning to the Tea Party member and warning: ※You better watch him. He wants your cookie.§This gag has been doing the rounds for a bit now and tends to be trotted out when the topic of inequality comes up 每 which means that there is a fair chance that someone might give it a run out at the Resolution Foundation this week, as the thinktank launches new research into ※the wealth of our nation: who owns what in 21st-century?Britain§.The topic feels as current as ever 每 especially as the work will examine ※not just at the wealth gap between rich and poor, but also the new gap opening up between young and old§ 每 and comes at a point when Oxfam reckons the accumulated wealth of Britain＊s richest 1% is more than 20 times the total of the poorest fifth.The charity says the inequality problem is likely to have been a contributing factor in the vote to leave the European Union and that the figures make the country one of the most unequal in the developed world.That really takes the biscuit.In April, a plan by the second-largest shareholder in  to oust the toymaker＊s chairman hit the buffers.A 20% shareholder called New Pistoia described Hornby＊s five years under Roger Canham as ※disastrous§, before predicting that the firm＊s ※ineffective§ strategy ※will continue to destroy value and is not aligned with creating wealth for all shareholders§. Oh 每 and just for good measure it added that Canham＊s other role, at Hornby＊s largest shareholder Phoenix, was not ※in accordance with principles of good corporate governance§.Canham was not derailed: but if he＊s congratulating himself over holding on to the controls at a company whose brands also include Scalextric, Airfix and Corgi, then he probably shouldn＊t. Having your second largest shareholder characterise your tenure as ※disastrous§ hardly suggests the chairman has been doing a flawless job 每 and nor does the company＊s share?price.It slumped by 62% in February 2016 after the firm warned of mounting losses following a ※disappointing§ start to that year 每 and it hasn＊t really shown much sign of staging a comeback since.All of which makes the group＊s full-year results this week rather intriguing.Developing.It may not currently be the most fashionable tactic for everyone 每 but this week we＊re going to see what happens when our ruling classes talk to ordinary people.On Wednesday we get the latest instalment of the Bank of England＊s agents＊ summary of business conditions 每 effectively a report from Threadneedle Street＊s eyes and ears on the ground around the country.The field agents talk to hundreds of businesses and report back with scores and comments on the health of consumer spending, manufacturing, the housing market, pay awards and costs faced by business and consumers.This is likely to be watched more closely than usual following the split that emerged last week at the Bank over the right time to raise interest rates from their record low of 0.25%.Three members voted against the other five and called for an immediate rise in borrowing costs to keep a lid on inflation. One of the hawks, Kristin Forbes, leaves the monetary policy committee at the end of the month 每 but investors will be hoping to hear from the other two, Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, soon. They will certainly hear from the governor 每 Mark Carney 每 this week, as on Tuesday he and chancellor Philip Hammond will be delivering their Mansion House speeches, cancelled last week after the Grenfell Tower fire."															
"The  has warned households that living standards will fall this year as the effect of the Brexit vote works its way through to higher prices and meagre pay deals.Presenting a sober assessment of the economic outlook just weeks before the general election on 8 June, the Bank＊s governor Mark Carney predicted living standards could start to recover in 2018 but , in the meantime, inflation would be higher than pay growth this year making it a ※more challenging time§ for households.He said inflation, already  was expected to continue rising in 2017 as the pound＊s weakness since the Brexit vote raised import costs. As the UK embarks on talks to leave the EU, he also highlighted the uncertainty weighing on businesses as they hesitate over awarding pay rises.※Uncertainty for companies about the outlook may also have made them unwilling to raise wages at a faster pace until they have more clarity about future costs and market access,§ Carney said at a news conference to present the Bank＊s quarterly inflation report.Against the backdrop of political uncertainty,  and rising inflation, the Bank left interest rates on hold at their record low of 0.25%. But it hinted that they may need to rise sooner than investors were anticipating if inflation continued to overshoot its target and as long as the Brexit process was ※smooth§.The monetary policy committee was split for its second meeting running over the rates decision, with Kristin Forbes again voting against the other seven members and calling for an immediate rise to 0.5% to keep rising inflation in check. One seat on the committee was empty 每 the result of resignation by the Bank＊s deputy governor, Charlotte Hogg, .The forecasts published alongside the interest rate decision were for economic growth to edge up to 1.9% this year from 1.8% in 2016. That 2017 forecast was little changed from a 2% prediction made in February and followed official figures showing .Growth was predicted to slow next year to 1.7%, little changed from February＊s 1.6% prediction.The bigger changes were on the inflation forecast after faster price rises than the Bank expected. The Bank now forecasts inflation will be 2.7% this quarter, up from the 2.4% rate it was forecasting in February and a stark contrast to inflation of just 0.3% a year ago.It said inflation, on the consumer prices index, would continue to rise further above its 2% target in the coming months, ※peaking a little below 3% in the fourth quarter.§ But then inflation would ease back in 2018 and the following year.At the same time, the Bank slashed its forecast for average earnings growth for this year to 2% from 3% pencilled in back in February. It expects wage growth to recover in 2018 as unemployment remains low.Once adjusted for inflation, the Bank＊s outlook for this year translated into a 0.8% drop in average pay, according to the Resolution Foundation thinktank. Its analysis found average pay was now expected to be ?320 lower this year than predicted in the Bank＊s February inflation report and ?915 lower than it forecast in the May 2016 report that preceded the referendum.The squeeze on household budgets will have repercussions for an economy that is highly reliant on consumer spending to drive growth. But the Bank＊s policymakers said weaker consumer spending would be offset by rising business investment and an improving trade performance as the weak pound and solid overseas demand boost exports.Explaining its rates decision, the Bank hinted that financial markets＊ recent expectations were on the low side and that a rate rise could come sooner than many investors expected. However, that statement was based on the market view over the 15 working days to 3 May, which was for only one rate rise to 0.5% over the next three years. Since then, markets have moved to price in around two rate rises.Minutes from the policy meeting said: ※On the whole, the committee judges that, if the economy follows a path broadly consistent with the May central projection, then monetary policy could need to be tightened by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than the very gently rising path implied by the market yield curve underlying the May projections.§The Bank said its view was conditioned on a ※smooth§ Brexit process. Carney explained this meant getting an agreement on future trading arrangements and having a transition period to that agreement.Paul Hollingsworth, at the consultancy Capital , said the inflation report supported his view that interest rates are set to rise sooner than markets expect.But Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the Bank was too optimistic about the UK＊s near-term growth prospects.※We expect that inflation will weaken economic activity by more than the central bank is currently predicting, with wage growth likely to remain persistently below price growth over the next few years,§ he said. ※Rising input costs faced by businesses are also likely to weigh more heavily on investment intentions than the Bank of England forecasts currently imply.§"															
"Britain＊s blueprint for a post-Brexit immigration policy, outlined in , would be ※catastrophic§ for some industries, employers have warned. Corporate chiefs and industry leaders in sectors including housebuilding, aerospace, farming and hotels said the tighter controls could lead to labour shortages and damage the economy, as one of their biggest fears about  shows signs of becoming a reality.About 2.2 million European Union nationals work in Britain 每 roughly 7% of the overall workforce 每 with some subsectors of the economy almost totally reliant on migrants, official figures show. Business leaders have long counselled No 10 on the need to retain access to high and low-skilled labour when Britain leaves the EU. The warning is stark from some, with  accounting for more than 20% of the labour force in at least 18 specialist sectors,  of Office for National Statistics figures.The hotels, retail and hospitality industries, in particular stand to lose from the reforms. Some 75% of waiters and 25% of chefs working in the UK come from other EU nations. ※If these proposals are implemented it could be catastrophic for the UK hospitality industry,§ said Ufi Ibrahim, the chief executive of the British Hospitality Association.Hospitality firms need at least 60,000 new EU workers a year in order to fill vacancies, according to research for the BHA by the accountancy firm KPMG. Peter Gowers, the chief executive of the hotel chain Travelodge, said: ※Even if the hotel industry recruited virtually every person on the the unemployment register there wouldn＊t be enough people to fill all the roles needed in the 10 years following Brexit. That＊s particularly the case in London.§He said the government must consult on a ※meaningful guest worker programme as a matter of urgency§ to avoid price rises and cuts in investment in the industry. The  proposes offering EU migrants residency for a maximum of only two years, in a policy designed to drive down numbers. Those in ※high-skilled occupations§ will be granted permits to work for a longer period of three to five years.About 4% of aerospace, defence and space industry workers are from other EU countries, while 5% of employees in these sectors working in the EU are UK citizens, with a supply chain that stretches across Europe. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of industry trade body ADS, said: ※It is important the needs of businesses who rely on employees being able to cross national borders are taken into account in the government＊s final proposals.§Downing Street faced a second embarrassing leak in 24 hours after it emerged No 10 has been  supporting its Brexit strategy. The document, leaked to Sky News, was circulated to a number of FTSE 100 company chiefs with a request that they consider signing the letter by Friday.The furious response of businesses is likely to strengthen the position of Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who has been pushing for the government to listen more to companies＊ concerns about Brexit. Theresa May＊s spokesman insisted on Tuesday that this engagement was already happening, saying: ※Business has an important voice in the conversation taking place over Brexit and we will continue to listen to them. One of our aims is to make sure we deliver a Brexit that is as smooth as possible for business.§Tighter immigration controls could damage economic growth, bringing potentially dire consequences for the nation＊s finances. The rapid reduction in net migration to below 100,000 new arrivals to the UK each year 每 a Tory campaign pledge before the election 每 could knock 3.1% off GDP by 2025 and lower tax receipts by ?32.7bn, according to research from the Centre for  and Business Research (CEBR).Douglas McWilliams, the executive chairman of CEBR, said: ※If you destroy the capacity for people to come here looking for work, then there will be a significant effect to the economy and a very big knock-on effect for the public finances.§Industry sectors lined up to voice concern over the leaked proposals. ※If this does represent the government＊s thinking it shows a deep lack of understanding of the vital contribution that EU migrant workers make 每 at all skill levels 每 across the food chain,§ said Ian Wright, the director general of the Food and Drink Federation.The National Farmers＊ Union said an abrupt drop in the number of EU workers able to work in the UK would cause ※massive disruption to the entire food supply chain§. Farming produces the raw ingredients for the UK food and drink sector, worth ?109bn and employing 3.8 million people.The EEF, the manufacturers＊ organisation, said it could work with the proposals for highly skilled workers but the proposals for low-skilled migrants were a ※grave concern§. Tim Thomas, the director of employment and skills at the EEF, said: ※The proposals represent a mixed bag. On the highly skilled side, the system described is one we can work with, after some changes. But, we would have grave concerns that at lower skill levels accessing EU workers will be on a completely different basis.§ Thomas also warned that overseas workers may no longer want to come to the UK: ※The question, currently unanswered, is whether workers other than the highly skilled will still want to come to the UK on the basis there＊s no family reunion, no pathway to ever settling here, and where their stay is limited to two years.§ The CBI, which speaks for 190,000 businesses that employ 7 million people, said it was essential to keep an open approach to hiring staff from the EU so that vacancies could be filled and that overseas firms carried on investing in the UK.Neil Carberry, the group＊s managing director for people and infrastructure, said the government＊s final position paper should support ※an open but managed approach to immigration§.The Institute of Directors said business leaders would not welcome the approach outlined in the leaked documents and its members would be hoping for changes in the government＊s final position.Seamus Nevin, the institute＊s head of employment and skills policy, said immigration rules should be clear and simple. ※The UK needs an immigration system which provides control while also enabling employers to access the foreign workers they need at all levels 每 whether it be short-term seasonal workers, intra-company transfers or permanent positions,§ he added.Tim Martin, the founder of the Wetherspoons pub chain and a prominent supporter of Brexit, said immigration was healthy for the economy. He draws about 5% of his 35,000-strong workforce from EU nationals, although he said tighter controls similar to Australian or US rules would be preferable. ※The EU method of immigration and migration was unsustainable and was undemocratic, even though you have definitely benefited from the eastern Europeans, in particular, who have come over here in the last decade or so,§ he added.The EU referendum and Britain＊s increasingly hostile stance to European workers is already having an effect on employment figures. There was a  to 997,000 in the three months to June from the same period a year ago, according to ONS figures.A slowdown could contribute to lower unemployment and might potentially push up wages. However, Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said old Home Office studies showed that immigration had little impact on wages and employment. ※Overwhelmingly it has been the case that overseas workers have been complementary rather than competitive to British workers,§ he said.Rob Perrins, the chief executive of the Berkeley Group, which builds upmarket homes in London, said some of its EU workers had left because of the sharp fall in sterling since the Brexit vote. The company is heavily dependent on EU workers, who make up half its workforce.Perrins said about 200,000 workers are needed to build housing in London to address the shortage of new homes. Steve Turner, of the Home Builders Federation, said as many as 70% of workers on some construction sites in the capital hail from abroad, mainly from within the EU. ※Clearly the electricians, bricklayers and plumbers that are coming from Europe we are very reliant on,§ Turner added. ※You＊re going to have to define what＊s skilled. House builders need labour of all sorts 每 skilled and unskilled.§"															
"Business leaders have blamed the uncertainty created by Britain＊s vote to leave the European Union for the slowest pace of output growth in the services sector for almost a year.Financial data provider Markit said Brexit uncertainty and higher import costs arising from the slump in the pound were behind the stumbling performance of the UK＊s largest business sector last month.In the first half of the year the services sector, which accounts for almost 80% of economic activity, kept the UK from slipping back into recession.But  after a spike in inflation and the reluctance of households to accumulate debt at the pace seen in the first half of 2017 appeared to have hit the demand for services. Markit said its purchasing managers＊ index (PMI) for the sector fell to 53.2 points in August from 53.8 the previous month amid signs that ※Brexit-related uncertainty continued to undermine business confidence§. Anything above 50 indicates expansion. Without a strong rebound over the next few months, analysts said the UK could be heading for another quarter of 0.3% GDP growth and an annual figure that struggles to get above 1%. The survey followed news of a dramatic fall in car sales during August that analysts warned was connected to household concerns over the outcome of Britain＊s talks with the EU.Private car sales fell by 9.9% in August, compared with the same month last year, to leave the overall annual drop at 6.4%.The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), said August was traditionally a month for low car sales before the September number plate change. The car industry body said the 76,000 sales still represented the third biggest August in 10 years. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said car industry sales were declining from all time highs, but nevertheless August＊s figures represented the fifth month of falling sales and pointed to ※a clear loss of momentum in the sector§. Last month Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, warned that motor manufacturers feared  by Britain＊s departure from the EU.He said: ※A lot of people have spent the best part of decades turning round the industry, when you think back to how it was characterised in the 70s, 80s and into the 90s. It is very different now. It has had very difficult times and it is a cyclical industry, and there is a fear that that success could be put at jeopardy.§The fall in car sales and weaker services sector growth is ※more evidence that the hit to real incomes from sterling＊s depreciation and heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook 〞 both attributable to Brexit 〞 are holding the economy back§, said Samual Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Markit said that on a more positive note, the largest majority of services firms since July 2015 reported that work backlogs increased in August. And in response, firms hired the most workers in 19 months and offered slightly higher wages to retain key staff.But the new orders index declined to 54.2 in August from 54.7 in July, signalling continued weakness in demand.Chris Sood-Nicholls, head of global services at Lloyds Bank commercial banking, said: ※Brexit brings an added layer of complexity and uncertainty, with many investment decisions going on hold. This uncertainty is also impacting sentiment and making it difficult for businesses to plan long term.§He said the continued weakness of sterling continued to drive price increases and consumers and businesses were feeling the pinch. ※It＊s difficult to see anything immediately on the horizon that will nudge the index out of its fairly flat performance,§ he said.Jeremy Cook, chief economist at foreign exchange dealer WorldFirst, said that together with the PMIs for manufacturing and construction, ※the services number indicates a quarterly UK GDP rate of 0.3% 每 and slowing all the time§.He said: ※Brexit uncertainty, higher costs and lower investment are slowing UK output to a chronic crawl. The summer months may have been warm but the recessional risks for the UK economy are only increasing as we move into autumn.§"															
"British manufacturers and retailers are reporting an upswing in sales, despite fears Brexit could hamper future growth, as the weak pound bolsters exports abroad and consumer spending at home. Retail sales increased by 1.3% on a like-for-like basis last month from August 2016, when they fell 0.9%, according to the . Meanwhile the EEF manufacturers＊ organisation said there was rising demand for goods made in Britain from Europe and the rest of the world. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: ※August provided a welcome pick-up in retail sales across channels, with non-food returning to growth as shoppers＊ attentions turned to homewares, autumn clothing ranges and the new school term.§Over the three months to August, food sales increased 1.8% on a like-for-like basis, as growth in other sales increased 0.6%. Children＊s clothing helped drive the growth in non-food sales as school＊s return from the summer break, while the strengthened home improvement sales. However, the healthy retail figures obscure the fact that food sales are growing only as a consequence of rising prices, as the overall number of products sold was weaker than last year. Non-food sales have recently recovered to levels seen two years ago, after a dismal August in 2016. There was also according to the Office for National Statistics. The slump in the pound 每 by more than 16% since the EU referendum last summer 每 has led to higher prices on the high street as the cost of goods imported from overseas increases on a relative basis. That has pushed inflation to 2.6%, outstripping the growth in earnings and putting pressure on household spending. The weakness in sterling is a shot in the arm for , as goods made in Britain become cheaper for buyers overseas. A poll of 416 companies by the EEF found an improving eurozone economy was leading to more export orders in the three months to the end of September. The survey found the balance of firms reporting an increase in export orders has mounted to 33%, from a drop of 2% in the final three months of 2016. Factory gate output and future orders were found to be in positive territory, lifted by demand at home and abroad. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, said: ※Exporting companies are capitalising on growth in the world economy 每 Europe in particular. That＊s encouraging buyers of manufactured goods everywhere, and UK is helping those supply chains, helped by the weak pound.§Economic confidence is at its  where GDP is growing at twice the rate of the UK at 0.6%. The European commission＊s measure of sentiment increased to 111.9 in August, its highest since July 2007, just before the financial crisis.Despite positive signals from recent surveys, manufacturers＊ contribution to GDP growth has proved elusive in recent months. Output from the industry fell by 0.6% in the second quarter, according to the ONS, having only expanded by 0.3% in the first three months of the year.Manufacturers＊ investment plans are also failing to keep pace with their order books, as uncertainty over Brexit discourages them from putting money into their operations. Hopley said uncertainty over Brexit could hit firms over the next 12 months. ※It is vital the government sends a signal to industry and investors in the UK and overseas that it is doing everything in its power to get growth of the UK economy back on the agenda,§ she said.

"s  celebrates Labor Day by proposing to slash taxes for CEOs such as himself, it may come as a shock that a president who was previously best known for firing people on TV might not have been completely sincere in his promise to put ※American workers first§.And like most things he says, it＊s hard to tell what that＊s supposed to mean. This is the same man who, as a candidate, said US workers＊ salaries were ※too high§, something even the most reactionary politician knows not to say out loud.So when he proclaims that ※§, the fact that this statement is demonstrably false is beside the point: as a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies shows, the job growth rate for corporations that paid the least amount in taxes over the past eight years , compared to 6% for the private sector as a whole; businesses for the most part spent tax breaks not on job creation but on stock buybacks and executive pay.It＊s also beside the point whether Trump actually believes corporate tax cuts benefit workers. They benefit him, and the people he goes golfing with, and that＊s all that matters. This is a president who embodies rent-seeking at its purest.Consider the Department of Labor, an otherwise low-profile department targeted in Trump＊s budget proposal for a 21% funding cut, the largest of any federal agency after the Environmental Protection Agency and State Department. The Department of Labor is known mostly for enforcing overtime and minimum wage rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and probably wouldn＊t be on Trump＊s radar were it not for the fact that it has hit his businesses for failing to pay workers.Trump＊s original pick to run the department, Carl＊s Jr CEO Andy Puzder, shared with Trump a long list of FLSA violations; his fast food business is one of the worst offenders in an industry well known for ripping off workers. Under Puzder＊s replacement, Alex Acosta, the Department of Labor has taken measures to ensure deadbeat employers will go unpunished. These include ending a policy holding businesses responsible for violations committed by subcontractors, rescinding disclosure requirements for law firms engaging in union busting, overturning rules to prevent companies from misclassifying employees as independent contractors (making them ineligible for overtime, unemployment insurance and workers compensation), and excluding many workers from overtime by lowering the disqualifying income threshold former president Barack Obama had raised from just over $23,000 to $47,000.The Trump Department of Labor has also taken steps to hobble the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an agency established by Richard Nixon whose workplace safety mission isn＊t normally an area of partisan contestation. Nevertheless,  from lung disease caused by exposure to silica and beryllium, barred union representatives from certain health and safety inspections and, in a petty but symbolic move, erased a tally of deaths from workplace accidents from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration website.The Department of Labor isn＊t the only arena for Trump＊s assault on workers. He has overturned Obama-era executive orders requiring federal contractors to disclose labour and safety violations, and companies to disclose race and gender pay gaps; equal pay for women had been one of Ivanka Trump＊s personal causes until it suddenly wasn＊t. And at the Supreme Court, Trump＊s solicitor general made the highly unusual move of switching sides in a case on whether companies could force workers to sign mandatory arbitration agreements and thereby lose their right to file class action lawsuits; the Trump administration chose to argue against its own agency, which had found this to be a violation of workers＊ rights. Trump＊s most lasting legacy for workers is likely to be his Supreme Court pick, , who is poised to be the deciding vote in a case that will financially cripple public sector unions and speed the slow death of organised labour in the US.It＊s hard to imagine a more anti-worker agenda from any president, much less one claiming the mantle of champion of the American worker. Yet despite this record, Trump continues to show up at factories wearing a hardhat and taking credit for saving jobs that have already been shipped overseas. To say he＊s done nothing wouldn＊t be a fair assessment. It＊s just nothing he promised workers, who were sold a president who would repeal the North American Free Trade Agreement and stand up to China, and instead got their overtime and workers comp taken away. The business term for this is bait and switch. It＊s a practice Trump knows well. As a businessman, he promised to pay his workers, contractors and creditors, and frequently didn＊t. He isn＊t the first president to get elected pledging to run Washington like he runs his business. But at least, in this regard, he was the most honest. "															
"Britain＊s construction industry is taking on fewer workers amid a slowdown in commercial work, as economic uncertainty puts projects on hold. Growth in the construction sector fell unexpectedly to a one-year low in August, the closely watched  for the industry showed on Monday. The gauge of economic activity fell to 51.1 last month from 51.9 in July, pointing to marginal expansion. fifty indicates stagnation, while anything below signals contraction. The figures show the construction sector ※flirting with another recession§, according to Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy. There could be a worse outlook if limited progress in the Brexit talks forced large firms to consider relocating activities to . Numerous banks from HSBC to Goldman Sachs have suggested they could move staff.※If, as we expect, Brexit negotiations continue to progress slowly, more firms will activate  contingency plans, freeing up office space and sapping demand for new commercial projects,§ Tombs said.Only robust housebuilding activity kept the industry growing in August, as civil engineering work was close to stagnation and commercial building dropped at the fastest pace since July 2016. The subdued demand was linked to a lack of new work following completed projects, as heightened economic uncertainty puts projects on hold. That has led employment numbers to rise at the slowest pace since July 2016.Duncan Brock of Cips (the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply), which helps to compile the survey, said: ※Reduced government spending, economic uncertainty and Brexit-delayed decision-making among clients were largely to blame.§The poor results suggest the construction sector will contribute little, if anything, to  in the three months to the end of September. Firms are also bracing for the soft patch to continue into the autumn, according to the survey, as fragile confidence among firms contributes to weaker trends for job creation.The figures come after a recent slide in the value of sterling, adding . That could push inflation higher, raising pressure on the Bank of England to consider tackling the climb through the use of higher interest rates. The weak survey also comes after the , especially in London. The overall UK annual increase is about 5% in the first half of the year. However, there is support for house prices from low levels of unemployment 每 at the lowest point since the mid 1970s 每 and from rockbottom interest rates keeping mortgage costs low. The construction data also failed to mimic a , which showed the potential for robust production over the coming months. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at trading firm IG, said: ※Unfortunately, given the current trajectory, it seems like a strong possibility that we could see the construction sector move back into contraction in the coming months.§"															
"ichael Saunders surprised many when he voted in June for the  to increase interest rates.The former Citigroup economist, who joined the Bank＊s nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) last year as one of the four external members, warned that the UK economy was performing well enough for inflation to become a challenge. The response, he said, should be a  for businesses and households.Within days he encountered a distinct problem. Official figures showed inflation falling back. Over the summer the annual rise in  (CPI) declined from a peak of 2.9% to 2.6%. Worse was to come. Consumer and business confidence data showed both groups were becoming more nervous about the future.Later, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed  from its miserable performance in the first quarter. It was stuck in the slow lane, only inching higher from 0.2% in the first three months of 2017 to 0.3% in the second.Surely the gloomy data was a humiliating blow to Saunders＊ forecasting prowess. He reckoned inflation was heading upwards to 3% and possibly beyond. The hard facts pointed in the opposite direction.Undaunted, he voted again on 3 August for a 0.25 percentage point rise.A speech on Thursday in Cardiff provided Saunders with the perfect platform for an admission that he had mistimed his interest rate call. But far from it. He maintained his warning, claiming that the fall in inflation was temporary and it was still in danger of becoming entrenched. His explanation centred on three things that would force employers to hike pay rates. First, that unemployment would stay low despite  jitters. Second, that a flight of EU nationals back across the channel would restrict the supply of labour, putting upward pressure on wages. Third, he pointed to studies that showed most workers are unwilling to take on more hours.It is true that some industries are already screaming for skilled staff. The construction industry is certainly under pressure to find people to fill the holes left by departing Polish and Lithuanian workers.As for evidence that the impact is feeding through to the broader economy. There isn＊t much more to go on. At the moment the only harm to the economy flows from the EU referendum. In the first instance there was the . A year after the vote, businesses remain reluctant to buy new equipment or expand capacity.Subsequently, the low pound pushed up the cost of imported goods, hitting disposable incomes. Saunders probably feels safe from criticism after his colleague Ian McCafferty joined him in calling for a rise and the Banks＊ governor, Mark Carney, almost went as far, hinting that a tougher regime might be necessary before the end of the year. Andy Haldane, Threadneedle Street＊s chief economist, was another to say he could envisage a base rate of 0.5% before Christmas.Which leaves us to ponder the forecasting prowess of the MPC as a whole. It beggars belief that while the government maintains its austerity drive and businesses consider the known unknowns thrown up by the Brexit talks, why the central bank would withdraw just about the only support the economy has from an agency of the state.Carney and his team do themselves little credit when they talk about raising rates and winding down quantitative easing while the status quo persists. If they urged the government to push ahead with  and higher pay for nurses and teachers as a way to stimulate the economy, allowing the Bank to withdraw its own, that would make sense. But while the UK resembles a hospital patient on heavy medication, albeit out of intensive care, withdrawing the only stimulant that still works would surely be negligent."															
"Britain needs higher interest rates to prevent inflation from heading back towards 3% and staying there for several years, according to , one of the two dissenting Bank of England rate-setters to vote for a rise earlier this month.Saunders said the UK economy was able to withstand the impact of higher credit costs after a  that paved the way for an increase in wages and higher prices in shops.In a speech to business leaders in Cardiff, Saunders said he recognised that  uncertainties weighed on consumer and business confidence, but warned that the decreasing number of migrant workers, which was already affecting some industries, would add to the pressure to raise wages.※We do not need to be putting the brakes on so much that the economy weakens sharply,§ he said. ※But our foot no longer needs to be quite so firmly on the accelerator in my view. A modest rise in rates would help ensure a sustainable return of inflation to target over time.§Saunders is one of eight members of the monetary policy committee, having joined last year from the investment bank Citigroup.Earlier this month, the MPC said Brexit uncertainties had  from awarding pay rises as it warned that rising prices and weak wage growth would continue to  this year.The committee voted 6-2 to leave official borrowing costs at their , but it hinted that rates would have to rise over the coming year to keep inflation in check.Since the vote,  from a recent peak of 2.9% to 2.6%, and a string of business and consumer confidence surveys have shown households and business leaders expecting a more gloomy outlook for the economy.Saunders said: ※There are considerable advantages to acting early enough to allow a gradual rise in interest rates. It is fully 10 years since the MPC last tightened monetary policy. ※Overall, balance sheets are much less fragile than 10 years ago, with lower debt to income ratios and higher levels of liquidity among companies and households. Banks have much stronger capital positions.※A sizeable net balance of consumers, especially those with a mortgage, already expect interest rates to rise in the year ahead and hence have presumably incorporated this in spending decisions. So I do not expect a modest rise in rates will have a disproportionate effect on spending. ※Nevertheless, many borrowers have never faced a rate hike. It would be preferable to have the space to move gradually, observing the effects as we go. If we get behind the curve, we lose that space.§"															
															
"Philip Hammond would need to spend an extra ?33bn a year to ※end austerity§ according to a leading tax and spending watchdog.The  (IFS) said the chancellor could use his autumn budget to reverse major cuts scheduled to hit public spending and still keep the government＊s spending deficit at 2.4% of GDP by 2021.To meet a target of balancing the budget in the middle of the next decade, the IFS warned that the Treasury would need to return to its spending squeeze if the economy, as expected, only grows modestly in the aftermath of leaving the European Union, limiting the growth of tax receipts. The analysis has been released as ministers prepare to battle with the chancellor to protect their departments before the autumn budget.The chancellor has warned that government finances remain vulnerable in the event of another financial shock and the Treasury＊s task must remain to bring down the deficit over the next parliament.Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said: ※An ＆end to austerity＊ 每 as defined by no further net tax rises, benefit cuts or cuts to spending on public services 每 would require a very sharp change of direction. ※It would imply a ?17bn boost to planned spending on public services alongside a ?5bn net tax cut and an ?11bn increase in planned benefit spending 每 ie a giveaway of ?33bn a year. [That] would, on current forecasts, leave us with a deficit at its current level 每 2.4% of GDP 每 in 2021-22.§Emmerson said relaxing the spending squeeze was ※an option in a way that it was not an option back in 2010§. But he warned that it would leave the chancellor with ※less room for manoeuvre§ if growth stalled as a result of Brexit.Revisions to figures for the public deficit, which soared to 9.9% of national income in 2009-10 after the financial crisis, have shown it fell to 2.4% last year and is the lowest it has been since 2003-04. Labour has argued that a deficit of 2.4% is low enough to continue to bring down the overall debt-to-GDP ratio.Emmerson, who unveiled his analysis at the Institute for Government in London, appeared to agree when he said: ※We could choose to continue to run deficits of around the current level over the longer term. If the economy were to grow as expected, this would be sufficient to see debt fall as a share of national income over the longer term.※It would mean that over the next few years household incomes could be better supported and a greater quality and quantity of public services could be enjoyed. But it would also involve planning to live with elevated public sector debt for longer.※It could give the chancellor less room for manoeuvre if the economy were to suffer badly, for Brexit-related or other reasons, over the next few years. And it would almost certainly require the abandonment of the pledge to eliminate the deficit in the mid-2020s.§"															
															
"The economist Christopher Colclough, who has died aged 70 of cancer, did much to shape the course of education in developing countries. In 1982, he assembled a range of hard evidence to show that primary education does more for economic development than secondary or higher education. An article he wrote for the World Bank showed how, in the developing world, primary education brought productivity benefits for work in the informal sector (the very small-scale operations that can be important for poor communities) and smallholder agricultural production. In addition, by improving literacy and numeracy, primary education contributes to wider social and economic life, through better health, nutrition and birth spacing.His paper played a key part in shifting aid-supported education programmes away from secondary and higher education towards the primary level 每 a shift undertaken by the World Bank, the Overseas Development Administration (now the Department for International Development or DfID) and other donor governments over the following years. This helped set the stage for the first global UN Education for All Conference, held in Jomtien, Thailand, in 1990, at which 155 governments and supporting NGOs made commitments for expanding primary education, so that all girls and boys would have one.Christopher＊s strategy paper for the conference, co-authored with Keith Lewin and published in 1993 as Educating All the Children: Strategies for Primary Schooling in the South, documented the practical possibilities of achieving universal primary provision, even in poorer countries with severe budgetary constraints.Between 1993 and 2000, he undertook a long-term policy advisory role in South . Working initially with the ANC until transition, and then with the new post-apartheid ministry, he helped design a new framework for education, moving from a system with excessive expenditure allocated to the schooling of white children to one of equal subsidies for all. The essential features of this new school financing policy are retained to this day.In 2002 he was appointed by Unesco as founding director of the Education for All global monitoring report. Education was by then high on the agenda of international development. In 2000, world leaders had pledged at a conference in Dakar, and as part of the millenium development goals, to provide education for all, with gender equality, by 2015. The global monitoring report became the main instrument for holding governments and agencies to account for the commitments they had made. The findings of Education for All: Is the World on Track? received front-page treatment in the press of some 160 countries.In part, this outreach was the result of Christopher insisting that the report be free of jargon and UN bureaucratic censorship, negotiating right up to Unesco＊s director-general that he alone should be responsible for its content and conclusions. The next two global reports 每 Gender and Education for All: The Leap to Equality (2003) and Education for All: The Quality Imperative (2004) 每 were equally bold.In 2005 Christopher was appointed professor of the economics of education at Cambridge University, and director of a new research centre for Commonwealth education. At the core of this was a research consortium on education outcomes and poverty. His own contribution had a significant influence on DfID aid policy between 2008 and 2013. He provided the technical analysis and the evidence base for a substantial increase in UK aid for education. A 10-year pledge to provide ?8.5bn to support education, announced by the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the secretary of state for international development, Hilary Benn, in 2006, was described by Benn as ※DfID at its best§.Christopher＊s writings set education within the broader context of wages and employment, incomes policy, human resources planning, public sector pay and alternatives to structural economic adjustment. States or Markets? (1991) attracted attention towards the end of the Thatcher era, arguing that for practical policy the choice should never be state or market but a more judicious balancing of each, requiring careful analysis in relation to country and context.Born in Glossop, Derbyshire, Christopher was the son of Frederick, a primary school headteacher, and his wife, Margaret (nee McMellon), a music teacher, pianist and organist. From Chetham＊s school, Manchester, he went to Bristol University, where he studied economics and philosophy, and won the Powesland memorial prize in economics. He later gained a diploma in development economics and a doctorate at Cambridge University. After working in Botswana in the Ministry of Finance and Development (1971-75), he was appointed a fellow at the Institute of Development Studies of Sussex University, where he became a professorial fellow in 1994.Tall, with piercing blue eyes and an open friendly manner, Christopher was known for being warm and collegial, supportive of students and an authoritative chair and leader of debates. He combined intellectual acuity with a deep humanity in his continual advocacy of the need for education for all the world＊s children. He was both a talented pianist and cellist.He is survived by his wife, Sarah (nee Butler), whom he married in 1992, and their son, Giles.Christopher Louis Colclough, development economist, born 10 July 1946; died 28 June 2017"															
															
", the transport secretary, has dampened hopes of an imminent lifting of the 1% public sector pay cap for teachers, police and prison officers, saying the issue was a matter for future budgets.He said a decision on the future of the cap would be taken collectively by the cabinet at the next budget in the autumn, despite signals from some senior Tories 每 including Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, Justine Greening and Jeremy Hunt 每 that they would like to see a quicker easing of the controls.Speaking to BBC Radio 4＊s Today programme, Grayling acknowledged there had been divisions within the cabinet over the issue, as they were ※not all clones§.

The exact reverse is true.※Giving up on sound finances isn＊t being generous, it＊s being selfish: spending money today that you may need tomorrow.§Hammond has also challenged those who want the pay cap lifted to consider how they would make the argument for higher taxes or spending cuts to pay for an easing of the cap. On Monday, he urged his party to ※hold its nerve§, arguing that borrowing piles debt on to the next generation.He has said growth was the only sustainable way to boost public spending in the long run, although sources suggest he is ready to talk about ways to raise money to loosen the ties of austerity over the coming months.One senior Treasury figure said despite that, things would continue to be financially constrained in the run-up to Brexit. Raising public sector pay in line with inflation at 2.9% would cost about ?6bn a year."															
															
"hat Helmut Kohl, the man who oversaw the reunification of Germany and was for so long a giant on the European stage, should  leading to Britain＊s withdrawal from the EU seems symbolic. The former German chancellor made the best of the extraordinary circumstances and public mood that followed the collapse of communism and the opening up of eastern Europe.Today＊s European leaders are, by contrast, confronted with an especially adverse set of circumstances. Trump, Putin, Erdo?an, terrorism, unprecedented flows of migration, unemployment, the rise of populism and, of course, Brexit. But, just as Kohl and his French contemporary Fran?ois Mitterrand relaunched the European project in the early 1990s,  are, as Britain prepares to leave, readying their ambitions and vision for the continent.At stake is no less than Europe＊s role in defending liberal democratic values and a rules-based international order at a time when 每 as one former Obama administration official put it to me recently 每 Trump＊s America is ※missing in action and the UK is disappearing into oblivion§. The words may be harsh, but they underscore that Britain＊s central weakness lies not only in its internal political confusion 每 but also with a dangerous ignorance of what its European neighbours are setting their?sights on.The Franco-German engine is not focusing on  but rather on consolidating the 60-year-old European project through further integration and cooperation. At the heart of this stands an emerging Macron-Merkel deal, intended to act as Europe＊s new powerhouse. On 15 May, the French and German leaders met and spoke of a new ※roadmap§ for the EU. The thinking goes like this: in the next two to three years, as France carries out structural economic reforms to boost its credibility, Germany will step up much-needed European financial solidarity and investment mechanisms, and embrace a new role on foreign policy, security and defence.For Britain, being aware of the wider European context should be an important part of assessing options. The sobering fact, from Britain＊s perspective, is that however important a challenge Brexit may represent, it is hardly the sole topic other Europeans are focused on. Brexit is not their obsession, but a British one. Continentals mostly see it as a tedious burden whose outcome can only be bad for everyone so the task is about limiting damage.Outside Britain, the mood in the EU is on the upswing. . Unemployment in the eurozone is at its lowest since 2009 (but still at 9.5%). Growth has returned. Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, speaks of ※a solid and broad recovery§. Populist forces have suffered political defeats, in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Italy?and Finland.Across the continent, citizens＊ support for the EU is on the rise, according to Eurobarometer surveys. Polls show Europeans are increasingly in favour of a ※multiple speed§ or ※flexible§ EU, in which ad hoc groups of member states would forge ahead with new projects. For all the headlines about a populist movement eating away at the EU＊s foundations, it seems all the shockwaves the continent has felt in recent years have brought a renewed sense of belonging, and an appetite for better, if not more, integration.To be clear: this is not thanks to Brexit, but despite it. Strengthening the EU project and opening up horizons is what Germany, France and the European commission are intensely working on. To believe that Europeans are gloating, or cynically happy to capitalise on Brexit, is to fall into a Trump-like vision of a zero-sum world in which one side＊s gain is the other＊s loss. When occasional continental voices claim they relish the thought of Brexit, be sure there is more provocation at play than sound appreciation of the meaning of the process, or of its consequences.The point is that the EU has turned a corner, and feels more confident. It wants to develop its capacities to act internationally beyond its borders 每 not just perpetually fix its internal problems. It has no other choice, because of its geopolitical environment. Some of this predates the Brexit?referendum.A  is now being discussed, notably for joint procurement efforts (but don＊t expect a European army to emerge). Also, there is talk of setting up a European Monetary Fund, and increasing investments for job creation.One German official told me his country was undergoing ※a sea change§ because public opinion had come around to the view that ※Europe should take on more responsibility§ if the US retreated. This was not to say, he quickly added, that Merkel should be seen as the leader of the west or a new embodiment of the Statue of Liberty 每 she herself has called that ※absurd§. But in recent discussions with European experts and officials, I heard the following comment: ※A golden decade may be dawning for .§ A new narrative is in the air.There are many caveats, no doubt. Anxieties are rife about Italian banks, for example. Resistance in Germany＊s finance ministry about anything that may weigh on German taxpayers has by no means gone away. Germany＊s role in security and defence still stirs gruelling domestic debates 每 even as the country deploys troops in Lithuania as part of Nato＊s deterrence of Russia. Much will depend on the outcome of German elections in September. The populist wave in Europe may have ebbed, but it hasn＊t disappeared, nor all the factors that fuelled it. Brexit will be time consuming and will take up huge amounts of energy.Still, the scenario of a European reawakening shouldn＊t be discarded 每 especially not in Britain, as it heads for a wrenching exit. With Trump and Brexit, Europe now has a role in defending values and international institutions in a way that was ※unprecedented§, insists a former Obama official. ※Europe needs to hold the fort, as long as Trump remains in office. It＊s Europe＊s moment.§A Luxembourg foreign minister once infamously proclaimed that 1992 would be ※the hour of Europe§. The expression drew bitter irony as Europe dismally failed to put an end to the human catastrophe in the former Yugoslavia. But 1992 was also the year when, under Kohl and Mitterrand＊s guidance, the  transformed the European Economic Community into a formal union. The real emphasis in Europe, 25 years on, is not on Brexit or breakups, but on how, in a shifting world, the EU can acquire new, indispensable significance.Just as Kohl and Mitterrand seized the opportunities that history presented to them, Merkel and Macron are, in different circumstances, identifying their path towards a common European endeavour. After a decade of crisis, Europe may now be pulling out of it. More British awareness of this might help avert bad choices."															
"The UK economy was the worst performer in the  in the opening months of 2017 as the Brexit vote took its toll, according to official statistics that underscore the challenge facing the next British government.With economic growth , the UK was well behind its European neighbours. Official EU  released as Britons went to the polls on Thursday showed the growth for the whole of the EU was 0.6% in the first quarter. The eurozone single currency bloc also grew 0.6% in the opening quarter, buoyed by strong domestic demand.The Eurostat figures showed every nation in the 28-member bloc reported first-quarter GDP figures growing faster than the UK. The strongest expansion was in Romania at 1.7%, followed by Latvia at 1.6% and Slovenia at 1.5%. The closest countries to the UK＊s weak pace of growth were France and Greece, with GDP growing 0.4% in both.However, in year-on-year terms the UK was closer to the EU performance and ahead of the 19-nation eurozone. After a strong second half to 2016, when the economy defied predictions of a post-referendum slump, UK GDP was still 2% bigger in the first quarter of 2017 than a year earlier. The EU＊s economy was 2.1% bigger on the year while the eurozone was up 1.9%.Recent business surveys have  after its slow start to 2017. But with higher inflation , most forecasters  as a whole and even weaker in 2018. The main pressure is expected to come from higher inflation, stemming largely from the pound＊s sharp fall since the  vote last year. That has made the many imported goods to the UK more expensive and been passed on to consumers. Wages meanwhile have failed to keep pace with those price rises and so workers are worse off in real terms and have been cutting back.Prospects for the 19-nation eurozone, by contrast, have brightened. Political uncertainty has diminished now France＊s presidential election is out the way, unemployment has fallen, business surveys point to solid demand and a continuing recovery in the global economy could boost exports, economists say.The confirmation that the UK was the worst performer in the EU growth league in the first quarter follows news last week that it was also , with  registering stellar growth in the first three months of the year.The outlook for the UK was tough but stronger global prospects should provide some cheer, economists said. ※Brexit has been partly to blame for slower UK growth, as higher prices due to lower sterling and uncertainty hit retail spending and the willingness of firms to invest,§ said George Buckley, economist at the financial firm Nomura.※But it＊s not all bad news 每 this is as much a story about global strength as it is about downside risks to the UK, which should eventually support exports§The European Central Bank was the latest body to raise its growth forecasts for the eurozone on Thursday after telling financial markets it had no plans to cut interest rates. ECB president Mario Draghi said growth was now expected to come in at 1.9% in 2017, up from the 1.8% forecast made in March. The outlook for 2018 was nudged up to 1.8% growth, from 1.7%. ※We consider that the risks to the growth outlook are now broadly balanced,§ said Draghi, dropping a previous assertion that risks were skewed to the downside.Draghi said the risk of deflation 每 or persistently falling prices 每 in the eurozone had dissipated. But at the same time, inflation was not showing much sign of picking up and the ECB toned down its inflation forecasts for this year, 2018 and 2019.That suggested policymakers would be in no hurry to withdraw the stimulus they have been providing to the eurozone after the global financial crash of 2008-9 and the eurozone debt crisis of 2012. That , includes printing electronic money to buy bonds and record low interest rates. Some rates are below zero, meaning people effectively pay to deposit money."															
															
"Growth forecasts revised up. Inflation forecasts revised down. Jobs being created. Take a bow Mario Draghi. Urged on by its proactive boss, the  has achieved what looked impossible until recently: it has got the eurozone economy moving again.Draghi should milk the applause while he can because the eurozone＊s sweet spot won＊t last for ever. It didn＊t in the US and it didn＊t in the UK, two countries that pursued exactly the same macro-economic strategy as the ECB, only earlier.Like the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, the ECB has cut interest rates to the bone and cranked up the electronic printing presses. Moreover, Draghi plans to continue with the current plan for some time to come. True, the  decided that further interest rate cuts were no longer on the agenda and that the risks to the economic outlook were balanced rather than tilted to the downside.But there was not the remotest suggestion that borrowing costs were going to rise, nor that the ECB＊s quantitative easing programme would end 每 or even be tapered away 每 any time soon. Draghi wants to make absolutely sure that the recovery is assured and inflation is closer to its target before taking his foot off the pedal. Again, this follows the example of the Fed and the .No question, the ECB is in a far better place than it was this time five years ago, when the economy was dipping in and out of recession, unemployment was rising and there were real fears that Italy and Spain would be the next dominoes to fall in Europe＊s debt crisis. The fact that they weren＊t was due to Draghi＊s insistence in July 2012 that the ECB would do to defend the euro.It is clear, however, that ultra-low interest rates and QE are generating the same sort of labour market recovery as in the US and the UK: 5 million jobs have been created in the past three and a half years in the eurozone, but as Draghi admitted on Thursday many of them are low quality, part-time or temporary posts. That＊s why falling unemployment is not being accompanied by higher wages, and it is also why underlying inflation remains weak. Ultra loose monetary policy can only do so much: it is a painkiller not a cure. "															
"Major financial firms will have traders and analysts stationed at their desks by 10pm on Thursday, in time for the exit polls which will give first indication of the result of the snap general election.With the market positioned for a Conservative victory, any early sign that Theresa May＊s party will loosen its grip on parliament will spark a market reaction. The pound will move first, as it trades round the clock in the 24-hour foreign exchange market. But shares and and government bonds will also be jolted as their markets open on Friday morning.Investors were surprised when May called the election on 18 April, with the  while sterling rallied, but most commentators expected the Tories would win convincingly, with some predicting a landslide. ※A somewhat unimpressive campaign from the Conservatives, plus a better showing from [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn than had been expected, have combined to make this campaign more of a contest than was likely six weeks ago,§ said analysts at financial firm IG. ※Nonetheless it is clear that, barring a Brexit or Trump-style surprise, Theresa May will be returning to Downing Street at PM on Friday morning.§After a flurry of activity when the exit poll is published, there will be a lull until the first seats are called. Analysts will be looking at the size of the Conservative majority in parliament - it is currently 17 seats - to determine any market moves, while a hung parliament or Labour victory would cause a more dramatic reaction.As the markets are expecting the Conservatives to win, analysts at ING reckon the party＊s majority would need to increase if the pound is to move sharply from its current level of just below $1.30.  ※We need to see a Conservative majority of at least 50 to get a significant move higher§ in the pound, according to analysts at Dutch bank ING. A survey of economists by Bloomberg suggests sterling will rise to $1.3100 if the Conservatives achieve a large majority. Movement in the stock market is likely to be linked to sterling. Since the vote for Brexit, the FTSE 100 has been bolstered by the weaker pound as this benefits the international companies in the index. Analysts at JP Morgan, though, reckon the index could rise by as much as 2% despite stronger sterling on relief that the Conservatives have secured victory.The political ramifications for Brexit negotiations will also be scrutinised. Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital , points to rumours of a cabinet reshuffle in the event of a strong victory for May. This could include Ben Gummer moving to the Brexit department. ※Given that Gummer campaigned to ＆remain＊, this might perhaps soften the government＊s stance somewhat in negotiations,§ said Hollingsworth.This could spark expectations that May will not survive as leader of the Conservative Party. Stefan Kreuzkamp, chief investment officer at Deutsche Asset Management, said: ※Tory losses of the sort  could fatally undermine the position of May as prime minister and party leader. Tory infighting could then easily result in a hard Brexit candidate taking over, increasing the risk of a Brexit with no alternative arrangement in place.§Kathleen Brooks, research director at financial firm City Index, agreed that a slim majority will ※arouse fears of a hard Brexit§. ※This could spook sterling traders,§ she said, calculating the pound could fall towards $1.25 每 the level it was trading at before the election was called.But others take a different view, calculating that a weakened Conservative party could soften Brexit as it would require more political compromise between the parties. The Bloomberg poll reflects these differences, showing a sterling rally 每 to $1.3025.※All hell could break loose metaphorically speaking, at least at first,§ said Berenberg＊s senior UK economist, Kallum PickerinThe Bloomberg poll puts sterling at $1.2350 in this scenario.Brooks points to a delay the Brexit negotiations, which she said could drive the pound to $1.20.※In this scenario we would expect a sharp drop in the pound and the FTSE 100. While we would expect the FTSE 100 to recover in the short term, we could see ?/$ fall back towards 1.20,§ she said. ※Sterling has been the conduit through which traders have expressed concern over Brexit, thus we would expect the pound to suffer the most if there is no clear winner,§ she said.Guy Foster, head of research at Brewin Dolphin, said the FTSE 100 could benefit as the international companies in the index will benefit from the pound＊s weakness. Hollingsworth at Capital Economics reckons the index may not sustain its rally, though. ※We are not convinced that equity prices would continue to rise, given the political uncertainty,§ said Hollingsworth.In this scenario, Bloomberg＊s poll predicts sterling would reach $1.2484. Brooks expects an initial decline in sterling and in UK share prices ※on the back of investor fears about Jeremy Corbyn＊s leftwing agenda§, but she reckons that in the longer term the markets should have little to fear. ※Stock market gains under a Labour government aren＊t unheard of ... under Tony Blair＊s premiership, the FTSE 100 rallied nearly 50%,§ she said.Pledges  that energy companies will be taken back into public ownership, the privatisation of Royal Mail will be reversed and a consultation will take place on breaking up Royal Bank of Scotland may rattle the stock market. Labour also wants to increase corporation tax to 26% in 2020 from 19%, which could also knock sentiment on the stock market.But currency experts at Dutch bank ING see some support for sterling. They said: ※If a credible Labour-led coalition can be formed quickly, then we are likely to see markets price in greater odds of a softer Brexit deal and this could arguably help the pound recover from any initial sell-off. From the currency＊s perspective, this channel is likely to outweigh any questions over Labour＊s economic policies.§Hollingsworth reckons there would be a reaction in government bonds, known as gilts, because of expectations that Labour would loosen fiscal policy. Gilt yields 每 which move inversely to price 每 could rise from their low levels, according to analysts at JP Morgan."															
"Industrial output shrank more than expected and the trade deficit widened in March in the latest signs that uncertainty surrounding  is beginning to weigh on the economy.Industrial output dropped by 0.5% in March, sharper than the 0.3% fall predicted by economists. It followed a 0.7% fall in February and brought the sector to a virtual standstill in the first quarter overall, with growth of just 0.1%, according to the  figures.Production was dragged lower as warmer-than-average temperatures led to a 4.2% fall in energy supply, and manufacturing also fell unexpectedly by 0.6% in March. Economists said the weak data made it unlikely that the ONS would revise up its first estimate of growth for the first quarter overall, .UK growth has been heavily dependent on consumer spending since the financial crisis, but economists believe households will begin to rein in spending in response to falling real pay, as inflation outpaces wage growth.The services sector, which includes hotels and restaurants, was the first major part of the economy to surpass pre-crisis levels of output. Construction followed, but industrial production and manufacturing have yet to fully recover, with output still below pre-crisis levels.Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said it was ※a ropey set of March data for the UK economy that point to a poor end to a disappointing first quarter§.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) estimates that the pace of economic growth slowed to 0.2% in the three months ending in April, from 0.3% in the three months ending in March.※Growth in the service sector has remained subdued, consistent with softer consumer spending growth. We expect the squeeze on household real incomes to continue as inflation accelerates throughout the year, reaching almost 3.5% by year end,§ said Rebecca Piggott, research fellow at NIESR.The thinktank expects annual growth to slow to 1.7% in 2017, from 1.8% in 2016, before picking up to 1.9% in 2018.The broad services and goods deficit jumped to ?4.9bn in March from ?2.6bn in February according to separate figures from the ONS. Meanwhile, the trade in goods deficit widened to ?13.4bn, more than the ?11.8bn economists had been expecting.The figures suggested the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the  vote did little to boost exports in March, despite making British goods cheaper abroad.Instead there was a surge in imports, up ?2.9bn over the month, with an increase in imports of goods from both EU and non-EU countries. The main drivers were greater volumes of imported machinery and transport equipment 每 mainly cars 每 as well as oils and chemicals. Exports increased by just ?600m.Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, called the March trade figures ※simply dreadful§.The British Chambers of Commerce said that while the weaker pound was helping to make UK exporters more price competitive, they were also being hit by the rising costs of raw materials.※As the UK moves through the Brexit process and beyond, it is vital that more is done to provide greater practical assistance for exporters, including developing an expanded trade mission and fairs programme and funding front-line, face-to-face support for exporters to help get UK businesses trading with the world,§ said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the BCC.A 0.7% fall in construction output in March added to the raft of weaker-than-expected data and reinforced fears that the UK economy is facing a renewed slowdown, as uncertainty about Britain＊s future outside the UK takes hold.Michael Thirkettle, chief executive at construction and property consultancy McBains Cooper, said the ONS figures provided the latest evidence of a slowdown in the sector as concerns over Brexit hit the construction industry.※Whoever wins [the general election] on 8 June, Brexit will occupy much of the government＊s focus over the next two years, and consequently there will be continuing caution from the private and corporate sectors in construction. Yet the industry needs the opposite 每 some bold moves and big investments 每 if it is to produce sustained growth any time soon.§ He said that any party pledges to increase housebuilding and address Britain＊s housing crisis would be hollow unless they were backed by concerted action to address skills shortages and increase access to finance."															
"Labour＊s plan to could boost educational performance but would risk damaging the economy＊s long-term growth prospects, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said. of one of Jeremy Corbyn＊s flagship policies shows that reversing the government＊s planned cuts to schools＊ budgets would be comfortably paid for by the extra revenue raised by increasing the main rate of corporation tax to 26%.Under current Conservative plans, spending per pupil in England will be cut by 6.5% between 2015-16 and 2019-20 每 the first real-terms fall since the mid-1990s. The IFS said higher pension costs meant schools＊ budgets were likely to face an 8% reduction in total.Labour has proposed to reverse all real-terms cuts to date and then to maintain school spending per pupil in real terms at this new higher level. This would boost spending on schools by ?4.8bn as part of an education package worth ?8.4bn. Labour has previously pledged to , which the IFS has estimated will cost between ?700m and ?900m.Luke Sibieta, a research fellow at the IFS, said: ※These commitments would represent a significant increase in education spending and would leave the school sector insulated from cuts made to most other areas of public service spending. If this extra cash is used well, then it could make a positive difference to educational attainment.§Labour has said it would scrap government plans to cut corporation tax from 19% to 17% and instead raise the levy on profits for larger companies to 26% by 2020., but ※substantially less§ in the medium to long run because companies would respond to the higher tax rate by investing less in the UK.Helen Miller, the associate director of the IFS, said: ※Cuts to corporation tax have been one of the largest and most expensive policy changes since 2010. They have bought the UK a more competitive tax rate and are likely to boost economic activity in the medium to long run. Seventeen per cent 每 the rate due to be in place in 2020 under current plans 每 is not a magic number and raising corporation tax can bring in substantial sums in the short run.※But, as always, there are trade-offs. Were rates to be increased, the benefits of additional revenue would need to be weighed against any long-run effects on growth. We should always remember that all taxes are paid by people and that workers can feel the effect of corporation tax indirectly though lower wages.§The IFS said there was a very high degree of uncertainty about the impact of higher corporation tax on growth, jobs and wages but said it could be ※substantial§."															
"adies and gentlemen, it＊s time to clutch your privately owned pearls, for the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has had the audacity to acknowledge 每  每 that there is a lot to learn from Karl Marx. Judging by the horrified reaction McDonnell＊s comments unleashed, you＊d think he had ridden into BBC studios on a Soviet tank, shouting ※Death to the bourgeoisie!§It doesn＊t end with McDonnell, of course. When Jeremy Corbyn was asked whether he was influenced by Marx＊s ideas, . And, of course, when Ed Miliband was leader of the Labour party, an intrepid reporter from the Daily Mail , by printing the ideas of the Marxist academic Ralph Miliband (Ed＊s father) that are already publicly available in books. No word from the Pulitzer prize board yet, but it＊s surely only a matter of time.If these histrionics are anything to go by, the respectable position must be that Marx＊s ideas are outdated and dangerous, and that we should all carry on as though they never existed. But if we depart from the juvenile intellectual dead zone that calls itself mainstream political discourse for a moment, we could observe the role his writing has played in upending the political direction of the entire world.Agree with him or not, his thought has had an unrivalled influence on not just politics, philosophy and economics, but art and media criticism, anthropology, sociology, theology and linguistics. Ignoring the impact of Marx on modern society is like saying Shakespeare has no relevance to English literature, or that biologists should be ashamed of reading Darwin. Only in the facile arena of modern politics would such idiocy be tolerated.The fact is that we can＊t understand capitalism without considering Marx, and perhaps this is why he was voted the  as part of a BBC poll in 1999. Marx＊s importance comes from the fact that he wasn＊t just the first to form a really complete understanding of how capitalism actually works; his analysis gave people the tools they needed to change it. And while the ruling class hasn＊t been overthrown, or private property eliminated, plenty of his proposals 每 just as radical when he wrote them 每 are common sense today. These include free education, abolition of child labour, a progressive income tax, a national bank, and closing the gap between town and countryside. What should John McDonnell do: swiftly promise to reinstate child labour to prove he＊s not a Marxist?I suppose this is the bit where I point out that Theresa May has , price controls being a key part of Soviet economic planning. Ed Miliband suggested the same thing when he was leader of the Labour party, to which David Cameron promptly responded by accusing him of living in a Marxist universe, something the Joseph McCarthy division of the British press was .But I＊m not going to suggest May is a closet Marxist, because the only thing more stupid than coming to that conclusion would be entering into a kind of political discourse that consists solely of accusing your opponent of being more communist than you are.Instead, let＊s talk about the fact that British wages have been flatlining for a decade 每 : ※I cannot stress how extraordinary and dreadful this is.§ Let＊s talk about the fact that a  is now going to landlords, rather than to wages. Let＊s talk about the fact that  are living in working households.This remarkable imbalance of power between labour and capital is the foundational problem Marx seeks to address in his writing. He suggested the solution was for workers to organise themselves into a class, overthrow their rulers and take control. To that end, it＊s not difficult to see why he＊s become something of a bete noire in public debate. Political figures and national newspapers are welcome to be scandalised every time his name his mentioned. But Marx was right that capitalism doesn＊t work for an awful lot of people. And this inconvenient fact cannot simply be wished away."															
"here he sits, flaunting his newly acquired curves. The curves of his new shed. Not any old shed. David Cameron has, of course, acquired a . I have no idea if a shepherd comes installed or you have to pay extra. The hut has been decorated by Sam Cam in the Farrow & Ball colours of Clunch, Rat＊s Arse and Obviously White because posh people can only use Farrow & Ball 每 they＊re afraid of colour so find the Traditional Neutrals range just scrummy. Cameron needs a writing room as he presumably doesn＊t have enough space in either of his houses. Sheds are now trendy. Man caves. Offices. Spare rooms. Who could begrudge a man a shed?Well, me, obviously. This is the man who decided to become prime minister for a while simply because he could. His government deliberately targeted some of the poorest people in the country in the name of paying off debts that they blamed on the previous government rather than the actions of their banker mates. Cameron also called a referendum on the EU, assuming he would win it easily, like everything else in his life. Now we are living with the consequences of that while he cogitates in a fake folksy ※hut§ in the Cotswolds.Remember when he was prime minister? Out of the 29 people in his cabinet, 18 were millionaires. Their combined wealth was estimated to be more than ?70m. George Osborne, with his huge trust fund, slashed benefits and made women and disabled people even worse off; now he walks into the editorship of a newspaper. Jeremy Hunt, who sold his Hot Courses company for ?30m, now tells the NHS to make ※efficiencies§ when its key workers repeatedly tell us the service is crumbling.So when Theresa May told Andrew Marr yesterday morning that nurses go to food banks for many  每 presumably far beyond poverty and hunger 每 there was a collective gasp.  means nurses＊ wages have actually gone down in recent years. Delays in benefit payments lead some people to visit food banks and sometimes they go for more than just food. Women need sanitary protection and basic toiletries. But May didn＊t get into any of that.May doesn＊t do the ※I feel your pain§ thing, while Cameron did masquerade a bovine empathy on occasion. But the attack on her for being robotic misses the point somehow 每 her denial of feeling is seen by some as strength. Feeling is weakness, but also, the implication now goes, poverty is weakness too. Cameron＊s government was successful at recasting poverty as a failure of morality (skivers). Being poor is shameful, stressful, often hidden and experienced as individual failure. To respond to all this by saying vague stuff about being anti-austerity never really works because it is a feeling, not a policy.In fact, poverty has been questioned and recast in all sorts of ways. After the Blairs left power and grabbed at everything, this was sometimes explained by Cherie as once having been poor; poverty was used to explain why they were necessarily so avaricious. Former Tory MP Edwina Currie recently questioned whether children in the UK could possibly be going hungry, on the basis that some children are fat.As we now move in the direction of being a one-party state, our leaders and former leaders are not only fabulously relaxed about vast wealth, they are unembarrassed by it. Yet in such a rich country we see rough sleepers, kids without a hot meal inside them. We hear tales of hunger, shame and stress, of many lives actually shortened by poverty.So the sight of Cameron chillaxing in his upmarket shed while May dissembles about food banks made one thing very clear. Not only are the Tories unembarrassed about vast wealth, they are unembarrassed about poverty. Shame on them and their faux folksy huts."															
" Britain＊s economy will surge back to life in the next six months following its slow start this year, a leading forecaster has predicted, prompting the Bank of England to raise interest rates next spring 每 more than a year earlier than its previous projection.The  (NIESR) said a boom in exports after the fall in the pound and a return to bumper wage rises next year would be enough to increase GDP growth to almost 2% and convince the central bank to increase the cost of borrowing.Jagjit Chadha, the institute＊s director, said a rise interest rates would also have the effect of supporting efforts by high street banks to boost their profits and the reserves needed to protect them against another financial crash.※We are not talking about a rapid return to higher interest rates, but signalling that process 每 even if it takes five to seven years 每 will help banks rebuild their balance sheets and create a healthier financial system,§ he said.In a separate report, Chadha said one of the main reasons for the UK＊s slow growth in recent years was the weakness of the banking sector and its ability to support expanding businesses with extra loans. ※The finance sector is crucial because every business has to go to a bank to put forward their business plan and get credit,§ he added.NIESR＊s forecast comes despite growing concerns that Brexit uncertainty is discouraging companies from investing in the UK and hampering a bounce-back from low growth in the first six months. While foreign firms have bought high-profile properties in the UK since the Brexit vote, including  there are few examples of increased investment in new factories.Official figures last week showed that GDP growth was 0.3% in the three months to the end of June 每  每 after a rise of 0.2% in the first quarter.  Philip Hammond has also said he was concerned about  in the last year after a rise in inflation of 2.7% while wages growth remained stuck at about 2%. The chancellor is understood to be scaling back government tax receipts in the light of stumbling GDP growth and pushing back the date when he can balance the government＊s books from 2025 to 2027.Later this week, the Bank of England＊s interest rate setting committee will give its own verdict on the strength of the economy in its quarterly inflation report. It is expected to present a gloomier outlook for the economy than NIESR after the economy failed to rebound from a weak start to the year.The Bank of England＊s governor, Mark Carney,  in June when he warned that continued growth in the UK economy would eventually lead to higher interest rates, but is not expected to say this week that it will come as early as next spring.After the Brexit vote, the Bank＊s monetary policy committee cut the base rate as an emergency measure from 0.5% to 0.25%, its lowest level in the Bank＊s 323-year history. Carney is likely to highlight how wages have failed to keep pace with rising prices, hitting real incomes and consumer spending. As one economic consultancy said this week: ※The criteria set out by the governor to justify a hike look a long way from being met.§NIESR said it was bringing forward the timing of the first increase in interest rates to the first quarter of next year following its more upbeat assessment of the next six months. Previously it forecast that a rate rise would take place after the second quarter of 2019, when Britain had left the European Union.A rise in business investment and productivity would spur a broad-based recovery that would allow the central bank to at least reverse the emergency cut last August. It said: ※This rate increase should not be seen as a tightening in policy, but instead as a modest withdrawal of some of the additional stimulus that was injected into the economy after the 2016 EU referendum.§ Chadha accused the Bank of England of confusing the public about the next move in interest rates, saying that a series of speeches by the governor and other members of the MPC ※fostered a haphazard debate§, when clarity was needed.※That is why we have called for a proper debate to start now in a careful, considered and open manner,§ he said."															
															
"A shortage of homes for sale has kept house prices rising despite falling consumer incomes and political uncertainty, according to .The building society said the price of the average house went up by 0.3% in July to hit a new peak of ?211,671. But the annualised growth figure dropped from 3.1% to 2.9%. The resilience of has surprised economists as they contrast with falling transactions 每 at their lowest level for eight months 每 and the number of mortgages approved, which have also fallen to a nine-month low. Nationwide reported  in March, April and May, but June and July have seen prices rise again. ※On the surface, this appears at odds with recent signs of cooling in the housing market,§ said Robert Gardner, Nationwide＊s chief economist. ※But a lack of homes on the market appears to be providing support, with annual house price growth remaining only just outside the 3-6% range that has been prevailing for most of the past two years. This pattern looks set to be maintained in the near term.§Gardner pointed to surveys which show that the number of properties coming on to the market is slowing, and the number of homes on estate agents＊ books is close to a 30-year low. But with household budgets under pressure, and wage growth failing to keep up with the cost of living, Nationwide is forecasting ※subdued§ housing market activity, and says prices are likely to rise by just 2% over the whole of 2017. Jonathan Samuels of property lender Octane Capital said: ※Weak supply has once again ridden to the rescue of house prices. The shortage of homes, both for sale and being built, is preventing prices from falling sharply. ※Record low mortgage rates are helping what demand there is, but it＊s hard to see anything other than a sideways-moving market for the rest of 2017.§The lack of sales, plus competition from online operators, will mean that , according to a report earlier this week. Almost 5,000 estate agents are showing signs of ※financial distress§, according to accountancy firm Moore Stephens."															
"For tens of millions of people around the world, 2017 has been a year of disasters. The latest in a long list of catastrophes, natural and manmade, has left more than 40 million in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal struggling with extreme monsoon flooding. Many of those affected are the least able to cope 每 subsistence farmers and the urban poor who can expect little help from their governments. In a world inundated by emergencies, .The victims of hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana will likely fare better. The extent of their suffering should not be under-estimated. On the evidence of previous killer storms, such as , which devastated New Orleans in 2005, it will take many years to repair the damage and the lives of some survivors will be permanently scarred. But at least the residents of Houston can count on generous assistance from the federal government. Congress is already considering a  billions more will follow.The response to Harvey is highly untypical, not least in the intense media attention it has attracted. More usual, to give one glaring example, is the relative lack of international interest in the near-apocalyptic disaster currently afflicting the people of South Sudan. This disaster is largely manmade, triggered by an avoidable civil war. The conflict has a strong ethnic component, pitting the Dinka against the Nuer in a fight for oil, land and power. But it is also about of international institutions to keep the peace.Since 2013, tens of thousands of people 每 nobody really knows how many 每 have been killed in the fighting. Starvation and disease have killed many more, with a cholera outbreak causing particular concern. About one-third of South Sudan＊s 12?million population is displaced. Two million, mostly women and children, have fled to Uganda and other neighbours. Nearly 2,000 refugees reportedly arrive each day.※Recent arrivals speak of barbaric violence, with armed groups reportedly burning down houses with civilians inside, people being killed in front of family members, sexual assaults of women and girls and kidnapping of boys for forced conscription,§ a UN report said last month. Of $883.5m requested in international aid,  so far. Compare that with the Texas billions.As with Yemen, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where conflict, displacement and disease have combined to cause similar, largely unremarked disasters, the political failure of international and regional organisations to rescue South Sudan is stark. A 2015 peace agreement has not been implemented. Opposing factions have not been contained. War criminals roam unchecked. The  of the Intergovernmental Authority for Development, the African Union, the UN security council, the UN＊s Juba peacekeeping force and international backers such as the US and Britain, which supported South Sudanese statehood in 2011, is little short of lamentable.The unmitigated suffering of the people of Yemen is likewise hard to excuse. Earlier this year, aid agencies warned that the Arab world＊s poorest state was ※at the point of no return§, with 17 million people facing severe food insecurity. But since then their plight has only grown worse, with the western-backed Saudi bombing campaign compounding the evils of hunger and disease. In the DRC, meanwhile, , ※vicious conflict§, unreported in the west, has forced nearly a million people to flee their homes this year. About 1.5 million are ※on the brink of famine§.New additions to 2017＊s roll call of disaster come thick and fast. Last week produced another dire example of the international community＊s failure to protect 每 a sudden upsurge in violence in western Myanmar that uprooted about 70,000 Rohingya, members of Burma＊s Muslim minority, in the space of a few days. The long-running persecution of the Rohingya by Buddhist nationalists in Myanmar is well known. The military has launched previous slash-and-burn campaigns in Rakhine state, .Now the generals are at it again, torching villages and killing their inhabitants on the pretext of counter-terrorism. The violence is by no means over. But where is the international outcry? Where are peacekeepers and mediators when you really need them? The answers are all too evident. Instead of demanding an end to , the UN security council spent last week fretting over North Korea＊s missiles, another problem it cannot solve.The  of the UN＊s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs gives a daunting measure of the challenges 2017 has thrown up. Manmade and natural disasters have so far left at least 140 million people in 37 countries in need of humanitarian aid. This figure does not include the south Asia or Myanmar crises. An estimated $23.5bn was needed to fund assistance efforts this year, the June report said, but only $6.2bn, 26% of the total, has been raised.Stephen O＊Brien, the UN＊s senior aid official, said humanitarian needs, from all causes, . ※This year has been marked by multiple disasters amid protracted crises... As many as 20 million people are at risk of famine across north-east Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. Five flash appeals have been launched in 2017 to respond to devastation caused by the drought in Kenya, by tropical cyclones Enawo in Madagascar and Dineo in Mozambique, and by flooding in Peru.§ To all this misery, O＊Brien said, must be added the ※intense suffering§ of civilians in war zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.What is to be done in the face of this overwhelming wave of woe? More funding is one answer. Ordinary citizens, especially in Britain, usually respond generously to specific disaster appeals.  for the south Asia floods. Wider acceptance is needed that, as individuals, we all share a moral responsibility to inform ourselves about what is happening across our joined-up world. Governments such as the US and Britain, the two leading donor states, should increase, not cut, their foreign aid budgets. The emerging economic powers must do more, too. Another imperative, in terms of natural disasters, is ever more forceful, integrated efforts to combat climate change, especially by the recalcitrant Trump administration.Yet more pressing than any of this, perhaps, is the necessity to increase the effectiveness and improve the co-ordination of global and regional governance organisations, principally the UN, its peacekeeping arm and its agencies, but also the , IMF, World Bank, OECD, EU, AU and Asean, in tackling global disasters of all descriptions. Multilateralism has fallen out of fashion of late. But without it, there may be no way to turn the tide of global disaster."															
"Britain＊s manufacturers increased production at the fastest pace in seven months in August, taking on more workers to keep up with strong domestic and international demand. The closely watched  barometer of factory sentiment showed activity jumped to 56.9 last month from 55.3 in July, the second-highest level in more than three years, helped by the weak value of the pound. That confounded forecasts for a modest slowdown to 55.0 in a Reuters poll of economists and was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The weak pound, having plunged after the Brexit vote, was reported to have increased competitiveness for British products. The domestic market, however, was the prime source of contract wins for the manufacturing sector, despite robust demand from mainland Europe, the US, China and Australia. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers＊ organisation EEF, said: ※UK manufacturers are looking beyond the Brexit negotiations to strengthening market opportunities in Europe and beyond, with the acceleration in manufacturing activity in August helping to provide some welcome offset to sluggish consumer demand at home.§The jump in production was underpinned by faster intakes of new work, which filtered through to the labour market as the number of jobs grew for the 13th straight month. However, almost 31% of companies said they experienced an increase in the price of materials required for their operations, generally linked to the rising cost of commodities. Despite the strong performance in August, there may be trouble brewing. The survey of more than 600 industrial companies found higher raw materials and staff shortages could lie ahead, which would hit the pace of production in future and lead to higher costs. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said: ※At the moment, the survey data suggests the manufacturing economy remains in good health despite Brexit uncertainty, and should help support ongoing growth in the economy in the third quarter.§The survey provides a snapshot of the UK economy before official figures are released later in the year, meaning the expectations for faster growth may fail to materialise. Manufacturing contracted by 0.6% in the three months to June, despite the PMI data pointing to an expansion of about 0.5%, according to Andrew Wishart, an assistant economist at the consultancy Capital . The survey results ※add weight to our view that the sector will put a disappointing first half to the year behind it§, he said. ※We expect the manufacturing sector to help overall GDP growth to accelerate in the second half of 2017.§The upbeat survey could give credence to policymakers calling for the Bank of England to raise interest rates to offset higher inflation, arguing the economy is now strong enough to handle tighter monetary conditions. , one of the two dissenting Bank of England rate-setters to vote for a rise last month, The manufacturing figures reflect activity in a sector that contributes about 10% to GDP, although uncertainties remain in other areas. Consumer spending is under pressure as higher prices and weaker wage growth squeeze their purchasing power. Caution has been recorded among businesses considering investments in the British economy amid political and Brexit uncertainties. The improved picture for manufacturers was also mirrored in Europe, even though a steep climb for the euro has eroded competitiveness on the continent. Production in the eurozone accelerated in August, as manufacturers recorded the fastest rise in export orders since February 2011, according to separate figures on Friday. IHS Markit＊s manufacturing PMI for the eurozone rose to 57.4 in August, up from 56.6 in July. Those levels of productivity should indicate ※solid support§ for the eurozone in the third quarter, according to Claus Vistesen at research consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. The stronger picture on the continent could encourage the to begin cutting its 2.3tn (?2.11tn) bond buying programme. Mario Draghi, the ECB president, could take such steps at a key meeting later this month. "															
" city council has taken the unusual step of appointing economic advisers to assess its prospects for the bond market, as a growing number of local authorities turn to the world of high finance amid central government cuts.Councillors in Scotland＊s third largest city will get advice from  on the state of the regional economy, and will help the panel with the annual assessment of a credit rating agency Moody＊s. Aberdeen is one of a handful of councils to raise money by selling bonds, raising ?370m in November 2016 to help finance a ?1bn capital spending programme. Stephen Boyle, RBS＊s chief economist, Hanan Morsy, an economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Douglas Peedle, chief economic adviser to Jersey, will sit on the panel of experts. They will be paid as much as ?17,000 a year for working one day a month, for a term of up to three years.The move comes amid the increasing financialisation of local authorities. Whitehall cuts are pushing councils to either scrap services or borrow to invest in profit-making schemes. Although devolution means Scottish councils are funded differently to the rest of the UK, Holyrood has also . As well as using the bond markets, authorities are taking out cheap loans from the Public Works Loan Board, a Treasury agency, as they plough money into property developments and other investments.Councils  last year. The London borough of Newham has invested in a Welsh solar farm, and  buying shares in a bank based in Hertfordshire.The trend raises questions over the qualifications of local officials to spend public money on speculative deals, and they could also be entering into relationships in the City of London with savvier partners with potentially differing interests. In the late 1980s, Hammersmith and Fulham council west London, bet on derivatives in a scandal that led to authorities being banned from such activities. Many councils＊ pension funds have paid advisers, but Aberdeen is believed to be among the first to hire a standing panel of economists. Local authorities typically rely on external advice from accountancy and law firms when making investment decisions. Aberdeen might benefit from expert economic advice owing to its , which makes the city vulnerable to movements in the value of crude. A crash in prices in 2014 每 from more than $100 (?78) a barrel when the  referendum was held in 2014 to as low as $27 last year 每 led local unemployment rates to rise by a quarter. The city＊s move into the bond market does, however, raise the risk that speculators could bet against the council should oil prices wobble again. Moody＊s also links its view of Aberdeen to the UK＊s creditworthiness as a whole, which could change should the Scottish government look to hold another independence vote. Moody＊s rates just five councils: Aberdeen, Warrington, Cornwall, Guildford and Lancashire.Joel Benjamin, a campaigner on council finances, said he believed a local authority could go bankrupt within the next decade. ※That＊s going to prompt a pretty quick reappraisal of risk by local authorities,§ he added. Aberdeen makes a significant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies, with a ※gross value added§ contribution of more than ?18bn and GVA per head of ?36,726, which is 55% higher than the Scottish average. The council co-leader, Douglas Lumsden, said: ※To have such a knowledgeable and experienced group in place is of great benefit, not only to Aberdeen city council but to the region as a whole.§The experts will also share their reports with the , which includes the Nobel prize-winning economists James Mirrlees and Joseph Stiglitz.

"enis Healey never actually said he intended to squeeze the rich until the pips squeaked. The man who would soon be Labour chancellor was referring solely to property speculators when he made the remark during the February 1974 election campaign.But the rich knew full well that Healey was coming for them, too. At the previous year＊s Labour party conference, he said: ※We shall increase income tax on the better off so that we can help the hundreds of thousands of families now tangled helplessly in the poverty trap, by raising the tax threshold and introducing reduced rates of tax for those at the bottom of the ladder. I warn you, there are going to be howls of anguish from the rich. But before you cheer too loudly, let me warn you that a lot of you will pay extra taxes, too.§Healey was as good as his word, with the top rate of income tax set at 83%. By contrast, the . Under a Jeremy Corbyn government, someone earning around ?125,000 or more would have been eligible for a new 50% income tax bracket and there would have been a 45% rate for people on more than ?80,000.Still, this is a different age. The abiding principle is that we should cut the rich some slack because the tax system needs them. Reducing tax rates for the better off is supposed to lead to a higher tax take by stimulating entrepreneurship and making the super-rich work harder. For those who don＊t believe this neoliberal fairytale, there is a fall-back position: the top 1% pay a lot more than 1% of tax receipts 每 and the proportion has been rising. The top 1% of earners in the UK accounts for 27% of income tax receipts, more than double the percentage when Healey was at the Treasury. So, stop grumbling, we＊re told. Without the sacrifices being made by those at the top, the cuts would be even deeper.This, though, is not the watertight case for the defence of the rich that it appears at first sight, as is demonstrated by .The trio accept that in ※an absolute, dry, sense§ the rich are supporting the tax system more than any other group, but say this tells only half the story. The past four decades have been extremely kind to those at the top. They have seen their incomes grow faster than the rest of the population and hold a far bigger share of wealth in the form of property and financial investments than the rest of the population. Over the years a bigger slice of national income has gone to capital at the expense of labour, and the rich have been the beneficiaries of that, because they are more likely to own shares and expensive houses.The trend has been particularly strong in the US, where labour＊s share of income has fallen from a recent peak of 57% at the end of Bill Clinton＊s presidency to 53% by 2015. The  每 a measure of inequality 每 has been steadily rising since 1970 and is now at levels normally seen in developing rather than advanced economies.Hatgioannides, Karanassou and Sala seek to take account of these profound changes in the distribution of income and wealth. They do so by dividing the average income tax rate of a particular slice of the US population by the percentage of national income commanded by that same group and by their share of wealth.They then look at whether by this measure 每 the fiscal inequality coefficient 每 the US tax system has become more or less progressive over time. The findings show quite clearly that it has become less progressive.In terms of income, the poorest 99% of the US population paid nine times as much income tax as the richest 1%, both when John F Kennedy was president in the early 1960s and when Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 race for the White House. By 2014, they paid 21 times as much.Similarly, the bottom 99.9% in the US paid 28 times as much tax as the elite 0.1% in the early 1960s and the early 1980s, but by 2014 they were paying 76 times as much.The same trend applies 每 although it is not pronounced 每 when income tax is divided by the share of wealth. The bottom 99% paid 22 times as much income tax as the wealthiest 1% in 1980 but were paying 47 times as much in 2014. The bottom 99.9% paid 58 times as much income tax as the top 0.1% before the onset of Reaganomics; by 2014 they were paying 175 times as much. The paper＊s research does not extend to Britain, although given that the distribution of income and wealth has also been tilted in favour of the rich and the very rich, a similar picture would almost certainly emerge.As the authors note, since 1980, economic policy making has been dominated by the idea that deregulation, less generous welfare and tax cuts will stimulate higher investment, higher productivity, higher growth and higher living standards for all. None of this has occurred and, what＊s more, the social mobility in the decades after the second world war has been thrown into reverse. The great American dream 每 the notion that anybody can strike it rich 每 is dead.Even so, the  每 assuming he is able to get it through Congress 每 will be big corporations and the highest earners. Any suggestion that this is entirely the wrong approach is met by three arguments. The first is that the call for the rich to pay more is simply the politics of envy. The second is that it would be a return to the bad old days. The third is that the rich would find ways of avoiding paying any more. Yet Hatgioannides, Karanassou and Sala show there is a reason for the bulk of taxpayers to be unhappy about the way the system is loaded against them. What＊s more, for the average US worker, the bad old days weren＊t really so bad. Finally, saying that the rich would never pay up is defeatist; tax loopholes could be closed, tax havens shut down, wealth 每 especially in the form of immovable land 每 could be taxed rather than income.The argument that we should all be grateful to the ultra-rich is bunkum. As the paper concludes: ※The overarching policy question is the following: in the current era of fiscal consolidation, should the rich be taxed more? Our evidence suggests unequivocally yes.§"															
"hen I referred  to Chancellor Philip Hammond as the only grown-up minister in this chaotic cabinet, I was unaware that he had just  with his arch-foe Liam Fox, making the following statement: ※We respect the will of the British people 每 in March 2019 the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. We will leave the customs union＃ we will leave the single market＃ §True, this was followed by reports that he wanted, in effect, to retain quasi-membership for several years, but the two emphasised that such a precaution ※cannot be a back door to staying in the EU§. There were also reports that Hammond had in some mysterious way scored a victory, which contrasted vividly with other reports that his attempt at some kind of coup had been foiled.Certainly, what he put his name to in that article was not good news for those of us who firmly believe it is not too late to arrest the progress of Brexit in its tracks. But then the shenanigans in the present cabinet＊s approach to  negotiations call to mind the Queen in Through the looking-glass telling Alice: ※Sometimes I＊ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.§The fact of the matter is that this government is so unstable that anything could happen in the next two months. It is an open secret that up to half a dozen members of the cabinet, and at least one double-breasted outsider, are metaphorically polishing their daggers. As my colleague Andrew Rawnsley has pointed out, the only thing holding up a revolt against Theresa May is fear that, by precipitating yet another election, the assassins might end up with  in Downing Street.But Shakespeare＊s ※vaulting ambition§ is a powerful factor in politics, and there are those who wonder how Theresa May can survive the party conference in October unscathed.Which brings us to the  party＊s position on Brexit, which most people seem to regard as every bit as confused as the Conservative one.It is generally assumed that the problem with Jeremy Corbyn＊s lukewarm opposition to Brexit during the referendum was that he is a lifelong Eurosceptic and thinks the EU is a capitalist conspiracy against workers.But most enlightened Labour MPs and trade unionists are more aware than Corbyn seems to be that the EU is in fact very strong on workers＊ rights. As for Corbyn＊s apparent fear that the EU is the enemy of publicly owned corporations, he must surely be aware of the degree to which so many of our so-called ※privatised§ utilities and much of our transport network are already in the hands of continental state-owned concerns.It seems to me that Labour now has a golden opportunity to capitalise on the strong pro-European feelings of the young, as manifested in recent surveys and, indeed, in the last election.In which context, there was a  not long ago to Corbyn in his (and my) local paper, the , from a longtime Labour party member, Michael Wolff.He told Corbyn: ※Despite your current popularity, your ambiguity about the EU and that sense that you are out of step with our nation＊s youth on Brexit won＊t keep the momentum you＊ve created rolling in your favour.§ The message was epitomised in the headline: ※My message to Jeremy: Don＊t let our young people down, burst the Brexit bubble.§For those of us who care more about this nation than the Brexiters, the situation is urgent. Professor Vernon Bogdanor at King＊s College, London,  ※raise the question of whether the decision in the 2016 referendum is final: for, although Labour was not a Remain party this year, the British Election Study found that the party＊s ＆soft Brexit＊ policy played a large part in its substantial gain in votes. In constituencies where over 55% voted Remain, the party achieved a swing of around 7%.§ Bogdanor concludes that ※the election was the revenge of the Remainers§.The state of our nation is pitiful enough without the addition of self-inflicted damage. The hospitals, the care homes, the rail service 每 too many services are, to adapt May＊s phrase, ※just about managing§.This is bad enough, but the economy has slowed down as well: as the economist Simon Wren-Lewis points out, the slowdown was at first aggravated in 2015 and 2016 by the continuing austerity policy, but more recently has been hit by the impact on real incomes of the Brexit-induced devaluation of the pound.Now, in theory one of the few benefits of that depreciation should have been a rebalancing towards exports, and some surveys suggest that export orders are rising. But, as Wren-Lewis says, so far the depreciation ※has not led to any compensating increase in exports because firms are not going to expand markets that might soon disappear because of leaving the single market or customs union§.We are coming up to the 50th anniversary of the devaluation of the pound under Harold Wilson in 1967. Then as now, commentators worried that for a long time the trade balance was not improving. Then they discovered the ※J-curve§ 每 the immediate effect had been to worsen the balance of payments by making imports dearer and exports cheaper. But eventually the improvement in price competitiveness led to a better trade performance.But I am with Wren-Lewis: this time, any J-curve effects are likely to be offset by the deleterious impact of Brexit if our political leaders do not have the gumption to tell the electorate it made a grave mistake in last year＊s referendum. Time to think again! This article was amended on 31 August 2017 to correct a quotation about Lewis Carroll＊s Alice and her adventures."															
"Gary Cohn, Donald Trump＊s chief economic adviser, has become the most senior administration official to criticize the president over his initial failure to condemn neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups, following the clashes in Charlottesville earlier this month that .※This administration can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning these groups and do everything we can to heal the deep divisions that exist in our communities,§ Cohn  in his first public comments on the issue.Cohn, who was president of Goldman Sachs before accepting a position in the  as head of the White House national economic council, said he had come under ※enormous pressure§ to resign after Trump equivocated in his denunciation of white supremacist groups, saying there had been ※very fine people on both sides§ at the demonstrations.The economic adviser said he had considered stand down but decided to stay on after discussions with the president. The New York Times  he had gone as far as drafting a letter of resignation. Cohn said he＊d ※felt a duty to fulfill my commitment to work on behalf of the American people§ but also ※compelled to voice my distress over the events of the last two weeks§.※Citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the KKK,§ Cohn added. ※As a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting ＆Jews will not replace us＊ to cause this Jew to leave his job. I feel deep empathy for all who have been targeted by these hate groups. We must all unite together against them.§ Cohn said several chief executives had urged him to stay in the administration to continue to push a pro-business agenda. Those executives included some who resigned from the White House advisory council in protest over Charlottesville, the FT also reported. In the days following the outcry over Trump＊s remarks blaming ※many sides§ for the violence, Trump was forced to disband two high-profile business advisory councils, the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum, after eight executives, including Campbell Soup Co CEO Denise Morrison and 3M Co CEO Inge Thulin, quit in protest over his remarks.The Financial Times asked Cohn if his decision to stay was influenced by the firing of Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, with whom he is reported to have frequently clashed over the administration＊s China policy and whose allies reportedly called him ※§.Bannon＊s website, Breitbart News, greeted Cohn＊s criticisms on Friday with the : ※White House Shock: ????Gary???? Trashes Trump in Press 每 Whitewash: No Antifa Violence, Just ＆citizens standing up for equality and freedom＊§.Cohn said his decisions were his own. ※I have to do what is best for me and my family. I have had numerous private conversations with the president on this topic [and] I have not been bashful saying what I think.§His chances of becoming the next chairman of the Federal Reserve would almost certainly be scuppered if he resigned. Other members of the administration who had also been dismayed at Trump＊s remarks had made their own decisions about how to respond, he said. ※This is a personal issue for each of us. We are all grappling with it. This takes time to grapple with.§Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is also Jewish, has defended the president and said at a White House press briefing on Friday he intended to stay in office.※I think there＊s no question the president was not equating the hate groups who were peacefully and under no circumstances was I going to resign,§ the Treasury secretary said.Trump＊s confidante Roger Stone tweeted later on Friday that ※Gary Cohen [sic], recommended for his White House job by Jared Kushner, should be fired immediately for his public attack on the president§.But White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that: ※Gary has not held back how he feels about the situation. He＊s been very open and honest.§Cohn＊s comments go beyond what most administration officials have offered in response to Charlottesville.Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, called it an ※unequivocally an unacceptable, evil attack§ but offered no criticism of Trump＊s tepid response.

"he downside to a weak pound is immediately apparent because imports get dearer and foreign holidays get more expensive. With sterling at its lowest level for eight years, there have been plenty of horror stories of travellers from the UK being gouged by foreign exchange bureaux.The benefits of a weaker currency tend to be less obvious but are potentially significant nonetheless. Exports become cheaper and the UK becomes a more attractive destination for overseas tourists. This leads to an improvement in the balance of payments, something that is sorely needed in Britain＊s case. shows that the impact of a lower pound on consumption is coming through much more quickly than its impact on trade.  Some of that was due to consumers bringing forward purchases of new cars in order to beat changes in vehicle excise duty but for the most part it was a response to the squeeze on living standards caused by the sterling-induced jump in the cost of living.Meanwhile, net trade 每 which measures how imports and exports have changed over the latest quarter 每 contributed a big fat zero to growth in the three months to June. This was a bit better than the first quarter, when trade actually subtracted from growth. But only a supreme optimist would say that what we are witnessing here is the J-curve effect 每 the tendency for the trade figures to get worse before they get better after a depreciation. The truth is that there should have been a discernible improvement in net trade by now, particularly with the global economy doing a bit better.The glass-half-full way of looking at the latest growth figures is that the doomsday scenario predicted by the Treasury a year ago has not come to pass. It may be that the first half of 2017 is as bad as it gets.The glass-half-empty way of looking at things is that Britain is now the slowest growing economy in the G7 courtesy of weak investment, cautious consumers and its failure to exploit the opportunity afforded by sterling＊s depreciation.Britain runs a healthy trade surplus in services, but demand for lawyers, architects and management consultants tends not to be price sensitive, so a falling pound makes little real difference.The real problem is that Britain＊s manufacturing base is now too small to take advantage of a more competitive exchange rate. The  vote has starkly illuminated that the productive capacity simply isn＊t there.Washing machines are getting more sophisticated. Every time Bosch or Hotpoint bring out a new model it has new features and gadgets. Yet few consumers would take their old Samsung to the dump just because something is now available with a faster spin speed. suggests something similar is happening with mobile phones. People are no longer trading in their smartphone every six or nine months so that they can have the latest gizmo: as with cookers, fridges and washing machines, they change them only when they stop working.In part, that＊s a function of the falling value of the pound, which has pushed up the cost of imported handsets. But there＊s more to it than that. For a start, mobile phone makers are offering only incremental improvements when they release new models. But, just as importantly, yesterday＊s luxury goods become today＊s commodities. That has happened to desktop computers and laptops 每 it is now happening to smartphones as well.Let＊s be clear. While the profits warning at Dixons Carphone was bad for the company＊s investors, it was good for everybody else. Chucking away perfectly workable smartphones every few months simply as a fashion statement represents the worst form of banal, eco-unfriendly consumerism.If consumers are no longer looking for more megapixels on their smartphone camera, it is clear what they are looking for: longer battery life. That would be good for the environment. It probably wouldn＊t be bad for profits either."

"UK consumers are suffering a sustained fall in living standards as real pay fell again in the three months to May, piling more pressure on cash-strapped households.Regular pay adjusted to account for the impact of inflation fell by 0.5% year on year over the period, shrinking family incomes and signalling a weaker outlook for consumer spending.It followed , and a 0.4% fall in the previous three months, according to figures from the . Real pay fell despite a surprise drop in the unemployment rate from 4.6% to 4.5%, which was the lowest since May to July 1975. The employment rate rose to 74.9%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971.The TUC general secretary, , said the government must intervene to address the pay squeeze. ※Three months of falling pay is three months too many. The clock is ticking while workers wait for the government to act,§ she said.※Ministers must set out a plan to get real wages rising across the public and the private sectors. They should start by scrapping the unfair pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. And the minimum wage must be raised to ?10 as quickly as possible.§Damian Hinds, the employment minister, focused on the strong employment figures, describing them as ※another reminder that our strong economy is giving record numbers of people the chance to find and stay in work§.The prolonged drop in real wages reflects the rising pressure on household budgets as prices rise at a faster rate than pay.The ONS said that before inflation, regular pay growth excluding bonuses picked up slightly to 2% year on year in the three months to May, from 1.8% in the three months to April.However, that was still well below inflation, which hit . Inflation has risen rapidly since the Brexit vote last June . A weaker pound pushes up the price of goods imported from abroad, feeding through to higher shop prices.John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said it was a striking point of the modern economy that wage growth was so weak despite low unemployment.※In the 1970s or 1980s such low unemployment, combined with inflation rising towards 3%, could have set off a wage-price spiral. ※Real earnings growth remains deep in negative territory and this seems unlikely to change any time soon. This will dampen consumer spending power, though the continued strength of the jobs market should prevent the recent slowdown in the economy turning into a recession.§The ONS has calculated that adjusted for inflation, UK employees are now earning ?15 less a week after tax and deductions than they were in March 2008, six months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and .Ian Kernohan, an economist at Royal London Asset Management, said the  was unlikely to raise interest rates at next month＊s policy meeting given the weakness of pay growth.※Inflation is now above the Bank＊s [2%] target level and real earnings growth has slipped into negative territory,§ he said. ※This is having a negative impact on household spending.

Until we know the precise causes of the blaze, we cannot conclude for certain that any deaths were avoidable. But there are disturbing parallels between Grenfell and the state of the NHS. Like the residents of Grenfell Tower, NHS staff have warned repeatedly that the government＊s drive to cut costs . Arguably, this has already happened. Yet ministers continue to ignore our warningsThe  unfolding in the NHS as overcrowding and understaffing led to thousands of patients lying marooned on trolleys in hospital corridors this winter, with at least two patients . Although I wasn＊t working at the time, I know well the shame and guilt that come with being forced to treat patients in corridors, not to mention the distress and indignity for those patients themselves.The government seeks to airbrush away what those of us at work on the NHS frontline have observed.

That aspiration is fatally undermined by the government＊s failure to address endemic gaps in doctor and nurses rotas, with thousands of unfilled posts across our hospitals and general practices. The . Medics like myself often face workloads in which superhuman effort is required just to keep patients safe, let alone provide excellence of care.Although it was residents rather than professionals who repeatedly raised the alarm about the potential for a fatal disaster at Grenfell Tower, the similarity to the situation in the NHS is that no one is listening to the warnings. This begs the uncomfortable question: are  patients waiting for a tragedy even as doctors and nurses repeatedly raise concerns?The dangers to patients of understaffing are well-documented. A decade ago, thousands of patients at the  were subjected to callous, demeaning and unsafe care after the trust decided to save money by cutting the size of its wage bill. Elderly and vulnerable patients were left unwashed, unfed, soiled and in squalor, with the death rate greatly in excess of the national hospital average.

" from the poorest 40% of families entering university in England for the first time this September will emerge with an average debt of around ?57,000, according to a new analysis by a leading economic thinktank.The Institute of Fiscal Studies said the abolition of the last maintenance grants in 2015 had disproportionately affected the poorest, while students from the richest 30% of households would run up lower average borrowings of ?43,000.Jack Britton, one of the IFS report＊s authors, said that changes in recent years have been ※heavily focused on further reducing the cost to central government§ and that it had made the system more unequal.※Replacing maintenance grants with loans reduces the government deficit but results in students from low-income families graduating with the highest debt levels,§ he added.The economic thinktank＊s conclusion immediately prompted a sharp political exchange between the main parties and elite universities over the fairness of student finance 每 and a hint from the minister responsible that amid soaring debts the system could be reviewed again.Gordon Marsden, Labour＊s shadow higher education spokesman, said the IFS study made a nonsense of the .※From scrapping the maintenance grant to freezing the repayment threshold [at which students start repaying their loans], this government has focused on increasing the debt burden of students from disadvantaged backgrounds,§ Marsden said.※Under the Tories, student debt continues to rise with no end in sight, and students will now graduate with a shocking average of over ?50,000 in debt.

The pledges were credited in helping the party win over scores of young people and gain seats in university towns such as Canterbury., the higher education minister Jo Johnson describes as ※misguided speculation§ the idea government was likely to scrap the current system of loans that hiked from ?3,600 a year in 2012.But significantly, the minister went on to concede that the political climate makes demands for change hard to ignore, and pledged that he would also look again ※at the details of the student finance regime to ensure it remains fair and effective§. Johnson also attacked Labour and said that its policy was unaffordable. He said that Labour＊s policy of scrapping tuition fees would cost a ※mind-boggling§ ?100bn by 2025.Student loan debt has been soaring and its total value , underlining the rising costs young people face in order to get a university education. Outstanding debt on loans jumped by 16.6% to ?100.5bn at the end of March, up from ?86.2bn a year earlier, according figures released by the Student Loans Company.Many debts will not even be paid off within the 30-year time scale. The IFS also found that more than 77% of those taking out student loans will have some or even all of the loans paid off by the government because graduates will not earn enough to repay their loans within that time.Defending the situation, Johnson wrote: ※The fact some loans never get fully repaid is a deliberate subsidy for the lowest-earning graduates, not a symptom of a broken student finance system.§Students from low- and middle-income families are also made worse off by the government＊s decision to hold down the income level at which graduates must start repaying their loans to ?21,000.By leaving the figure unchanged the proportion of graduates who have to start paying back loans quicker increases because average wages are rising. The thinktank added that it means that students will have to pay back ?4,000 more over their working lives than otherwise.The government＊s position was criticised by the elite Russell Group of research-led universities, which includes Cambridge, University College London and Manchester.※Higher education should also be affordable for students and it may be helpful for the government to consider how to address concerns over things like the interest rate applied to undergraduate loans,§ said Sarah Stevens, the Russell Group＊s head of policy.The report also found that university income from teaching has boomed since 2012, with fees from teaching up by 25% per student. Arts subjects have particularly benefited, with universities receiving a 47% increase in fees income from those subjects. By contrast science or medicine courses received much lower increases in funding since 2012 because they are more expensive to run.※Universities are undoubtedly better off under the current system than they were before the 2012 reforms,§ said Laura van der Erve, an author of the report. ※However, their incentives have shifted towards providing low-cost subjects. This does not sit comfortably with the government＊s intention to promote typically high-cost Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects.§The IFS also highlighted changes to the interest rates charged introduced since 2012, with students now charged 3% plus the retail price index on loans accrued while they are still undergraduates. From September, students will be forced to pay higher interest rates on their loans of 6.1% after a surge in inflation.※Due to their higher principal debt, students from poorer households accrue the most interest during study; students from the poorest 40% of families now accrue around ?6,500 in interest during study,§ its briefing note states.In contrast students accrued just ?1,500 in interest under the system in force before 2012, the IFS said."															
"Households should prepare for interest rates to rise as the  withdraws some of the emergency support it injected into the economy in the wake of last year＊s Brexit vote, a top policymaker has warned.Michael Saunders used a Guardian interview to explain why  and to emphasise that it was no longer necessary for Threadneedle Street to keep its foot to the floor with record low borrowing costs.The external member of the monetary policy committee (MPC) said the economy had confounded gloomy forecasts made in the aftermath of the referendum and he warned inflation would climb higher and stay well above the Bank＊s target for longer without action.※I think households should prepare for interest rates to go higher at some point. But if rates do go up, it will be in the context of the economy doing OK and unemployment being low and probably falling,§ he said.Speaking on the eve of the 10th anniversary of , Saunders rebuffed suggestions that policymakers should hold fire while Brexit negotiations get underway.※We are not constrained from adjusting interest rates during the Brexit period.

Saunders hints he will vote again for a rise at the next meeting in August.※At the moment, in monetary policy terms if you like, our foot is pretty much on the floor with the accelerator. Record low policy rate, large stock of quantitative easing, and I don＊t think the economy needs as much stimulus as that,§ he said.The pound＊s sharp fall since the Brexit vote has left the Bank with a tricky balancing act. A weaker pound has made imports more expensive and pushed inflation well above the Bank＊s 2.0% target to . But household budgets have suffered as wages have failed to keep pace with inflation and consumer spending has slowed, knocking overall GDP growth.Saunders predicts inflation will rise further and the trade-off for the Bank between supporting jobs and growth and keeping inflation in check has shifted. Now there was a risk of acting too late to curb rises in costs.※To me this is the time when you don＊t take the punch bowl away fully but you just start to edge it away,§ he said. ※The risk that you run with maximum stimulus is that the jobless rate keeps falling then at some point if pay growth picks up you have to reverse course very sharply. It would then be much harder for tightening to be limited and gradual. You＊d be having to play catch-up.§Saunders says his visits to businesses around the country have highlighted firms＊ growing difficulty in hiring staff from overseas. That could well push up wage growth, he feels.※There has been this extra pool of labour which firms can call on and most of the rise in employment, the overwhelming part of the rise in employment of the last five years has been from people born outside the UK,§ he says. ※It＊s clear from talking to firms that it＊s getting harder to persuade people to come to the UK.§Another factor pushing him towards higher rates are signs that exports are ※doing really well§ and investment intentions have picked up. ※I am reasonably confident that the pick-up in investment and exports will roughly balance the consumer slowdown,§ he said.But even if that is enough to convince most of his MPC colleagues to vote for a hike this year, Saunders cautions against over-reacting. ※If rates were to rise to 0.5%, policy would still be pretty loose. We would still be providing plenty of stimulus, continuing to support output and jobs.§"															
"The international body that represents the world＊s central banks has claimed that globalisation has been made a ※scapegoat§ for rising inequality, as it launched a defence of closer cross-border ties.Against the backdrop of protectionist rhetoric in many countries, , the Bank for International Settlements used  to argue that globalisation has cut global poverty and will continue to lift living standards around the world.The body 每 which is known as the central bank of central banks 每 warned that reversing globalisation would be ※greatly detrimental to living standards§. The BIS concedes gains from trade have not been evenly distributed at the national level but that other factors, most notably technology, have played a bigger role in widening the gap between rich and poor. ※There is ample evidence that globalisation has not been responsible for the majority of the concurrent increase in within-country income inequality,§ said the report.※Attempts to roll back globalisation would be the wrong response to these challenges. , like technological innovation, has been an integral part of economic development.§The strong backing for globalisation echoes  and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development not to move towards more inward-looking policies.After Trump＊s presidential win following a campaign on an anti-globalisation platform, both bodies emphasised the apparent benefits from more global trade and .The BIS took a similar line in Sunday＊s report, urging governments to make their labour markets flexible enough to help people whose jobs are displaced to retrain and to benefit from regional employment drives. It also calls for international cooperation to shore up the stability of the global financial system.※Instead of retreating from the ties of global trade and finance, we should reinforce them. Instead of loosening them, we should make them more resilient,§ BIS general manager Jaime Caruana wrote in a foreword to a chapter on globalisation.※We must work together to create well designed policies, both domestically and internationally. Only then can we make sure that globalisation will continue to lift economic growth and living standards around the world for generations to come,§ Caruana continued.The BIS noted that certain costs and financial risks had arisen from globalisation and that they needed to be carefully managed. ※But they do not justify a backlash against globalisation,§ the report said. Instead there should be more acknowledgement of the gains from greater trade and cooperation, it said. ※The globalisation surge over the past half-century has brought many benefits to the world economy. Openness to trade has enhanced competition and spread technology, driving efficiency gains and aggregate productivity. ※The resulting stronger income growth has supported a remarkable decline in global poverty and cross-country income inequality. The ability to source cheaper, and better-quality, goods and services from all over the world has also directly increased households＊ living standards,§ the report said.In its recommendations of how to cut inequality, the BIS noted the trend for big companies to declare work and earnings in various parts of the world in order to limit their tax bills. It called for more international cooperation to ensure businesses pay their fair share of tax. ※Trade and financial linkages enable companies, particularly large multinationals, to make decisions regarding production and profit declaration to minimise their taxes,§ the report said. ※Avoiding this can ensure that highly mobile capital can share the tax burden with less mobile labour, and so address income inequality.§"															
"There are few people in the developed world who still cling to the maxim that ※home life ceases to be free and beautiful as soon as it is founded on borrowing and debt§.These days we can＊t afford to take the same view as Helmer, the husband in Ibsen＊s A Doll＊s House, one of literature＊s most cautious budgeters. It＊s a nice idea to be free of debt and just spend what you earn. But when a home costs many times the average annual income and life＊s running costs often exceed the monthly income, borrowing is not something that can be avoided.The government knows this only too well. This week sees publication of the public borrowing total for May and it is not expected to make pleasant reading. Together with April＊s shocker, when government borrowing was higher than the same month last year, the first two months of this financial year are forecast to show the borrowing requirement for the year is on track to be higher, not lower than last year.When David Cameron and George Osborne were in Downing Street, bringing down the deficit was the main aim of domestic policy. Until just last year, the plan was to cut the deficit to zero by 2020 and start bringing down the debt-to-GDP ratio from this year.The EU referendum vote and Theresa May＊s arrival at No 10 changed all that. Once she adopted a hard-Brexit stance, the economy began to turn. Her chancellor, Philip Hammond, was forced to loosen the purse strings.It meant that both of the main political parties went into the election with plans for the deficit to remain at about 2.5%. Independent forecasts for GDP growth over the next five years are below this figure, meaning that far from cutting the overall debt-to-GDP ratio, both parties were content to push it towards 90% 每 higher than any government has experienced in 50 years.That＊s why so many headlines after the election have declared austerity dead and why the deficit was the dog that didn＊t bark when the electorate went to the polls.The pressure on the deficit has only worsened since then. It has become clear to many of May＊s advisers and close colleagues that the Tory party might not survive a second election this year without stealing some of Labour＊s clothes.There is the possibility she will sanction scrapping, or dramatically reducing tuition fees, to nullify one of Labour＊s most popular pledges.The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, , while local authority spending may need to increase after the Grenfell Tower fire.Meanwhile, household debts are on the increase. Credit card, car loan and student debt, and borrowing using that most pernicious of loans, the second mortgage, have all risen sharply in the last couple of years. Making matters worse, the proportion of savings in the economy is at rock-bottom levels.It all adds up to an economy running on empty, with everyone, including ministers, borrowing extra each year just to keep the wheels turning.At a time when the official figures show employment at a and unemployment at a historical low, the workforce should be enjoying wage rises of at least 4% or 5%. Workers should be building up their savings and rejecting overtures to borrow more from greedy lenders.It is a constant refrain from ministers that the mark of a successful economy is full employment and Britain passes that test with flying colours. But in Britain, as elsewhere in the developed world, workers are powerless to bid for higher wages.In the US, there is an army of people, many of them women, who make no claim on the state for benefits, but stand ready to take well-paid jobs should they become available. In France, Italy and across much of the continent hordes of young people are kept like circling aeroplanes above an airport, ready to land whenever a slot opens and a job becomes available.In the UK we have colossal numbers of workers from all ages and both sexes on zero-hour contracts and in part-time work who would like more hours and security should it be offered.The combination of all these trends allows employers to keep wage rises at about 2%. These are the same employers who, despite enjoying a cut in corporation tax from 28% since 2010 to 19% today under the  and the promise of 17% by 2020, are hoarding profits and investing very little to increase output.Without strong increases in average wages , workers must borrow to maintain their standard of living. It also means income tax revenues have failed to rise as expected, hurting the exchequer and forcing the government to borrow more than it believes prudent.Far from being the strong economy of Osborne＊s imagination, sobered up by austerity and bolstered by deregulation of the labour market, Britain stumbles towards the end of the century＊s second decade, and more immediately the Brexit talks, like a first world war soldier back from the trenches, shellshocked and hobbling. Osborne＊s plan to reduce the deficit indicated Britain＊s weakness because it could only succeed once consumers accepted the need to borrow and spend again like they did before the financial crash. And they could only perform this task with the help of zero interest rates, kindly supplied by the Bank of England.That the economy now needs the government to match the appetite of households for extra borrowing shows it is not only weak but in a perilous state.The Norwegians, unlike in Ibsen＊s time, no longer need to worry about debt. Norway has a surplus of savings-to-GDP ratio of about 280%, the largest in the world. Oslo has its own worries of course. But the pressure is to stop its population from becoming idle as its carefully managed oilfields spew more cash than anyone can legally spend.Britain, on the other hand, continues in the other direction, its oil money already spent, with No 10 planning to cause even more harm by negotiating a hard Brexit that disturbs the operations of almost all large employers. Hammond said on the BBC1＊s Andrew Marr show on Sunday that he wants a softer landing, by which he means a free trade agreement with Europe. He might be the chancellor, but the issue is whether he has any power."															
"Britain＊s biggest business groups have made a joint plea to the government to put the economy first in  talks and to secure a transitional deal that preserves access to the European single market.The five lobby groups, including the British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI, have also called on ministers to prioritise an early deal on guarantees for EU 27 citizens in the UK and for UK citizens in other EU countries.Their , released to coincide with the start of talks to leave the EU, is the latest move by business leaders to push Theresa May . They are demanding a trade-friendly final deal in addition to a flexible transitional agreement.※The business community fully accepts the decision of voters last June that the UK will leave the European Union. We have come together to urge the government to put the economy first as it prepares to start formal negotiations on the UK＊s departure from the EU,§ says the statement from the BCC, CBI, manufacturers＊ group EEF, the Federation of Small Businesses and the .※This is a deal that when finally agreed will matter fundamentally for the UK economy, for UK companies and for citizens of the UK. A deal that supports growth will allow companies to hire more people, raise living standards and improve lives across the country,§ it adds.The five 每 which claim to represent hundreds of thousands of businesses that employ a combined workforce of millions of people 每 want the final Brexit deal to ensure the tariff-free trade of goods between the UK and the EU; minimal customs formalities at the land, sea and air borders between the two; and a flexible system for the movement of labour and skills ※that enjoys public support§.It is widely expected that the UK will need a transitional arrangement to cushion its exit from the EU after 2019. The business groups want such a deal to ※maintain the economic benefits of the single market and the customs union until a final settlement between the UK and the EU is agreed and implemented§.Adam Marshall, director general of the BCC, said businesses had felt disappointed that the economy had been sidelined in recent months and they wanted assurances they would be listened to as Brexit negotiations proceed. ※There was disillusionment with an election campaign that failed to realise the importance of the economy,§ he told the Guardian.※As we enter into the most important negotiations that our country will embark on in our lifetimes, the economy must be front and centre ＃ Without a strong economy with strong businesses, the things we all want for our country are not going to come to pass. We can＊t redistribute a shrinking pie. We need to be growing that pie, and that＊s a shared job between business and government.§Marshall said businesses were realistic about the complex nature of Brexit talks, but that they were keen to see some ※quick wins§. Guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens in the UK was a key priority.※Our companies are already losing people. There are people who are very worried about their future,§ he added."															
"Kansas has rejected the years-long tax-cutting experiment that brought its governor, Sam Brownback, to international attention and provided a model for the Trump administration＊s In a warning shot to the Trump administration, even Brownback＊s fellow Republicans voted to override his veto of a bill to reverse many of the tax cuts he championed as a way to spur entrepreneurs and the economy, but which have left the state with a $1bn hole in its budget.Starting in 2012, Brownback＊s plan has been to ※march to zero§ 每 cutting taxes wherever possible in the belief that the money Kansans saved would flow into the wider economy and drive growth. The governor was advised by Arthur Laffer, the economist who inspired Ronald Reagan＊s ※trickle-down§ economic theory. So radical was his plan that critics called  ※Brownbackistan§.State Democrats and local critics were delighted that Brownback＊s plan had finally hit the rocks after earlier attempts to overrule the governor＊s veto had failed. Senator Tom Holland, of Baldwin City, cheered the end of ※Sam＊s march-to-zero madness§.Judith Deedy, a mother of three from Johnson County who has campaigned against the cuts she blames for an escalating crisis in the state＊s school system, said she was ※delighted§ by the news. ※It just didn＊t work. This was a terrible experiment that has left our state unable to do what it is supposed to do,§ she said.Brownback＊s defeat means the state will end a tax cut for limited liability companies (LLCs) and so-called pass-through businesses 每 which meant independent business owners and farmers would pay no state tax on the bulk, if not all, of their income. That tax plan is similar to the pillar of Trump＊s tax proposal. After it was brought in, the number of LLCs in Kansas leapt from 190,000 to over 300,000 and tax revenues plummeted, but the rate of jobs growth in Kansas has lagged that of its neighbors.In an interview with the Guardian last month, Laffer defended his theories and said the problem was Brownback had not gone far enough. ※When you put an atomic bomb on a place, it will materially change the place 每 but a cherry bomb probably won＊t change the buildings or anything else,§ he said.Under the new tax plan, legislators expect to raise $1.2bn in new revenue over two years to close projected budget shortfalls totaling $889m through June 2019, and also provide additional funds for public schools.The conservative Republican governor still touts the income tax cuts enacted in 2012 and 2013 as pro-growth policies. But voters soured last year on the governor＊s policies, ousting two dozen of his allies from the legislature and giving more power to Democrats and moderate Republicans who then backed this year＊s tax increase. The legislature＊s action leaves his main political legacy in tatters. ※He still believes in this, and that＊s OK. I don＊t,§ said senate majority leader Jim Denning, a conservative Kansas City-area Republican who supported the first round of tax cuts in 2012 but voted to override the veto. ※I＊ve made many, many bad decisions in my business career, as many bad as good, but I＊ve always backed up and mopped up my mess. That＊s what I＊m doing now.§ Had the effort to override the veto failed, legislators would have had to start over on a new tax plan, with prospects of working into next week. Legislative leaders were waiting to finish work on the next state budget until tax issues were resolved, and Brownback＊s administration had said that lawmakers need to pass a budget by 17 June for most state employees to continue getting paid after the new fiscal year begins in July.※Let＊s get our work done,§ said representative Larry Hibbard, a moderate south-east Kansas Republican. ※Let＊s put this capitol in the rear-view mirror.§ Under the new tax laws, Kansas will return to having a third tax income tax rate for its wealthiest filers, something cuts in 2012 eliminated. The top rate will be 5.7%, as opposed to 4.6% now.The governor endorsed less aggressive income tax increases and proposed raising cigarette and liquor taxes and annual filing fees for for-profit businesses. But his proposals wouldn＊t have raised enough money to cover the spending increases for schools contemplated by lawmakers.※We can and we must balance our budget without negatively harming Kansas families,§ Brownback said in his short veto message Tuesday afternoon. The tax increase was designed to also cover extra aid to the state＊s 286 local public school districts because the state supreme court ruled in March that education funding is inadequate. The state spends about $4bn a year on its schools and lawmakers passed a plan Monday night to phase in a $293m increase in education funding over two years. Brownback＊s remaining legislative allies, like him, suggested that the tax increase will ruin the economy, and they argued that Kansas has done little to control its spending 每 a point many Democrats and GOP moderates disputed.※This level of taxation is wholly unnecessary,§ said senator Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area conservative Republican. ※What we＊re doing is fleecing our constituents.§ "															
															
"British workers will see their disposable incomes shrinking this year as a result of rising inflation that will peak at 3.4%, a leading economic thinktank has warned.The National Institute of Economic & Social Research said that wage rises would be capped at only 2.7% on average, leaving workers to face the largest real-terms cut in their takehome pay since early 2014.The warning follows the controversy over rising energy bills and inflation-busting increases in council tax that have already hit household budgets ahead of the general election.Recent surveys have shown  in response to increasing prices by a wide range of retailers.Theresa May has  to boost disposable incomes, while Jeremy Corbyn wants to intervene in the housing market to reduce .The prediction for a spike in inflation of 3.4% is well above the level forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury＊s independent forecaster, which said earlier this year inflation would reach 2.4% by the end of 2017.Inflation has already begun to rise steeply. It jumped markedly in February to 2.3% to overtake regular wage rises, which only inched ahead by 1.9% month on month.NIESR said wage growth was likely to pick up over the rest of the year, but remain well below inflation, denying the average worker a real terms rise.Simon Kirby, NIESR＊s UK economic forecaster, said that with inflation already hitting 2.3%, the OBR would be forced to revise its forecast upwards.He said: ※GDP growth over the next couple of years will be subdued, growing at less than the economy＊s long-run potential rate of 2% per annum, but households will feel the pinch from rising consumer price inflation.§He added: ※The rate of inflation is expected to rise from 2.3% per annum in March to almost 3.5% by the end of 2017. By 2018 we expect consumer spending growth to have effectively stalled.§Kirby said a previous forecast that predicted inflation would hit 3.7% had been revised lower in response to reports showing that the impact of the falling pound would be spread over a longer period.NIESR said that despite the squeeze on disposable incomes the GDP growth rate would pick up from 1.7% this year to 1.9% in 2018.It said moves towards Brexit since the vote to quit the EU last June had made little impact on its forecasts. It said the triggering of article 50 had only a short term impact on financial markets, leaving the economy to move ahead, albeit at a slower pace than before the vote.Kirby said the labour market remained ※robust§ with an unemployment rate of 4.7% and an employment rate hitting a record high in the three months to February of 74.6%.But he said surveys continued to show that millions of workers want an increase in the number of hours they work, showing that firms could increase output without taking on new staff or increasing hourly rates.※Despite the strong performance of the labour market, real wages growth remains subdued, perhaps indicating some slack remains,§ he said.Bank of England officials are expected to  of 0.25% when they meet on Thursday to offer continued support to the economy and the jobs market.Economists forecast that just one policymaker, Kristin Forbes, will vote for a rate rise to quell inflation, while the other seven members will consider the increase in prices to be temporary.Kirby said he expected the BoE＊s monetary policy committee to keep rates on hold until after the UK has quit the EU in 2019 when it will start to rise towards 2% in the latter half of 2022.A report by NIESR on the global economy said increasing activity in the developing countries would push GDP growth higher following a four year low point in 2016.Risks to the forecast came from the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal and US president Donald Trump introducing protectionist policies, but without these threats, the outlook was for an improving global growth rate.

"Larry Elliott＊s attack on economic policy (, 8 May) does not go far enough. Real GDP per head just crept back in 2015 to the level it was in 2007. Given that productive resources did not fall in that period, this represents a?complete waste. It is worse than that. Real GDP per head shows a very strong trend going back decades.If we take that trend line as a measure of productive capacity, the waste is much higher; the loss up to 2016 is roughly ?25,000 per head. Moreover it is?caused by the destructive blood-letting that is austerity. I recall the 2010 Tory slogan that promised to ※cut the deficit, not the NHS§. Ha! Philip Inman is so right (, 9 May). In January I tried to purchase a replacement car 每 same garage, make and model 每 with the money in my bank to pay for it. The garage wasn＊t interested in anything but a PCP (personal contract purchase) deal. The amount they offered for a part-exchange was minimal, but the add-ons for a leasing deal were considerable; in vain did I protest that I never used credit (other than for a mortgage).Despite considering myself financially competent, I found difficulty in understanding exactly what this deal involved and had to check several times 每 clearly staff commission for a PCP must be significant. At no point was I asked about credit history. I considered going elsewhere but it seems this sort of PCP sales pressure is ubiquitous. I now intend to pay off the full amount in the next few months because I resent having a debt that I neither need nor want. But there are many not in this happy position who may well find themselves in serious financial difficulty. I see that the 1,000 richest people in the UK have combined wealth of ?658bn (, 8 May) and that in the last year that wealth has increased by ?83bn. That＊s an average increase of ?83m each. The UK average annual income is ?27,000, which means it would take the working lifetime of over 70 people to amass what is just the increase in one year for the richest 1,000. It would be interesting to know what tax is paid by these people on what will largely be an unearned capital gain. This is obscene and provides an unanswerable case for a substantial wealth tax. That the government chooses to do nothing about it is a clear policy choice, as is the austerity foisted on those at the bottom of the income and wealth scale. Are these the hard-working just about managing that Theresa May bangs on about?"															
"Slower economic growth and higher inflation present  policymakers with a delicate balancing act when they meet this week to set interest rates and agree new forecasts for the UK as it goes through an election and Brexit talks.The Bank＊s monetary policy committee (MPC) is widely expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25% to offer continued support to the economy and the jobs market. Economists forecast that just one policymaker, Kristin Forbes, will vote for a rate rise, sticking to  amid worries about inflation picking up too fast. The rest will opt to leave policy unchanged, according to a Reuters poll of City economists.Alongside its decision on Thursday, the Bank will publish updated forecasts in its quarterly ※inflation report§, incorporating a host of new developments since its last outlook in February. Compared with that previous report,  than the Bank predicted and  as . On top of that, the government has officially  with the rest of the EU and .※The MPC will have to acknowledge that it is confronted with a slightly more difficult trade-off for policy-setting than previously, but we don＊t foresee a change from its core neutral stance,§ said Sam Hill, senior UK economist at RBC Capital Markets.Weighing up how the eight policymakers at this week＊s meeting will vote, Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec, noted that  showed worries about inflation went beyond Forbes. The rest of the committee also appeared to be more open to considering tighter policy, she said."															
"The eurozone economy has grown twice as fast as the UK in recent months, according to official figures that underscore the divergence between Britain and its neighbouring currency bloc after the Brexit vote.GDP in the 19 countries that use the euro expanded 0.6% in the second quarter of 2017, building on growth of 0.5% in the first quarter, according the  (pdf). In the UK by contrast, the latest official figures released last week showed  of 2017 following 0.2% expansion in the first three months of the year. The economy had shown resilience in the immediate aftermath of last year＊s EU referendum, confounding forecasts of a downturn. But growth has slowed markedly since the turn of the year as a weaker pound has raised the cost of imports, pushed up inflation and squeezed consumers.In the eurozone, growth has quickened and unemployment has fallen against the backdrop of ultra-low interest rates and other measures by the European Central Bank (ECB) to boost activity. Eurostat said second-quarter GDP was up 2.1% compared with a year earlier, the fastest growth since 2011 and in line with forecasts by economists in a Reuters poll.Bert Colijn, a senior eurozone economist at the bank ING, said the bloc had enjoyed a ※surprisingly strong§ first half to 2017.Eurostat did not provide any detail about what had driven growth in Tuesday＊s early estimate of GDP but Colijn said domestic demand continued to be an important factor. He added: ※Some countries have already released their first estimates of second-quarter GDP growth, showing that the expansion is broad-based within the eurozone. France, Spain, Austria and Belgium all recorded solid growth rates.§※All in all, the eurozone economy has rounded out the first half of the year in a very healthy state and seems to be set up nicely for continued firm growth for the rest of 2017.§While UK growth was slower over the first half of this year, some business surveys have suggested it could quicken in the second half. The latest check on manufacturing on Tuesday pointed to a rise in activity in July, helped by strong growth in export orders.The headline index on the  (pdf) rose to 55.1 in July, from 54.2 in June. The reading was well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction and beat economists＊ forecasts for 54.4.Job creation quickened, production picked up and order books improved, according to the poll of purchasing managers at more than 600 industrial companies.Rob Dobson, an economist at the survey＊s compilers, IHS Markit, said it showed UK manufacturing 每 which makes up a tenth of the UK economy 每 had started the third quarter on a solid footing.He highlighted particularly solid growth in UK exports, which have been made more competitive by the pound＊s sharp drop after the Brexit vote and have benefitted from a strengthening global economy.※Although the exchange rate remains a key driver of export growth, manufacturers also benefitted from stronger economic growth in key markets in the euro area, North America and Asia-Pacific regions,§ Dobson said. ※Continued expansion is also still filtering through to the labour market, with the latest round of manufacturing job creation among the best seen over the past three years.§The report will provide more fuel to the debate among policymakers at the Bank of England over when to raise interest rates from their record low of 0.25%. The monetary policy committee meets this week to make its latest decision on borrowing costs and to release new forecasts for the economy. The committee was , with three members wanting to increase borrowing costs to curb inflation while the other five preferred to keep them on hold to shore up growth and employment.Policymakers would be reassured by signs in the PMI report that manufacturers＊ cost pressures eased in July, said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to forecasting body, the EY ITEM Club. Input prices rose at the slowest pace in more than a year, according to the survey.※The survey pointed to a further marked easing of price pressures in the manufacturing sector in July, which fuels hope that UK inflation is close to peaking and will go down well at the Bank of England,§ said Archer."															
															
"The outgoing chairman of Britain＊s biggest bank, HSBC, has called for an overhaul of financial crime detection as he sounded the alarm over the impact of  and attempts to fragment global financial regulation.Douglas Flint＊s warning came as HSBC reported a  (?7.8bn) and announced a $2bn share buy-back 每 propelling the shares to a four year high.Flint, who has been at  for 22 years and chairman for the last six, used his last statement at the bank to call for the rules designed since the financial crisis to be implemented globally. He also warned on the impact of Brexit on Europe＊s financial markets.As the bank admitted for the first time that reorganising its business for Brexit will cost up to $300m (?228m), Flint said: ※The essential questions that have to be addressed are whether, at the conclusion of the negotiations, the economies of Europe will continue to have access to at least the same amount of financing capacity and related risk management services, and as readily available and similarly priced, as they have enjoyed with the UK as part of the EU.§He also warned that divergence in regulation ran the risk of ※skewing§ financial market activity to where the rules were less onerous, and he called for more cooperation among regulators to root out ※bad actors§. ※What is ＃ clear is that greater cooperation between the public and private sectors, together with a refresh of bank secrecy laws and regulation designed for a different age, would significantly increase the effectiveness of our joint efforts,§ Flint said. Among the ideas he endorsed was a mandatory register of beneficial ownership of corporate structures in every country.The City is focused on HSBC＊s attempts to clean up its business after a series of scandals about the tax avoidance strategies used by its Swiss arm and , which led to a monitor being installed at the bank as part of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA).US lawyer Michael Cherkasky was appointed as the monitor five years ago and his concerns have prompted an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into .Cherkasky＊s final report is scheduled for next March after which it will be up to the DoJ to decide whether the terms of the DPA have been met.The results were accompanied by pages of legal warnings, including a legal case which began in April 2017 into allegations that HSBC conspired with other banks to manipulate the the US bond market. There are other disclosures covering requests for information relating to the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca and investigations by tax authorities. HSBC also said it was cooperating with the DoJ over the way it packaged up toxic bonds in the run-up to the 20008 financial crisis. The investigation by DoJ, which has already reached settlements with eight other banks, is nearing completion, it added.In the UK, HSBC＊s results included a $300m hit for the payment protection insurance scandal. HSBC also said it had moved 170,000 accounts to new sort codes to comply with the new ringfencing protocols, known as the Vickers rules, which come into force at the start of 2019. Implementing these rules, which ring-fence high street bank operations from riskier investment banks, has cost ?500m and involved 2,000 staff.Stuart Gulliver, the bank＊s chief executive, focused on the amount paid out to shareholders in the last year. ※In the past 12 months we have paid more in dividends than any other European or American bank and returned $3.5bn to shareholders through share buybacks,§ said Gulliver, who in the financial stages of a global plan to make savings of $5bn, cut 25,000 jobs and ※pivot§ the business towards Asia.HSBC has previously said Brexit could force the bank to move , which Gulliver said would help avoid a loss $1bn of revenue.He reitterated his intention to retire next year while Flint said there was strong list of internal candidates."															
"he worst is clearly behind us.§ Panaghiota Mourtidou pondered the words with a gravity unusual for the jovial volunteer. Even now, several days after the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, , she still feels somewhat bewildered. ※Politicians clearly have no idea of the reality on the ground,§ she said. ※If they did, they wouldn＊t make such pronouncements because, really, it couldn＊t be worse.§It is four years since the Guardian met Mourtidou packing food boxes at the Solidarity Club which she and other concerned citizens were running out of the local branch of Tsipras＊s then radical  party. At the time, the leftist was an ardent fan of the only political force she truly believed could pull Greece from the depths of financial collapse.Tsipras＊s promise to stamp out austerity, his raised fist and fiery rhetoric appealed to her sense of justice. In the summer of 2013 每 almost 18 months before assuming power 每 he was ※our big hope, the big promise of better days§. But the politician＊s volte-face, his enactment of some of the most gruelling budget cuts and tax rises since Greece＊s great economic crisis began, has driven a wedge through any optimism she may have had.Today, the Solidarity Club operates not out of the party＊s local premises but a former grocery store up the road. Mourtidou now finds herself struggling with sentiments that veer between disappointment and rage.※Tell me, how can anyone survive on a basic wage of 490 (?438) and still pay all the taxes they have passed?§ she asks, stacking rice, pasta and pulses destined for the needy she encounters daily.※There are 51 families who depend on us, and a lot of them feel desperate. OK,  has escaped bankruptcy, it has even dipped its toes in the markets again but, so what if its people have been left bankrupt in the process?§With its brightly coloured furniture, open doors and do-good William James motto, the Solidarity Club is testimony to the endurance of Greeks under duress. Eight years on, the country＊s debt drama, its brutal internal deflation to avert euro exit and austerity-driven downturn, have decimated districts like this.For the Solidarity Club stands not in one of Athens＊ poorer suburbs 每 areas where citizens have long lived on, or beneath, the bread line 每 but in Koukaki, the neighbourhood favoured by those who want to be close to the Acropolis but can＊t afford to reside on, or off, the boulevard that surrounds it.It is in Koukaki that Chryssa Christodoulaki and her husband, Anestis, have lived for close to 50 years.Until the outbreak of the crisis when she was compelled by crippling taxes to close her salon, the French-trained hairdresser had paid into a pension fund for almost 45 years 每 contributions that yielded a decent income before budget cuts whittled it away. ※At first it was a fairly good pension at 1,750 a month,§ she recalled.※Then it was cut to 1,430 a month and now its 960 a month,§ she sighed. ※Anestis has suffered, too. All his life he worked in a private company only to see his own pension cut considerably.§The language of progress undone does not come naturally. In the wake of military dictatorship 每 and 43 years of peaceful democratic rule 每 life had only got better. Now the couple are no longer sure if they belong to the middle class. Hopes of spending their latter years in Crete have been dashed; so, too, have plans of a work-free retirement.※We talk about it often,§ says the 68-year-old, who has private clients to make ends meet. ※The middle class has certain comforts. We＊ve become poorer and have adult children who can＊t find work, who don＊t want to go abroad and who rely on us. That＊s the worst. An entire generation who have only known crisis, who may never be able to find work or have a family and future.§Athens, like most urban centres, has been hardest hit by a crisis that has seen the country＊s economic output contract by a devastating 26%. A study by the DiaNeosis thinktank found that 15% of the population, or 1,647,703 people, in 2015 earned below the extreme poverty threshold. In 2009 that number did not exceed 2.2%. The net wealth of Greek households fell by a precipitous 40% in the same period, according to the Bank of Greece. Unemployment, austerity＊s most pernicious effect, hovers around 22%, by far the highest in the EU, despite a 5% drop in the last two years.Although the worst is over in terms of fiscal adjustment, few believe Greece will be able to escape a fourth bailout even if Athens regains market access when its current EU-IMF sponsored programme ends in August next year. ※It is very difficult to see the country being able to make a clean exit [from international stewardship] and raise the sort of money it needs to refinance its debt,§ said Kyriakos Pierrakakis, director of research at DiaNeosis. ※It will almost certainly need a new financial credit line, a bailout light, and that will come with new conditions.§In such circumstances, faith in government claims that the country has turned the corner 每 based as much on last week＊s market foray as completion of a landmark compliance review and disbursement of 8.5bn in bailout funds 每 is in short supply.※Greeks can＊t see any light at the end of any tunnel,§ said Christodoulaki, shaking her head in disbelief. ※They won＊t believe anything at this point until they see it for real in front of their eyes.§Across town in the communist party stronghold of Kaisariani, municipal authorities are already preparing for winter. In the giant 1960s concrete town hall, the social services department has lined up fundraising events, including concerts and theatre performances, to finance food donations that local stores and supermarkets can no longer afford to make. ※Needs have grown exponentially,§ said Marilena Christodoulou, her office wall adorned with the slogan ※poverty is not a crime§. ※The crisis has gone on for so long that those who could once help are also suffering. We have 367 seriously deprived people on our books and the number is rising daily.§But the pessimism spawned by pauperisation has also resulted in growing forms of solidarity. On the other side of the Acropolis in Kerameikos, the Greek Orthodox priest Father Ignatios oversees the Galini soup kitchen, an ever-expanding operation that houses the homeless, provides free dental care and study groups for children.Those who invariably sign up for such services are the ※invisible poor§ 每 people who still have a roof over their heads but through dint of debt or joblessness cannot pay their bills. ※A lot are very typically middle class who don＊t want to come forward, who are ashamed,§ he lamented. ※It is getting worse. We need help, a lot more help.§From the onset of the crisis, Ignatios＊s crew of volunteers has cooked 350 meals a day, but with demand mounting has increasingly come to rely on donations from the country＊s pre-eminent food rescue organisation, Boroume.The brainchild of Xenia Papastavrou, the group has saved and donated over 14m portions of food since its initiation in 2011. Though phenomenally successful, Papastavrou said there was no time for volunteers to let down their guard. In the four years since our last interview, the crisis has morphed into a hydra-headed monster, affecting ordinary Greeks in ways both cruel and unforeseen.※It has come in waves,§ said the British-trained classicist who now heads the Giving for Greece initiative at the Bodossaki Foundation. ※At every level of society a new wave presents new challenges that can only be addressed if the church, state and private sectors collaborate so that resources aren＊t lost, help is given where it is needed most and all these solidarity groups have the greatest possible impact.§For those affected hardest by Greece＊s bankruptcy ordeal, the Syriza government has been praised for providing food vouchers and rental subsidies, free school meals and hospital care for some 2.5 million uninsured.※For the poorest of the poor Syriza has been good,§ said Mourtidou. ※But it has not done what the vast majority hoped and that is very dangerous. Tsipras had a calming effect when he came along. There isn＊t another Tsipras to promise us the world and now I fear the earth could be trembling under our feet. The next choice could be the far right.§It is a common concern. Greeks have responded to loss with fortitude and resilience but a mood of uncertainty prevails. Amid the rage and disappointment many worry the power of loss could assume other more menacing forms.※Uncertainty is the new normality,§ psychology professor Fotini Tsalikoglou noted. ※It could manifest itself in apathy, violence, more uncertainty, we just don＊t know.§"															
"here have been periods in the past in which the Bank of England has left interest rates . In 1719, official borrowing costs were raised from 4% to 5%, where they remained during the , the , the loss of the American colonies, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. In 1822, Seven years after the Battle of Waterloo, the Bank decided it was again time to act and reduced rates to their level of 103 years earlier.By comparison with their 18th and early 19th century forbears, the current crop of policymakers in Threadneedle Street are positively hasty.  in March 2009 and left there for a mere seven-and-a-half years. A year ago, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, . And there they are likely to stay. When the Bank＊s monetary policy committee last met, three of the eight members said the post-referendum  making it possible to push rates back up to 0.5%. That caused a flurry of speculation that this week＊s MPC meeting would result in the first rate rise in more than a decade. It would be wise not to bet your mortgage on it. The case for an increase was never all that strong and is weaker than when the MPC last met in June.  in the first half of the year, running at an annualised rate of 1%. While above its 2% target,  to 2.6% and looks to be close to a peak. There are few signs that workers have been able to use the  caused by the fall in the value of the pound to negotiate higher pay awards.Those advocating a rate rise say the Bank needs to give itself some room for manoeuvre in the event of there being another recession. The logic of this is not immediately obvious. Raising interest rates when the economy is struggling and consumer debt has been rising rapidly would risk triggering the recession the Bank is keen to avoid. Borrowing costs would go up only to come down again.  It is the same story around the developed world. Central banks are uncomfortable with interest rates at historically low levels. They would like to sell back to the financial markets the bonds they bought in their quantitative easing programmes. But that＊s easier said than done. Only in the US , and even there, the Federal Reserve is moving at a snail＊s pace. The European Central Bank is not remotely close to tightening policy, nor is the Bank of Japan. Hope springs eternal. Since the financial crisis broke 10 years ago, policymakers have viewed the disruption as a temporary phenomenon. Growth would pick up. Productivity would rise. Inflationary pressure would increase.  would return to more normal levels.It hasn＊t happened. The first convulsions in the financial markets  and a decade on, it is getting ever harder to see the crisis as a temporary phenomenon. Instead, the period before the crash now looks like the modern equivalent of the Edwardian summer before the outbreak of the first world war.The economic historian Angus Madison has produced figures for growth per head of population for western countries going back centuries. In the UK, GDP per head growth averaged 1.26% a year between 1820 and 1870, decelerated to 1.01% a year from 1870 to 1913, and then fell again to 0.92% in the period from 1913 to 1950 that included two world wars and the Great Depression. There was then a marked improvement to 2.44% a year in the period from 1950 to 1973, followed by a fresh decline to 1.79% in the quarter century from 1973 to 1998.Since the economy last peaked in early 2008, growth in GDP per head has averaged about 0.2% a year, in line with the performance of the economy between 1500 and 1820.The underlying performance of the UK economy is probably not quite as bad as that, but the trend has been poor enough for long enough to consider whether the really strong growth in the period after the second world war was the exception.There is plenty of supporting evidence for this notion. Economic growth in the G7 has been declining since the 1960s. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that potential per capita growth among its 34 rich-country members is 1% a year. The American economist Robert Gordon said only in one relatively brief period 每 1996 to 2004 每 has US productivity matched the growth rates of the golden age after the second world war, and that was .By 2000, Gordon said, every office was equipped with web-linked personal computers that could do not just word processing, but download all sorts of information and perform calculations at high speed. By 2005, the transition to the modern office was complete with the arrival of flatscreens, but then the progress stopped. As in the UK, US productivity growth since the financial crisis has been slow.There will be profound implications if, and it remains an if, this is the new normal. For a start, growth oscillating around a 1% trend will result in more recessions. Inflationary pressure will be weak and deflationary episodes will be common. In the 19th century, there was no assumption that the cost of living would rise year in and year out: indeed, the price level was lower in 1914 than it had been in 1815. Weaker growth, in itself, would not necessarily be a bad thing. It might actually be a good thing if it meant less systematic damage being caused to the environment. Living standards in the developed world are already high, so does it really matter if they are increasing at 1% a year rather than 2% a year?The answer to that question depends on how the fruits of that growth are distributed. If they are apportioned so the neediest benefit the most, this would be one thing. If they go disproportionately to the 1%, while the other 99% have to accept flat living standards and deteriorating public services, this would create conditions ripe for social and political upheaval.Central banks have provided unprecedented amounts of stimulus in the past decade, but the payoff has been poor. That alone should raise serious doubts about whether there will ever be a return to the days when living standards doubled in a quarter of a century. Instead, we need to be prepared for a world in which there will be a bitter struggle over the meagre spoils of growth."															
"Britain will be hit by huge border delays, require vast lorry parks in the south-east, and suffer more than ?1bn a year in economic damage, according to a stark economic analysis of the likely impact of customs checks after .Additional costs associated with potential motorway queues, extra customs staff and jobs lost as a result of companies relocating mean even that assessment is ※extremely conservative§, a study by a leading economic consultancy warns.The alarming assessment, by the Europe-wide Oxera consultancy, sets out what it describes as the most likely impact of the new border checks imposed after Brexit. The warning comes after Michel Barnier, the European Union＊s chief Brexit negotiator, ruled that the government＊s hopes of securing ※frictionless§ trade outside the EU was not possible. It also follows a week in which cabinet Brexiters signalled they were ready to adopt a comprehensive transitional deal for up to three years, as ministers attempt to buy time to tackle a series of unresolved policy challenges raised by Brexit.The complexities of creating a new customs regime as close as possible to the current arrangements is one of the major concerns for the Treasury, as it seeks to avoid serious disruption. Tory MPs are already sounding the alarm over potential gridlock at the border.The Oxera analysis paper, written by its head of transport Andrew Meaney and seen by the , finds that the most likely outcome would be a scenario it describes as ※slow trade: low regulation, high enforcement§.※Enforcement is either undertaken at the ports, or on a random checks basis,§ it states. ※However, the number of staff involved increases substantially, and many consignments are subject to lengthy checks.※We estimate the impact of such a scenario to be at least ?1bn per year. This is an extremely conservative estimate 每 it does not account for the economic costs of the uncertainty involved, the extra staff needed (for hauliers, ports and customs officials), the congestion associated with calling [which sees the M20 used as a makeshift lorry park], the land required for the additional customs checks [in the form of lorry parks], or of the wider economic impacts of jobs moving overseas due to uncertainty over the operation of just-in-time logistics. The full cost is likely to be much higher.§The study also sounds the alarm over a new customs IT system due to be delivered just as Britain leaves the EU.※It was agreed well before the referendum was announced that the current HMRC customs clearance system, , would be replaced in March 2019,§ it states. ※It＊s now due to be delivered just before we leave the EU and, having been planned to deliver 60m clearances per annum, it will now need to deliver 300m per year, with no understanding yet of what the customs deal with the EU looks like.§An  spokesman said the new system was ※on track for delivery by January 2019§.※We took the decision to bring in a new declaration system before the EU referendum, but the service remains fully capable of dealing with how the UK＊s exit from the EU will impact on customs declarations at the border.§Charlie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover and Deal, said the report ※underlines why we must take action now to ensure we are ready on day one for every eventuality. With fellow MPs, I have been urging the Treasury to move faster in preparing our border for Brexit,§ he said. ※Especially to take on board that the border is a tax point 每 not a search point 每 and that with digital borders, customs clearance can be managed incredibly quickly. In Singapore, clearance takes less than a minute.§Tim Waggott, chief executive of the Port of Dover, said that issues around a new set of customs clearance and border control procedures ※are acute§.※In 2016, almost 2.6m freight units and over 12 million passengers transited the port,§ he said. ※Maintaining fluidity at the Dover Straits to protect and promote UK-European land-based trade flows must be one of the key imperatives during the Brexit talks.§The Oxera report warns that past delays in building the new lorry parks risk motorway tailbacks in Kent. It says that the impact of delays and checks, known as ※non-tariff barriers§, risks forcing companies to move supply chains into the EU. ※Clearly, the UK elements of this chain are at risk if the cost and uncertainty created by customs checks (which can vary considerably in duration) are deemed to outweigh the benefits of doing business in the UK,§ it states.It adds that a solution is needed urgently, as businesses need to know ※very soon the customs rules under which they will be trading§.※The decision cannot be part of a last-minute deal on the eve of Brexit, due to the time it will take to get trade moving under the new arrangements,§ it states. ※The costs to logistics businesses and their customers, users of the road network and, eventually, jobs in the UK of a relatively limited increase in friction will be considerable.§A government spokesman said: ※The relationship we＊re seeking with the EU has been set out in the white paper and Lancaster House speech. We want a comprehensive free trade agreement and a new customs agreement which allows for trade which is as frictionless as possible 每 this is in the interests of businesses in the UK and across the EU.§"															
" was destined to live an ordinary life. He failed the Chinese university entrance exam several times before being accepted by the worst school in Hangzhou, and he was rejected from a dozen jobs 每 even selling chicken at KFC. Ma was ready to settle into a quiet life?as an English teacher in eastern China, a position with few advancement prospects, when, during a trip to Seattle in 1995 working as a translator for a trade delegation, everything changed.A friend showed Ma the internet. He placed a toe on to the information superhighway with a one-word search 每 ※beer§ 每 and, two decades later, Ma is the richest man in Asia, head of an e-commerce and finance empire that includes , one of the largest retailers in the world.Now Ma has once again set his sights on the US. In a high-profile meeting with Donald Trump before the inauguration, Ma promised to create 1m jobs in the US, and has wasted no time ingratiating himself into Trump＊s inner circle. He has dined alone with Ivanka Trump, and last week commerce secretary  at a meeting of US and Chinese businessmen. Those political connections may benefit him as he seeks to acquire American companies in a country that is increasingly wary of big Chinese investment.For Trump, the headlines of Ma＊s job-creating scheme may be more important that any actual jobs created.※As a merchant, it＊s about knowing your customer, and Trump doesn＊t care about anything that＊s not huge,§ says Duncan Clark, a longtime friend and author of . ※He figured a million is a good number to get Trump＊s attention. ※Realistically, without a major acquisition, I fail to see how that＊s possible,§ he adds. ※In the US context, it＊s a very big number.§For years, Ma has been pushing his vision of  to Chinese shoppers through his online marketplaces. He is often called the ※Jeff Bezos of China§, and there are clear similarities. Both built e-commerce empires and, like Bezos and the, Ma even owns a an old established newspaper, in his case Hong Kong＊s .But there＊s a key difference: while Bezos＊s Amazon sells products to consumers, maintaining massive warehouses and operating a sophisticated logistics network, Alibaba＊s sites are simply a medium, connecting consumers with merchants who ship through independent couriers. This has led experts to say Alibaba＊s business model is closer to Google＊s than Amazon＊s. has always been solving inefficiencies, creating a website that allowed a host of businesses to sell directly to consumers during the infancy of the internet in China and starting an online payment system when it was cumbersome to wire funds. The company＊s flagship platforms, Taobao (similar to eBay) and Tmall (similar to Amazon), have created a one-stop shop for consumers, and Alibaba is exporting the model to emerging markets such as Russia and?Brazil.But the US presents a new challenge, and e-commerce is already a crowded space. Alibaba may not have what it takes to spur massive job creation in the US. ※It＊s an incredibly unlikely target for job creation in any plausible time frame,§ said Christopher Balding, a professor of business and economics at Peking University＊s HSBC business school. ※If we＊re talking 25 or 40 years, maybe  could create that many jobs.§By comparison, WalMart, the largest private employer in the US, . If Ma is able to deliver on his promise of 1m jobs, it would decrease the number of  by a staggering 14%.Ma was born in the scenic city of Hangzhou in 1964, two years before the start of the , a decade of political upheaval that saw his parents and grandfather persecuted by elements of the ruling Communist party. His father beat him, according to a 2013 biography, but Ma found his escape in teaching himself English. From the age of 12, Ma would cycle for 40 minutes to the city＊s hotels to offer foreign tourists his services as a guide around the West Lake so that he could practise his?English.※The west was his lifeline in a land where he wasn＊t on the elite track,§ says Duncan Clark. ※He struggled in school, he＊s not an engineer, he＊s not a technical guy, so he became an English teacher.§ Ma＊s ability to read an audience, though, is on a par with a standup comedian, Clark adds, and some have described his charisma as ※Jack Magic§.That charm is increasingly being directed at Trump administration officials. But beyond the million-jobs propaganda story, Ma is working to convince the US government that his intentions are innocuous as he makes , the  in a deal that has raised national-security?concerns.※His repeat performances with Trump and his administration show he is making significant inroads,§ says Michael Wessel, head of the , a oversight body that reports to Congress. ※Ma isn＊t interested in America succeeding, he＊s interested in Ma, Alibaba and China succeeding. As a skilled, global businessman, Ma is operating in his own interest which, at times, might also be the interests of the Chinese Communist party. That has to be considered whenever he acts.§The MoneyGram deal has  from lawmakers in Washington, hinging on the fact that a large number of military families use the company to transfer money. The purchase is yet to be approved by US regulators in a process that could see the matter decided by Trump.Last year, Alibaba admitted that the US Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the accounting practices of its logistics network and its huge Singles＊ Day online shopping event 每 it＊s like Black Friday but much, much bigger 每 a matter that has yet to be resolved.At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, , saying that while America benefited from globalisation, it was squandering trillions of dollars on foreign wars and neglecting the country＊s infrastructure and its own citizens.Back in China, Ma＊s ties to the government have been invaluable. At a time when Chinese president Xi Jinping is signalling that companies should rein in overseas purchases, Ma＊s continuing push in the US is a clear sign of his political clout. And in 2014, when China＊s state administration for industry and commerce published findings showing that more than 70% of goods in a random sample , Ma met with the head of the agency, who subsequently claimed that the report was merely the minutes of a meeting and ※had no legal effect§.While Ma hopes to encourage American small businesses to sell on the company＊s high-end marketplace, Tmall, in December 2016 the US government put its much larger sister site, Taobao, on a blacklist of  known for the sale of counterfeit goods and violations of intellectual property?rights .The blacklisting was not the first setback for Alibaba. The company was burned on its first attempts to expand into the US when, shortly after founding the company, Ma was forced to shut down an office it opened just outside San Francisco after less than a year. Another venture 每 an  like Amazon called 11 main 每 was shuttered in 2015.Despite these hurdles, Ma is pushing on with his dream for US businesses to sell to China through his websites. In June, Alibaba hosted a conference, Gateway, in Detroit, which was aimed at bringing more small firms into its ecosystem. One of the speakers, something of a poster child for Alibaba, was Sam Wolf, who turned his family＊s vitamin store in suburban Philadelphia into an online giant selling 40,000 products around the world. His company, LuckyVitamin, started selling on Tmall in November and Wolf estimates he has hired about 20 employees since then, though only a fraction deal with  directly, with most working in inventory or?accounting.But when LuckyVitamin began selling in China, it already had the experience of expanding into more than 30 countries around the world, and Wolf warned that opening a shop on Tmall was the most challenging.※Selling on Tmall is like starting a new business, as opposed to simply adding a new channel for sales,§ Wolf says. ※It＊s not a light switch, it＊s not a get-rich-quick opportunity where you can just double your business overnight by opening the door to China. It＊s a marathon, not a sprint. Anybody who comes to Tmall with get-rich-quick aspirations is going to be disappointed.§Along with LuckyVitamin, Ma has convinced a handful of other businesses to sell through his websites. To fulfil his promise of 1m jobs, he needs more than 50,000 companies to replicate Wolf＊s success in the next few years.By then, or course, Trump will likely have moved on to his next pet project, and Ma, the English teacher turned tech billionaire, will have greased the wheels in the world＊s two largest economies."															
"he French economy is growing at the same pace the UK managed in 2016 and looks set to maintain it for the rest of the year. Growth for the second quarter was 0.5% and 1.8% over the past year. Meanwhile the UK is shuffling along in the slow lane, up just 0.3% between April and June.Does the reversal of fortunes tell us that  has found its mojo while the UK has done worse than let its foot slip off the accelerator?There is certainly a swagger to president  as he surveys a scene his predecessor Fran?ois Hollande dreamed about. Consistent growth is something that has eluded the French ever since the financial crash, as one false start after another robbed the economy of whatever momentum it had.With Greek bankruptcy averted and the refugee crisis contained, at least in the view of the Brussels bureaucrats, France can grow again without hindrance while Germany and Spain maintain their stellar record of expansion. Italy may still be struggling, but now that its banks, like Greece＊s, are shored up with extra government cash, its ailing finances are to some extent ringfenced.France is in the clear. To emphasise the point, unemployment is now at its lowest since the eurozone crisis, inflation is under control, and business surveys reveal the best confidence levels in a decade.Most importantly, exports jumped 3.1% 每 after a 0.7% contraction in the previous quarter 每 and household spending growth inched up slightly to 0.3% in the latest quarter, from 0.1%.But few analysts in the French financial services industry think the surge is more than a cyclical rebound. The return of business confidence follows Macron＊s election, the absence of financial disasters inside the EU and the cheap money flowing out of the European Central Bank, which is having the same effect now on France that the Bank of England＊s quantitative easing had on the UK economy in 2013.A structural recovery is one based on sustained increases in investment 每 public and private 每 and improvements in productivity that propel wages growth and higher standards of living for all.Macron expects that a mix of neo-liberal supply-side reforms to a labour market dominated by union rules, and an attack on cosy business practices allied to directives from the Elys谷e Palace to reform the public sector, will bring about the mix of policies needed to achieve this aim.But all his talk of industrial strategies is much like Theresa May＊s 每 empty when he has little money to spend and French businesses, much like their British counterparts, are unwilling to invest.That means France will continue to rely, as the British economy does, on armies of young people working for low pay on short-term contracts to keep the wheels turning.There is a silver lining, however. In the three months ending in May, world trade in goods grew by 5.1%, almost back to the growth rates seen prior to the financial crisis (the average rate then was 6.7%).While Britain is hampered by Brexit uncertainty, France has the capacity to join Germany in exporting more of its high-grade machine tools, pharmaceuticals, aeroplanes and lorries to emerging markets. France has hung on to less of its industrial heritage than Germany, but has apprenticeship schemes and polytechnical educational establishments that put Britain＊s to shame.Rebuilding the UK＊s technical skills after four decades of decline will take some time. Further education colleges are on their knees and, to shore up their finances, universities are looking abroad for students even more than usual. The Brexit dividend of homegrown talent that will foster growth looks like a mirage to anyone in the education business.That leaves Macron in a position where he only needs to achieve a fraction of the reforms he has planned for France to accelerate out of trouble, leaving the UK in its wake.Thursday was ※an exciting day§ for Virgin Atlantic, Sir Richard Branson wrote to his staff, as the airline＊s founder and left Delta with the biggest stake. But there were elegiac notes in the letter, recalling the decades when his airline was pitched as the upstart, punching above its weight. Now, Virgin has firmly sided with the big boys, and Branson can no longer control its destiny.Staff may be less than reassured by Branson promise that the  brand would live on. The Atlantic suffix is apt: the airline has flown more and more on established routes to the US since the first Delta hook-up in 2012. But Virgin＊s wings have been clipped, with riskier routes to Africa and Asia cut back.To exit with ?220m from Air France-KLM tucked away is an honourable retreat for an ageing knight. Airlines have had a good three or four years on the back of low oil prices, but the days of wafer-thin margins and teetering businesses are never far away. Virgin＊s own return to profit is now menaced by Brexit and the falling pound.Branson claimed to have proved Willie Walsh wrong. The chief executive of British Airways parent IAG said in 2012 that the Virgin Atlantic brand was likely to disappear if Delta took control. Branson may yet emerge technically victorious, but Walsh＊s prognosis that smaller airlines would be swallowed up looks prescient. This deal was hastened partly because of the travails of another partner of Delta and Air France-KLM: national carrier Alitalia, perennially kept on life support by Rome.Where full mergers are blocked by foreign ownership rules, joint ventures on lucrative routes, such as British Airways＊ tie-up with American, have become the strategic alternative. But where permitted, consolidation has been the story: the US ※big four§ are the prime example. Although Virgin traditionally prized its independence, Branson has also concluded that it was now time to join forces.RIP Libor. The interest rate benchmark linked to a series of bank scandals , Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, has announced.There have been various attempts to reform the index, used to price more than $350 trillion of financial products around the world, after it emerged that banks had been manipulating the rate.But as Bailey admitted last week, banks no longer want to participate in the setting of  每 the London interbank offered rate.Regulators did not ※suspect further wrongdoing or have any evidence of such§, he insisted. But it certainly feels like the right time to retire a rate that has taken on toxic connotations in the wake of the financial crisis.Now the search starts for an alternative. So it＊s a good job the regulators have given themselves five years to come up with something that will be a lot less prone to manipulation than Libor of old."															
"hat have David Cameron (Tory prime minister, 2010-16), and  (Labour prime minister, 1964-70 and 1974-76) got in common?Answer: in order to keep their respective parties together, because they were split over ※Europe§, each of them called a referendum. Wilson triumphed, and went down in history as a consummate politician, indeed statesman. Cameron failed lamentably, and his mishandling of this vital issue is sometimes described as the biggest prime ministerial disaster brought upon the nation since Lord North lost the American colonies.The Conservative party is probably split even more over Europe now than it was before; and, although the extent of the disaster is dawning only slowly on the British public, most foreigners I meet 每 from France to Japan 每 scratch their heads and ask ※why has your once great country voted to commit economic suicide?§Why indeed. Well, one points out to them that only 37% of the electorate voted to leave; that the referendum was ※advisory§; and that, when he feared he was going to lose by a narrow margin, the egregious Nigel Farage stated that, in the event of a close vote, there should be another referendum.The narrowness of the result does not, sad to say, prevent distinguished BBC interviewers who ought to know better from prefacing questions with preambles such as ※we know the nation voted to take back control, but＃ §The nation? Well, a small proportion of it. Control? Alas, one fears that many Brexiters had only the vaguest understanding of what that actually meant. ※Country back§? A country much of whose industry and public utilities are foreign-owned?The sheer folly of this self-inflicted wound is illustrated by the fact that, until it was called, our relationship with the rest of the  was way down the list of people＊s concerns in repeated surveys. However, Cameron lifted the stone, and Ukip had a field day.What continues to mystify is the way that worshippers of  on the right of the Conservative party have turned against her. After the two-to-one vote in favour of Remain in 1975, Thatcher joined in ※rejoicing over this excellent result§. She added: ※Also, one cannot let this occasion pass without paying tribute to the vision of Sir Winston Churchill and the courage of Harold Macmillan, who made the original application.§ (Of course, she should also have praised Edward Heath, who succeeded in his application. But then, relations between the two were, shall we say, somewhat strained.)Joining the European single market in the mid-1990s was one of Thatcher＊s finest achievements. Last weekend I met a Treasury minister from those days who recalled that, at the time, Tory Eurosceptics were overjoyed by it.It is true that, in common with the Treasury and many others, Thatcher found many aspects of the European Union intensely irritating. She certainly fought her corner. But Lord Powell, the civil servant who knew her mind as well as anyone, is convinced that, had she been still with us, the heroine of the Eurosceptics (always pronounced ※euroseptics§ by Heath) would have supported Remain.And the Treasury, that least ※European§ of departments, can see when the country is heading for a cliff. Hence  is doing everything possible to soften the blow.But back to the party that was led by Harold Wilson, and is now in the hands of . Wilson was originally lukewarm about Europe, and always thought the arguments were finely balanced. Shortly before the 1975 referendum, there was a special conference of Labour＊s national executive at the Sobell sports centre in Islington, in the heart of what is now Corbyn＊s constituency. The vote was two-to-one for Leave: but as Wilson＊s biographer Ben Pimlott wrote, ※behind the speakers＊ rostrum a banner had been carefully placed for the television cameras, with the message ＆Conference Advises 每 the People Decide＊.§※Wilson was low key. He said he was against coming out and ＆sinking into an offshore mentality＊.The journalist Peter Jenkins explained that Wilson had three objectives: ※to keep his party in power and in one piece, and Britain in Europe§. Bernard Donoughue, who worked closely with Wilson, said that while Wilson was never warm towards things European, nevertheless ※as a pragmatist he knew that a Yes vote was the most practical choice, because to stay in would be less disruptive politically, economically, industrially, than to pull out.＊Disruption is what we now face. The optimists among my fellow Remainers are hoping for various eventualities: a long transition; a change of mind; a ※soft§  in which Britain retains most, if not all, of the advantages of the customs union and the single market.But it is becoming increasingly obvious that the complexities of any such compromise are formidable. In particular, it is difficult to believe that the other 27 regard a soft Brexit as feasible. The likelihood is that, unless sense prevails pretty soon, this chaotic government will take us over the cliff.However, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the government may collapse and Labour win an early election. In which case Jeremy Corbyn could do worse than to learn some lessons from Harold Wilson."															
"ritain is on a consumer credit binge. Over the past year, growth per head of population has increased by 1% while the amount consumers have racked up 每 on their credit cards, on car finance and in unsecured personal loans 每 has increased by 10%.This is a matter of concern for the Bank of England, and rightly so. As .What＊s happened is simple. For many employees, a decent wage increase is a thing of the past 每 but borrowing is cheap and easily obtainable. Living standards are under pressure because prices are rising more rapidly than earnings, and that is forcing consumers to retrench. The belt-tightening would be even more pronounced were it not for the willingness to load up on?credit.Banks and other lenders have responded to a prolonged period of low interest rates and modest growth by making the terms for borrowers more attractive. It is now easier 每 at least in the short term 每 for someone to transfer their credit card balance from one company to another. The average advertised interest rate on a ?10,000 loan has fallen from 8% to 3.8% in the past year.As Brazier noted, these are classic signs of lenders thinking the risks are lower than they actually are. He used particularly strong language (for Threadneedle Street) in warning lenders that they were dicing with a ※spiral of complacency§. The Bank is prepared to act within the next two months if it thinks there has been insufficient action on the part of lenders to prevent the damaging popping of a credit bubble.Only once has the household debt to income ratio been as elevated as it is now, and that was 10 years ago, when the economy was on the cusp of its deepest?recession since the second world war.Most of the debt is secured against bricks and mortar, but a rising chunk of it is accounted for by personal loans, unpaid credit card debts and car loans.It was the willingness of consumers to take on extra borrowing that allowed the economy to surf through the first six months after the Brexit vote a year ago. To an extent, this was perfectly rational behaviour: consumers could see that prices were going to rise due to the fall in the value of the pound, so they loaded up on credit so that they could bring forward purchases.Some spending that would normally have taken place in the first half of 2017 actually happened in the second half of 2016. The fact that outstanding consumer debt is still rising suggests that people are no longer borrowing to fund luxury purchases but rather to make ends meet.To an extent, rising consumer debt is a problem of the Bank＊s own making. Its monetary policy committee has kept interest rates at 0.5% or lower for more than eight years, making it easier?to keep up the payments on loans. Now the Bank＊s other big policy body 每 the financial policy committee 每 is worried that the borrowing could get?out of hand.Both the MPC and the FPC need to be careful. Even quite modest increases?in official interest rates would be a problem for many debt-dependent households.Meanwhile, if the FPC makes it harder for consumers to obtain credit from mainstream lenders, there is the risk that they will drive the borrowing underground.Ultimately, rising consumer credit is symptomatic of a wider problem: the absence of real wage growth. Since the economy plunged into recession in early 2008, real GDP per head has increased by less than 2% 每 comfortably the most miserable performance, apart from times when Britain has been at war, since records began in the first half of the 19th century.Debt has been rising because wages, once adjusted for inflation, have moved sideways. And wages have moved sideways because productivity growth has stalled.The way to break the UK＊s serious credit habit is to develop a different growth model to replace one that is clearly broken.In the meantime, lenders would be well advised to heed Brazier＊s warning. The Bank does not use phrases such as ※spiral of complacency§ lightly. It fears boom will lead to bust. Lenders can either exercise a bit more caution voluntarily or the Bank will force them to do so through credit controls."															
"orby in Northamptonshire has taken on a few notable titles over the years. It has been dubbed ※Little Scotland§ to reflect the Scottish workers who flooded in during the last century for jobs in its now defunct steelworks. More recently, Corby emerged as , its population now swelled by EU migrants and young workers commuting to London.Last week, the East Midlands town had the dubious honour of topping a new list. Amid the latest warnings around Britons＊ growing reliance on borrowing, Corby was named .Borrowers there had made more inquiries about personal loans than in any other place in the UK, according to an analysis by MoneySuperMarket. There were 75.5 inquiries per 1,000 residents in Corby 每 47% higher than the UK average, according to a trawl through 3?million such inquiries made via the price comparison site since 2015. More generally, the UK-wide figures showed that the country＊s appetite for borrowing had grown over the last two years.A mere decade on from the financial crash, signs that households are building up debts are . Some of the rise is down to low borrowing costs and the easy availability of credit to pay for anything from cars and weddings to everyday living costs.However, borrowing is rising faster than incomes and the Bank＊s director for financial stability, Alex Brazier, warned last week that lenders who are offering cheap deals were taking the risk of sparking a fresh financial crisis. They could be contributing to a ※spiral of complacency§, he said.Debt charities warn that unsecured borrowing 每 which does not include mortgages 每 will continue to rise as people grapple with rising living costs, precarious employment and welfare cuts.In Corby＊s main shopping area, few of the people approached by the  seem surprised that their town has been crowned Britain＊s personal loans capital. Their stories encapsulate the shift seen around the country to more insecure work and less reliable incomes.Since Corby＊s main steel plant closed in 1980, new jobs have been created to fill the gap. But many of them are low-paying, low-skilled roles.Much of the work available is via employment agencies that offer contracts with very few, or no, guaranteed hours per week, says Ryan Noble, 24. ※People are taking out loans to cover the cost of living,§ he says.Ryan and his twin Callum help each other find warehouse work via agencies, but the hours fluctuate. At Christmas, Ryan took out a ?150 loan to stay afloat. ※I would do it again. If I got work for three days out of five, I would probably take a ?150 loan for that month to cover the loss of the two days.§Ryan earns ?250 after tax in a typical week for picking and packing in a supermarket warehouse. But sometimes even his scheduled shifts get cancelled or cut short. ※Today I was scheduled to work 6am to 2pm. I was sent home at 10am,§ he says.Mother-of-three Marie Bradley points to rising food prices over the last year and says pay is not keeping pace. ※Wages are so low in Corby. A lot of jobs are agency based,§ adds the 45-year-old.Her concerns about low pay are backed up by  from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank and anti-poverty campaigners the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.Their regional analysis of trends over 40 years shows . Average incomes in the east and west Midlands are now 6% and 9% below the national average, respectively.Corby Borough Council leader Tom Beattie testifies to that gap. ※The level of wages in Corby 每 compared to the rest of the county, not just the rest of the country 每 is lower here than elsewhere and I think that＊s a reflection of the sorts of jobs we have, at the lower end of the skills scale,§ says the Labour councillor.The town has put money into regeneration and its fast-growing population is testament to the effort to recover from post-industrial decline. But Beattie is conscious that some people are struggling. The council recently employed financial inclusion officers to help benefit claimants cope with living costs and changes to their income as welfare reforms are rolled out. The council would like to do more but its grants from central government have been cut by about 50% since 2010, he adds.Corby must also tackle the root causes for households＊ financial strains, says Beattie. ※We can＊t just be a low-skills, low-wage based economy. We need to work on that skills base.§Charities see a close link between rising debts and the proliferation of low-paid, insecure work. The debt advice charity StepChange estimates that 8.8?million people are using credit to pay for essentials, and of those, 1.1 million are using high-cost loans.※There are people where, even after we give them budget counselling, they don＊t have the money to get by,§ says Peter Tutton, the head of policy at StepChange. ※There is a big pool of people on the edge, hanging on by their fingernails.§One type of debt on watchdogs＊ radars is credit cards. Earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) . It said 3.3 million people had fallen into a persistent debt spiral, where all their money went on interest and the total debt was never lowered.It is a situation one Corby resident visiting a weekly food bank knows all too well. The woman, who asked not to be named, says she and her partner have ?12,000 of credit card debt. They have come to an agreement with the card issuers to pay back a bare minimum of ?26 a month. The mother of two says things got tighter when her disability benefits were cut earlier this year.※I don＊t sleep. I go to bed at night wondering is it worth getting up the next day because it will just be the same when it＊s no money and no one understands,§ she says.One of the food bank volunteers, John Hunter, is handing out parcels. He has seen a rise in people getting into financial difficulty because of benefit changes and because they get sanctioned 每 having their benefits paused 每 for not applying for enough jobs. ※We do find it hard sometimes to keep up with demand,§ says Hunter.One food bank user, Gerry, is in arrears on his council tax and rent after changes to his benefits. Gerry worked for most of his life as an engineer at food factories but lost his job nine months ago.His jobseeker＊s allowance is being switched over to universal credit, with a six-week gap between the two, the 63-year-old says as he sorts through his food parcel.※When I was at the job centre, I said ＆What am I going to live on?＊ They gave me a voucher to come here,§ he says.Citizens Advice has highlighted a connection between borrowing and the rollout of universal credit, which involves wrapping six existing benefits into a single monthly payment. The charity surveyed 800 people who sought help with universal credit in pilot areas, finding  and more than half (57%) were having to borrow money to get by during that time.The government says it has put extra help in place, such as advances, for people who need it under universal credit and that its research shows the majority of claimants were comfortably managing their money. ※Work is the best way to raise living standards, and record numbers of people are now in employment,§ said a government spokeswoman.※We＊ve introduced universal credit, the national living wage and increased the tax-free personal allowance to make sure it always pays to have a job, and we＊ve committed ?45m to providing free debt advice for anyone with money concerns.§Credit market experts are also keen to stress that the rise in borrowing is not simply a feature of financial strain. The availability of credit is also up. Using credit cards, or .One woman, walking down Corby＊s main shopping area with her family, sums up changing attitudes. ※I have had a couple of loans myself.§ says the woman, who asked not to named. ※It＊s not so much a taboo any more.

"emi-automated truck convoys . Perhaps, one day, human beings won＊t be allowed to drive. Perhaps it will be considered too risky to put an easily distractible human being in charge of a ton or more of fast-moving metal. Future generations may think of driving as terrifyingly retro.It＊s yet another example of a pressing existential question, as well as an economic one. When clever robots have taken most of our jobs, how will we live and what will we live on? For these Meccano scabs are not only going after the repetitive tasks of the long-distance lorry driver or factory workers. Once they  and can successfully fob themselves off as human beings, jobs that used to require a university degree will be just as much at risk. Human beings are fast heading for obsolescence.Optimists argue that new jobs will be created, just like they were during the Industrial Revolution and the computer revolution. After all, if no one has a paid job, who will be buying all the stuff that the robots are busy making? Others suggest that with all this robot-led productivity, societies will become rich enough to pay their populations a citizen＊s income 每 that is, provide everyone with an unconditional sum of money to live on, irrespective of whether they work or not. This is an idea that may be approaching as fast as the driverless car. From the  to the , the idea of a  draws support from across the political spectrum.Now, I am not an economist, and I don＊t know whether the sums will ever add up to make it work. But I do know a?little about how it might feel to live on a citizen＊s income because the nearest real-life comparison I can think of is my own situation. I am not paid a salary by the church. I am paid a stipend. And the crucial difference is that a stipend is not supposed to be a payment received for services rendered. Rather, it is a way for the church to support its clergy so that they can do their thing without a concern for basic material welfare. There is no bonus for more bums on pews. There is not a quota for souls saved. Being a priest is not really a proper job 每 it＊s not something that can be measured in terms of task. The stuff I absolutely have to do, task-wise, is pretty minimal. Even so, the church gives me a place to live and pays me every month.When first ordained, I couldn＊t figure out if I was incredibly lazy or fast becoming a workaholic. And that＊s because the stipend system erases the dividing line between what is work and what is not work. I feel constantly busy, but I don＊t always know under what category I would file much of my activity. As many clergy will attest, it is in this curious intermediate overlap between work and not work that the most important stuff often happens. The random conversations, the time given over to just sitting with people, the hands that have been held and the books that have been read.This could be the future for many of us. Under capitalism, many find it hard to establish a sense of self-worth without paid employment. The possibility of a citizen＊s income hints at a return to pre-capitalist sources of value. Less?about money, and more about things that are distinctively human 每?things that robots cannot do.The idealistic best-case scenario for a post-work future is that the economic growth of the robotic/AI revolution will enable many of us to work in ways that capitalism has typically undervalued. But if that doesn＊t happen, and the robots take our jobs and offer nothing in return, then our future is bleak indeed. Think , leading a neo-luddite revolution.A citizen＊s income is not a free handout for the undeserving 每 though it would erase that much-abused distinction between the deserving and the undeserving. After all, who can possibly be described as undeserving of having enough to live on? A citizen＊s income would be a way for the wealth that is generated by a society to be shared within that society. And the Protestant work ethic would become a thing of the past."															
"Donald Trump has vowed to , in a speech otherwise short on specifics but heavy on ※America first§ rhetoric.Addressing workers in Springfield, Missouri, the US president 每 who is yet to release his own tax returns 每 sought to take up the mantle of Ronald Reagan, the last president to oversee a major tax reduction, even though he has sharply criticised Reagan＊s measures in the past.Trump claimed that America has gone from a tax rate lower than its economic competitors to one that is more than 60% higher. ※When it comes to the business tax, we are dead last: can you believe that?§ he said. ※So this cannot be allowed to continue any longer. America must lead the way, not follow from behind.§Emphasising a theme of restoring lost glory, the president continued: ※We have totally surrendered our competitive edge to other countries. We＊re not surrendering any more. Ideally, and I say this for our secretary of the treasury, we would like to bring our business tax rate down to 15%, which would make our tax rate lower than most countries but still by no means the lowest, unfortunately, in the world. But it would make us highly competitive.§Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was present, is one of the main architects of the tax reform, but Trump＊s figure seems to be a stretch. Some members of Congress have already said any plan would be likely to cut business taxes to no lower than 20%, while experts say 25% is more likely. in 1986 but only after two years of haggling and developing relationships with House speaker Thomas ＆Tip＊ O＊Neill and other Democrats to achieve bipartisan support. He was also in the sixth year of his presidency, had fewer distractions than Trump and was more reluctant to add to the government deficit.Trump, who has shown little interest in reaching across the aisle, said: ※In 1986, Ronald Reagan led the world by cutting our corporate tax rate to 34%. That was below the average rate for developed countries at the time. Everybody thought that was a monumental thing that happened. But then, under this pro-America system, our economy boomed. It just went beautifully, right through the roof. The middle class thrived and median family increased.§Other countries emulated America＊s success, he argued, and cut their taxes to become more competitive. ※They are taking us, frankly, to the cleaners. So we must, we have no choice, we must lower our taxes.§Instead of a Reaganesque olive branch, he then issued a threat to a Democratic Senator in her home state. ※Your senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you. If she doesn＊t do it for you, you have to vote her out of office.§The crowd cheered and whistled. Trump added: ※She＊s going to make that commitment. We just can＊t do this anymore with the obstruction and the obstructionists. The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and tax reform.§But Trump was not always so enthusiastic. Writing in the Wall Street Journal in 1999, he described Reagan＊s Tax Reform Act of 1986 as ※one of the worst ideas in recent history§.Trump set out four priorities: simplifying the tax code and closing loopholes exploited by the wealthy and special interests (※I＊m speaking against myself when I do this§); a lower tax rate that will give Americans a pay rise and the business tax reduction to make the US competitive; tax relief for middle income families, ※the forgotten people§; and bringing back trillions of dollars that US companies currently park off shore.Trump is striving to recover from a . Whereas he made no major public speech during that process and blamed Congress for the failure, Wednesday＊s event at a manufacturing company is expected to be the first aiming to drum up support.※This is our once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,§ he said. ※I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done and I don＊t want to be disappointed by Congress.§His voice rose and his hand sliced the air then pointing to the audience, which included several members of Congress. ※Do you understand me? You understand? Understand.§The crowd cheered and applauded. Trump, shaking his head a little wearily, hands gripping the lectern, added: ※Congress. I think Congress is going to make a comeback. I hope so.§ There was some laughter. ※I tell you what: the United States is counting on it.§The audience included his daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump. ※I see my beautiful daughter＊s in the audience,§ the president said. ※Stand up. She working very hard. I＊m very proud of Ivanka.§In a hard-edged speech that characteristically pushed US self-interest, Trump declared that his reforms would would ※bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden§ and spur economic growth to benefit both companies and workers.Appealing to ※every member§ of Congress to get on board, Trump added: ※Instead of exporting our jobs, we will export our goods. Our jobs will both stay here in America and come back to America. We will have it both ways. Millions of struggling Americans will be lifted from welfare to work. I want Americans to wake up happy to go to work for a big fat beautiful pay cheque. I want them to be proud again.§But Democrats condemned what they see as an attempt to benefit corporations and the top 1%. Nancy Pelosi, minority leader in the House, said:※Instead of offering the American people a plan for real, job-creating tax reform, President Trump is pushing a billionaires-first, trickle-down tax scheme that hands out massive tax cuts to the wealthiest, at the expense of American families. ※If Republicans have their way, they will blow a huge hole in the deficit, gut Medicare, Medicaid, social security and the Affordable Care Act 每 all just to fund deficit-busting tax breaks for the high-end.§"															
"A former Obama administration official says he believes the  has given Australia tacit approval to move ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, despite the president disavowing and dumping the agreement as one of his first acts in office.Matthew Goodman, who served as White House coordinator for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) and the East Asia Summit in the previous administration, told Guardian Australia he believed the Trump administration had given Australia licence to ※just keep the seat warm for the United States§.※I have no hard evidence of this, but I＊ve heard senior Trump administration officials have acknowledged Japan and Australia＊s interests in moving forward [with the TPP] and haven＊t expressed any objections to that,§ Goodman said.He said Japan had been ※rattled§ when Donald Trump confirmed the US wouldn＊t proceed with the controversial regional trade pact. ※[Japan] approached the Trump administration and got their tacit approval to drive this forward§.Goodman, who now holds the William E Simon chair in political economy at the respected Washington thinktank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the US in the Trump era had to look for ※workarounds§ given it had enduring interests, both economic and strategic, in this region.He said the US would look to Australia to keep issues of mutual interest ticking over. ※We have to coordinate with allies like Australia to be, in a sense, our proxy, during this period where we are not leading on these issues§.Lead negotiators from the 11 remaining TPP countries  in an effort to keep the trade deal alive after the Trump withdrawal.The deal pursued by the Obama administration secured agreement from Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.Goodman said Trump＊s decision to exit the trade pact was ※a mistake§, and had set back America＊s strategic interests in the region. ※I am critical of the administration on these issues 每 this was not helpful to our interests out here, to withdraw from the TPP.§He said the TPP was the economic expression of US influence and connectedness in the region, and he insisted an economic strategy was required in Asia, not just a military presence.※We have to work at being here, because we are a Pacific power but not an Asian country,§ Goodman said.He acknowledged that the TPP was controversial with the public, but he said the trade pact had become a scapegoat of a lot of anxieties, and ※an easy target§.Goodman said there was a big challenge ahead for supporters of trade liberalisation given there was an underlying set of economic anxieties in developed economies which gave rise to populism, and to Trump.He said the benefits of trade liberalisation were not always obvious to Americans, but the specific transitional costs were front of mind for many people. ※We have to have real answers to those questions,§ he said."															
"The rapid growth in borrowing by consumers appears to be slowing amid a squeeze on households, despite remaining at levels unseen since the financial crisis.The annual rate of growth for consumer borrowing through credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans slowed to 9.8% in July, the lowest rate of expansion since April 2016, according to the . The growth rate was a little weaker than in recent months, when the pace of expansion was above 10%. , as households come under pressure to tighten their belts from higher prices fuelled by a drop in the value of the pound since the EU referendum. Wages rose by 2.1% in June, while inflation  in July, leading to negative earnings growth. The figures come as research from , a practice that it said Britain＊s financial watchdog should ban.Weaker levels of growth in consumer credit could relieve pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates to slow the rapid expansion in the supply of money. Sluggish GDP growth and inflation coming close to its peak could put off a rate rise until late 2018, or even early 2019. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the figures would be a relief to the Bank. ※While any interest rate hikes would be limited and gradual, even small increases could cause problems for many consumers given high borrowing levels,§ he said.In cash terms, consumer credit increased by ?1.2bn last month, below the estimate from a poll of City economists surveyed by Reuters and the smallest rise this year. Still, at the current pace of expansion, Britons are racking up debt at almost five times the growth rate of earnings. Total unsecured borrowing by consumers also remains at levels unseen since the financial crisis 每 at ?201.5bn, the highest level since December 2008. Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at the consultancy Capital , said: ※Given that credit is still rising fairly strongly, it suggests that households are confident enough to borrow in order to maintain spending while real incomes are being squeezed.§The figures from Threadneedle Street also show lenders approved 68,689 mortgages last month compared with 65,318 in June, returning to levels seen earlier this year. The value of mortgage lending increased by ?3.6bn, slowing from ?4.1bn in June.Even so, mortgage approvals remain well below the average monthly levels seen in recent decades. Demand for new home loans could also be being stoked by record low rates on offer, encouraging borrowers to remortgage in order to lock in bargain deals. The effective rate on new individual mortgages was 1.95% in July, according to the Bank, the first time this measure has fallen below 2%. Archer said: ※While July＊s marked pick-up in mortgages may ease some concerns over tepid housing market activity, we have doubts that it marks the start of a significant upturn.§There could also be signs that businesses are about to invest more, as borrowing by firms stood at ?8.9bn last month, its highest level since July 2014. However, this may jar with recent indicators of business confidence, while the most recent figures from the  reveal firms＊ investment in the UK economy showed no growth at all in the second quarter.Instead, the surge in corporate borrowing could reflect firms fearing higher interest rates and locking in low borrowing costs, according to Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. ※The risk of a near-term rate hike, however, has receded, suggesting that corporate borrowing will fall back soon,§ he said."															
"he Taylor report was commissioned nine months ago. Theresa May was in her prime, apparently in a job for life, or at least until 2020, and she was keen to add substance to her early rhetoric on the ※just about managing§ by commissioning Matthew Taylor, a respected Blair-era policy guru, to examine ways of improving work. No one foresaw the irony in these altered times of .Mr Taylor, a man who has always preferred a nudge to a shove, was never likely to mount a revolutionary challenge to the established order. But expectations were high, and now many people are disappointed. Yet it is . Mr Taylor rightly defends its essential recognition of the value not just of work but of good work. And it is important to remember that despite record levels of employment, many people want to work more hours than they do and others, classed as economically inactive, want a job. Britain＊s labour market too often offers low pay, low productivity and long hours. These?are deeply ingrained problems.The gig economy has attracted much more attention than these. It has transformed the nature of work for some people, but it still accounts for only a tiny share of the job market. Yet it is also open to abuse. The?essential question for this new category of workers is . Businesses such as Uber and Deliveroo insist they are self-employed contractors. Employment tribunals have found that where there is a significant element of control and supervision they are workers, entitled to?benefits like sick and holiday pay, and most importantly to the minimum wage. Uber is fighting this decision, and the Taylor report appears to back away from endorsing it. Instead, it proposes that government rebadge a ※worker§ as a ※dependent contractor§; dependent contractors would get the benefits workers receive but no automatic entitlement to the minimum wage. This may not be such a cop-out as Mr Taylor＊s critics believe: he argues that it could be a viable finesse between the flexibility that some Uber and Deliveroo drivers value with the protection that others seek. It would also allow HMRC to collect employer＊s national insurance contributions.The Taylor approach to agency workers may also be less of a disappointment to trade unions when they study the small print. Mr?Taylor wants to end the so-called Swedish derogation, a longstanding, much-exploited arrangement that in certain circumstances permits an employer to bring in agency workers to do the same job as employees for?lower pay. He also hopes that demanding greater transparency about an employer＊s use of agency workers would be a driver for change. He makes the same argument about transparency when he suggests employers be obliged to report how many workers on zero-hours contracts have exercised the new right to request fixed hours that he thinks they should have after a year. Unions scoff at?an idea that seems to do nothing to restore the balance of power between worker and boss, and are angry that he is too pragmatic to demand a complete end to employment tribunal fees that have .Mr Taylor rightly draws attention to much wider problems in the labour market, like the amount of overtime demanded of low-paid workers, and recommends following US legislation in imposing a higher-rate minimum wage in such circumstances. There＊s lots of gritty detail along with the ambition to deliver good work. Critics rightly point to the gap between the problems he identifies and the remedies he proposes.

In the mounting friction between , she＊s a leading figure on one side of the fence who also spent half her career on the other side 每 starting out as a nurse.Willcox, 60, is in no doubt where her loyalties now lie. ※I love working in social care because you can make a real difference to people＊s lives,§ she says. ※Even at a senior level, while you are not a practitioner, decisions you make about managing staff and influencing systems still play back to those individuals in a very direct and meaningful way.§ The past fortnight, she reflects, has been a salutary reminder of the huge influence that the hospitals lobby still wields. ※Even when I worked in the  I didn＊t realise 每 really until quite late on 每 just how powerful it is.§Matters have come to a head over the delayed discharge of older people from hospital, with  Social care received an emergency cash infusion of , in part to address delayed discharges, but the  that only one in four trusts had received a commitment from its local councils to a share of the money.This comes against a background of massive cuts to council social care budgets since 2010. , taking the . Things were already frosty, therefore, when health secretary   (BCF) 每 a pot of money spanning the NHS and councils that aims to integrate health and social care. He prioritised addressing delayed discharge over the rest of social care, insisting that 2,000-3,000 hospital beds must be freed up. He also announced reviews of 12 areas with the worst problems and warned they could lose funding in 2018-19 if they did not improve.The  and said it could no longer support the BCF guidance. Izzi Seccombe, who leads for the association on social care and is Conservative leader of Warwickshire council, told the local government press that the NHS wanted control of the ?2bn and was ※a dinosaur and it hasn＊t changed§.

She says she was unsurprised by last week＊s , revealing that more than a fifth of all adult social care services in England have been rated below the ※good§ benchmark, including almost one in three nursing homes.The sector is in a fragile condition, she agrees, having had recent direct experience. In March, a company that was Gloucestershire＊s main provider of homecare went into liquidation overnight, leaving the council to take over services as best it could for three weeks until others could step in. The 250 care workers affected had to be given cash help and food parcels, and driven around by council officers before cars could be leased for them, while the fire service made available its stocks of petrol and diesel.Services for 480 older and disabled people were just about sustained, but a  going before councillors this week says the company had been found to have been making ※impossible§ demands of the workers on unmanageable rotas. Willcox says she is resolved to do more to check what care providers are doing to fulfil their contracts. But another lesson, she stresses, was the dedication of the care workers 每 many of them from eastern Europe 每 who overwhelmingly stuck with the job, and with their clients, despite the personal uncertainty when the company, Cleeve Link, went bust. ※To keep on turning up to look after our people was just an incredible credit to them in such extremely difficult circumstances.§She fervently hopes that the forthcoming , will embrace issues like workforce and types of care and not focus simply on paying care bills in older age. ※The thing I want most from the green paper is a conversation with the public about what they want as the model of social care for the next 20 or 30 years 每 and then how they want to pay for it. I really hope we don＊t have one Aunt Sally that people are asked if they like or not.§"															
"lthough England has an established church, few of us today pay it much mind. We follow an even more powerful religion, around which we have oriented our lives: economics. Think about it.  offers a comprehensive doctrine with a moral code promising adherents salvation in this world; an ideology so compelling that the faithful remake whole societies to conform to its demands. It has its gnostics, mystics and magicians who conjure money out of thin air, using spells such as ※derivative§ or ※structured investment vehicle§. And, like the old religions it has displaced, it has its prophets, reformists, moralists and above all, its high priests who uphold orthodoxy in the face of heresy.Over time, successive economists slid into the role we had removed from the churchmen: giving us guidance on how to reach a promised land of material abundance and endless contentment. For a long time, they seemed to deliver on that promise, succeeding in a way few other religions had ever done, our incomes rising thousands of times over and delivering a cornucopia bursting with new inventions, cures and delights.This was our heaven, and richly did we reward the economic priesthood, with status, wealth and power to shape our societies according to their vision. At the end of the 20th century, amid an economic boom that saw the western economies become richer than humanity had ever known, economics seemed to have conquered the globe. With nearly every country on the planet adhering to the same free-market playbook, and with university students flocking to do degrees in the subject, economics seemed to be attaining the goal that had eluded every other religious doctrine in history: converting the entire planet to its creed.Yet if history teaches anything, it＊s that whenever economists feel certain that they have found the holy grail of endless peace and prosperity,  On the eve of , the American economist Irving Fisher advised people to go out and buy shares; in the 1960s, Keynesian economists said there would never be another recession because they had perfected the tools of demand management.The 2008 crash was no different. Five years earlier, on 4 January 2003, the Nobel laureate Robert Lucas had delivered a triumphal presidential address to the American Economics Association. Reminding his colleagues that macroeconomics had been born in the depression precisely to try to prevent another such disaster ever recurring, he declared that he and his colleagues had reached their own end of history: ※Macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded,§ he instructed the conclave. ※Its central problem of depression prevention has been solved.§No sooner do we persuade ourselves that the economic priesthood has finally broken the old curse than it comes back to haunt us all: pride always goes before a fall. Since the crash of 2008, most of us have watched our living standards decline. Meanwhile, the priesthood seemed to withdraw to the cloisters, bickering over who got it wrong. Not surprisingly, our faith in the ※experts§ has dissipated.Hubris, never a particularly good thing, can be especially dangerous in economics, because its scholars don＊t just observe the laws of nature; they help make them. If the government, guided by its priesthood, changes the incentive-structure of society to align with the assumption that people behave selfishly, for instance, then lo and behold, people will start to do just that. They are rewarded for doing so and penalised for doing otherwise. If you are educated to believe greed is good, then you will be more likely to live accordingly.The hubris in economics came not from a moral failing among economists, but from a false conviction: the belief that theirs was a science. It neither is nor can be one, and has always operated more like a church. You just have to look at its history to realise that.he American Economic Association,to which Robert Lucas gave his address, was created in 1885, just when economics was starting to define itself as a distinct discipline. At its first meeting, the association＊s founders proposed a platform that declared: ※The conflict of labour and capital has brought to the front a vast number of social problems whose solution is impossible without the united efforts of church, state and science.§ It would be a long path from that beginning to the market evangelism of recent decades.Yet even at that time, such social activism provoked controversy. One of the AEA＊s founders, Henry Carter Adams, subsequently delivered an address at Cornell University in which he defended free speech for radicals and accused industrialists of stoking xenophobia to distract workers from their mistreatment. Unknown to him, the New York lumber king and Cornell benefactor Henry Sage was in the audience. As soon as the lecture was done, Sage stormed into the university president＊s office and insisted: ※This man must go; he is sapping the foundations of our society.§ When Adams＊s tenure was subsequently blocked, he agreed to moderate his views. Accordingly, the final draft of the AEA platform expunged the reference to laissez-faire economics as being ※unsafe in politics and unsound in morals§.So was set a pattern that has persisted to this day. Powerful political interests 每 which historically have included not only rich industrialists, but electorates as well 每 helped to shape the canon of economics, which was then enforced by its scholarly community.Once a principle is established as orthodox, its observance is enforced in much the same way that a religious doctrine maintains its integrity: by repressing or simply eschewing heresies. In Purity and Danger,  observed the way taboos functioned to help humans impose order on a seemingly disordered, chaotic world. The premises of conventional economics haven＊t functioned all that differently. Robert Lucas once noted approvingly that by the late 20th century, economics had so effectively purged itself of Keynesianism that ※the audience start(ed) to whisper and giggle to one another§ when anyone expressed a Keynesian idea at a seminar. Such responses served to remind practitioners of the taboos of economics: a gentle nudge to a young academic that such shibboleths might not sound so good before a tenure committee. This preoccupation with order and coherence may be less a function of the method than of its practitioners. Studies of personality traits common to various disciplines have discovered that economics, like engineering, tends to attract people with an unusually strong preference for order, and a distaste for ambiguity.The irony is that, in its determination to make itself a science that can reach hard and fast conclusions, economics has had to dispense with scientific method at times. For starters, it rests on a set of premises about the world not as it is, but as economists would like it to be. Just as any religious service includes a profession of faith, membership in the priesthood of economics entails certain core convictions about human nature. Among other things, most economists believe that we humans are self-interested, rational, essentially individualistic, and prefer more money to less. These articles of faith are taken as self-evident. Back in the 1930s, the great economist Lionel Robbins described his profession in a way that has stood ever since as a cardinal rule for millions of economists. The field＊s basic premises came from ※deduction from simple assumptions reflecting very elementary facts of general experience§ and as such were ※as universal as the laws of mathematics or mechanics, and as little capable of ＆suspension＊§.Deducing laws from premises deemed eternal and beyond question is a time-honoured method. For thousands of years, monks in medieval monasteries built a vast corpus of scholarship doing just that, using a method perfected by Thomas Aquinas known as scholasticism. However, this is not the method used by scientists, who tend to require assumptions to be tested empirically before a theory can be built out of them.But, economists will maintain, this is precisely what they themselves do 每 what sets them apart from the monks is that they must still test their hypotheses against the evidence. Well, yes, but this statement is actually more problematic than many mainstream economists may realise. Physicists resolve their debates by looking at the data, upon which they by and large agree. The data used by economists, however, is much more disputed. When, for example, Robert Lucas insisted that Eugene Fama＊s efficient-markets hypothesis 每 which maintains that since a free market collates all available information to traders, the prices it yields can never be wrong 每 held true despite ※a flood of criticism§, he did so with as much conviction and supporting evidence as his fellow economist Robert Shiller had mustered in rejecting the hypothesis. When the Swedish central bank had to decide who would win the 2013 Nobel prize in economics, it was torn between Shiller＊s claim that markets frequently got the price wrong and Fama＊s insistence that markets always got the price right. Thus it opted to split the difference and  每 a bit of Solomonic wisdom that would have elicited howls of laughter had it been a science prize. In economic theory, very often, you believe what you want to believe 每 and as with any act of faith, your choice of heads or tails will as likely reflect sentimental predisposition as scientific assessment.It＊s no mystery why the data used by economists and other social scientists so rarely throws up incontestable answers: it is  data. Unlike people, subatomic particles don＊t lie on opinion surveys or change their minds about things. Mindful of that difference, at his own presidential address to the American Economic Association nearly a half-century ago, another Nobel laureate, Wassily Leontief, struck a modest tone. He reminded his audience that the data used by economists differed greatly from that used by physicists or biologists. For the latter, he cautioned, ※the magnitude of most parameters is practically constant§, whereas the observations in economics were constantly changing. Data sets had to be regularly updated to remain useful. Some data was just simply bad. Collecting and analysing the data requires civil servants with a high degree of skill and a good deal of time, which less economically developed countries may not have in abundance. So, for example, in 2010 alone, Ghana＊s government 每 which probably has one of the better data-gathering capacities in Africa 每 . Testing your hypothesis before and after that kind of revision would lead to entirely different results.Leontief wanted economists to spend more time getting to know their data, and less time in mathematical modelling. However, as he ruefully admitted, the trend was already going in the opposite direction. Today, the economist who wanders into a village to get a deeper sense of what the data reveals is a rare creature. Once an economic model is ready to be tested, number-crunching ends up being done largely at computers plugged into large databases. It＊s not a method that fully satisfies a sceptic. For, just as you can find a quotation in the Bible that will justify almost any behaviour, you can find human data to support almost any statement you want to make about the way the world works.That＊s why ideas in economics can go in and out of fashion. The progress of science is generally linear. As new research confirms or replaces existing theories, one generation builds upon the next. Economics, however, moves in cycles. A given doctrine can rise, fall and then later rise again. That＊s because economists don＊t confirm their theories in quite the same way physicists do, by just looking at the evidence. Instead, much as happens with preachers who gather a congregation, a school rises by building a following 每 among both politicians and the wider public.For example, Milton Friedman was one of the most influential economists of the late 20th century. But he had been around for decades before he got much of a hearing. He might well have remained a marginal figure had it not been that politicians such as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan were sold on his belief in the virtue of a free market. They sold that idea to the public, got elected, then remade society according to those designs. An economist who gets a following gets a pulpit. Although scientists, in contrast, might appeal to public opinion to boost their careers or attract research funds, outside of pseudo-sciences, they don＊t win support for their theories in this way.However, if you think describing economics as a religion debunks it, you＊re wrong. We need economics. It can be 每 it has been 每 a force for tremendous good. But only if we keep its purpose in mind, and always remember what it can and can＊t do.he Irish have been known to describetheir notionally Catholic land as one where a thin Christian veneer was painted over an ancient paganism. The same might be said of our own adherence to today＊s neoliberal orthodoxy, which stresses individual liberty, limited government and the free market. Despite outward observance of a well-entrenched doctrine, we haven＊t fully transformed into the economic animals we are meant to be. Like the Christian who attends church but doesn＊t always keep the commandments, we behave as economic theory predicts only when it suits us. Contrary to the tenets of orthodox economists, contemporary research suggests that, rather than seeking always to maximise our personal gain, humans still remain reasonably altruistic and selfless. Nor is it clear that the endless accumulation of wealth always makes us happier. And when we do make decisions, especially those to do with matters of principle, we seem not to engage in the sort of rational ※utility-maximizing§ calculus that orthodox economic models take as a given. The truth is, in much of our daily life  all that well.For decades, neoliberal evangelists replied to such objections by saying it was incumbent on us all to adapt to the model, which was held to be immutable 每 one recalls Bill Clinton＊s depiction of neoliberal globalisation, for instance, as . And yet, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the consequent recession, there has been a turn against globalisation across much of the west. More broadly, there has been , most notably in the 2016 US election and Brexit referendum.It would be tempting for anyone who belongs to the ※expert§ class, and to the priesthood of economics, to dismiss such behaviour as a clash between faith and facts, in which the facts are bound to win in the end. In truth, the clash was between two rival faiths 每 in effect, two distinct moral tales. So enamoured had the so-called experts become with their scientific authority that they blinded themselves to the fact that their own narrative of scientific progress was embedded in a moral tale. It happened to be a narrative that had a happy ending for those who told it, for it perpetuated the story of their own relatively comfortable position as the reward of life in  that blessed people for their skills and flexibility. That narrative made no room for the losers of this order, whose resentments were derided as being a reflection of their boorish and retrograde character 每 which is to say, their fundamental vice. The best this moral tale could offer everyone else was incremental adaptation to an order whose caste system had become calcified. For an audience yearning for a happy ending, this was bound to be a tale of woe.The failure of this grand narrative is not, however, a reason for students of economics to dispense with narratives altogether. Narratives will remain an inescapable part of the human sciences for the simple reason that they are inescapable for humans. It＊s funny that so few economists get this, because businesses do. As the Nobel laureates George Akerlof and Robert Shiller write in their recent book, , marketers use them all the time, weaving stories in the hopes that we will place ourselves in them and be persuaded to buy what they are selling. Akerlof and Shiller contend that the idea that free markets work perfectly, and the idea that big government is the cause of so many of our problems, are part of a story that is actually misleading people into adjusting their behaviour in order to fit the plot. They thus believe storytelling is a ※new variable§ for economics, since ※the mental frames that underlie people＊s decisions§ are shaped by the stories they tell themselves.Economists arguably do their best work when they take the stories we have given them, and advise us on how we can help them to come true. Such agnosticism demands a humility that was lacking in economic orthodoxy in recent years. Nevertheless, economists don＊t have to abandon their traditions if they are to overcome the failings of a narrative that has been rejected. Rather they can look within their own history to find a method that avoids the evangelical certainty of orthodoxy.In his 1971 presidential address to the American Economic Association, Wassily Leontief counselled against the dangers of self-satisfaction. He noted that although economics was starting to ride ※the crest of intellectual respectability ＃ an uneasy feeling about the present state of our discipline has been growing in some of us who have watched its unprecedented development over the last three decades§.Noting that pure theory was making economics more remote from day-to-day reality, he said the problem lay in ※the palpable inadequacy of the scientific means§ of using mathematical approaches to address mundane concerns. So much time went into model-construction that the assumptions on which the models were based became an afterthought. ※But,§ he warned 每 a warning that the sub-prime boom＊s fascination with mathematical models, and the bust＊s subsequent revelation of their flaws, now reveals to have been prophetic 每 ※it is precisely the empirical validity of these assumptions on which the usefulness of the entire exercise depends.§Leontief thought that economics departments were increasingly hiring and promoting young economists who wanted to build pure models with little empirical relevance. Even when they did empirical analysis, Leontief said economists seldom took any interest in the meaning or value of their data. He thus called for economists to explore their assumptions and data by conducting social, demographic and anthropological work, and said economics needed to work more closely with other disciplines.Leontief＊s call for humility some 40 years ago stands as a reminder that the same religions that can speak up for human freedom and dignity when in opposition, can become obsessed with their rightness and the need to purge others of their wickedness once they attain power. When the church retains its distance from power, and a modest expectation about what it can achieve, it can stir our minds to envision new possibilities and even new worlds. Once economists apply this kind of sceptical scientific method to a human realm in which ultimate reality may never be fully discernible, they will probably find themselves retreating from dogmatism in their claims.Paradoxically, therefore, as economics becomes more truly scientific, it will become less of a science. Acknowledging these limitations will free it to serve us once more. Follow the Long Read on Twitter at , or sign up to the long read weekly email . This article was amended on 17 July 2017.

"The  is stepping up its scrutiny of banks and other lenders on credit cards, personal loans and car purchases amid fears that growing consumer debt could rebound on the banking system. Threadneedle Street is writing to the firms it regulates after reviewing the consumer credit sector, where lending is growing at 10.3% a year 每 outpacing the 2.3% rise in household income. The bank is calling on firms to look at the terms under which they are granting 0% balance transfers on credit cards and the basis on which they are issuing personal loans, and to consider the impact of a fall in value of a car when providing vehicle finance. Its regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, found that while the current pace of growth was not being driven by a relaxation of lending standards, it was concerned that to achieve their future plans they would have to do so. The PRA found ※that the resilience of consumer credit portfolios is reducing, due to the combination of continued growth, lower pricing ＃ And some increased lending into higher-risk segments§. The statement issued on Tuesday followed the Bank＊s announcement last week that lenders would be required  to help prepare for any rise in bad debts from consumer lending. Providing more information on that decision, the Bank said its financial policy committee (FPC), which looks at risks in the financial system, had recently discussed the risk that lenders ※might be placing excessive weight on recent good performance in this sector, given that the current environment was likely to have improved the credit scores of borrowers§.Threadneedle Street said banks were themselves the best way to protect against rising consumer credit. ※The FPC agreed that firms remained the first line of defence against these risks. Effective governance at firms should ensure that risks were priced appropriately and benign conditions did not lead to complacency by lenders.§The Bank asked for a series of information from lenders, including - , - ※whether today＊s ＆new generation＊ of borrowers (without experience of higher interest rates environments) has implications for their credit-scoring models§.Car finance, the fastest growing part of the consumer finance sector, is being driven by personal contract purchase deals which now make up 80% of the market. The Bank said a fall in car prices could lead to a surplus of vehicles coming on to the market which could mean losses for lendersand asked lenders to analyse the impact on capital from each incremental 10% fall in car prices. The Bank＊s data showed that in the credit card market, the average term on zero-balance transfers has more than doubled to nearly 30 months, and its latest report was published as TSB cut its rates on loans between ?5,000 and ?7,499 to a market-leading 3.3% APR.The Bank said, though, that the practices the industry followed before the 2008 crisis were no longer being adopted. Credit card write-offs were 6.5% in 2006 and 2007 每 more than double the current rate.The PRA 每 which regulates 40% of providers of car finance and 80% of the credit card market 每 looks at the consumer finance market from the perspective of the lenders. The impact on borrowers is considered by the , which is scheduled to provide an update on its views later this month but on Tuesday told firms to scrutinise their bonus schemes. ※We expect firms to understand the effects their staff incentives might be having,§ said Jonathan Davidson, executive director of supervision at the FCA.

" has described critics of austerity as ※selfish§, saying their calls to boost spending and raise public sector pay may appear compassionate but would simply saddle future generations with debt.The comments triggered a furious response from Labour and the Lib Dems, who described the former prime minister as totally out of touch, claiming it was astonishing he could make the argument when nurses were turning to food banks to get by. Cameron＊s remarks could also reopen the wounds of the EU referendum as they were widely interpreted as an attack on the two most significant Vote Leave figures,  and Michael Gove.The foreign secretary and environment secretary, whose successful Brexit campaign cost Cameron his political career, have both broken ranks in recent days to hint that the  should be lifted.Their comments, alongside cabinet level interventions by Justine Greening at education and Jeremy Hunt at health, have ramped up the pressure on Theresa May and the chancellor, Philip Hammond. The pair have faced demands from dozens of MPs to ease the pain for families by raising pay and blocking school cuts after Jeremy Corbyn＊s radical, anti-austerity Labour party stance secured gains in the general election.Many feel action is urgent after a  suggested the average pay of teachers had fallen by ?3 an hour in real terms, police officers by ?2, while the wages of nurses have stagnated. But Cameron used a speech in Seoul, South Korea, to come to his successor＊s defence by saying it was too soon ※to let spending and borrowing rip§ because of the danger of future economic shocks.※The opponents of so-called austerity couch their arguments in a way that make them sound generous and compassionate,§ he told the Asia Leadership Conference. ※They seek to paint the supporters of sound finances as selfish, or uncaring. The exact reverse is true.※Giving up on sound finances isn＊t being generous, it＊s being selfish: spending money today that you may need tomorrow.§His comments led to an angry response from opposition politicians who lined up to say that Cameron had no idea how much people were struggling 每 and suggested it was crass to use a well-paid speech to make the argument. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused the senior Conservative figure of living ※in a different world from the rest of us§.※Only David Cameron would say that hard-working people seeing their living standards fall back and their pay suppressed is good for them. It just further shows how out of touch he was then, and still remains today.§The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, described it as a ※pretty rich for a multimillionaire to tell our hard-working firefighters, paramedics, nurses and doctors that they don＊t deserve a pay rise§.※But I guess you would think that if you are jetsetting around the world to give highly paid speeches 每 you don＊t really understand how millions of public sector workers have to scrimp each month to get by,§ he added, giving examples of nurses visiting foodbanks and asking how Cameron considered them to be ※paid enough§.A spokesman would not say how much the former Tory leader had received for the speaking engagement, but confirmed that he was paid. The shadow Treasury minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said Cameron was ※completely out of touch and has no awareness of the country he used to lead§.But Cameron is not the only one to urge calm within the Tory party after a public spat at the top of government over the issue of public sector pay. Sources said that the chief whip, Gavin Williamson, had been speaking to colleagues about the need for ※unity and discipline§ with a number of one-on-one meetings with cabinet ministers.The former work and pensions secretary, Stephen Crabb, suggested it was wrong for such senior figures to speak out so publicly against government policy., a former chancellor under Margaret Thatcher, said it was Hammond＊s job to keep control of public spending to avoid ※economic disaster§.※It＊s not easy but it is necessary,§ he told the BBC. ※People understand we need to pay our way on the road to economic success.§ He argued that the arguments needed to happen in private. ※Stop having this debate in public, it＊s ludicrous.§Hammond also tried to defuse the row by calling on his party to ※hold its nerve§, claiming that the only way to free up spending was higher taxes, more borrowing or stronger growth. Like Cameron, the chancellor has argued that borrowing piles debt on to the next generation and has insisted the Tories are a party of low tax. He has said growth was the only sustainable way to boost public spending in the long run, although sources suggest he is ready to talk about ways to raise money to loosen the ties of austerity over the coming months.One senior Treasury figure said despite that, things would continue to be financially constrained in the run-up to Brexit.Rises of 1% for dentists, nurses, doctors and the military have already been agreed for this year, and Downing Street said ministers would respond to other pay review recommendations within days. Teachers, police and prison officers are next in line.It came alongside a call from civil servants to ensure that any lifting of salaries also included them.Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union that represents senior managers and professionals in public service said his members would welcome ※warm words from a number of cabinet ministers over lifting the public sector pay cap.※But warm words won＊t pay the bills. The majority of civil servants are not covered by pay review bodies and so those very same ministers have it within their control to lift the pay cap for civil servants in their department.※We have today written to those ministers, calling on them to follow up their words with action. If they believe the pay cap should be lifted, then they can begin with the civil servants in their departments who support them as ministers and deliver vital public services.§"															
"ast Tuesday I made my . It happened very quickly. With all my energy used up fighting the general election, it was not until the weekend before the event I started thinking about what I wanted to say.Inside the  there is hype around someone giving their ※maiden speech§. It is something that other MPs ask you about. I just wanted to get it over with, so I could get on with the job of holding this government to account on behalf of my constituents in North West Durham. There are certain traditions about how involved you can be in the chamber until you＊ve given your maiden speech.So, I sat down to write it. Originally, it was eight minutes in length, then it was cut to four, because of the demands of the debate. I had one thing in mind. I simply wanted to convey my initial reflections of being a member of parliament, and what my impressions were of the system in which I found myself.To my surprise, the speech got quite a bit of attention. Not, I think, because it was particularly well-written or a great performance, but because it tapped into a feeling of distance, alienation and dismay that thousands, if not millions of people, are experiencing.I wanted to express the widespread feeling that the House of Commons represents a system of fear, oppression and privilege for so many people, past and present. I also wanted to convey that it should not be respected by virtue of its opulence or longevity, but that respect for our parliament in 2017 must be earned, by eradicating the crushing poverty and inequality that exists in Britain. I wanted to show quite directly my frustration at sitting opposite people who know nothing of the communities they so confidently talk about and lord over.My disdain for the government and the cold-hearted, dystopian nightmare it has become only increased when the vote on Labour＊s amendment to the Queen＊s speech (which sought to lift the pay freeze on poorly paid and undervalued public sector workers) was announced. , we lost, and the coalition with the Democratic Unionist party bore fruit 每 for the Tories, at least.In their glory,  like kids in a playground. But it was far from a joke. To me, their laughter was blood-curdling: they were laughing at the very emergency and public services that they praise when it suits their purpose. To laugh at freezing a person＊s wages is grotesque, and proof that they are completely disconnected from the people they have the privilege to represent. In real terms, this was a reaffirmation of a pay cut, and I view with utter contempt . It is nothing more than playing politics in preparation for a leadership bid.To have your wages fall in value year after year places a heavy weight on a professional person＊s soul. To have your endeavours devalued, to have to deal with the cumulative effects of state-sponsored austerity, and then to have the decision-makers laugh at you as their ※deal§ comes to fruition must have been truly sickening.But there is hope. The general election and the millions of votes registered in opposition to austerity have gone some way towards taming hardline Conservative ambitions. The electorate has seen off a Conservative majority, grammar schools, the so-called dementia tax, the scrapping of free school meals, and much more.We are, however, sadly still governed by a party that is comfortable with poverty, and happy to leave people destitute through its sanctions regime. It heralds higher employment figures without an analysis of the exploitative nature of the workplace today, and continues to pursue an economically flawed model of deficit reduction that justifies cuts to public services, with all the costs to society and the economy that entails. So our struggle continues. Luckily, we are stronger and more confident than ever in that fight.The Tories are ruthless protectors of their power, and they have shown they will stop at nothing to cling on to it. But our movement is energised, more united than ever, diverse, hopeful and strong. Every day more and more people are being pulled into this powerful mass movement, people who are willing to organise, protest, argue and demand a better society, and I don＊t think it will be long until their energies are rewarded."															
"ew predicted it at the time, but the real effect of the EU referendum a year ago has been political rather than economic. One prime minister has resigned and another has been so badly mauled that she may not survive much longer. Britain is closer to having a Labour government with a radical leftwing agenda than it has been for decades. All this has been going on while the economy has been growing at a respectable, if unspectacular, rate, averaging growth of 0.5% a quarter since the Brexit vote. The  by the Treasury ahead of the vote has not happened.There have been economic consequences of the referendum. The pound＊s fall has made imports dearer and contributed to a squeeze on living standards, but it has helped manufacturers who, , have the strongest order books in three decades. Britain＊s unbalanced economy needs higher exports and less reliance on consumer spending, unpopular though that combination is.Some in the remain camp have taken heart from the fact that France is growing more quickly than the UK, hopeful that this might engender the much-anticipated buyers＊ remorse. There is not yet much sign of this, perhaps because voters are smart enough to realise that one quarter does not make up for decades of slow growth and high unemployment in France, and perhaps also because countries are sometimes willing to accept some short-term economic pain for a political objective. Germany at the time of reunification is a case in point.The Tories own Brexit. It was their decision to hold a referendum and it is their responsibility to deliver it at a time when there is a distinct lack of a feelgood factor. In one sense, this is good news for Jeremy Corbyn because he can watch the Conservatives struggle. But it is also a challenge, because the possibility of another election will focus attention on what a Labour  would look like.Labour＊s approach has thus far been one of studied ambiguity. To put up a decent show in the general election in June, Corbyn needed to hold together a coalition of leave voters in the north and Midlands with remain voters in London and the other big cities. So the line was that Labour accepted the result of the referendum but would seek to secure access to the single market in any negotiations. Despite the loss of a handful of seats where the leave vote was strong, the strategy worked.One option for Corbyn would be to say that the result of the referendum was a terrible mistake and that the whole Brexit thing should be called off. What might be called Labour＊s hardline remain faction says Britain could have the best of both worlds: it could have the political upheaval caused by Brexit, which has weakened the Conservatives, while at the same time maintaining the economic status quo. The UK would be back where it was before the referendum, only with Corbyn and John McDonnell running things instead of David Cameron and George Osborne.There are, though, one or two drawbacks to this approach. One is that quite a lot of the 17 million people who voted leave in the referendum were cheesed off with the status quo and don＊t want it resurrected. A second is that many of the measures that a Labour government might want to introduce to remedy Britain＊s structural weaknesses 每 increased state aid, infant industry protection, public ownership 每 would be harder to implement, or actually prohibited, inside the EU. A third is that it would be profoundly anti-democratic. The liberal left＊s approach to the Grenfell Tower fire has been to demand that poor people have a voice, yet this sits oddly, to say the least, with the idea that the result of the EU referendum should be overturned because the poor people who voted for Brexit didn＊t know what they were doing. Giving people a voice means giving people a voice. It doesn＊t mean only giving them a voice when they agree with you.A slightly milder version of hardline remain is the one : to retain the option of staying in the European single market. This would be Brexit but the mildest Brexit possible. Moving leftwards on the spectrum, there are those who think Britain should stay in the EU but only if it is reformed. This gets round the problem of simply turning the clock back to the state of affairs that existed before the referendum and also recognises that the shortcomings of the eurozone 每 the one-size fits all single currency, the austerity imposed on Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the ingrained unemployment and the perpetually slow growth 每 might have had something to do with last year＊s result.Those who say a different Europe is needed are right in their analysis. The problem they have is in explaining how this different Europe comes about, particularly given that the direction of travel for decades has been entirely in the opposite direction, towards a destination where budgets have to balanced, where countries have to deflate their way back to growth, where the nation state must bend the knee to market forces and competition and where neoliberal ideas hold sway. A Corbyn-led government could make a success of reform and remain, but only if it could win the support of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and a Council of Ministers, none of which are exactly awash with kindred spirits. It would require treaty change to bring about a different , which seems unlikely.Finally, there are those who favour left exit or Lexit, a group that sees the EU as anti-democratic, pro-big business and steeped in conservative economics. Lexiteers see Brexit not as a threat to use trade, procurement, tax, ownership, and public investment to transform the economy along socialist lines. So that＊s the choice. At one end of the spectrum are those who want Brexit to be as soft and messy as possible to prevent what they fear will be serious economic damage from leaving. They think the EU has been a success, the single currency＊s travails are simply teething troubles, that Emmanuel Macron heralds a new dawn for European social democracy and that socialism in one country is a fantasy.At the other end are those who think the EU embodies neo-liberalism, that the euro should be broken up, that Macron will deliver more for his former employers at Rothschild than for the French working class, and that radical socialism is possible even in the teeth of violent opposition from the financial markets. With a different leader, Labour would almost certainly be heading in a more soft Brexit direction. But before 2015＊s leadership contest, Labour＊s hard Lexiteers would have been able to count on support from Corbyn and McDonnell. Hence the ambiguity."															
"e have heard plenty from the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee of late, with its members divided over how to set interest rates in a post-referendum Britain. The debate centres on when to raise borrowing costs from their record low and whether the economy 每 and squeezed consumers 每 can take it.This week it will be the turn of the Bank＊s financial policy committee to hold forth. Its twice-yearly financial stability report will be presented by the governor, Mark Carney, on Tuesday and he is likely to use the health check to highlight the problem of consumer debt burdens in the UK. With real incomes squeezed, households have been dipping into savings and maxing out their credit cards.The Bank has raised its concerns about what this means for the broader financial system before, and could well use this update to flag the risks to the system if individuals overstretch themselves. Investors will be watching?for any hints from the Bank on what it plans to do about rising consumer borrowing.Carney is also likely to use the report to give himself and committee colleagues a pat on the back for the steps already taken by the FPC to rein in the mortgage market, which in turn give monetary policymakers scope to raise interest rates without inflicting too much harm on borrowers.The royal family＊s commercial property arm has had full confidence in the resilience of the market in the West End of London despite the Brexit vote.Even though investment in commercial property sank to its lowest levels in four years in the aftermath of the referendum, the Crown Estate said it was pushing ahead with a ?100m development of Duke＊s Court, a mixed retail and office block in St?James＊s, because it believed in ※the fundamentals of London＊s West End§.Six months and an election later, and with the Brexit negotiations having just started, what will the view of the Crown Estate be now? On Monday, chief executive Alison Nimmo will reveal the annual results for the estate, which owns London＊s Regent Street and the entire UK seabed, among many other holdings. Last year the property empire delivered a record ?304.1m to Treasury coffers and saw the value of its portfolio rise 9.7% to ?12bn.The post-Brexit market is very different for commercial property, however, and a report from Deloitte found high levels of construction, but with less than half of the space being built let. Duke＊s Court is due to be completed in the spring of 2019 每 around the same time that article 50 negotiations are also due to complete.Opponents of fracking are expected to gather this week in Lancashire for what has been called an ※information evening§ about the activities of energy company Cuadrilla in the area.Work began in January on the company＊s Preston New Road site, in Little Plumpton, Fylde West, which will be the location of the UK＊s first horizontally fracked wells and a group of protesters has been a consistent presence since.On Tuesday, anyone interested in fracking 每 including supporters 每 has been invited to a town-hall-style gathering at the 450-seat Lowther Pavilion theatre in Lytham St Annes, organised by engineer Mike Hill, one of the most vocal opponents of fracking in Lancashire. Billed as an event for all the community to learn about fracking, Hill says the meeting will focus on facts and not opinion, according to the Drill or Drop blog on fracking.Last March, the chief executive of Cuadrilla, Francis Egan, complained about intimidation and harassment by what he called ※irresponsible§ activists at the Preston New Road site. He said he felt the balance between the right to protest and the right for companies to go about their business had tipped in the wrong direction amid reports of verbal abuse of his staff. Whether?Egan turns up at the meeting as one of the supporters of fracking remains to be?seen."															
"he investment plans of Jaguar Land Rover are unlikely to be an isolated reaction to Brexit. Last week the carmaker revealed amid a fanfare of publicity that it would be  and, with less fanfare, that it would begin work on its next-generation electric car in Austria.Very simply, the company appears to have made a judgment that for the next two to three years the pound will remain low and, with this discount in place on its exports, it will profit from shifting a huge volume of diesel cars from factories in the West Midlands and Merseyside to the rest of the world.But the post-2020 years will be dominated by sales of electric cars, and for that  poses too many risks.The rhetoric from the car industry has become more strident as the opening of negotiations has neared and last year＊s vague promises from business secretary Greg Clark of help and support have faded from memory.Mike Hawes, the boss of the carmakers＊ lobbying organisation, said last week that without the promise from Theresa May of  to fall back on when talks on a deal conclude in 2019, firms would look overseas for expansion, not to the UK.Hawes has long argued for a deal that keeps tariffs low and regulations in harmony to favour trade. The difference between his comments in the past week and those just a few months ago was the tone. It was all high anxiety, where once there was dead calm.Already the anecdotal evidence of scrapped investments in the UK are piling up. City investment managers say their clients are increasingly twitchy about what , the UK＊s chief negotiator, can achieve against the brick wall of intransigence built by EU leaders.It doesn＊t matter to exporters that Nigel Farage says that a hard Brexit is for the birds, after the election and a hung parliament. A hard Brexit is still the logical outcome of the UK＊s position that free movement of labour and the jurisdiction of the European court of justice must end in Calais.The opening skirmishes over the right of EU citizens to remain in the UK and on what terms have shown how tough Angela Merkel and other EU leaders intend to be as they stand behind Michel Barnier and his team to preserve the integrity of the union, and the single market in particular.The former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis gives a disturbing account of his negotiations in Brussels following the country＊s debt crisis. Greece was obviously in a worse position than the UK, and therefore a weaker negotiating partner. Still, . He warns that EU negotiators will happily drown meetings in swaths of data and a determination to focus on details when the resolution of a particular problem is within their grasp.So it wasn＊t surprising that the Belgian prime minister and others described May＊s proposals as vague. It is almost the default position of any senior EU-supporting politician.Even dyed-in-the-wool europhiles can recognise that the EU＊s reaction to the 2008 crash and its aftermath showed that democracy plays second fiddle to the survival of the union.In his book , Varoufakis relates how the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch?uble welcomed him to his first meeting with the words: ※It is my mandate against yours.§ Sch?uble, according to Varoufakis, ※was honouring a long EU tradition of neglecting democratic mandates in the name of respecting them§.Germany＊s tight-fisted finance chief, feted as one of the architects of German reunification, and reviled in equal measure as the chief enslaver of Greece in perpetuity, may be shuffled to one side in a new Merkel government after elections this year. But the EU will continue to sing the same song, especially now that May＊s mandate is that much weaker.And that is what British and international companies based in the UK are waking up to. They themselves spend billions of pounds each year lobbying in Brussels to gain an advantage against outside competition. If they didn＊t, Europe would be deluged with cheap goods from the far east while its huge trade surplus with the US would be much diminished.Estimates that the German car companies would lose 60,000 or 80,000 jobs in the event of a hard Brexit and the return of tariffs to Anglo-German trade might be close to the truth, but they miss the point. Business leaders from Warsaw to Stockholm, and Madrid to Dublin, are well aware that Brussels believes in Brussels first and foremost, and the advantages to them of this stance are many.Davis was always kidding himself as he toured Europe before the talks, telling local politicians that they were powerless to prevent Britain extracting a beneficial trade deal because they were in hock to big business. If Bavarian politicians were being dictated to, it was not by BMW, it was by the Brussels elite.Yes, Barnier et al were nervous last year when Italy＊s Five Star Movement and Spain＊s Podemos were poised to wreak Ukip-style havoc with their own exit plans. But that time has passed, leaving Brussels free to bury Davis in details 每 and any hopes of a soft Brexit with it."															
"f you had told people in the City at the height of the  in 2008 that it would take almost nine years for the , few would have believed you. If you had then said that this first prosecution would relate to suspected fraud over one bank＊s supposed attempt to avoid nationalisation 每 rather than the crash itself 每 the bankers involved in the crisis would have laughed in disbelief: surely, they aren＊t going to let us get away with that?But they did: the bankers who played a central role in the worst crash of the postwar era . Even worse, the fundamentals of the system that made it possible were retained intact.It is feasible that some of the  will now go to jail for the way they raised billions from Qatar to avoid a government bailout 每 though the accused deny breaking any laws.Yet ultimately it is of little consequence how this case plays out. The main outcome of the crash is that the DNA of the system that nearly destroyed the world economy is still there. In 2015 Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England＊s financial stability chief,  not even the regulator can know what banks really own and owe because they are still allowed to hide so much off the balance sheet.It is worth recalling just how close we were to unimaginable disaster after  in September 2008. Since nobody in the sector knew what other banks＊ real status, pure panic broke out. The entire global financial system threatened to collapse. As the then president of the European council, Herman Van Rompuy, admitted (years later): ※We came within millimetres of a total implosion§ 每 an implosion that would have meant hundreds of millions of people discovering that they had lost access to bank accounts, and that supplies to supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations had stopped.With a lot of luck and very expensive emergency measures, an economic cardiac arrest was averted. At the time few insiders were open about the danger the world economy was in, for fear of provoking the very panic that threatened the system. This was probably wise: but the consequence is that few outsiders are aware of the threat posed by the system in its current form. And without public awareness of the need for a genuinely different financial sector, there is precious little political capital in truly taking on the banks and their accomplices.So, the short answer as to why no top banker lost his (they are always men) fortune when their banks went bust and required bailouts or nationalisation? It＊s politics. There was too little political capital and almost no political will among mainstream parties to break up the banks and make them small and simple again 每 let alone to take on the ※top§ bankers and at least take away the bonuses paid out to reward profits that in 2008 proved illusory.Indeed, as soon as the shock of the Lehmans moment subsided, the banks went on the offensive again. In America the financial lobby has been able to make the  每 brought in after the crash to make things safer 每 all but unworkable. Huge campaign donations helped ※financial business-friendly§ politicians get elected and re-elected. Those presidents, prime ministers and finance ministers who stayed within the lines set by the financial sector were rewarded lavishly. Some got lucrative speaking engagements 每 Hillary Clinton＊s $200,000  come to mind. Others found new work after their time in politics was over, with Tony Blair taking a reported  as a fixer for JP Morgan. George Osborne, Britain＊s former chancellor, was the latest big name to join the industry, netting about  at the US fund manager BlackRock.Whether Theresa May ends up with a City job paying huge rewards remains to be seen. It can＊t hurt her chances that the Tory election  promised to  每 the body that has now brought charges against the Barclays bankers."															
"The chancellor, , hinted on Sunday that the government would ease up on its austerity programme, saying the Conservatives were ※not deaf§ to the message delivered by the election result.In interviews in which he also criticised Theresa May＊s team for sidelining him during the election campaign, Hammond said that he accepted that ※people are weary of the long slog§.But he also insisted that, with the deficit still at 2.5% of GDP, government borrowing was ※not sustainable in the long term§ and he left open the possibility of raising taxes to fund more generous public spending.Asked whether he would go ahead with ?3bn of cuts to local government funding, he replied: ※We＊ve set out a series of measures that are already legislated for. We have other proposals that we will now have to look at again in the light of the general election result and in the new parliament.※I will be delivering a budget in the autumn and you will find out then what we are proposing. There＊s not going to be a summer budget or anything like that.§Pressed on whether the government would have to change direction, particularly if it did a deal with the DUP, which is opposed to cuts to the winter fuel allowance and the end of the triple lock on pensions, he replied: ※We will look at all these things. Obviously we are not deaf. We heard a message last week in the general election and we need to look at how we deal with the challenges we face in the economy.※I understand that people are weary after years of hard work to rebuild the economy after the great crash of 2008-09, but we have to live within our means. More borrowing, which seems to be Jeremy Corbyn＊s answer, is not the solution.※We have never said we won＊t raise some taxes. Overall, we are a government that believes in low taxes and we want to reduce the burden of taxes overall for working families.§ In interviews on the Andrew Marr Show and Peston on Sunday, Hammond stressed that he had already taken some steps to relax the austerity programme set by his predecessor, George Osborne. He said that when he became chancellor last summer he pushed back the target date for the government getting the budget into surplus ※into effectively the middle of the next decade§.Hammond played a relatively low-key role during the Conservative election campaign, with May refusing to confirm that she would keep him as chancellor if she won, although she retained him in his post, along with all her other most senior cabinet ministers, after her failure to obtain a majority left her without the authority to reshape her team.In a sign of the new confidence he feels in his role, Hammond said three times that the decision to sideline him during the campaign 每 or keep him ※not quite in a cupboard§, as joked 每 was ※a mistake§.He explained: ※We didn＊t talk about the economy as much as we should have done.※We didn＊t put enough energy into dismantling Jeremy Corbyn＊s economic proposals and his spending plans, which would be catastrophic for this country. We will now do that ... which I would like to have done during the campaign.§"															
"hen I suggested before the election  and a coalition to think again on Brexit, I was certainly not thinking of the DUP. But, as Harold Macmillan once said: ※Here we are, and the question is: where do we go from here?§It seems to be generally agreed that the election result boiled down to a vote against austerity and a vote against a so-called ※hard Brexit§, with the young 每 predominantly Remainers and angry about austerity 每 in full swing.The vote against austerity was long overdue. Under Cameron and Osborne the Conservatives got away with blue murder in blaming the world financial crisis on Labour in general and Gordon Brown in particular. Their obsession with ※the deficit§ hoodwinked people who do not understand that a nation is not a household, and that cuts in public expenditure are the reverse of what is required in a time of depression.All economies need a period of rapid growth after a recession. This was denied the people of this country, who have finally rebelled. Way back in 1980, in the early stages of Mrs Thatcher＊s sado-monetarist regime, the great JK Galbraith wrote in this newspaper: ※British social services and social insurance soften what elsewhere might be intolerable hardship. British phlegm is a good antidote for anger; but so is an adequate system of unemployment?insurance.§Unfortunately, the gaps in our social safety net are showing, and in some cases a government obsessed with reducing the size of the state has deliberately ripped that net apart.Thinktanks are vying with one another to tell us about a record period of negligible growth in living standards. Alas, things are becoming even worse as the referendum-induced devaluation bites further into real incomes.The terrible thing about the prospect of Brexit is that our underlying economic situation is already bad enough, and the  decision, if not reversed, is guaranteed to make things a lot worse. In economics there are time lags between announcements and their consequences, and under George Osborne the Treasury overdid its warnings about the timing of the referendum＊s effects. Only now are people beginning to realise the consequences of the decision made last year by the world＊s financial markets that Britain had, in effect, voted to become poorer and less secure. The devaluation constituted a reassessment of this country＊s economic prospects.It was Philip Hammond, Osborne＊s successor, who, in challenging Theresa May＊s obsession with a hard Brexit, maintained that the people who voted for Brexit did not vote to become poorer. But that is what the 51.9% of those who voted in effect did.There were those who thought that the fantasy of a 150-seat majority would enable May to see off the hard Brexiters and pursue a more sensible policy. But all the evidence suggests that she meant what she said: that she put reductions in immigration above all else, and was prepared to leave the customs union and the single market in order to realise this dubious aim.It is this preparedness to leave the single market that puzzles me most about the Brexiters. On the whole, these are people who worship the memory of Margaret Thatcher and thought she could do no wrong. My own view is that she did quite a lot of wrong, but that the single market was a great achievement, working very much in our economy＊s interests. Yet these latter-day Thatcherites are prepared to give it all up in their mystical pursuit of ※sovereignty§ and ※control§.One of the results of the election is that May is now so weakened that she has no alternative but to hang on to a chancellor who knows that Brexit is self-damaging nonsense. Hammond is trying to make the best of a bad job: in remarks on Friday before an EU meeting, he rightly emphasised the need for the UK to concentrate on jobs, growth and the needs of business. , the needs of business do not include Brexit. On the contrary. The Duke of York should stick to what he knows.Earlier in the week, Harvard University released written by Ed Balls, who needs no introduction, and Peter Sands, former chief executive of Standard Chartered. Originally conceived as a way of helping British business to cope with Brexit, the report seems to this correspondent to deliver a very simple message: British business would rather not have to cope with Brexit at all. Thus, ※contrary to much of the media and political commentary, the majority of businesses ＃ were broadly satisfied with current regulatory approaches in their sectors§, and ※many spoke to the overall quality of EU regulations and rule-making processes§.This is the nub. It is hardly surprising that Lord Bridges, who has been finding it increasingly frustrating trying to find a workable approach to Brexit for the government, has resigned from the Department for Exiting from the  in apparent disgust. Yes, he has exited the Department for Exiting. I am not making this up. And I don＊t blame him. When will my old friend David Davis finally get the point?Which brings us to the statesmanlike way in which Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, offered Britain : ※Until negotiations come to an end there is always a chance to reopen the door.§Lord Adonis has said: ※We are at a moment of national crisis, with echoes of the 30s.§ His fellow peer, Michael Heseltine, has suggested that the problem could be sorted out at heads-of-government level, and that it should not be impossible to achieve the kind of concessions that eluded David Cameron. The stakes are that great!"															
"A fall in home ownership is fuelling the return of rising wealth inequality across Britain, it has emerged.Booming house prices in the run-up to the financial crisis had led to a decade-long fall in the uneven distribution of the country＊s wealth. However, comprehensive new analysis of the UK＊s wealth divisions has now found that the trend has gone into reverse.The study by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found that just a tenth of adults own around half of the nation＊s wealth. The top 1% own 14% of the total. It warned that even this figure may be an underestimate because of the difficulties in calculating the assets of the super-rich.By contrast, 15% of adults in Britain have either no share of the nation＊s record ?11.1 trillion of wealth, or have negative wealth. The study found that wealth is distributed far less evenly than earnings or household income.The thinktank measured wealth inequality using the , with 0 being perfect wealth equality and 1 representing a society where a single person has it all. Wealth inequality was almost twice as high as earnings?inequality. Despite the perception that wealth inequality has been rising for decades, the research found that the  fell steadily between 1995 and 2005, with the Gini coefficient falling from 0.71 to 0.64.The fall was driven by high and rising home ownership, with more households benefiting from the pre-crisis property price boom. As a result, the proportion of property wealth owned by the bottom four-fifths of adults grew from 35% in 1995 to 40% in 2005.However, home ownership , with the wealth held by the bottom four-fifths of the population dipping as a result. Since the financial crisis, home ownership among the least wealthy 50% of the population has fallen by about 12%. Meanwhile, it has risen by 1% for the wealthiest tenth.The shift in property ownership further towards the richest has contributed to the widening of wealth inequality. Including private pensions, the Gini coefficient rose from 0.67 to 0.69 from 2006-08 to 2012-14.Total wealth across Britain, which includes private pensions, property, financial and physical wealth, rose in the wake of the financial crisis from ?9.9tn in 2006-08 to ?11.1tn in 2012-14. This has been fuelled by rising pension wealth.While Britain as a whole has become wealthier, the wealth of a typical adult has fallen since the financial crisis from ?99,000 in 2006-08 to ?84,000 in 2012-14.Private pensions account for 40% of the wealth total 每 the largest share at ?4.5tn. The report forms part of the Resolution Foundation＊s intergenerational commission. Conor D＊Arcy, policy analyst at the foundation, said: ※The accumulation of wealth over the course of our lives is arguably the most important driver of lifetime living standards, and yet it has been largely ignored in the public debate. Given the hugely unequal distribution of wealth across Britain, it＊s time we looked into how the nation＊s wealth is divided up and what the consequences are for those who never build up assets of any significance.※With wealth inequality now rising again, the progress of the pre-crisis period has gone into reverse.※At ?11.1tn and growing, Britain has a lot of wealth to share around. It＊s vital that policy makers ensure that the key drivers of wealth in Britain today 每 property and pensions 每 are accessible to as many people as possible, young and old.§"															
"ix months after the coalition government came to power, the first version of  was written out of a deep frustration with austerity politics. David Cameron promised that ※we＊re all in this together§ 每 but the aggressive cuts to public services coupled with banker bailouts told another story. We wanted to put the anger of many Britons to a beat and become an outlet for protest, while providing levity and solidarity in grim times.It was a way to make politics more relevant and accessible to a wider audience, including young people, by challenging the ※I＊m not into politics§ refrain. After seven years, the government cuts that were meant to put Britain＊s finances in order .  while . When Theresa May called a snap election on a platform promising strength and stability on the back of ever-deeper public service cuts, it seemed like the right time to .Over the past seven years the band has repeatedly been told that political music is too controversial, too geeky or out of fashion, yet the Liar Liar GE2017 remix seems to have struck a chord over the past week. Despite making it to No 4 in the , all commercial stations have refused to play it alongside the other top 40 tracks, to maintain balance and impartiality during an election season, in accordance with Ofcom regulations. Yet Liar Liar GE2017 shows the power of protest music in action. Despite its exclusion from the airwaves, the track has been circulated through social media and has managed to transcend the confines of conventional channels. Perhaps after seven years of coalition and Conservative policies, protest music is resonating with a wider public and coming back into fashion.BBC Radio 1 has gone above and beyond the remit of Ofcom regulations by not only refusing to play Liar Liar GE2017, but also  next to the online track listing, which prevents listeners from linking to it as they can with all the other top 40 tracks. It is hard to see what service the BBC is providing to the public by discouraging them from accessing any viewpoints that could instigate critical thinking or debate. Yet open debate is entirely necessary for democratic society＊s survival. The BBC is not exercising impartiality, but actively censoring material that it has decided is disagreeable. There are historical precedents for this censorship 每 when the , for instance 每 that suggest the organisation continually errs on the side of establishment. This is a troubling stance for a broadcaster that is meant to represent the public.One can understand the good intentions behind Ofcom＊s rules, but unfortunately they rely on the fiction that you can easily magic up a neutral value-free space just because it＊s an election season. This ignores how power structures work around the clock day in and day out; they cannot simply take a holiday.Liar Liar GE2017 is certainly an anomaly in the charts due to its subject matter. There are no tantalising sexual lyrics, while the video features a host of Tory politicians instead of scantily clad gyrating women. In an era where young people are always castigated for not engaging with politics as pop culture leads them astray, surely their interest and engagement with politics should be applauded and encouraged rather than censured? This shows that what is regarded as political and who gets the airtime to speak is a deeply embedded issue of power and privilege.Instead we are urged to tune out of politics and focus on songs about sex, love and breakups. It＊s not that these topics aren＊t important, but there needs to be room for a richer and wider discussion. Taking an overt political stance via Ska has been embraced by many 每 perhaps because lots of other folk feel there is too much at stake in this election to just tune out.So, just to clear up a few facts: , the video hasn＊t been watched over 2.5 million times, nor downloaded over 40,000 times. There aren＊t  around the country playing it to thousands of partying students and we most certainly won＊t be performing it live on Wednesday in . So just keep calm, zone out and put on some Justin Bieber."															
"he choice facing the voters in this election is clear 每 between more failed austerity or a Labour party advancing an economic agenda that is right for the UK. To understand why  is right, we first need to look back to the 1980s.Under Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the UK, there was a rewriting of the basic rules of capitalism. These two governments changed the rules governing labour bargaining, weakening trade unions; and they weakened anti-trust enforcement, allowing more monopolies to be created. In our economy today we can see industries with one or two or three firms with market power. This gives them the power to raise prices 每 and as they raise prices, people＊s incomes fall, in terms of what they can buy.Changes to how our corporations are governed have allowed , leaving less and less to be reinvested in the company, and less to pay to workers. Monetary policy has been conducted with a focus on inflation rather than on employment.Over three decades later, it is clear that the rules were rewritten in ways that slowed our economy. These changes encourage financialisation, with firms chasing only profits; and they promote short-termism, with companies unwilling to invest over the longer term. Both contribute to this slowdown. And as the economy has grown more slowly, it has been divided more unequally.The set of ideas that came to dominate has been called . By boosting inequality and a dependency on finance, the ideas of neoliberalism fed directly into the crash of 2008. The ideas have now been shown to be wrong, to have failed for over a third of a century. It＊s time for us to think about alternatives.Put simply, there needs to be an appropriate balance between government and market. When an economy is weak, as it has been in recent years, there is a need for governments to invest in people, technology and infrastructure. This not only grows the economy today, but also in the future.Instead, since the crash, many governments have turned to austerity. Across Europe, and in Britain, they have tried frantically to cut their spending, allegedly to repay debts run up as a result of the crisis.The idea that government debt is a particular burden has a kind of intuitive appeal. The former Conservative chancellor George Osborne would talk about ※maxing out the credit card§, so governments would have to balance the books, and couldn＊t borrow. But an economy is different from a family. In an economy, when the government spends more and invests in the economy, that money circulates, and recirculates again and again. So not only does it create jobs once: the investment creates jobs multiple times.The result of that is that the economy grows by a multiple of the initial spending, and public finances turn out to be stronger: as the economy grows, fiscal revenues increase, and demands for the government to pay unemployment benefits, or fund social programmes to help the poor and needy, go down. As tax revenues go up as a result of growth, and as these expenditures decrease, the government＊s fiscal position strengthens.. The evidence on this point is very clear. Austerity has not only damaged the European economies, including the UK, but actually threatens future growth. For instance, when you have young people not learning, or in jobs inappropriate to their skills, they＊re not increasing their human capital in the way they could be. Without that human capital, future economic growth will be lower than it could have been. It is remarkable that there are still governments, including here in the UK, that still believe in austerity.There is a need for a break with the past. With neoliberalism discredited and austerity failed, we need to rewrite the rules of the economy once again. But this time in the right way. We need rules that focus on long-term economic growth, and the only kind of sustainable prosperity is shared prosperity.Even if you have to borrow, if the value of your investments 每 in people, in technology, in infrastructure 每 increases, then the economy is in a stronger position for the future. Focusing only on the debt side of the balance sheet misses this, and damages the economy.There＊s a long list of investments that governments could and should be making. There is strengthening infrastructure, such as transport and communications; there is investment in education; there is investment in families, particularly putting measures in place that free women from having to make the choice between raising a family and work. If that is done, it increases the labour supply. And that is not only better for society 每 it＊s better for the economy.In this election, it is Labour that is advocating the kind of economic plan that is right for the UK. I＊ve been impressed with how the party proposes to finance its plans: it＊s not on the basis of ※magic money§, but on carefully thought-out proposals based on taxing those at the top and ensuring that corporations pay what they should. The evidence shows that these actions will not slow down growth but will help strengthen the UK economy."															
"avid Robinson Simon＊s latest colonoscopy was carried out at a major hospital in southern California by the head of its gastroenterology department. ※I said something like, ＆I hope you don＊t find any polyps, because I＊m a vegan, so I shouldn＊t be at risk,＊§ Simon says. ※He said, ＆Ah, that＊s a bunch of nonsense.＊§As Simon tells me this anecdote, 27 minutes into our interview, a new twist on the old joke crosses my mind: How do you know if someone is vegan? They＊ll tell you ＃ as you＊re about to give them a colonoscopy.It＊s a cliche but the mainstream perception of people who voluntarily avoid animal products is that they＊re smug and earnest 每 and out to recruit anyone who＊ll listen. The persistence of the stereotype is testament to our attachment to eating meat, even as the arguments against doing so apparently pile up.In his book Meatonomics, about the unseen economic drivers of the meat industry, Simon set out to make a new case for the head, to supplement the existing ones for the heart.※The traditional three arguments in this field are around health, ethics and the environment 每 I just wanted to have a fourth perspective, which was economics,§ he says. ※If I can reach people through another set of arguments they may not have heard before then there＊s just one other way to open the door.§The figures Simon puts forward are so big as to defy comprehension: he says the externalised cost of America＊s animal food system is US$414bn annually. Three-quarters of that is expenditure on healthcare relating to the ※epidemics§ of obesity, diabetes and heart disease that Simon says are driven by high rates of consumption of meat and dairy.But as much as Simon sought with Meatonomics to make the case against eating animals with numbers alone, he admits it was ※somewhat challenging§ to prioritise that perspective over another that is well known and widely ignored: that animals raised for consumption undergo extreme suffering.References to the structural cruelty of the animal food industry were cut from the book at the insistence of Simon＊s publisher. ※I think ＆sentimental＊ was the word they used,§ he says. (These paragraphs, on the ※debasement§ of animals in industrial meat production systems, subsequentlyappeared  under the heading: ※Reprinted with appropriate sentimentality.§)Simon is not an economist but a lawyer, whose day job is a general counsel for a healthcare company. He is closing in on his 10th year as a vegan after watching a HBO documentary called I Am an Animal about Ingrid Newkirk, the co-founder of Peta, that sent him down an online rabbit hole of animal rights videos.※Literally that night, I took all the animal foods out of my refrigerator,§ he says. ※I just transitioned overnight. I went from eating bacon double cheeseburgers at fast-food restaurants to eating vegan bacon double cheeseburgers.§He is among a minority: in the US, an estimated 5% of people are vegan, vegetarian or pescatarian. The rest continue to eat meat in vast and increasing quantities. A  thinktank found global consumption was already at unhealthy levels and set to rise by more than 75% by 2050. Later OECD figures say global meat production was projected to be 16% higher in 2025 than in 2013-15.Consumption has skyrocketed because, Simon says, of the system of government subsidies, legislation and regulation he outlines in Meatonomics that allows animal food producers to keep output high and retail prices artificially low. If the industry were forced to cover its total costs, instead of imposing them on taxpayers, animals and the environment, a US$4 Big Mac would cost about $11, he says.Though his argument in the book is specific to the US, the mechanics are broadly true for other countries, including Australia, which Simon visited in May on a lecture tour organised by the animal rights charity Voiceless. But outside of animal rights advocacy communities, he says Meatonomics has been perceived as ※just another vegan diatribe§ 每 and he hasn＊t received any response from producers at all.※More likely, it＊s on their radar but they think that by not calling attention to it it＊s less likely to get airtime than if they do address it.§Part of omnivores＊ resistance stems from the perception that vegans are out to control their behaviour: even vegetarianism is still seen as an agenda, despite empirical evidence of its benefits. ※When people tell you things like ＆that burger means a cow spent her life in misery＊, there is a sense that ＆how dare you tell me what I am allowed to eat or do, this is a free country＊,§ Simon says.※I think a lot of the indignation stems from that. The challenge is to try and present information in ways that doesn＊t cause that sort of response.§The societal shift needs to be led by the medical community, which he says has been dismissive of the link between particularly red meat and noncommunicable diseases. ※Whenever somebody tells me they＊ve got a friend or relative who＊s just been diagnosed with cancer, for example, I always ask, ＆And did their doctor recommend any dietary changes?＊※Usually, the answer is no. Sometimes it＊s chicken.§ He laughs.※What we need is regular, mainstream, meat-eating doctors to tell their patients, if you＊ve got heart disease or diabetes, you should be on a plant-based diet. And we＊ll get there, I＊m sure we will.§He draws hope from an unlikely historical example: tobacco. ※Seventy years ago, if you asked somebody if smoking was bad for them, they＊d say, ＆Heck no, whenever I catch a cold, I smoke a cigarette and I feel better right away.＊※I just think we＊re at that same place and we need to go through that evolution where we come to grips with the truth.§It is less outlandish than it sounds, he says. ※Exactly everything that I envision for meat has happened with tobacco.§That backlash was led by doctors 每 GPs, not specialists 每 on the basis of their observations of patients. When the health risks of tobacco were recognised in the surgeon general＊s report in 1964, about 42% of US adults were smokers compared with 15% today. The industry rapidly lost credibility and influence, with Congress requiring that all cigarette packets display warning labels the following year. By 1970 all US states and territories had implemented cigarette taxes, and radio and television advertisements had been banned. Judges, previously cowed by the industry＊s history of litigation, were empowered by policymakers to allow lawsuits against tobacco companies to proceed to trial.The final blow came in 2004, when the government ended subsidies for tobacco farmers through its buyout program.※I really do think if we could do it with tobacco it＊s completely plausible that it could happen with meat,§ Simon says. He is heartened by recent references 每 and  每 to a ※tax on meat§, his preferred solution for wrenching consumption back down to sustainable levels.  Oxford University team calculated that surcharges of 40% on beef and 20% on milk would account for the damage their production causes people via climate change, while also improving health through reduced consumption.There are signs the cultural shift is under way through initiatives such as ※meatless Mondays§, which have been adopted in many US school districts. The impact of the so-called ※reducetarian movement§ on the industry may be negligible, but Simon says it is effective is in changing attitudes to make it more acceptable not to eat meat. While it doesn＊t matter to him how people come to vegetarianism or veganism, they＊re more likely to stick to it if they＊re motivated by ethical reasons, he says. ※They＊re much less likely to go, two or three years down the road, ＆You know what, I＊m just not getting enough＊ 每 fill in the blank 每 ＆iron, protein, calcium.＊§In the past Simon has ※flirted with different diets§. Diagnosed with high cholesterol, he tried vegetarianism for a month or two; at another point he went on the Atkins diet. ※Two completely different ends of the spectrum, but neither one really stuck.§But with veganism motivated by animal rights, he says: ※Once that switch clicked, I＊ve never had any 每 well, I mean, I look at a steak sometimes and think that looks pretty good, but I＊ve never had any desire to go back.§"															
"n the day that former Royal Bank of Scotland boss  explaining in court how he crashed the business and lost billions of pounds during the 2008 financial crash, it is timely to consider Britain＊s post-election economic fortunes. It is a future still defined by the banking crash that Fred ※the Shred§ Goodwin was so much a part of, and by the aftershocks that still weigh the government down with debt. In particular, the blow to confidence deterred businesses  needed to raise productivity and lift average wages. Britain＊s not a strong and stable economy, but a fundamentally weak and enfeebled one, brought low by a banking industry that lent hundreds of billions more than it should have to people it barely knew.It is not for the want of profits that businesses have shied away from shopping for the latest ideas or buying the latest kit. Official figures show  were back to the peak achieved in 2008. In the last quarter, the number of companies convinced their profit forecasts were on target or likely to exceed expectations was at a three-year high. Yet in the three months before Christmas, business investment actually fell 0.9% and was flat overall during the previous year.It is this lack of investment that the next government must address and quickly 每 not just to strengthen an economy starved of private sector spending since the noughties, but also to address the concerns of a younger generation that lacks an endowment worthy of the name from those already retired or reaching the end of their working lives.This is not a subject that has featured much in the last few weeks of election debates and speeches. Questions about how to run the state and the economy while at the same time breaking away from the European Union have rarely been asked. Looking at the main parties＊ manifestos, there is a clear divide between them, as there is on much else, even if there is some agreement on the need for greater state intervention. Labour believes corporate leaders had their chance to invest and blew it. Under Labour, government-backed investments will be the priority via a dedicated bank, public sector housing developments and some expensive nationalisations. Corporate profits will be returned to 2010 levels to fund it. The?Conservatives expect lower corporation tax rates to finally trigger an increase in investment, and economic growth strong enough to offset the party＊s painful austerity agenda.  promises more spending from Whitehall on infrastructure, but her policies continue to rely on the private sector to boost?the economy.This strategy might have some foundation, except that the decline in corporate taxes from 28% in 2010 to 19% this year produced virtually no increase in investment or productivity. Instead profits have found their way back to shareholders. Another cut in corporation tax to 17%, the Tories＊ plan, means more of the same. Meanwhile, Mrs May plans to focus her austerity cuts on young people likely to have or to be planning a family, . Increases in personal taxes or VAT, which she has refused to rule out, would fall on the same group. Mrs May＊s only stab at addressing the intergenerational divide was a tax on those who need social care. It?addresses one small corner of the welfare state while the engine of employment and higher wages, namely the economy, continues to splutter. The new ?3bn apprenticeship levy should be a bonus, but reports already indicate it that is being introduced haphazardly. Further education colleges and schools budgets are squeezed. is right. Only a bigger injection of investment funds from the state can lay the groundwork for higher levels of investment. And that is even more the case as Brexit negotiations loom. Anything less will mean Britain continues to rely on cheap labour and more debt to keep the show on the road."															
"Tory politicians now frequently accuse Labour of believing in the existence of a ※magic money tree§ that will enable a Labour government to ※pay for it§ (, 3 June). They hope that none of us will remember that in its 2014 Q1 Quarterly Bulletin the Bank of England published a graphic and explicit account of the facts of money: almost all money comes into this world ※out of thin air§, conjured into existence by the book-keeping act in which ※whenever a bank makes a loan, it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower＊s bank account, thereby creating new money§. This had for very many years been well understood by bankers, but for some reason most of them had been too shy to admit such facts outside a small circle of consenting adults.The secret of political understanding is that most accusations hide guilty secrets. In this case the money tree is by no means a fantasy: it is the very real tree of quantitative easing, a tree that has dropped billions of pounds of new money into banks and financial institutions. The resulting inflation of asset values has allowed the few to become obscenely wealthy while the Tories have increased the national debt by nearly ?800bn since 2010.Meanwhile, what needs to be done and what  says must be done, cannot be done because of ※austerity§. For now the money tree operates to Tory advantage. The question on Thursday is, who owns it and what should it properly do? , the Tories tell us, is a ※tough road§. The implication is that austerity will rebuild the economy, giving us once again the level of services that existed before. However, the first seven years of austerity have almost doubled the debt they were supposed to eradicate. So?why would anyone believe that a further eight years of the same will do any more towards that end? The real reason for austerity is an Ayn Rand-esque assault on the public sector.In an Ayn Rand society, there would be no public sector and no taxes. If you want to drive your car, you pay to use the road; if you want an education for your child, you pay for it; a public health service would be inconceivable.It works out extremely well for those who can already pay for everything they want 每 they do so while enjoying even lower taxes. For everyone else it＊s a nightmare. To see a past Ayn Rand society, look at Victorian Britain, with its extremes of wealth and poverty, and actual starvation. To see a future one, check out any of many dystopian sci-fi movies, where the rich live in fortified palaces, protected by private armies and police forces, and everyone else fights for?survival in a living hell outside.The creeping privatisation of prisons, schools, the NHS and so much more is work in progress. Austerity is about completing and normalising this and getting us used to the privation and exploitation that come with it.  In last Wednesday＊s live BBC televised debate, home secretary Amber Rudd accused Jeremy Corbyn, of relying on the ※fairytale money tree§ that would be needed to honour the spending pledges in Labour＊s election manifesto.The real elephant in the British fiscal coffers room, which the Tories strenuously refuse to see, is huge income inequality, appropriation of insane chunks of wealth by the top 1% and systematic public underinvestment due to relatively low direct income tax rates for the highest earners.Besides configuring the fiscal revenue space (together with other direct/indirect taxes, insurance contributions and government borrowing), we would like to point to another, much neglected, redistributive function that progressive income tax should serve in a rich, albeit highly polarised and divided advanced economy such as the UK.Instead on focusing on the absolute income tax contribution, in our research we have developed a novel and holistic index which tracks the ratio of the effective income tax rate per income group divided by the percentage of total personal wealth (alternatively, one may use the percentage of national income) owned by the same income group.Under this metric, we show that the bottom 99% pays in relative terms at least 10 times (1,000%) more tax than the top 1%.From the social justice perspective the ※money tree§ will blossom when the richest 1% will pay a higher and fairer income tax rate. In  (3 June) you mention Labour＊s economic reputation. It is a myth that a Conservative government is better for the economy. In the last 25 years, the only time there has been a budget surplus was under a Labour government. The recovery since the financial crash has been the slowest in 300 years. Why? Because the Conservatives imposed austerity rather than increasing productivity.Currently, the profit of large companies accrues to the shareholders 每 at the expense of investing in the company and improving productivity. Long-term gain is sacrificed for short-term profit. The chief of Unilever  (21 May) that he could easily manufacture a higher share price by cutting jobs, factories and research. ※Graveyards are full of companies that have been cutting costs＃§In Germany it has been found that including employees on the board of a company improves productivity. It is in the interest of employees for their company to succeed. But the  recently decided not to take this simple step: one example, among many, of their economic weakness.Instead of improving productivity, the government is relying on consumer debt to fuel economic growth. This is not wise or sustainable. Consumer debt in the US led to the last financial crash.Labour＊s economic policies focus on how to lessen the likelihood of consumer debt and how to support companies to improve productivity. A Labour government is essential for the economic wellbeing of the country. Philip Inman＊s article (, 1 June) rightly notes that Britain＊s credit habit is returning, despite a decrease in consumer confidence.At?National Debtline we see the human cost of this with a huge rise in contact from people who are struggling to pay their household bills, council tax, rent arrears, water and utilities. The effects of being in debt on mental and physical health have been well documented. While credit can be a valuable tool, equally we need to look again at households using credit as a way of keeping their heads above water. There are better protections, too, for people in debt that could be explored, such as enhanced rules on enforcement by bailiffs.As politicians seek the public＊s support, we urge them to be thoughtful about how the increasing gap between wages and prices affects people struggling to make ends meet, and to focus on addressing underlying causes and possible remedies. ※There isn＊t a magic money tree,§ says . That perverse branch of financial services, the tax avoidance industry, is a veritable forest of magic money trees, the rich fruit of which is harvested by those who need it least."															
"t was summertime when Katey Howell, 34, first visited Rhyl, and she was bowled over by a town where everyone ※seemed really happy§. The north  seaside resort was ※full of holidaymakers, had a beach you could walk to and a good range of shops§. In 2004, Howell moved from Manchester to be with her future husband. ※It seemed like a nice thing to do, to get away from city life and move down here.§Rhyl＊s glory days 每 when families from Merseyside and the Midlands would gather during Factory Fortnight to enjoy the beach, the funfair and fish and chips eaten al fresco 每 are long gone. Assembly member Ann Jones, who has lived in the area all her life, says the introduction of cheap flights to Spain and guarantee of a better climate started a slow decline that saw magnificent seafront Victorian B&Bs turned into flats. As chain stores such as Marks and Spencer and Topshop relocated to nearby Prestatyn, the town centre became increasingly forlorn. In 2007, the funfair closed. ※People were seeing things leaving and nothing was replacing them,§ says Howell.  and six years ago part of Rhyl was identified as the  in Wales. It was also labelled a ※§ by some.But not for much longer. Funded jointly by the Welsh government, Denbighshire county council and private investment, a programme of regeneration aims to bring jobs, businesses and tourists back to the town. As Rebecca Maxwell, the council＊s corporate director, points out, Rhyl has a lot going for it. ※The town is in a beautiful location, it has a stunning beach with the hills behind it, and it＊s just off the A55 so there＊s easy access in and out.§Work began in 2013 with the opening of a striking new pedestrian and cycle bridge, Pont y Ddraig, across the harbour. Arthur Davies, harbour master since 2014, says the bridge has drawn in walkers as well as ※groups cycling from Holyhead or the east coast or even from London§. Howell says the bridge has made a difference. ※It is beautiful 每 so peaceful. You see a lot of people down there, dog walking, jogging, cycling, whereas a few years ago you wouldn＊t have seen anyone.§Both Jones and Maxwell believe that, while the bucket-and-spade holidays of old are unlikely to return, Rhyl can become an attractive destination for short breaks. The big draw will be a  that will see the refurbishment of the Pavilion Theatre, the arrival of a Travelodge and Premier Inn and new restaurants 每 as well as a rejuvenated Sky Tower, which will illuminate the night sky. Meanwhile, the Sun Centre, a much-loved leisure pool that had fallen into disrepair, has been demolished, and will be replaced by an all-year round waterpark. It＊s a project the council hopes will pay for itself in five years.In west Rhyl, the Gerddi Heulwen housing development has a mix of social housing, shared ownership, private rental properties and what Maxwell describes as ※prestigious town houses,§ sited round a new park. A new building for Rhyl high school, completed last year, will also appeal to families, Maxwell hopes. It all sounds so promising. But a cloud hangs on the horizon: north Wales is a  of EU funding, and when support for existing projects runs out in 2020, the gap may not be filled 每 and that＊s without the concern about how losing membership of the single market will . Jones is worried: ※If we＊re not careful, that will be a downward spiral that will send us plunging out of control.§ Cuts to the welfare budget and council funding have already hit the region hard, she notes. But Maxwell hopes that Denbighshire＊s plan can turn Rhyl＊s fortunes around before then. By 2021, the town should reach a tipping point where it＊s ※much less dependent on regeneration funding and starting to look at economic development activity§. Encouragingly, Howell, who had thought about leaving, feels ※more happy about staying now than I was three or four years ago§. But, she adds cautiously: ※Check back in five years.§"

Eighteen reports later, he and his team condensed their efforts into one assessment of five tests that Brown said needed to be met before the UK could join.Sir David persuaded Tony Blair in 2003 that joining the euro would prove disastrous.Carney is expected to appreciate Sir David＊s reputation for loyalty.

"y colleague, Greg Jericho, is dead right. Bill Shorten＊s inequality pitch sure has ※§ of Australia＊s conservatives. It should. When the facts are in, and the facts are bad, they can be very frightening.The facts in this instance are twofold. First, yes, inequality in Australia is as bad as it＊s been in 75 years. The promise of Australian egalitarianism has withered under the blanket of stagnant wage growth, smothered by this government＊s unprecedented structural favouritism to the rich. When the ACTU agreed to wage restraint back in the days of the Prices and Incomes , it was in return for universal healthcare, a mass expansion of education and training, superannuation and award wages.But successive governments have hacked at Medicare, privatised training, allowed the wealthy to arbitrage superannuation and idled by as 40% of the workforce has found themselves casualised＃ all while real wages have not gone up. Instead,  has thrown not only wads of cash, but cheaper and even free labour, at the profit-making corporations who need help the least.Which brings us to the second scary fact for Turnbull and his fellows. The electorate has noticed. This may be an experience unfamiliar to the prosperous gentlemen who dominate the benches of the Coalition, but when one＊s , or one＊s penalty rates have been cut, or one＊s kid is suddenly working for $4 an hour at the local bakery, certain truths do begin to dawn. Especially when forking out to meet a growing gap between a Medicare rebate and a health bill. So obvious has economic division in this country become that when Shorten speaks about it, it＊s to a democratic majority. He＊s been leading two-party preferred , precisely because of an electoral yearning that someone acknowledge reality. It has allowed him ditch the cautious, centrist me-tooism that dulled the most interesting parts of the Labor party for over two decades.

"New research examining for the first time the potential impact of Brexit on cities and towns has found Aberdeen could be the hardest hit by higher trade costs with the , though no British city will escape its effects. by the Centre for Cities thinktank predicted that in the decade following the implementation of new trade agreements with the EU, every local authority area would be negatively affected.The impacts would be greater in the case of a ※hard§  每 where the UK would default to trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules.A ※soft§ Brexit 每 if the UK joined a free-trade area with the EU 每 would lessen its negative effects across the board, especially in London, where economic output as measured by Gross Value Added (GVA) was predicted to decline by 1.3%, compared with 2.6% under a hard Brexit.All British cities were ※set to be negatively affected§, researchers predicted, with GVA on average 1.2% lower under soft Brexit and 2.3% lower under hard Brexit than if the UK remained in the EU. (Belfast in Northern Ireland was excluded due to a lack of available data.)Aberdeen emerged as the city likely to be most affected in either scenario due to the impact of increasing costs on its oil sector, with a 3.7% forecast decrease in GVA in the case of a hard Brexit, and 2.1% in a ※soft§ scenario.Worthing, Reading, Swindon and Slough were predicted to incur a 2.8% loss in the event of hard Brexit, followed by Edinburgh (-2.7%) and London, Aldershot, Leeds and Ipswich (-2.6%).Generally, cities and towns with high levels of employment in private sector, knowledge-intensive services 每 such as Reading, London and Edinburgh, the three cities with the largest business and financial sectors 每 were likely to be most negatively affected by Britain leaving the EU. Researchers also found a correlation, albeit not a strong one, between areas that voted Remain in last year＊s referendum and those that were predicted to be most badly hit.Crawley, the town predicted to be least affected by hard Brexit with a decrease in GVA of just 1.1% (and 0.7% under soft Brexit), was an outlier in the same regard as Aberdeen due to its reliance on the air services industry.But the paper＊s co-authors, Naomi Clayton and Prof Henry G Overman, warned against placing strong weight on the estimated effects on any particular sector when their analysis was likely underestimating Brexit＊s total impact.Their model did not take into account any effects on cities＊ economies other than increasing trade costs 每 such as the impact on foreign investment and migration 每 nor how individual cities might adjust to them. At an national those additional factors took the costs of Brexit from a loss of 6.3% of national income to 9.5%.Researchers warned that Brexit＊s impacts would likely be felt differently over time, with the most-affected cities, predominantly in the South of England, also best-placed to adapt to the changes ahead due to their highly skilled workforces and relative wealth.Less affluent cities could struggle to respond to the economic shocks of Brexit, despite being less directly impacted in the short term.The difference in urban areas＊ ability to adapt could exacerbate existing inequality, researchers found, drawing parallels with the 2008 financial crisis, in which London and south-east England were hit hardest but recovered more strongly than other areas.Andrew Carter, the chief executive of Centre for Cities, said the impact of either a hard or soft Brexit would be felt very differently across the country.※Contrary to much of the received wisdom on Brexit, it is the most prosperous UK cities which will be hit hardest by the downturn ahead 每 but poorer places across the north and Midlands will find it tougher to adapt.§He called on the government to strive to minimise the effect of the coming economic shocks by securing a trade deal with the EU that came as close to maintaining Britain＊s current relationship with  as possible.※But it＊s also critical that the government uses its forthcoming industrial strategy to give cities across the country the investment, powers and responsibilities they need to make their economies as successful and competitive as possible.§"															
															
"uppose our fire department was staffed with out-of-shape incompetents who didn＊t know how to handle a firehose. That would be really bad news, but it wouldn＊t be obvious most of the time because we don＊t often see major fires. The fire department＊s inadequacy would become apparent only when a major fire hit, and we were left with a vast amount of unnecessary death and destruction. This is essentially the story of modern economics.The problem is not that modern economics lacks the tools needed to understand the economy. Just as with firefighting, the basics have been well known for a long time. The problem is with the behavior and the incentive structure of the practitioners. There is overwhelming pressure to produce work that supports the status quo (for example, redistributing to the rich), that doesn＊t question authority, and that is needlessly complex. The result is a discipline in which much of the work is of little use, except to legitimate the existing power structure. In terms of the poor quality of work, it is easy to point to the failure to recognize the size and risks posed by the housing bubble in the last decade. This failure has been unbelievably costly to the US and the rest of the world. If we compare the most recent estimates of the potential GDP of the  from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) with the projections made in 2008, before the severity of the crash was recognized, the difference is $1.8tn. This is an annual figure; it implies a loss of $18tn over the course of the decade. This amount averages out to more than $54,000 for every person in the country. Other countries have seen even larger losses.CBO is not God, so it could have been overly optimistic before the crash and is arguably too pessimistic at present. But even if we cut the number in half, we are still looking at a loss of $9tn over the course of a decade, or $27,000 per person. It is also worth noting that CBO＊s numbers are useful here not only because they are seen as authoritative, but they are in the center of the profession by design. CBO raises or lowers its numbers if they are out of line with the consensus of economic forecasters.The retrospective analyses of the overall crash have focused on the financial crisis specifically. These analyses have worked hard to convince people that seeing an impending financial crisis is an extremely difficult undertaking, but the reality is that the financial crisis was very much secondary. The overwhelming reason for the downturn and the weak recovery was the collapse of housing bubbles in the US and elsewhere that were driving growth.It was not difficult to recognize these bubbles. House prices had risen at an unprecedented pace in the years from the mid-1990s until the crash, with no remotely plausible basis in the fundamentals of the housing market. This could be seen by a variety of measures, but most obviously from the fact that rents were still following the overall rate of inflation, as they ordinarily do. The record vacancy rate 每 even before the crash 每 might also have been a red flag, especially to people who believe in supply and demand determining prices.Also, the fact that housing was driving the economy was clear from the record share of residential construction in GDP, as well as an unprecedented consumption boom driven by housing wealth. Of course these sources of demand would disappear when the bubble burst; what could anyone expect to replace six percentage points of GDP in annual demand (around $1.1tn in today＊s economy)?When I tried to raise these issues in years prior to the crash, my arguments were largely laughed off by a wide range of economists. I didn＊t have the stature, and besides, the argument was far too simple. This is not the first time that I had a problem with making arguments that were too simple.Back at the time of the debate over President George W Bush＊s social security privatization plan, I pointed out that his administration＊s assumed rates of return in the stock market were impossible given the current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios in the market and the economic growth rates assumed by the social security trustees. This was an argument based on simple algebra. wanted to make this into a Brookings paper and enlisted  in the effort. Together they produced a paper (generously leaving me as lead author) that had an intertemporal optimization model with declining labor force growth as its key feature. (You don＊t have to know what an intertemporal optimization model is; just that it added complexity.) This model had nothing to do with the underlying point (the stock market would yield the assumed returns if its price-to-earnings ratio was near its historic average of 15, rather than the P/E level near 25 that we were seeing at the time), but it was necessary to have something more complex than simple algebra to be taken seriously at Brookings.It is easy to extend the list of failings in the economics profession. It is just now becoming accepted that our pattern of trade imposes substantial costs on large segments of the working population. This didn＊t require any new or novel innovations. This is a prediction of the completely mainstream , first published three-quarters of a century ago.And why is there so little research devoted to analysis of alternatives to patent financing of prescription drug research? The markups associated with patent protection in the sector are equivalent to tariffs of many thousand percent. Every competent economist knows that a gap that large between a government-protected price and a free-market price is a recipe for massive waste and corruption. The gap between patent-protected drug prices and free-market prices is now approaching $400bn a year in the US alone (more than 2% of GDP). This doesn＊t require new economic thinking; it requires economists who know introductory economics.And how about a little accountability for economists when they mess up? There is much literature on the importance of being able to dismiss workers who do not perform their jobs well. We all know and expect that a dishwasher who keeps breaking the dishes or a custodian who can＊t clean the toilets loses his job.I have suggested that economists who prescribe policies that turn out badly, or who can＊t see multitrillion dollar housing bubbles coming whose collapse sinks the economy, ought to pay a price in terms of their careers. Invariably people think I am joking. When they realize I am serious, they think I am crazy or vindictive.Leaving aside motives, let me just speak to the economics. If we have a profession in which people are rewarded with high pay and career advancement for saying the same thing as everyone else, and never face any consequences when the accepted wisdom proves to be wrong, then we should expect to see economists like the firefighters mentioned at the beginning of this piece.

"abour＊s commitment to retaining Britain＊s  during any post-Brexit transition is a brave and welcome move. It is overwhelmingly in our national economic interest. That Jeremy Corbyn has been  for it by  每 a man who has never genuinely stood up for Britain＊s best interests 每 should be worn as a badge of pride by all in the Labour movement, and convince any waverers that we＊re on the right path.This Tory government is making a mess of the  每 and putting the future of our country at risk. A lengthy transition period is now increasingly needed and increasingly likely. Retaining Britain＊s privileged place within the single market and customs union during this transition 每 rejecting the Tory vision of a job-destroying,  每 will begin to protect our economy.But a , however long, doesn＊t end the threat posed by Brexit: it simply delays the moment when we fall out of the vital trading relationships we have built our economy around for over 40 years. That is why  is right to also hold out the possibility of Britain remaining permanently part of the single market and customs union.I have never made any secret of my belief that Britain would be better off staying in the . Equally, I don＊t believe that anyone in this country voted in the referendum to make themselves poorer. Yet there has been a consistent attempt over the last year by leading Brexiteers to pretend that the leave campaign made the economic dangers clear. It did not. Throughout the campaign they actually said Britain would be better off 每 not worse off 每 and that the warnings from the remain side were wrong. Now that the economic costs of leaving are starting to become clear, we are told that these costs are worth it, that people voted in spite of the economic hit their communities and families would face.Of course that＊s not true, which is why 每 if we are to limit the economic damage caused by Brexit 每 we need to stay permanently in the single market and the customs union. If we want to be able to fund the  Labour put to the public in 2017, we can＊t afford a multi-billion pound hit to the public finances, which would mean less money for schools and hospitals. If we want to stop a race to the bottom on workers＊ rights or consumer standards, we need to stay part of the single market. And if we want our children to have decent jobs and life-changing opportunities, we need to remain a country where businesses want to invest, not one they want to leave.These facts are not just arguments for a transition. There is no better trading relationship with the EU outside the single market now, and there will be no better economic agreement outside the EU waiting for us in five years＊ time. This is the fantasy the Tories have been pushing since the referendum 每 it will still be a fantasy after any transition.Since the referendum, the government has sought to close down any debate on what  should look like. Labour＊s position now opens the possibility of a realistic and grounded discussion on the future direction of our country. I hope now that businesses, trade unions and all campaigning groups will have the confidence to start making the case for what they know is right.As part of this debate, Labour must show bravery not just on the single market, but on freedom of movement too. False arguments that deny the huge advantages to Britain from EU migration must be defeated. By doing so,  can once again be the great anti-racism party and the party of economic competence in Britain today. Seb Dance is a Labour MEP for London"															
"With reference to your report on the official figures revealing that fewer than 5,000 students a year stay on after their visa expires (, 25 August), I have just retired after 17 years as chancellor of Leeds University and cannot credit that the government has got away with this mule-headed and mendacious policy for so long under Theresa May at the Home Office and now at 10 Downing Street.Like many others in parliament and the universities, I have consistently challenged this policy and been consistently fobbed off with arrogant or?feeble responses. I must conclude that  wants to keep referring to these 140,000-plus students as immigrants because it suits some disgraceful scaremongering tactic.Foreign students have added immeasurably to the current remarkably high status of British universities. And many of our most loyal alumni are in India and China etc, promising good future relations but not of course in the current climate. May＊s widely reported insulting slap in the face to Indian students was regarded as directly responsible for her failed trade trip to India. Not only Indian but Chinese students now feel unwelcome here. They are rejecting us in droves and now widely embraced by Australia, America and European countries. To preserve Theresa May＊s face we are told we will have to wait a year for this proven and gross error to be put right. A terrible amount of?damage has already been done.  Of all the mean-minded, incompetent policies the Home Office and Theresa May are associated with, her constant accusations against foreign students have been among the most damaging. British patriots of the old school constantly bemoan the decline of the UK＊s military power, but actually the one area where we have always ※punched above our weight§ is soft power, not hard. Many thousands of influential people across the globe, including the leaders of one in seven of the world＊s nations, have studied at British universities. We are widely seen as the mother of western liberal democracy and our mother tongue is undoubtedly among the most useful to learn for anyone who has ambitions outside their own country.If  has any clear implication it is that we will be more dependent on our soft power in the future than we are as a member in good standing of the EU. It is good news that the BBC World Service (another major institution contributing to it) seems to be expanding its coverage. But the widely understood hostility to foreigners who wish to study here, which May has helped to create, is undermining and will continue to undermine this strength. Now we know the hostility is based on a myth, will she abandon it? If not, it is even more clear that her government＊s policies are based not on evidence of the national interest but on the interests of the Tory party; and, in fact, her need to protect her own personal political position. In 1989, following a recommendation I made as a member of an industrial panel, Queen Mary University of London set up an MSc course on management of intellectual property for the university training of IP professionals. This was unique and attracted students from the UK, EU and overseas territories worldwide. Since 1990, I have successfully taught about 800 postgraduates, the vast majority of whom returned to work in their country of origin, where they occupied senior posts and are ambassadors for UK university education. While they were here, the students, many of whom were sponsored by their governments or employers, made a huge contribution to the UK economy. The only hiatus was when the government abolished the post-study work (PSW) visas, causing a drop in applicants. Those overseas students who stayed were mainly appointed to valuable positions involving liaison with their country of origin or other positions requiring their enhanced postgraduate qualification. One was even directly appointed as IP manager of the National Physical Laboratory, responsible for the inventive output of 600 of the UK＊s leading physicists. In the many years that I was a judge I spent most of my time hearing appeals against decisions made by various government departments. The most bizarrely dysfunctional of all was the Home Office. It comes as absolutely no surprise, then, that its figures in relation to student numbers have been proved to be hopelessly wrong. This begs the inevitable question of what reliance, if any, can be placed upon statistics from the Home Office.Let us not forget that its figures have been used in support of poisonous and divisive ideological arguments from the . Let us also not forget that for many years Theresa May was home secretary. If, as is manifestly the case, she could not properly run a single government department, what hope is there for her ability to run the country, never mind dealing with enormously complex Brexit issues?"															
"British tourists returning from continental holidays last week arrived at airports in various states of shock. The pound＊s slump in value against the euro reached an eight-year low during their trips and many holidaymakers bore tales of the woes they had endured at foreign cash machines.※You do become more aware of it each time you take money out,§ said Tom Wake as he and his wife Pip made their way through Stansted airport after a break in Pisa. ※The rate shifted quite a bit when we were away, so it became quite noticeable and  is there in the back of your mind. Everyone seems to be talking about it over there 每 they can＊t really understand why we＊re doing it.§The recent swing against sterling prompted predictions that Britain＊s currency may now be trending towards parity with the euro 每 although analysts later revised forecasts. Nevertheless, the euro is now worth 92p compared with 70p before last year＊s Brexit referendum.It＊s a hit that is felt keenly with every British order for beer on the Spanish costas or for croissants on the French riviera. Alan Rylett and his wife, who had travelled with a group of friends to Italy, greeted the exchange rate difference with a weary shrug of the shoulder. ※We took some money out before we went, so it wasn＊t too bad,§ he said. ※The shops were a bit more expensive. Eating out was not too bad actually, apart from the very touristy areas where you get ripped off regardless of what rate it is.§Others, including some coming back from non-eurozone countries, were less than impressed. ※It wouldn＊t stop us from travelling, but it is an annoyance,§ said Yvette Franco, who was returning from Denmark.※I remember getting something like 115 Danish krone for around ?10, which didn＊t feel great. It just makes you a little bit fed up in general with the country and the politics.§For other travellers, including those who had voted in favour of Brexit, the slide of the pound was regarded as a temporary price worth paying. They included Stewart Harris, who was travelling to Turkey and had been closely monitoring how the pound was faring against the Turkish lira. ※I felt that it was going to happen, but I＊m confident that things will even out,§ he said."															
"Ministers are preparing for crucial  talks this autumn against a backdrop of better news on jobs, inflation and the public finances as the UK economy displays signs of stability after a volatile start to the year, a Guardian analysis shows.The Guardian＊s monthly tracker of economic news shows inflation coming close to its peak and the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s. However, the ever-present threat that rocky negotiations could knock business confidence, derailing the economy, remains.The latest inflation figures confounded City economists＊ expectations for prices to resume an upward trajectory after an unexpected drop in June, while the UK also reported a surprise budget surplus in July, the first positive outturn for the nation＊s finances in that month since 2002. Meanwhile, spending on food helped to support growth in retail sales, despite a drop in spending across all other sectors, as consumers exercise more caution amid a squeeze on household budgets. But despite the positive signs for UK, defying the , clouds are gathering as ministers prepare for more talks with Brussels after a summer lull. Two senior economics commentators have warned that the long-term outlook remains bleak. , a former member of the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee, said Britain appeared to be missing out on higher levels of growth seen elsewhere in Europe. ※We would expect a recovery in the other EU economies to benefit the UK. Because of Brexit, growth in the UK and other EU economies are now moving in opposite directions,§ said Sentance, a senior economic adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers.Eurozone GDP rose by 0.6% in the three months to June, twice as fast as the UK＊s in the second quarter of 2017, underlining the currency bloc＊s recovery from the depths of the Greek debt crisis. On an annual basis, the eurozone expanded by 2.3% during the quarter, compared with 1.7% in the UK. The figures come as David Davis, the Brexit secretary, attempts to put Britain＊s future trading relationship with Brussels higher on the agenda in severance talks, while facing . The EU is demanding that the UK makes further progress in talks about citizens＊ rights, Britain＊s divorce bill and the border with Ireland before moving to discuss trade. Davis will need to show progress on these areas in talks next month, before a key meeting of the European council in October, when leaders could allow talks on trade to move forward.  could make this likelier, although the big hurdle of the financial settlement still remains.To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers ahead of their release, and in five cases the outcome beat expectations.The dashboard for July shows a further deterioration in the value of the pound amid a bleak mood over the prospects for the UK economy, against an improving picture in , pushing sterling to a more than 10-month low against the euro. While the dollar has suffered due to political turbulence in Washington, sterling is now resuming a downward slide against the greenback.Britain＊s trade position with the rest of the world worsened in June, according to the latest figures this month, adding impetus for ministers pushing the country＊s future trading relationships higher up the agenda with Brussels. The figures from the ONS suggest the sharp fall in the value of the pound has so far failed to lift sales of UK-made goods abroad.Some free market economists have argued the UK would not be faced with disaster if Theresa May fails to secure a trade deal with Europe, including , who advocate trade with the rest of the world over a ※hamstrung§ deal with Brussels.But , another former Bank of England policymaker, said such claims did not match the view of most economists, who say Britain is worse off with Brexit.※The claims by some rightwing economists that a free trade nirvana will emerge if there is a hard Brexit has been rightly met this week by incredulity by the economics profession,§ said Blanchflower, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US.There are signs that the effects of the pound＊s slump on inflation may be beginning to fade, providing some relief to households put under pressure in recent months. The consumer price index (CPI) remained static at 2.6% in July, helped by a drop in the price of petrol, which offset upward pressure from import-sensitive goods and services such as clothing, household goods and food and drink.Despite the encouraging data in the last couple of months, economists believe the drop in sterling is yet to fully wash through the economy, while the Bank of England expects CPI to reach 3% later in the year. ※Fundamentally we suspect we＊ve got further effects from the fall in sterling to come through into the high street,§ said Philip Shaw, an economist at the banking group Investec.Rail fares are set for the , after the government set prices for commuters at July＊s 3.6% increase in the retail price index, which is typically a higher measure of prices than CPI. Further price rises ahead will further harm living standards and household budgets, putting more pressure on the economy. ※The main driver behind this has been the Brexit vote which lowered the pound and increased prices,§ said Blanchflower.Although there are signs of UK pay growth, as record low levels of unemployment potentially boost workers＊ bargaining power, real wages remain negative for the third month in a row. Real pay was down 1.4% between April and June, contributing to a sharp fall in living standards.Meanwhile, unemployment could rise over the next year as the economy slows, with the potential to be further hurt by Brexit, according to Sentance.※Over the recovery following the global financial crisis, the UK has been one of the better-performing economies until now. That may now be about to change, as other EU economies gather momentum and the UK economy falters,§ he said."															
"ritish supermarkets were once an established social ecosystem: Waitrose and Marks & Spencer catered for the wealthy, Asda for the hard up, and Tesco and Sainsbury＊s for everyone in between. Then a foreign species disturbed it. In the early 1990s, German discount stores Lidl and Aldi arrived in Britain, catering mostly for those who couldn＊t afford to go anywhere else. Now they respectively , and are stuffed with middle-class shoppers, who shun Sainsbury＊s Pimm＊s for , Lidl＊s own brand version. On Tuesday  to become Britain＊s seventh largest grocer. It now has plans to open 60 new UK shops a year.The success of these budget shops can be partly explained by a decade of stagnant incomes and government austerity. The depth of the recession, and now rising food price inflation, encouraged people to hunt down the cheap deals (one survey claims Lidl beats other stores on price by some 15%). It is also down to altered social trends. When faith in the banks took a hit in 2008, loyalty to other institutions, including large superstores, did too. Shopping habits became more fragmentary: people carrying their designer handbags would also wear socks from Primark (the effect is known as ※Primarni§). If you bought your avocados in , you might also buy your milk from Morrisons or Aldi. And as more young people head online for their groceries, supermarkets are competing over a population of ageing shoppers who have the time to look around for the cheapest option.But the rise of Lidl and  reveals something more surprising about British shoppers: look beneath the surface of the triumph of the discounters and it is clear they care for value as well as price. A decade ago, when these shops were equally good value, but sold cheap food in bleak Teutonic surroundings, they did not attract many customers. Only when they made efforts to compete on quality did their current boom begin. So now they are sourcing fresh fish from Scotland; they claim to produce own-brand nappies of equal quality to more expensive brands such as Pampers. They sell a larger proportion of fresh vegetables, meat and fish than their rivals. And since the summer of 2013 their combined market share has grown nearly 80%.This bodes well for the health of the British food industry, as do some of the methods Aldi and Lidl use to save money. They have short supply chains, which means fewer opportunities for the kind of bad behaviour that led  over contaminated eggs and pork in UK supermarkets. They avoid big brands, a move that gives them a larger profit share, but which also allows smaller and local businesses a look in. They also specialise in smaller local shops, which are cheaper, rather than the kinds of out-of-town superstores that contributed to the downturn of many high streets.The older names are going to have to move fast to stay ahead. They are already struggling to deal with a threat from Amazon, which recently bought upmarket food store Whole Foods, and threatens to outpace them with innovative new delivery methods. Now they must squeeze prices too, but with large overheads it will be difficult without cutting quality. There is the irony. Just as the British customer makes the case for value, supermarkets may downgrade."															
"Theresa May has been accused of insulting teachers by offering them a 1% pay rise after she refused to bow to pressure from some Tory MPs, Labour and trade unions to begin easing the public sector wage cap.The Department for Education said it would accept the recommendation of a 1% pay rise made by the independent pay review body, days after an open revolt by some senior cabinet ministers who said the seven-year cap should be lifted. Labour said the government was causing a recruitment crisis in schools by holding down pay, while the award was described as ※an insult§ by the Liberal Democrats.  behind inflation since 2010.The pay deal for more than 500,000 teachers was the first to be announced since Tory MPs raised concerns over public sector pay earlier this month following the , which saw it lose its overall majority, with public sector workers turning to Labour.Some of May＊s own senior team, including Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt, had indicated they thought it was time to . But the prime minister appears to have kept a temporary lid on the cabinet rebellion for now, after her chancellor, Philip Hammond, challenged his colleagues to hold their nerve on austerity until they have found a way to pay for any wage increases.Pressure is now building on May and Hammond to announce a review of public sector pay in the autumn budget. Some Tory MPs had been concerned it would look unfair to  in the spring, if the government had been more generous to teachers, police and prison officers only after suffering a poor election result.But some are making the case for Hammond to announce a change in the 1% pay policy 每 set out in a remit letter to pay review bodies 每 in the autumn, boosting the wages of public sector workers halfway through the year. Pressure is compounded by the recent  in the 12 months to July, adding to the impact in real terms.Former Conservative minister Dan Poulter told the Guardian there was a ※strongly moral and financial case§ for this 1% deal for teachers to be revisited at the autumn budget to give teachers a pay rise at least in line with inflation. The MP, who is running for chair of the Commons education committee, also said he was ※concerned that the true independence of the pay review body processis being compromised when there is a clear instruction and expectation from the government for the pay review bodies to ensure that increases in teaching pay are capped at 1%§.The pay deal drew widespread condemnation from opposition parties. Angela Rayner, Labour＊s shadow education secretary, said: ※While the education secretary [Justine Greening] says she has accepted the recommendations of the pay review body, they were forced to accept the arbitrary 1% pay cap. The simple fact is that teachers are still facing a real terms pay cut.§Layla Moran MP, Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: ※Giving teachers another below-inflation pay rise is frankly an insult to these incredibly hard-working and dedicated professionals.§Over the weekend, it emerged that around a quarter of the teachers who have qualified since 2011 . Analysis of official figures shows that more than 27,500 teachers who trained between 2011 and 2015 had already left the job by last year. It means that just over 23% of about 117,000 teachers who qualified over the period have left.Kevin Courtney, the NUT general secretary, warned Theresa May: ※This is a missed opportunity which the government will come to regret as the teacher recruitment and retention crisis gets worse.§The government made its announcement following a recommendation from the School Teachers＊ Review Body (STRB), the independent body that advises the government on teachers＊ salaries.In reality, the STRB had little choice but to maintain the 1% cap in line with the government＊s public sector pay awards, but it also reiterated previous warnings that teachers continue to be paid less than other graduate professions, making it difficult to recruit and retain high-quality graduates as teachers.Announcing the award, a Department for Education spokesperson said: ※We recognise and value the hard work of teachers, which is why we have accepted the pay deal proposed by the independent School Teachers＊ Review Body, in line with the 1% public sector pay policy. This will ensure we continue to strike the balance between being fair to public sector workers and fair to taxpayers.§A small proportion of teachers at the bottom of the main pay scale will receive a 2% increase, but all increases will have to be funded within existing school budgets, which are known to be under increasing pressure as school employer costs rise.A written ministerial statement by Greening, the education secretary, who was reported to have been sympathetic to both relaxing the pay cap and increasing public spending on schools, said: ※The report contains recommendations on the pay award for teachers that is due to be implemented from September 2017, which are consistent with the government＊s 1% public sector pay policy.※I am grateful to the STRB for these recommendations and, subject to the views of consultees, I intend to accept all the key recommendations.§Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the move was deeply disappointing given the challenges schools face in recruitment and retention of teachers. ※The STRB has had its hands tied. It is now crystal clear that the review body was not able to recommend a pay award based on the evidence. It is straight-jacketed by an overall 1% pay cap, and could not reflect the needs of schools to offer fair pay to their employees.It was reported on Monday night that ministers are considering cutting back plans to build hundreds of new free schools in an attempt to plug a gap in the education budget. The government is struggling to meet a Tory manifesto pledge to increase education budgets by ?4bn after being forced to abandon plans to scrap free lunches for infants, the Times said.One option reportedly under consideration is scaling back or dropping altogether plans for more free schools. An education department spokesman told the Guardian: ※The free schools programme is a key component of the government＊s work to raise standards, increase parental choice, and provide the new school places we know we will need in the years ahead.§Greening has been arguing for more money for the national funding formula, which will reallocate money between schools, to make sure there are no cash losers. However, ensuring that money is provided to shore up budgets could make it difficult to fulfill other promises, including the election pledge to further expand the free schools programme.The Conservative general election manifesto promised to build ※at least a hundred§ new free schools every year.

"inancial markets are starting to get rattled by the winding-down of  in many advanced economies. Soon enough, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) will be the only central banks still maintaining unconventional monetary policies for the long term.The US  started phasing out its asset-purchase programme (quantitative easing, or QE) in 2014, and began normalising interest rates in late 2015. The European Central Bank is now pondering just how fast to taper its own QE policy in 2018, and when to start phasing out negative interest rates.Similarly, the  (BoE) has finished its latest round of QE 每 which it launched after the Brexit referendum last June 每 and is considering hiking interest rates. And the Bank of Canada (BOC) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have both signalled that interest-rate hikes will be forthcoming.Still, all of these central banks will have to reintroduce unconventional monetary policies if another recession or financial crisis occurs. Consider the Fed, which is in a stronger position than any other central bank to depart from unconventional monetary policies. Even if its normalisation policy is successful in bringing interest rates back to an equilibrium level, that level will be no higher than 3%.It is worth remembering that in the Fed＊s previous two tightening cycles, the equilibrium rate was 6.5% and 5.25%, respectively. When the global financial crisis and ensuing recession hit in 2007-09, the Fed cut its policy rate from 5.25% to 0%. When that still did not boost the economy, the Fed began to pursue unconventional monetary policies, by launching QE for the first time.As the last few monetary-policy cycles have shown, even if the Fed can get the equilibrium rate back to 3% before the next recession hits, it still will not have enough room to manoeuvre effectively. Interest-rate cuts will run into the zero lower bound before they can have a meaningful impact on the economy. And when that happens, the Fed and other major central banks will be left with just four options, each with its own costs and benefits.First, central banks could restore quantitative- or credit-easing policies, by purchasing long-term government bonds or private assets to increase liquidity and encourage lending. But by vastly expanding central banks＊ balance sheets, QE is hardly costless or risk-free.Second, central banks could return to negative policy rates, as the ECB, BOJ, SNB, and some other central banks have done, in addition to quantitative and credit easing, in recent years. But negative interest rates impose costs on savers and banks, which are then passed on to customers.Third, central banks could change their target rate of inflation from 2% to, say, 4%. The Fed and other central banks are informally exploring this option now, because it could increase the equilibrium interest rate to 5% to 6%, and reduce the risk of hitting the zero lower bound in another recession.Yet this option is controversial for a few reasons. Central banks are already struggling to achieve a 2% inflation rate. To reach a target of 4% inflation, they might have to implement even more unconventional monetary policies over an even longer period of time. Moreover, central banks should not assume that revising inflation expectations from 2% to 4% would go smoothly. When inflation was allowed to drift from 2% to 4% in the 1970s, inflation expectations became unanchored altogether, and price growth far exceeded 4%.The last option for central banks is to  the inflation target from 2% to, say, 0%, as the Bank for International Settlements has advised. A lower inflation target would alleviate the need for unconventional policies when rates are close to 0% and inflation is still below 2%.But most central banks have their reasons for not pursuing such a strategy. For starters, zero inflation and persistent periods of deflation 每 when the target is 0% and inflation is below target 每 may lead to debt deflation. If the real (inflation-adjusted) value of nominal debts increases, more debtors could fall into bankruptcy. Moreover, in small, open economies, a 0% target could strengthen the currency, and raise production and wage costs for domestic exporters and import-competing sectors.Ultimately, when the next recession strikes, central banks in advanced economies will have no choice but to plumb the zero lower bound once again while they choose among four unappealing options. The choices they make will depend on how they weigh the risks of bloating their balance sheets, imposing costs on banks and consumers, pursuing possibly unattainable inflation targets, and hurting debtors and producers at home.In other words, central banks will have to confront the same policy dilemmas that attended the global financial crisis, including the ※choice§ of whether to pursue unconventional monetary policies. Given that financial push is bound to come to economic shove once again, unconventional monetary policies, it would seem, are here to stay."															
"n recent weeks, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have affirmed that the financial system is sound and stable. The  in June that all US banks passed its latest annual stress test. And the Fed chair,, has now  we might not experience another financial crisis ※in our lifetimes§.At the same time, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) 每 which monitors regulatory practices around the world to ensure that they meet globally agreed standards 每 has declared, in a  to G20 leaders, that ※toxic forms of shadow banking§ are being eliminated.In short, ongoing measures to buttress the global financial system have undoubtedly paid off, especially when it comes to strengthening capital cushions and cleaning up balance sheets in important parts of the banking system. The latest assurances from policymakers are comforting to those of us who worry that not enough has been done to reduce systemic financial risk and to ensure that banks serve the real economy, rather than threaten its wellbeing.Yet it is too soon to give the financial system as a whole a clean bill of health. Efforts to shore up the banking sector in some parts of Europe are still lagging far behind. And, more importantly, financial risks have continued to migrate to non-bank activities.After irresponsible risk-taking almost tipped the global economy into a multi-year depression in 2007-2008, regulators and central banks in advanced economies launched a major effort to strengthen their financial systems. To that end, they focused initially on banks, which have since bolstered their risk-absorbing capital cushions, cleansed murky balance sheets, increased liquidity, enhanced transparency, narrowed the scope of high-risk activities, and partly realigned internal incentives to discourage reckless behaviour. Moreover, the process for resolving failing 每 and failed 每 banks has been improved.In addition to strengthening the banking sector, policymakers have also made progress toward standardising derivative markets and making them more robust and transparent, which also reduces the risk of future taxpayer bailouts for irresponsible institutions. Moreover, the system for payments and settlement has been made safer, thereby lowering the threat of a ※sudden stop§ in economic activity, like the one that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008.It has been encouraging to watch national authorities coordinate their efforts under the auspices of the FSB. Better coordination has reduced the risk of regulatory arbitrage, and address the threat that banks will be, as the former Bank of England governor Mervyn King memorably , ※international in life but national in death.§The US and the UK took the lead on reform, and Europe has been catching up. Assuming that it does, as policymakers there intend, Yellen＊s assurance of a ※much stronger§ banking system in the US will apply to all of the other systemically important banking jurisdictions in the developed world, too. And the FSB＊s confident assertion that ※reforms have addressed the fault lines that caused the global financial crisis§ will receive more support.Still, it is too early to declare victory. Although the FSB describes the financial system as ※safer, simpler and fairer,§ it also acknowledges ※nascent risks that, if left unchecked, could undermine the G20＊s objective for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.§As an observer and participant in global capital markets, three of these risks stand out to me.First, as more carefully regulated banks have ceased certain activities, voluntarily or otherwise, they have been replaced by non-banks that are not subject to the same supervisory and regulatory standards.Second, certain segments of the non-bank system are now in the grips of a ※liquidity delusion,§ in which some products risk over-promising the liquidity they can provide for clients transacting in some areas 每 such as high-yield and emerging-market corporate bonds 每 that are particularly vulnerable to market volatility. And at the same time, exchange-traded funds have proliferated, while financial intermediaries have shrunk relative to bigger and more complex end users.Third, the financial system has yet to feel the full impact of technological disruptions fueled by advances in big data, artificial intelligence, and mobility, which already are in the process of upending a growing number of other established sectors. And the financial-technology (fintech) activities that have expanded are inadequately regulated, and have yet to be tested by a full market cycle.To be sure, another systemic financial crisis that threatens growth and economic prosperity worldwide likely won＊t originate in the banking system. But it would be premature to assert that we have put all the risks confronting the financial system behind us.Because risks have morphed 每 and migrated out of the banking system 每 regulators and supervisors will have to step up their efforts and widen their focus to see beyond the banks. After all, as Greg Ip of the  in 2015: ※Squeezing risk out of the economy can be like pressing on a water bed:每 the risk often re-emerges elsewhere. So it goes with efforts to make the financial system safer since the financial crisis.§"															
															
"When Theresa May took the stage at the Conservative party conference last autumn she reprised her pledge for a fairer economy. Specifically, she homed in on pay growth, or the lack of it. ※Our economy should work for everyone, but if your pay has stagnated for several years in a row and fixed items of spending keep going up, it doesn＊t feel like it＊s working for you,§ the prime minister declared.Fast-forward to this summer and the one in six workers who ply their trade in the public sector will know exactly what she is talking about. Living costs are rising at an increasingly rapid pace and, thanks to a cap imposed by May＊s government, public sector pay is falling behind.Under the Conservatives＊ austerity drive, a large part of the pain has been borne by public sector workers 每 a broad cohort ranging from low-paid NHS workers to high-paid civil servants. Their pay was frozen in the financial years 2011-12 and 2012-13 每 except for the lowest earners. Rises were then limited to an average of 1% from 2013-14 to 2015-16, and then capped at 1% again for the next four years. It remains to be seen if May and her cabinet colleagues, weakened by last month＊s election shock, will soften that stance.The current squeeze on public sector workers is in stark contrast to the years of the global financial crisis. Their pay was relatively protected after the crash while earnings in the private sector fell. Average weekly earnings for the public sector were ?479 in 2011, up 9% from ?439 in 2008. In the private sector, average weekly earnings were up just 3% over the same period to ?448 in 2011, and that was before taking into account inflation. But thanks to government-set pay restraint, public sector workers have missed out on the recovery in wage growth in recent years.Now that the pound＊s sharp drop since the Brexit vote is pushing up import costs and stoking inflation, that pay restraint is being felt even more acutely. Wages are falling in real terms for many public sector workers or, in other words, the cost of many goods and services is rising faster than their pay packets. That is , but their real wages are falling at a slower pace.As the Resolution Foundation thinktank : ※The scale of the current public sector pay squeeze is much tighter than in the private sector, and will continue for some time too.※While real growth up to the end of 2016 was 1.6% for the private sector, it had fallen to 0.3% for the public sector.§, when , showed that average weekly earnings were rising 1.2% on a year ago in the private sector and just 0.8% in the public sector.For public sector employers that squeeze is causing serious problems when it comes to recruiting and retaining workers, as shown by the news that . That has knock-on costs for the public sector when hospitals and other places of work are forced to rely on agency staff to fill the gaps.Looking into what is pushing people to leave the public sector, the TUC says many workers cannot make ends meet any more. It points to , which found that one in 10 had pawned possessions to ease their cashflow problems, and a similar proportion had used payday loans.The TUC＊s own analysis suggests there is worse to come. It calculated that nurses, firefighters and border guards will all see their real pay  if the government sticks to its 1% cap.It is worth noting that going by simple sector-wide averages, those employed by the state are still earning more than those in the private sector. Public sector workers earn about ?25,000 a year on average and for the private sector it is ?22,500, says Jonathan Cribb at the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank.※But once you control for education, age, where people live and their experience, the difference is quite small,§ he adds. Furthermore, the gap is narrowing.Based on current plans and on forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government＊s independent economic forecaster, the IFS says private sector pay will rise six percentage points faster than public sector pay between 2016-17 and 2020-21. That would reduce the average difference between public and private sector pay to a level not seen in at least the last 20 years and to one that is ※well below the level seen in the early 2000s when there were shortages of nurses,§ notes Cribb.But the government will be wary of rushing into any big policy changes to fix its recruitment troubles. John Hawksworth, the chief economist of accountancy group PwC, says the public sector pay bill was about ?180bn last year. ※So if you were to raise the public sector pay rise to 3% for the next three years it would cost you an extra ?10bn by 2020 compared with current plans,§ he adds.※So I guess there＊s a clear case for doing it in terms of recruitment and retention and fairness ＃ but on the other hand it is a significant amount and has to be weighed in the overall fiscal balance against other priorities.§"															
"lthough it seems longer, it was just three weeks ago that Conservative MPs returned from the election with tales of lost votes from nurses and teachers 每 and the unfairness of artificial public sector pay caps . Today there is yet further evidence that solving the public sector staffing crisis is urgent: for every five new nurses and midwives joining the NHS, .It should have been no surprise that the government artificially holding down pay for 5.5 million workers was an election issue. Not when midwives are down over ?3,000 a year in real terms, and nurses, teachers and firefighters are all down over ?2,000.TUC polling in the days after the election showed that more than  wanted to end artificial public sector pay restrictions 每 even if meant paying more in tax.Public sector pay is now a touchstone for whether this humbled government is listening to the lessons of the election. Last week No 10 briefed that the pay restrictions were for the chop, before being forced into an . And over the weekend, Conservative MPs and ministers, including  每 who famously  每 came out calling for the pay cap to be lifted.It＊s time for the government to admit that it got it wrong 每 and public sector workers should be allowed to earn a modest pay rise.Critically, any pay rise must not come from already stretched public sector budgets. The majority of  trusts finished the last year in the red, and schools in England and Wales have already lost nearly ?3bn since 2015.Instead, the government should review its plans 每 and find new money for decent public services and the workers who run them. The  a modest pay increase would account for less than 2% of today＊s departmental spending.Our post-election poll  increased taxes to support a pay rise. But let me be clear: don＊t take it from our overseas aid budget. That＊s just playing shabby politics 每 and breaking the UK＊s promises to the developing world.Nor should the government cherry-pick a group of workers for a pay rise. All of our dedicated public servants need that cost-of-living bump 每 and have earned it.Like all modern workplaces, the public sector is a team. As firefighters, police and paramedics rush to an emergency, it＊s despatchers and control staff guiding them and answering the emergency calls. When police officers crack a case, it＊s forensic staff who provided the evidence to get them there. And when nurses save lives in A&E, it＊s their non-medical colleagues who made sure that the A&E is clean, hygienic and stocked with the equipment and medicine they need.No public sector worker is an island 每 they work together, support each other, and should all get the pay rise they＊ve earned.Everyone in the public sector has seen their real pay fall year on year since 2010. They have earned a real pay rise, no matter how advanced they are in their career. Limiting pay rises to those on below-average wages would leave out many nurses, midwives, social workers and police constables. And it would exclude many of our brave firefighters too. That＊s hardly the way to show that the prime minister has listened and learned from the lessons of the election.The sensible approach is to allow different parts of the public sector to negotiate the right wages for that sector 每 not a top-down directive from Westminster. That has to include genuinely independent pay review bodies, empowered by the government to raise pay.It is inconceivable that this discredited over-centralised artificial pay policy can continue. It＊s time to give all of our hardworking public servants the pay rise they＊ve earned.If we are to halt another living standards crisis, we need a new deal for workers across the whole economy 每 both public and private."															
															
"London is facing renewed pressure over its dominance of the 1tn (?880bn)-a-day euro clearing market after the  set out proposals aimed at giving it more oversight of the lucrative business.The move by the Frankfurt-based ECB 每 the central bank for the 19 countries using the euro 每 follows that called for the EU to have more powers over clearing of financial products denominated in euros after Brexit.The City dominates the market in clearing, a process which is supposed to reduce the risks in complex financial transactions by matching buyers and sellers as well as reducing the cost of trading, through the use of clearing houses.The business has been hotly contested since the EU referendum a year ago, when Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, warned  if the City lost the ability to process euro-denominated transactions.In , the ECB said its governing council was setting out a recommendation to have more oversight of the business.Using the technical term for clearing houses 每 central counterparties 每 the ECB made clear that London was in its regulatory sights, as it demanded ※clear legal competence in the area of central clearing§. The bank said: ※These powers include a significantly enhanced role for central banks of issue in the supervisory system of central counterparties, in particular with regard to the recognition and supervision of systemically important third-country CCPs clearing significant amounts of euro-denominated transactions.§It builds upon the report from the European commission earlier this month which fell short of forcing the relocation of euro clearing after  but would allow tougher regulation of ※systemically§ important amounts of trade being conducted by clearing houses outside the remaining 27 members of the EU.In a , Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, outlined the scale of the clearing market. He said the London Clearing House (LCH) clears swaps 每 a form of financial instrument 每 in 18 currencies for companies in 55 jurisdictions, handling more than 90% of cleared interest rate swaps globally and 98% of all cleared swaps in euros. He argued that pushing business through clearing houses reduced the risks in the markets. ※Prior to the crisis, derivative transactions created a complex, opaque 每 and dangerous 每 web of exposures that helped turn a shock into a panic,§ Carney said the speech to an audience at the Mansion House.He said clearing houses also reduced the cost of business. ※Any development which prevented EU27 firms from continuing to clear trades in the UK would split liquidity between a less liquid onshore market for EU firms and a more liquid offshore market for everyone else,§ he added, warning that the costs would be passed on to households and businesses.The argument about where euro clearing should take place raged even before the referendum. George Osborne, when he was chancellor, had taken the matter to the court to fight an attempt by the ECB to argue that clearing houses 每 such as the LCH 每 should be based in the eurozone when they handle trades in euros. In 2015, the general court of t. The euro clearing issue is one of many competitive threats to the City in the wake of the Brexit vote.

"or some time now, the radical left has been dipping its toes in the waters of  (or unconditional basic income, depending on who you talk to). The idea is exactly as it sounds: the government would give every citizen 每 working or not 每 a fixed sum of money every week or month, with no strings attached. As time goes on, universal basic income (UBI) has gradually been transitioning from the radical left into the mainstream: it＊s , is picking up steam among SNP and Labour MPs and has been advocated by commentators including .Supporters of the idea got a boost this week with the news that the Finnish government has piloted the idea with 2,000 of its citizens with very positive results. Under the scheme, the first of its kind in Europe, participants receive 560 (?473) every month for two years without any requirements to fill in forms or actively seek work. If anyone who receives the payment finds work, their UBI continues. Many participants have reported ※§ In March,  a similar scheme.Given that UBI necessarily promotes universalism and is being pursued by liberal governments rather than overtly rightwing ones, it＊s tempting to view it as an inherently leftwing conceit. In January,  as a solution to the mass unemployment that might result from robots taking over manual jobs.But UBI also has some unlikely supporters, most prominent among them the neoliberal Adam Smith Institute 每 Sam Bowman, the thinktank＊s executive director, : ※The ideal welfare system is a basic income, replacing the existing anti-poverty programmes the government carries out.§ He added that UBI would result in a less ※paternalistic§ government.From this perspective, UBI could be rolled out as a distinctly rightwing initiative. In fact it does bear some similarity to the government＊s , which replaces a number of benefits with a one-off, lower, monthly payment (though it goes only to people already on certain benefits, of course). In the hands of the right, UBI could easily be seen as a kind of universal credit for all, undermining the entire benefits system and providing justification for paying the poorest a poverty income.In fact, can you imagine what UBI would be like if it were rolled out by this government, which only yesterday promised to fight a ruling describing the benefits cap as inflicting Despite the fact that the families who brought a case against the government had children too young to qualify for free childcare, the Department for Work and Pensions still perversely insisted that ※the benefit cap incentivises work§. It＊s not hard to imagine UBI being administered by the likes of  (), which carried out back-to-work training for the government, and saw  for defrauding the government of ?300,000. UBI cannot be a progressive initiative as long as the people with the power to implement it are hostile to the welfare state as a whole.In their incendiary book  argue for UBI but link it to three other demands: collectively controlled automation, a reduction in the working week, and a diminution of the work ethic. Williams and Srnicek believe that without these other provisions, UBI could essentially act as an excuse to get rid of the welfare state.What＊s needed is not the arbitrary adoption of UBI, but an entirely different conversation about what a welfare state is for. As David Lammy MP : ※This is about whether the welfare state is just about schools and hospitals or whether it is about a safety net.§ The conversation, in light of UBI, could go even further: it＊s possible for the welfare state not just to act as a safety net, but as a tool for all of us to do less work and spend more time with our loved ones, pursuing personal interests or engaging in our communities.UBI has this revolutionary potential 每 but not if it is simply parachuted into a political economy that has been pursuing punitive welfare policies for the last 30 years.On everything from climate change and overpopulation to yawning inequality and mass automation, modern western economies face unprecedented challenges. These conditions are frightening but they also open up the possibility of the kind of radical policies we haven＊t seen since the postwar period. UBI could be the start of this debate, but it must not be the end."

This goes far beyond the precise shockers 每 the; the cuts to funding to councils responsible for retro-fitting fire suppressants; ; and even . Conservative Kensington and Chelsea council allegedly blocking its ears to  is just the immediate scandal.

The Cameron, Osborne, Gove Notting Hill set live just up the road.From the 40% cuts to local councils, to the  and the housing benefit cap banishing people hundreds of miles from family and schools, the people spilling out on to the street, sheltered by , are the unwilling emblems of deliberate Conservative attacks.

What of rehousing all the other tower block residents now horrified to find their homes too are potential fire-traps?The danger is that once this drama is over and news moves on, people get forgotten. Not this time. What a contrast was Jeremy Corbyn＊s visit, hugging and embracing victims, promising to guarantee that never happens.

"hich matters more: actual levels of inequality, or the levels that people  to exist? There is now clear evidence that perceptions of inequality have a profound impact on societies all over the world 每 and that people aren＊t very good at judging the reality for themselves.The trouble is, almost all research on inequality focuses on actual levels, which means our understanding of how people respond to inequality has been based on the assumption that people＊s perceptions align with reality. And this, according to a unique survey of Indonesian people by the , is just not true.The lack of credibility of this assumption suggests a range of research on inequality needs to be revisited, including  that the actual level of social mobility in a country is related to people＊s support for redistribution; the Indonesia results imply it should in fact be the  level of social mobility. The World Bank＊s nationally representative came about in 2014 because a range of stakeholders wanted to understand how Indonesians perceived their country＊s deepening levels of inequality. There is literately no other survey like it for any country in the world, as it captures both people＊s perceptions of inequality, and their levels of support for redistribution to make Indonesia a more equal society.As such, it provides the best insight currently available as to whether misperceptions of inequality reduce a society＊s support for redistribution. And this is significant for people wherever they live, in this ※post-truth§ era of Trump, Brexit and fake news, where misperceptions are seen to play a strong role in the way people vote.The reality of inequality in Indonesia is eye-watering: according to Oxfam＊s latest report,  as the poorest 100 million people, and the richest 1% now owns . Yet the World Bank survey reveals that Indonesians dramatically underestimate the extent of inequality in their country. Nine in every 10 adults there believe they are located around the middle of the country＊s income distribution 每 which means rich and poor alike tend to think they experience the ※average§ standard of living. They also typically believe people can do more to improve their standard of living than is actually the case; that is, they overestimate the level of social mobility in Indonesian society.Politically, these three widespread misperceptions about Indonesian inequality are significant. Collectively, they appear to be limiting public support for redistribution through policies such as increasing social protection. Now let＊s look at their likely individual impacts on society there 每 and, indeed, everywhere.People＊s estimates of the overall distribution of income in Indonesia were elicited using a state-of-the-art approach developed by Harvard professor Michael Norton and co-authors in their . On average, Indonesians believed the country＊s  to be around 0.3, which is more equal than most countries in the world. In reality, Indonesia is about as unequal as the United States, with a Gini coefficient of around 0.4 每 higher than most countries.Furthermore, when asked what they would prefer inequality to be, respondents＊ answers implied an average ※ideal Gini coefficient§ of 0.15 每 lower than any country has ever achieved. (Currently, , closely followed by Slovenia and Norway.)Not surprisingly, the Indonesian survey found that people＊s ※inequality preferences§ were closely linked to the policy priorities they wanted the country＊s president to focus on. A preference for lower levels of inequality was associated with support for increasing social protection, while a preference for higher levels of inequality was related to supporting job creation as the number one policy priority.Thus policymakers 每not just in  每 who are trying to address inequality should be aware that people may be less supportive of redistributive policies because they are unaware of just how unequal their society is.The first step in trying to reduce inequality would appear to be communicating to the public just how unequal their society is and then what can be done to address it. Otherwise policymakers risk having limited public support for redistributive policies as people may believe they are trying to fix a smaller problem than actually exists.Respondents to the Indonesian survey were roughly equally spread across the distribution 每 but they often did not perceive this to be the case. Indeed, almost 90% of respondents perceived they were located in the middle 60% of the income distribution 每 between the 20th and 80th percentile.Remarkably, there was only a weak correlation between people＊s actual place in the income distribution, and where they perceived themselves to be. In other words, on average, poor people overestimated and rich people underestimated their place in the distribution. In fact, only one respondent out of 3,000 households thought they were located within the richest 20% of the distribution, even though around 600 respondents actually were.Again, levels of support for different policies to address inequality varied significantly, depending on where people perceived themselves to be in the distribution. However, levels of support for the most popular policy priorities 每 social protection and job creation 每 did not differ much across the actual distribution. It＊s only people＊s perceptions of where they stand relative to others in society that really affect their support for different policies.A further conclusion is that people＊s own belief about whether they would benefit from a policy appears to be more important than ideology. This would imply that public support is likely to be higher for programmes which benefit everyone, such as , compared to those that target beneficiaries, such as tax credits for a select group.Also, poorer people who overestimate their place in the distribution are likely to be missing out on social protection programs where people need to self-identify as poor to benefit. This appears to be an issue in the United States as well as Indonesia,  and sign up to receive food stamps.The survey captures two main aspects of how people see social mobility: perception of their own experience and beliefs about whether people are rich or poor due to factors within their control.Around two thirds of the people surveyed thought they would move up the income distribution from their current place by at least 20 percentage points within five years. So while people tend to perceive they are around the middle of the income distribution today, most people believe they will be well above average in the future.Perceiving that one has experienced upward mobility in the past is associated with lower support for redistribution. In other words, it appears many people who believe they have moved up the distribution think that others can do the same 每 and are therefore less inclined to believe government intervention is required.This finding is almost identical to  famous theoretical economic model published in 1995 每 the key difference being that Piketty＊s model was based upon how actual mobility, not perceived mobility, affects support for redistribution. The results of this survey would suggest his theory should be modified to capture perceptions of mobility, instead of what is actually the case. almost half of respondents thought people were poor due to ※internal§ reasons such as being lazy, and believed that rich people gained their wealth through hard work. Perceiving that effort is the key determinant of a person＊s standard of living was related to support for job creation as the best policy to reduce inequality. This overly optimistic belief in the causal link between effort and standard of living erodes support for redistribution. Analysis of one of the largest panel datasets in a developing country, the  每 an ongoing longitudinal survey conducted by Rand Corporation, a well-respected research institution based in California 每 suggests upward mobility is much less common than the respondents in the 2014 survey believe.In fact, it is likely that the most important drivers of one＊s living standard are determined at birth. This is the case globally, where around 80% of an individual＊s income level is .The findings of the World Bank＊s pioneering survey of Indonesian (mis)perceptions of inequality provide a first step in better understanding how support for wealth and income redistribution in a society is likely to be subdued by misperceptions of inequality.Above all, it suggests we should not blithely assume that monitoring changes in the actual levels of inequality is enough. A key takeaway from this survey is that perceptions of inequality deserve greater attention, as they appear to underpin people＊s political preferences.However, this survey is also only a first step in developing our understanding of inequality in societies. We cannot be certain whether these findings hold across all countries, or even in Indonesia over time. An important next step must be to look for opportunities to conduct similar surveys in other countries. The few studies that have been done that try to correct people＊s misperceptions of inequality have shown this leads to , and  in society. In this era of rising conservatism (often based upon misinformation), developing a greater understanding of the nature of people＊s misperceptions about inequality, and what leads them to change their minds, could have a significant impact on politics around the world. It is a logical next step for those concerned about the decline of evidence-based policy decisions."															
															
"Employers in the UK are struggling to fill vacancies after the sharpest drop for more than a year in the number of available candidates, according to a report that points to more recruitment difficulties ahead once  bites.Even before the potential restrictions on immigrants once the UK leaves the EU, firms are reporting skills shortages across a range of more than 60 roles, including engineers, IT specialists, care workers and accountants. The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said its latest monthly snapshot of the jobs market found vacancies continued to rise in April for permanent and temporary staff, albeit at a , reaching their weakest levels for 16 months. The REC chief executive, Kevin Green, said the continued evidence of skills shortages put the onus on the government formed after  to invest in training and career advice and to ensure employers would still be able to access workers from abroad once the UK left the EU.※Demand for staff is growing within all sectors and all regions of the UK, but there are fewer and fewer people available to fill the vacancies,§ Green said.※We have the  and people already in work are becoming more hesitant about moving jobs amid Brexit uncertainty.

"China＊s economy has shown more signs of cooling with key barometers from its manufacturing and services sectors dipping in April. The latest data comes as.Two surveys on Sunday suggested activity in the world＊s second largest economy eased back in April. Manufacturing slowed more than expected as demand was hit by government moves to curb risks associated with a run of high borrowing in .The National Bureau of Statistics＊ official purchasing managers＊ index (PMI) of factory activity fell to a six-month low of 51.2 in April from a multi-year high of 51.8 in March.

That index slipped to 54.0 from 55.1 in March, showing the sector was still expanding at a solid pace as rising living standards continue to buoy consumer spending.The  has defied expectations over the first three months of 2017, with GDP growing 6.9%, but economists expect the pace of expansion to ease during the rest of the year as the government continues its efforts to shift from an economic model based on debt-fuelled investment and exports towards a consumer-driven one.Economists are hopeful that the news on growth will remain positive enough so that Chinese authorities are not tempted to ease back on the pace of reform or reach for once-favoured ways of propping up the economy, such as spending on big infrastructure projects and relying on the booming property market.※A steady flow of solid economic data will only reinforce expectations the Chinese authorities can afford to focus their efforts on reducing financial imbalances in the economy rather than supporting the growth rate of the economy itself,§ Victoria Clarke, an economist at the bank Investec, said in a research note ahead of the PMI reports.

"here is a familiar rhythm to French politics. President gets elected amid a wave of optimism. President says root and branch reform of the economy will lead to stronger growth and falling unemployment. President fails to deliver the promised transformation. Economy continues to struggle. President gets booted out of office.In the past 30 years, Fran?ois Mitterand, Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran?ois Hollande have won elections for the mainstream parties of the centre left and centre right but France＊s economic problems have not been resolved. It says something about how poor performance has been under Hollande that growth of barely more than 1% in 2016 was good by recent standards. The upshot is that France has lost faith in the old established parties and is increasingly willing to give something new a try. More than 60% of those who voted in the first round of the voted for self-styled radical outsiders: Marine Le Pen of the radical right; Jean-Luc M谷lenchon of the radical left; and Emmanuel Macron of the radical centre.Assuming the polls are right, Macron will be president in a week＊s time. If he loses to Le Pen on 7 May, it will be a bigger surprise than or ＊s victory in the US presidential election. Macron will then have to deliver on his promises. France＊s economic performance in recent years has been underwhelming, especially when compared to that of Germany. Fifteen years ago, the eurozone＊s two biggest countries enjoyed comparable living standards. Today, Germany＊s are almost a fifth higher than those in . Likewise, at the time when euro notes and coins were introduced in 2002, French and German unemployment rates were both around 8%. Today, Germany＊s unemployment rate has dropped below 4% while French unemployment is close to 10%.Youth unemployment is a particular problem. Almost one in four of those aged under 25 are out of work, a much higher rate than in Germany. Hollande has had some success increasing the number of people in training and he forced through legislation last year making hiring and firing easier. But more than 85% of employment growth last year was for temporary jobs, and the vast majority of those hired were on contracts of less than a month.These are not new problems. From the mid-1990s to the start of the financial crisis in 2007, only Italy among the rich members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has grown less quickly than France. Since the crash, France＊s recovery has lagged well behind the US, the UK and Germany. It is not all bad news. France has good productivity, a strong industrial base and levels of inequality similar to those in Germany and the Netherlands, but much lower than in the UK and the US. The employment rate for prime-aged workers 每 35- to 54-year-olds 每 is higher than it is in the US.Even so, France＊s poor economic record has left it with an inferiority complex when it comes to Germany. In part, France＊s championing of the  in the 1990s was due to its belief that monetary union would dilute Germany＊s influence over European economic policy. Germany was always suspicious of the French claim that the single currency would be the catalyst for economic convergence, and so it has proved. The divergence in economic performance has left France in a clearly subservient role and Germany wary of any further integration that will involve it writing blank cheques to the rest of the eurozone. Berlin has grown impatient with the failure of French politicians to deliver on the reforms they have promised. As a result, it is no longer a partnership of equals. Angela Merkel never took Hollande all that seriously.According to Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank, . Firstly, he wants Berlin to agree to reflate its domestic economy, thereby helping not just French exporters but those of other EU countries. Secondly, he wants to complete the monetary union project by having a eurozone budget managed by a eurozone parliament and a eurozone finance minister.It would certainly help the other members of the single currency if Germany invested and consumed more. There is also something intrinsically unstable about the euro in its current incomplete form.But getting the Germans to agree to Macron＊s proposed changes is not going to be easy. In part, that＊s because reforms of the labour market will run into stiff opposition and 每 if history is any guide 每 will be watered down. But even if Macron does push all his changes through, there is no guarantee that growth will accelerate and unemployment will plummet.And that＊s because the assumption is that all France＊s problems stem from structural rigidity and the lack of labour market flexibility rather than from inadequate demand. The classic neo-liberal diagnosis is that the French state is too big and needs to be pared back through significant cuts in spending. Likewise, the French unions are too powerful and the unemployed need to price themselves into jobs by working harder for lower wages.This has been the standard explanation of France＊s economic woes ever since the abandonment of Keynesianism in the early 1980s. The abiding economic orthodoxy has held that low inflation should be the sole aim of macro-economic policy and should be achieved through control of the money supply; that fiscal policy - changes to tax and spending - is ineffective; and that the economy is a self-adjusting mechanism that will revert to full employment provided prices and wages are flexible.France, in other words, was not giving up anything of real value when it joined the single currency because all that was required was for the European Central Bank to keep inflation low and for politicians in Paris to embark on meaningful structural reform.The Keynesian take on France, by contrast, would be that adjustment to shocks tends not to be automatic but comes through the use of all the main economic levers: interest rates, the exchange rate and fiscal policy. The failure to deploy all these weapons explains why growth in the 12 original members of the eurozone averaged 3.4% a year in the 1970s and 0.1% between 2009 and 2015.Seen from this perspective, Macron does not offer radical centrism but more of the same. By seeing France＊s problems as stemming from a lack of supply-side reform rather than from a shortage of demand, he is setting himself up to fail. The difference is that if Macron fails to deliver on his promises, the Front National will be able to mount an even stronger challenge for the presidency in 2022 than it has this time. That＊s why the stakes for Macron are so high."															
															
"Looking back, the spring of 2015 was the perfect time for David Cameron to fight a . Tumbling oil prices had left inflation at zero and after a couple of years of falling unemployment, annual wage growth was nudging 3%. Rising real earnings translated into a feel-good factor that delivered a political dividend for the Conservatives.Two years on, the real surprise is not the bounce-back in inflation, which at 2.3% remains modest by Britain＊s recent standards, but the . Unemployment has continued to fall since the general election and the jobless rate has not been lower since the 1970s.A tightening labour market is normally associated with upward pressure on earnings, but wage pressure actually seems to be abating. Earnings growth is running at half the 4% expected by the Bank of England a couple of years back.All this takes some explaining. To say the least, it is unusual for an economy to be nearing full employment with absolutely no upward pressure on wages. There are record job vacancies and reports of skill shortages, both of which would normally increase the bargaining power of employees.There are a number of possible explanations. One is that the economy is still quite a way from full employment. The labour market expert John Philpott believes the jobless rate could fall to 4% before wage pressure starts to build.Another is that there is a difference in wage growth between those workers who move jobs and those who remain with the same employee. The movers are able to negotiate better pay deals than the stayers. A third is that the 1% pay limit for the public sector 每 which accounts for about one in six employees 每 is dragging down overall earnings growth.Whatever the explanation, the squeeze on real wages will continue and intensify.  is going to hit 3% later this year and will comfortably outpace earnings growth.For consumers, this will be a rerun of the first half of the last parliament, although the impact is unlikely to be as severe, since back then a combination of rocketing oil prices and higher VAT took the annual inflation rate to 5% at a time when wage growth was struggling to get above 1%.In the circumstances, it is not hard to see why George Osborne was , because there tends to be a correlation between what＊s happening to living standards and the popularity of the government.The current period of falling real wages could hardly have come at a worse time for Theresa May, since it coincides with the start of two years of hard bargaining to thrash out Britain＊s departure from the EU. Those negotiations will take place against a backdrop of people feeling poorer. Not that you＊d know it from the performance of its shares, but . Britain＊s biggest supermarket chain has announced its first sales growth in seven years. Profits have again broken through the ?1bn barrier and exceeded City expectations. The dark days when the company  每 one of the biggest in UK corporate history 每 are now fast receding. Yet the near 6% drop in Tesco＊s share price made it the biggest loser in the FTSE 100.In truth, the market reaction is not a criticism of the impressive job that Dave Lewis, chief executive, has done in turning round Tesco＊s fortunes since his arrival in 2014. The strategy of getting the basics right has worked.Rather, the share price reflects concern that this might be as good as it gets, at least for a while. One source of anxiety is the , which some of Tesco＊s investors are clearly unhappy about.Perhaps more significantly, supermarkets are operating in a highly competitive market that will be made even more challenging by rising inflation. In the energy sector, the lack of competition means EDF can announce it is  每 the second price hike this year. Any supermarket that tried to do the same would be committing commercial suicide.So, investors anticipate that  will be forced to shield its customers from the higher cost of imported food caused by the fall in sterling, while at the same time chiselling out efficiency improvements. That＊s not going to be easy."															
															
"here＊s something fishy going on. In the last 10 days we＊ve heard that , ,  and household debt . What＊s the connection? I hate to sound apocalyptic about it, but taken together they suggest Britain has reached 每 if not surpassed 每 a tipping point.A tipping point, in the social context, is the moment at which small incidents accumulate such that they give rise to a more general and significant societal shift. If the string of recent indicators across public health and crime are indeed the sign of a tipping point, they raise the need for intervention from amber to red. They tell us that a number of things are going wrong and interacting to create a potentially devastating vicious circle.Thousands of academic papers and reports have joined the dots between poverty and inequality with crime or health outcomes. The Marmot review back in 2010  there is a strong social gradient in health: the lower a person＊s social position, the worse their health. This means that health outcomes, including life expectancy, are highly sensitive to poverty. For example, a baby boy from the most deprived area in Kensington and Chelsea  than one from the most affluent part of the borough.This is what statisticians like to think of as causation rather than correlation: it＊s not just that outcomes are moving in the same direction, but that one is influencing the other. In other words, there are social determinants of headline health outcomes 每 as there are for other outcomes including  and .On the issue of more fast-food takeaways in deprived areas, one might argue that this is just a middle-class obsession with poor people not cooking. Such a view, however, overlooks the explanatory power of this metric. The study found that of the 30 council areas where takeaways are the predominant kind of food outlet, 25 are in economically deprived areas of the north, with notable clusters in the north-west. This clear correlation between deprivation and fast food again raises questions of causation. In my experience, stressed individuals and parents, who are both time- and income-poor, turn to fast food at times where life has become too much.Research has found that the diets of low-income groups are  and fear of potential waste. Low income pushes people into less healthy and cheaper diets. The causal link goes the other way too 每  have also stressed the effect of a concentration of fast food outlets as well as the poor availability of fresh produce as key factors in determining diet.A former adviser to David Cameron told me last week that the above is a lazy argument. Crime rates can go up and down, regardless of how many police there are, he claimed, and linking life expectancy to public services or poverty is a huge leap. Of course, these things aren＊t easy to pin to one policy, but cuts to youth, health and police services, growing levels of poverty and more people in insecure work have to be linked. This is one of those times where research only confirms common sense. One has to question why it is that some people want to put their hands over the ears.Levels of household debt 每 now at  每 are yet another reminder of how difficult people are finding it to make ends meet, as well as the prevalence of a consumption culture. But this is about more than individual levels of income and a defunct economy. Cuts to services, rising crime and increasing inequality are all combining to create a feeding ground for stress, crime and ill-health.And then there is the . For years we had a ※runaway rich§ type of inequality 每 a strong welfare state and redistribution meant that inequality looked like the top 1% pulling away from the rest of us. Given the damage done to the welfare state, those at the bottom are now falling behind at an alarming rate. This type of inequality 每 where the rubber band is being pulled at both ends 每 creates a number of different and more pronounced strains on society and the people that live in it.It would be dangerous to ignore these signs. Maybe I＊m wrong 每 maybe we reached the tipping point a while back when we voted for more austerity in 2015. Or, perhaps, things are already starting to take a turn for the better 每 with recent polling showing dwindling support for austerity. Whether or not this is the case, what we need to do now is wise up before things snowball and the life experiences of the rich and poor diverge further. When used in climate change literature, tipping points are seen as points of no return. Society is not the same as the ecosystem. We are still in control 每 if we choose to be."															
"ompare and contrast. As , prime minister Alexis Tsipras declared that the fundraising was ※the most significant step to finish this unpleasant adventure§, meaning the country＊s bailout.Back in April 2014, when  was returning after a four-year absence, the country＊s finance minister drew a similar moral. The return to international borrowing markets was ※a catalytic undertaking,§ he said. The crisis soon returned. The next bailout followed after a referendum on the terms of austerity.Is this time different? Has the end of the Greek debt crisis finally arrived? The omens are better in the sense that the economy is finally growing and the International Monetary Fund is lobbying for meaningful debt relief. But the hard fact remains that the country＊s debt-to-GDP ratio is enormous at 180%. And, while raising 3bn (?2.6bn) of five-year money at 4.6% is impressive in Greece＊s position, the bailout funds are still priced at lower rates of interest.Sadly, thinktank Capital Economics＊ verdict looks correct: ※Unless the eurozone creditors agree to much deeper debt relief than that which is now on the table, it seems fairly likely that Greece will require a fourth bailout when the current one expires next August.§Alan Lewis, chair of Safestore, says he appreciates that the storage firm＊s new incentive scheme, which could pay out ?28m-plus to executives over the next five years, has ※divided opinion§. He＊s putting it mildly. Safestore, in its second attempt to win over shareholders, secured a narrow victory on Tuesday 每 51% of votes were in favour and 49% against.Lewis＊s executives owe him a large drink for his lobbying efforts. He has managed to get this scheme across the line in the face of opposition from influential proxy voting agency ISS and a red-flag warning from the Investment Association, the establishment fund management trade body.It is hard to understand why the 51% rolled over. Safestore trimmed the number of shares on offer to the executives by a fifth since the first draft but the scheme could still hand 37 managers some 3.25% of the company＊s entire share capital. Why? Safestore＊s argument boils down to its preference for a model in which its top folk accept sub-market salaries in return for large potential windfalls. ※Our corporate philosophy is simply that no one in the business should get rich by just turning up each day,§ says Lewis.Very admirable in theory, but it＊s not how everybody views the details. The executives would still get 49% of their jackpot just for hitting City consensus forecasts, noted ISS. That would mean chief executive Frederic Vecchioli getting ?4.2m for what would be considered a par score. This is a FTSE 250 storage company, remember, not an international corporate titan. As ISS put it, the level of rewards is exceptional but the performance targets ※do not appear to be commensurately and exceptionally stretching§.However much Lewis argues otherwise, there is a strong sense here that Safestore is trying to reward past success. The company has indeed done well under Vecchioli but it＊s not obvious why he needs fatter rewards than the ?1.5m he collected last year to continue in the same style. This looks to be a share-grab by a management that judged correctly 每 just 每 that more investors would bark than bite. It sets a bad precedent. The 49% were right.There is serious money to be made by lending at very high rates of interest to ※non-standard§ borrowers, as the euphemism has it. Just ask Peter Crook, chief executive of , the biggest firm in this line of business. He＊s earned a whisker under ?30m over the past five years.Shareholders have also done well during his decade at the helm, despite the one-third plunge in the share price from its peak. That is why Provident＊s debacle on the doorsteps 每 a botched switch from part-time agents to full-time employees 每 probably won＊t cost Crook his job. One suspects Neil Woodford＊s fund and Invesco, long-standing investors with 19% stakes each, will be loyal. The ?40m impairment charge hasn＊t got worse since last month＊s profits warning and the non-doorstep divisions, including the big Vanquis credit card operation, appear unaffected.Even supportive investors, however, should be irritated by the company＊s inability to explain why it didn＊t have a decent back-up plan when many of its 4,500 part-time agents chose to hop off to rivals rather than go full-time at Provident.Instead, Crook repeated his line that strategic rationale for new doorstep operating model remains ※compelling§. Maybe it is, but chief executives are paid the big bucks to execute a strategy cleanly. Telling us that divisional chief Mark Stevens has ※left the business§ doesn＊t explain what the bosses were doing to guard against a ?40m mess."															
															
															
"he final day of 2016 was a Saturday. In the centre of Bolton, Lancashire, the streets should have been crowded with shoppers at the sales. A few shops were doing decent trade, but it was hardly thronging. Those with Christmas money still in their pockets might have been attracted to the grand-looking jewellery shop with the large ※sale§ posters in the window. But this was no regular post-Christmas sale. After 145 years of business, Prestons of  was closing for good.As staff at ※the diamond centre of the north§ sold off the last few rings, five miles north Bolton Wanderers were preparing to face Scunthorpe United at the Macron Stadium, the club＊s gleaming, out-of-town base. They went on to win their top-of-the-table clash 2-1, in front of a crowd of 17,000 fans. Nearby, many thousands more people shopped at Middlebrook, the adjacent mall.Since the stadium opened 20 years ago, Bolton＊s town centre has shown signs of decline. In fact, decline is a polite word. The commercial heart of one of the  is in nothing less than an existential struggle.In 1988, I stood on Victoria Square, the main square of Bolton, having been given the day off school to come and see the Queen open a brand-new swimming pool, the Water Place. Standing in the same spot now, little seems to have changed since that day: the magnificent  is still flanked by imperious lions, and everything seems as it was.Turn around, however, and a different story reveals itself. Opposite the town hall lies the abandoned home of the defunct department store BHS. The wonderful Victorian building that was originally the town＊s first central library has hosted a bank and a betting shop, and is now vacant. (The central library is now hosted nearby, in a building that also houses the museum and aquarium.) And the Water Place? That closed in 2002.※This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a whimper.§ With  might be the next big name to abandon Bolton town centre,  about my home town. which is the sixth worst figure in Britain. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation recently named it one of the . At a food bank warehouse in the town centre, volunteers made clear their sense of despair over the state of their town.※I＊ve lived in Bolton 40 years. I was proud of the centre when I came from Accrington,§ says 71-year-old Hazel Kirane. ※People used to come from all over and shop and say what a wonderful centre it was. But now, it＊s fragmented. Somebody described it to me, Bolton, as being a doughnut 每 the centre＊s gone out of it. It＊s sad what＊s happened to Bolton.§Sad is a word you hear a lot around here. ※I think there are too many pound shops, too many discount stores. It＊s sad that it＊s declined,§ says Lesley Wetherall, 67.Over coffee in the town centre, local MP David Crausby vents his own frustrations. ※I think we＊ve missed some opportunities in Bolton town centre. What I do believe was a serious mistake was to allow shopping on the other side of the dual carriageway, which effectively expanded the size of the town centre. At a time when traditional retail shopping is going down, we＊ve ended up with a bigger town centre.§Crausby, Labour MP for Bolton North East since 1997, points the finger at big-box retail outlets. ※A number of shops opened over where the Sainsbury＊s is, and they seem to be prospering. But, guess what? It just shuts down shops on the other side of town.§Bolton＊s problems aren＊t unique, says Stephen Young of Bolton council. ※All town centres aren＊t what they once were,§ he says. ※People shop online now. People don＊t come into town centres and do food shopping any more. There are more people since the recession coming into Bolton town centre and spending money.§The market town was  and was small, but occasionally significant, for the next 500 years. In 1651, James Stanley, the 7th earl of Derby, lost his head during the civil war outside , one of the country＊s oldest pubs.It was during the Industrial Revolution that Bolton really came to prominence. Samuel Crompton＊s invention of the  in 1779, and the perfect damp conditions in the town for spinning, saw Bolton become a giant of cotton production. Along with neighbouring towns, it became the world centre of the cotton industry, based on the might of nearby Manchester. Bolton＊s population swelled from  only 100 years later.The cotton industry remained a major feature . By the time my parents moved here in the early 1980s, though, much of the industry was gone. The 70s and 80s brought their fair share of economic hardships, but even when I was growing up, the town remained a bustling commercial hub. It was entirely normal for people to come from all over the north-west to shop in Bolton. Most popular was the Market Hall, home of independent traders, quirky shops, chain stores and big local names.As the Blair/Brown boom rolled on, Bolton seemed to be doing well. Our own  was the first voice heard by millions every morning on the Radio 1 breakfast show,  became the most popular comedian in the country, and we even claimed  (schooled in Bolton) at the height of his Gandalfian greatness. Alongside this cultural confidence, that other great marker of civic pride 每 the town＊s football club 每 was soaring. Thanks to manager Sam Allardyce,  were on their most successful run since the 1950s, mixing it in Europe with the likes of , and Red Star Belgrade, and regularly outplaying the big-city boys of  and .The scene of these triumphs, however, wasn＊t in the town centre. It was at the Reebok Stadium, the club＊s sparkling new home, which replaced the dilapidated old , where I＊d watched my first match as a child in the 80s. Burnden Park had been in such a state of disrepair that one of the stands was replaced by the flagship store of Normid, the ＊s supermarket brand. By the time a new ground was being built, it wasn＊t Normid who＊d be sponsoring, but Reebok, the global sportswear brand founded . (The stadium was renamed the Macron Stadium in 2013.) Instead of being half a mile out of town, and walkable for the majority of Boltonians, the new ground was located conveniently for the M61 motorway. The days of walking to the stadium were over.Around it, a sprawling retail park was built. Middlebrook started big, and has kept on growing. It has its own train station, police station and a sports arena that hosted events in Manchester＊s 2002 Commonwealth Games. The site even got its own school: Bolton Wanderers free school, which  and is soon to close, with  about its financial dealings.Around the same time as this large development to the north of Bolton, there were temptations for shoppers to the south. The , one of Britain＊s largest shopping centres, was built within easy driving distance of Bolton. Manchester city centre was in the midst of its own millennial renaissance after the . Suddenly, shoppers from across the north-west who used to come to Bolton were spoiled for choice.The centre might have been resilient enough to deal with one, or perhaps two of these competing retail opportunities, but all three together seems to have proved too much. Manchester＊s re-emergence as a shopping destination was always likely. Yet Bolton＊s decision to move the football stadium out of town and build a huge retail park seems to have contributed to its downward spiral.Meanwhile, online shopping presents a challenge everywhere: the closure of national retailers such as BHS and Woolworths have left holes in high streets across the country. Yet Bolton did itself no favours, stripping the Market Hall of its distinctive character and allowing small traders to be replaced by chain shops, making Bolton＊s offer more generic.The evisceration of the Market Hall was greeted with widespread dismay. ※It was very much a community place 每 people came there because of lots of different shops, little market stalls,§ says Sam Bagley, 25, who works for , a local charity. ※That was the identity of Bolton. I think when they closed the Market Hall and relaunched it as it is now, they lost that identity. It became a nothing of a town.§※A lot of people were very disappointed when the Market Hall was changed,§ says Ellen Greenhaulgh, 54, while shopping in the town centre. ※It was one of those places where you could get those little useful things in life. You built up relationships with the people that were running stalls. A lot of people felt not listened to.§When I was growing up and used to walk into the town centre most Saturdays to window shop and buy CDs, the place was thriving. Yes, there were national options such as Debenhams, but we also had Whitakers, a  near Bolton＊s main Post Office. As a child it was where I＊d go to buy shoes and get a haircut. In 2011, Whitakers was bought out by the national chain Beales. On the same day that Prestons, the jewellers, closed its doors for the last time, so did the store, which had been at the heart of Bolton . Standing outside its shell and looking across the road, you can see the husk of , an independent bookshop that has lain derelict since it closed in 2011.Along with the loss of Prestons, the closure of Whitakers has been a hammer blow to the local retail scene. ※Things like Prestons closing and Beales closing 每 they＊re part of the way that you grew up, with your parents and your family,§ says Greenhaulgh.Young from Bolton council says the local authority did all it could to prevent the closures. ※We were working with Beales for a long time. They also pulled out of a number of major towns. While it＊s obviously very sad, we did everything we possibly could.§It would be easy to pin the blame on the council. There have been baffling decisions, such as allowing the beautiful old fire station to be . Others decry money poorly spent: there was an uproar last year when  a ?300,000 grant from the council to a legal firm in exchange for keeping their offices in the centre of town.But the council can＊t be blamed for the success of Middlebrook. Shoppers seem happy with it, and its business rates are filling Bolton＊s coffers, which have been badly stretched by central government cuts.Meanwhile, in the town centre, even the chains are struggling now. News of closures comes through with alarming regularity; Pizza Express is . The company told the Bolton News: ※We have made the decision to close our restaurant in Bolton, to focus trading on the various restaurants we have in the surrounding area; including nearby Bury, Prestwich and the seven sites we have in Manchester.§Bolton may not yet go out with a whimper, though. After 18 years without one, a cinema has finally been built in the town centre, in the old Market Hall, which itself is undergoing an imaginative development that has seen old vaults dug out to provide space for restaurants. It is a beautiful space, sympathetically restored in order to attract more of the night-time economy. Elsewhere, the Octagon theatre has , while the town＊s museum and art gallery are . An annual food and drink festival has begun to receive acclaim, while a large multi-storey car park is  into retail space for independent traders. The town＊s population  grow by 12% 每 roughly 33,000 people 每 by 2035. Above all, hopes are pinned on the University of Bolton. The former polytechnic＊s teaching and residential buildings have been consolidated in the town centre, bringing with them a readymade group of customers. A new sports centre, named after the most renowned Boltonian of the present day, track cyclist and Olympic gold medallist Jason Kenny, is now open to the public.Near the university campus, a new transport exchange will consolidate the train and bus stations into one site. It＊s a good idea, although the ?48m cost has raised eyebrows, and public spending on transport in the north of England still . Will better transport links, educational and leisure opportunities be enough to save the once-thriving town centre?※We＊re doing lots and lots, not only to attract the big boys but to help fledgling local businesses,§ says Young from the council. ※The figures are showing positive things. I＊m absolutely confident the Market Hall isn＊t the end. The private sector is voting with its cheque book.§The tired-looking shopfronts on Bolton＊s wide thoroughfare, Newport Street, , have been renovated and painted. But the road still tells its own story. In the refurbished row of 20 properties are two charity shops, two pawnbrokers, a pound shop, a betting shop and a vaping shop.A bigger question, perhaps, is what long-term damage has been done to civic pride. ※Very quickly you can destroy it and [it takes] a very long time to rebuild it,§ says Crausby. ※In all of our particular Lancashire town centres, we had something that was really quite unique 每 but most of this was born out of huge levels of prosperity. Towns like this were built on cotton, and it＊s gone. There is no cotton.§He remains hopeful, though. ※We＊ve got a great opportunity in a beautiful town centre and we＊ve got to make it fit the 21st century.§ Bagley, the charity worker, agrees. ※Bolton＊s got a real chance at making itself again. People are very generous, from a charitable perspective; people want to help each other. I would very happily have my family in Bolton and shop in Bolton and continue to invest in Bolton.§ The city will need many more like him."															
"ome people might be happy to stop at being founder and chief of one of the world＊s biggest tech companies while still in their early 30s. Not Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook＊s CEO has spent the last couple of years casting himself in various guises. First, global philanthropist: he and his wife last year pledged to invest $3bn over 10 years  (a well-meaning if hopelessly naive sentiment; it＊s a ). Most lately, social commentator: Zuckerberg is currently undertaking a 50-state meet-and-greet tour across the United States. Little wonder rumours are flying that he fancies himself for an imminent White House run.Put aside for a moment the chilling thought that if the chief of the world＊s most ubiquitous media platform chose to run to be leader of the free world, his command of Facebook＊s unrivalled ability to profile, segment and target voters might make him all but unbeatable. What might he do as president? The missives from his grand tour 每 published, of course, on Facebook 每 provide some clues. Last . Zuckerberg used it as an opportunity to heap praise on the idea of a universal basic income 每 an unconditional income paid by government to all citizens, regardless of whether or not they＊re in work.Zuckerberg＊s got some cheek. The idea of a universal basic income is all very well and good in sparsely populated Alaska, where revenues from natural oil fund a  to the state＊s permanent residents that in the last decade has varied between $800 and $2,000.But the proponents of a basic income often talk it up as replacement for welfare benefits altogether. Funding a decent safety net that gets paid to everyone 每 where there isn＊t a multibillion-dollar state-backed fund conveniently created in the 1970s from oil reserves 每 would be very expensive. The cash would either have to come from hiking up taxes or significantly cutting back state spending on other services, such as education and health.Here＊s the rub. Zuckerberg has no right to pronounce on what the welfare state should look like while Facebook takes aggressive measures to minimise its tax burden. Here in the UK, Facebook paid just ?4,327 in corporation tax in 2014, despite paying its UK . In 2015, it offset its tax bill of ?4.2m against a tax credit of ?11.3m 每 despite making .It＊s not just Facebook: global tech giants such as Amazon and Google are notorious for exploiting every loophole to get out of paying their fair share of tax. It＊s deeply hypocritical for Zuckerberg to back the idea of a state-based income while his company does everything it can to avoid paying tax. And there＊s a clue Zuckerberg sees a basic income as a replacement for, not in addition to, public services, ※It comes from conservative principles of smaller government, rather than progressive principles of a larger safety net,§ .Zuckerberg is not the first Silicon Valley CEO to talk up universal basic income: it＊s an idea . This is no coincidence. One of the beliefs that powers Silicon Valley＊s fervent tech worship is the idea that artificial intelligence and automation will one day spell the end of work. This is implicit in the business plans: Uber＊s growth strategy, for instance, is based on the idea that driverless technology will one day replace its drivers altogether.But that leaves tech CEOs with a problem. If they see a world with far fewer jobs, where will their customers of the future come from? Suddenly  doesn＊t look such a great marketing proposition if the majority of its users don＊t have any income to spend. Cue basic income, aka let＊s make this the state＊s problem. This is the turbo-charged version of gig-economy platforms shifting employment risk from companies to individuals and state welfare systems, all in the name of profit. It＊s part of the bigger trend of global companies stepping back from their responsibilities, expecting the state to pick up the tab even though they＊re not prepared to pay the taxes to fund it.The ※end of work§ premise for a universal basic income is also deeply flawed. Predictions about technological progress foreshadowing the end of work have been around for centuries. But while technology has always replaced some jobs, it has also created more than enough new ones. There＊s no reason to think the forecasts of today＊s utopian dreamers are more accurate than those of their predecessors. The lesson from the deindustrialisation of recent decades is not that we should get ready to pay cash handouts to those for whom there won＊t be any jobs, but that we should be ready to invest in the significant reskilling needed to train people for new jobs when their old ones disappear.Obsessing about a universal basic income as the panacea for the shortcomings of the labour market of the future is a distraction from tackling the problems in the labour market of today. In parts of our low-pay labour market 每 like  每 we＊re not seeing technology being used to modernise workplaces and increase productivity, but a return to Victorian-style sweatshops that flout employment law. In other industries, such as logistics, technology is being used to further degrade low-skill work, with warehouse workers subject to wrist-based technology that tracks their every move for efficiency and records how long they take for toilet breaks.We should be fighting for a society in which everyone has the right to a decently paid job that provides them with autonomy and fulfilment; not a future in which a big chunk of the population is consigned to exist on meagre state handouts. At best, a universal basic income is a dangerous diversion from how to improve the quality of work. At worst, it could be an enabler for the dark motives of the Silicon Valley tech scene. We＊d be naive to buy into the idea that the owners of the robots would happily carry on paying the rest of us a basic income if it no longer suited them. Karl Marx would be turning in his grave at this fundamental misunderstanding of how economic power works. A Zuckerberg candidacy shouldn＊t get your vote."															
"Shoppers would be forced to pay ?3 more for a traditional British fry-up if the government fails to secure a trade deal with the EU, piling more pressure on already cash-strapped consumers. A typical basket of ingredients for a family breakfast could rise by almost 13% from ?23.59 to ?26.61 according to a report by KPMG. The accountancy firm warned households would face above-inflation price rises for imported breakfast classics such as olive oil, bacon and orange juice if Britain left the EU without a deal and defaulted to the ＊s (WTO) customs rules.It estimated that a 79p litre of orange juice from Spain and bottled in Ireland would rise to 93p, and a 300g pack of Danish bacon would increase from ?2 to ?2.18. In other examples a litre of Italian olive oil would jump from ?3.60 to ?4.68.A 500g pack of French butter would rise by a quarter to ?4.08. Butter prices are already at an all-time high, up 20% over the past 12 months, as farmers and dairies struggle to cope with demand.Consumer budgets are under mounting pressure as the sharp fall in sterling＊s valuesince the  vote last year pushes up the prices of goods imported from abroad and drives shop prices higher. The pound is currently trading at about $1.29, 13% lower than it was on the day of the June 2016 referendum.As a result, inflation has risen rapidly, from 0.3% in May last year to . Meanwhile wage growth is weak, intensifying the squeeze on household finances. ※WTO tariffs could have a significant impact on both consumers and retailers alike 每 totting up consumer price tags and further squeezing retail margins,§ said Bob Jones, director at the accountancy firm.It＊s important to remember that our analysis does not even reflect the steep costs consumers and retailers are already facing as a result of the pound sterling＊s devaluation or the costs of any new non-tariff barriers.§KPMG said that if no deal was struck on or before March 2019, two years after the UK , imported food and drink items would be among those hardest hit by increased tariffs. ※If the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal or transitional agreement, we can expect both higher prices and a huge spike in red tape at the borders,§ Jones said. ※The top priority for businesses is to fully understand their own supply chains: the volumes and values of the goods they ship back and forth and which countries they＊re importing to and from.§ KPMG made the calculations by taking the cost of mid-range ingredients of a fry-up from a UK supermarket and applying the current EU external customs tariffs to each product. It also took into account the grocer＊s price mark-up.Milk, free range eggs and sliced white bread were all sourced from the UK in the analysis, and were therefore free from additional tariffs.Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, said that while supermarkets had so far avoided fully passing on higher prices to customers, this would change if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.※The British consumer has become accustomed to seasonal produce all year round and has binged on a diet of discounts for some time. ※Shoppers could be forgiven for overlooking the significant impact customs will have on the prices they pay at the till. However, against a backdrop of increasingly squeezed margins, it is unlikely retailers will be able to hold the flood on higher costs indefinitely.§ Last week , the EU＊s chief Brexit negotiator, said Britain has more to lose than the EU if it walked away without a deal.※In practice, ＆no deal＊ would worsen the ＆lose-lose＊ situation which is bound to result from . And the UK would have more to lose than its partners,§ Barnier said."															
"here is more fuel for the raging debate around UK interest rates this week, with official figures on pay growth out on Wednesday. Investors and policymakers alike are looking for any signs that a tight labour market can translate into faster pay growth, a trend that has so far proved elusive this year. If wages do start to get going again, the pound is likely to rally as traders price in a greater chance of a 2017 interest rate rise.This month marks a whole decade since the  last raised borrowing costs. Since then, the only way has been down and interest rates are currently at a record low of 0.25%. But that could be about to change if the latest noises from Threadneedle Street＊s policymakers are anything to go by 每 with the obvious health warning that previous hints of rate hikes have come to nothing.At the last rate-setting meeting in June, three policymakers voted for an immediate rate rise to 0.5%, which would remove some of the emergency stimulus the Bank injected into the economy after the Brexit vote. The other five members of the monetary policy committee outvoted the hawks, however, preferring to leave the base rate at 0.25% to shore up the economy after a slow start to 2017. But more recently, the Bank＊s chief economist, , and the governor Mark Carney have suggested they may be more amenable to higher rates.After six years as chairman of Marks & Spencer, Robert Swannell will take to the podium at an AGM for the final time on Tuesday.The former investment banker will retire in September at a tumultuous time for the retailer. In May, the retailer reported a drop in profits of almost two-thirds at the same time as a turnaround plan by chief executive Steve Rowe brought in a bill of more than ?400m in restructuring costs.Rowe has insisted that M&S is on track for recovery, despite worsening performances in clothing and food. Not that this will be the only thing likely to irk the shareholders, known for taking their opportunity at AGMs to vent their grievances over every facet of the company＊s operations.The last few years have seen shareholders protest about the appointment system for bra fitting, the type of music played in stores (※would the board at least consider changing the irritating songs to something more tranquil?§) and where best to find a cotton dress with sleeves and a high line suitable for ※golden oldies§.A number of questions have focused on socks 每 one specifically about why they fall to pieces ※when you look at them§, according to one shareholder, although this claim was rejected by the chairman.One hopes Swannell＊s replacement, , who takes over on 1?September, is prepared for what is to?come.London＊s black cabs have been voted in the past as the best-recognised design in London transport, proving more popular than the Routemaster bus and the Tube map. This week, the look of the next generation of black cabs 每 electric models 每 will be revealed by The London Taxi Company (LTC).This new generation of battery-powered cabs is due to be ushered in from later this year as Transport for London moves to reduce toxic pollution from diesel engines. On Tuesday, the wrapping will come off the new vehicles, which will be moving around the streets of the capital (and other cities at later times). TfL has pinpointed the existing black cabs as one of the major contributors to traffic pollution 每 15% of nitrogen oxides are reported to have come from cabs.LTC will unveil the new design, so far only seen camouflaged in public, at a breakfast event in Wapping led by chief exec Chris Gubbey. From 1 January, all new black cabs will have to be battery-powered electric models and ?18m is being spent to upgrade the capital＊s power grids, including the installation of 300 fast-charging stations. An initial 75 stations are due to be operational by the end of the year.Some sites will be exclusively for black cabs but others will be open to owners of other electric vehicles, such as Teslas and electric BMWs. Cab drivers with an existing taxi older than 10 years will be able to claim up to ?5,000 from TfL later this year towards the cost of a new zero-emission cab."															
"Families who rely on a fathers＊ earnings alone are at greater risk of poverty than other households, with average incomes stagnant for the past 15 years, according to analysis by the .The IFS said that because the father works in most single breadwinner households, those families have not benefited from the relatively large increases in women＊s earnings since the mid-1990s.Over the past two decades, growth in the earnings of working fathers has been ※extremely slow§, at 0.3%-a-year on average, according to the thinktank. In contrast, mothers＊ earnings have grown by more than 2% a year.While the incomes of two-earner families are 10% higher than in 2002-03, the incomes of one-earner families have not changed over that period.※With men＊s earnings growing so slowly over the last 20 years, it has become increasingly hard for families dependent on the father＊s earnings alone to keep up with other families,§ said Jonathan Cribb, a senior research economist at IFS and an author of the report. ※The average incomes of one-earner couples with children have not grown at all since the early 2000s, and the only reason that they are any higher than in the mid-1990s is the greater generosity of benefits and tax credits.§The research, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, found that fathers in one-earner couples were less likely than other fathers to be in well-paid professional or managerial jobs. They were also increasingly likely to have been born abroad.※These figures show that families with a single breadwinner are under increasing strain and have become much more vulnerable to ,§said Helen Barnard, head of analysis at the foundation. ※Relying on one earner no longer protects families from hardship. Balancing work and caring, and earning enough to make ends meet is an uphill struggle for many.※Ensuring families can keep more of their earnings, driving up the number of good jobs through the industrial strategy and ensuring parents can access good quality and affordable childcare will help ease the strain,§Barnard said.The report said that a growing number of children living in families with one working parent were at risk of poverty. The proportion of children living with one working parent and one non-working parent in relative income poverty rose to 43% in 2015每16 每 after accounting for housing costs 每 up from 33% in 1994每95. The Treasury said the government had taken action to help working families. ※Income inequality is now at its lowest level since the mid-1980s and our reforms to the tax system mean hardworking people are keeping more of what they earn. ※Increases to the personal allowance have taken millions out of income tax altogether and reduced tax bills for some of the lowest earners by ?1,000 a year.§ A separate survey by the charity Grandparents Plus found that one in four mothers would have to give up work if they did not have help with childcare from their own parents. Only 7% of parents said they did not rely on their mother or father to have their children while they worked."															
"Fundamental reforms undertaken since the US sub-prime mortgage market triggered the deepest global recession since the second world war have created a safer, simpler and fairer financial system,  has said.With the 10th anniversary of the  next month, Carney said the world＊s biggest banks were stronger, misconduct was being tackled, and the toxic forms of shadow banking were no longer a threat.Carney, as well as being governor of the , is chairman of the Financial Stability Board, a body created by the G20 group of developed and developing nations in 2009 to recommend ways of remedying the flaws in the system highlighted by the crash.In a letter to  later this week, Carney said: ※A decade after the start of the global financial crisis, G20 reforms are building a safer, simpler and fairer financial system. The largest banks are considerably stronger, more liquid and more focused.§The FSB chairman said there were still issues to be addressed, such as the risks posed by developments in financial technology (fintech) and the increased vulnerability of digital systems to cyber-attack.But at a press conference in London on Monday, Carney said: ※We have fixed the issues that caused the last crisis. They were fundamental and deep-seated, which is why it was such a major job.§The financial crisis of 2007 began in the  but rapidly went global as it emerged that banks and unregulated shadow banks were massively exposed in the market for derivatives and did not have enough capital when losses started to mount.Public anger towards the financial system grew when the biggest banks were bailed out by taxpayers because they were deemed ※too big to fail§.Carney said in his letter: ※The largest banks are required to have as much as 10 times more of the highest quality capital than before the crisis and are subject to greater market discipline as a consequence of globally agreed standards to resolve too-big-to-fail entities.※A decade ago, many large banks were woefully undercapitalised, with complex business models that relied on the goodwill of markets and, ultimately, taxpayers. A decade on, the largest banks have raised more than $1.5tn of capital, and all major internationally active banks meet minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements well in advance of the deadline.§He added that on the eve of the crisis a decade ago, ※enormous risks were built up outside the core banking system and away from effective supervision with devastating impact on the real economy§.As a result of measures agreed four years ago to toughen up regulation, Carney said ※the financial stability risks from the toxic forms of shadow banking at the heart of the crisis no longer represent a global stability risk§.The FSB is monitoring the rapid growth of the asset management industry, with particular emphasis on the vulnerability of emerging and developing countries to sudden outflows of funds.※Despite this immense progress, there are nascent risks that, if left unchecked, could undermine the G20＊s objective for strong, sustainable and balanced growth,§ Carney said. ※In particular, giving into reform fatigue could erode the willingness of  members to rely on each other＊s systems and institutions and, in the process, fragment pools of funding and liquidity, create inefficiencies and frictions, reduce competition, and diminish cross-border capital and investment flows.§ "															
"Skills shortages in Britain are costing businesses more than ?2bn a year in higher salaries, recruitment costs and temporary staffing bills, according to research by the .Its survey of 400 firms found 90% had faced difficulties recruiting workers with the required skills in the last 12 months. The findings will add to  even before a potential clampdown on immigration once Britain leaves the EU.Open University researchers noted that , those in work were reluctant to move jobs because of continued Brexit uncertainty and that a lack of clarity about future immigration rules was deterring some EU nationals from taking up roles in Britain.As a result, the recruitment process was taking longer for three quarters of employers surveyed 每 an average of one month and 24 days more than expected. They estimated the extra costs from recruitment fees and hiring temporary staff as ※at least§ ?1.7bn. They put the cost of inflating salaries to above the market rate in order to fill roles at ?527m. Steve Hill, external engagement director at the Open University, said employers should respond to skills shortages by helping train their workforces. ※The UK challenge of finding talent with the right skills means that businesses need to look at recruitment, development and retention differently,§ he said.The survey, conducted in April and May, found 56% of businesses had to increase the salary on offer for a role ※well above§ market rate to get the skills they required in the previous 12 months. The average increase was ?4,150 per hire for small and medium-sized firms and ?5,575 per hire for larger organisations.While the firms surveyed highlighted higher starting salaries for new hires, official figures have shown average wage growth in Britain has slowed and fallen behind inflation, meaning .The Open University poll found about half of employers, or 53%, were  with the required skills and chose to hire at a lower level as a result. More than half, again 53%, said they were using training to bring those new employees＊ skills up to the required level.The survey follows a  last week that highlighted the potential pressure on employers if EU migrants choose to leave. Its polling of people outside Britain found the country was still a very attractive place to come to live and work, ranking above other nations. But its survey of people already in Britain found that  in the next five years. "															
"Britain＊s manufacturers are enjoying the strongest demand for their products in almost 30 years as a recovering global economy and a weaker pound boost order books.The  found that export and total order books were both at their highest for decades 每 providing some hope that a stronger manufacturing sector would cushion the effect of higher inflation on consumer spending.The employers＊ organisation said that particularly strong performances by the food, drink, tobacco and chemicals industries had spearheaded a pick-up in orders in 13 of the 17 industrial sub-sectors tracked each month.As a result, the balance of companies reporting that order books were above normal rose from +9 percentage points in May to +16 points in June 每 the highest since the height of the late 1980s boom in August 1988. The balance for export orders rose from +10 points to +13 points 每 the joint highest in 22 years.But the CBI warned that manufacturers were still being affected by rising prices. The balance of companies expecting prices to rise in the coming months remained unchanged at +23 points between May and June, but was up from +1 point a year ago.Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI＊s chief economist, said: ※Britain＊s manufacturers are continuing to see demand for ＆Made in Britain＊ goods rise with the temperature. Total and export order books are at highs not seen for decades, and output growth remains robust.※Nevertheless, with cost pressures remaining elevated, it＊s no surprise to see that manufacturers continue to have high expectations for the prices they plan to charge.※To build the right future for Britain＊s economy, manufacturers and workers, the government must put the economy first as it negotiates the country＊s departure from the EU. This approach will deliver a deal that supports growth and raises living standards across the UK.§Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at Capital , said UK manufacturing was poised to record a strong performance in the second quarter of 2017. ※Today＊s strong survey supports our view that solid manufacturing and export growth will help to offset the slowdown in consumer spending growth this year,§ he said."															
"hey haven＊t gone away. The great spending dinosaurs of the political dark ages, back before June 2017, are still roaming the jungle. Theresa May＊s first decision as prime minister, to , is still crashing about Whitehall. Now the national audit office (NAO) has added its voice to those calling it a . The project now has no independent supporters.Hinkley was a hangover from when Whitehall＊s energy department took leave of its senses and approved anything that looked remotely ※green§. It just passed the bill to the Treasury. The Treasury then passed the risk to Chinese investors and French contractors. The risk proved so great that these backers swiftly passed it back to the Treasury and future British taxpayers and energy users, in loan guarantees and sky-high prices.As the French contractors saw their costs soar and risks rise, the burden of these guarantees soared. The Chinese and French have made British consumers the equivalent of a gargantuan payday loan. The case for the project, says the NAO, was ※marginal§ and the deal ※not value for money§. That is auditor-speak for crazy. In which case, why does the NAO speak up only now?Hinkley Point is one of a group of French mega-reactors that have yet to work anywhere, and have become a byword for cost overruns and delays. Like most such ventures, they are so big as to get enmeshed in ministerial machismo, foreign diplomacy, lobbying and politics. That is how really bad decisions get made. No one sees the wood for the trees, and the dinosaur crashes on.May should have cancelled Hinkley on day one. There are already cheaper and less risky nuclear alternatives on the horizon. She lacked the nerve. Now her ramshackle coalition needs to take tough decisions on spending if it is to honour its promise to ease austerity. It must help the police, prisons, housing, schools and mental health services, among others. May has at least shown flexibility in her this week.Nothing would signal more clearly a change of heart than for her to clear the ground of the vanities and extravagances of the David Cameron years. The government should postpone its fantastically expensive high-speed rail project, and redirect the money to northern intercity links. It should call a halt to an ever more inflated Heathrow. There should be an embargo on ,  and . And May should wriggle out of Hinkley. Whatever the cancellation costs, it will be cheaper in the long run."															
"hen 48% of shareholders rebel against a company＊s remuneration report, most chairmen scuttle into the shadows muttering empty words about seeking further engagement with investors. So Andy Higginson, chairman of Morrisons, deserves some credit for coming out fighting after more than half of investors either voted against the proposal or withheld their vote.  ※fundamentally disagrees§ with the assessment by proxy voting agency ISS that executives＊ new performance targets aren＊t stretching.The argument here is slightly technical. Chief executive David Potts is being incentivised to get Morrisons to produce ?800m of cash over the next three years. Is that demanding? It＊s hard to tell, since comparisons are distorted by disposals and one＊s view of how past working capital improvements should be regarded. But, actually, that little squabble is beside the point. The rest of us can concentrate on the indisputable fact that Potts has just had his long-term incentive package increased by ?510,000. It seems a lot, especially as his pre-bump package was worth a potential ?4.8m in total, which ought to be enough to get him out of bed in the morning.Why does Potts need a carrot worth an extra half a million? At this point, Morrisons＊ argument descends into the usual pleas about what a good job Potts is doing and how an LTIP set at ※only§ 240% salary was subpar for a FTSE 100 chief executive. It＊s true that Morrisons＊ trading, and the share price, have revived on his watch. But, come on, the risk of Potts, 60, being poached by a rival is minimal.The board might also remember what the man himself said in January. ※Our improving performance is entirely due to the continuing hard work of the Morrisons team of food makers and shopkeepers,§ said Potts. Entirely due to the whole team? Then don＊t annoy everybody with a top-up that just looks greedy.It is rarely wise to read too much into a sofa retailer＊s view of the trading outlook. Furniture and carpet stores have always seemed peculiarly vulnerable to hot weather, cold snaps, late Easters, and most other supposed plagues of the shopkeeping game.All the same,  每 it now expects ?82m to ?87m compared with ?94.4m a year ago 每 is rightly being taken as a worrying sign for the sector.DFS blamed ※customer uncertainty regarding the general election and the uncertain macroeconomic environment§. Well, maybe. Precise explanations of why the consumer mood may have shifted are usually impossible. The election was only a week ago, even though it feels like it happened in a different age.The big-picture backdrop, however, is easier to describe. In real terms, wages are falling. In the three months to April, , and has subsequently risen to 2.9%. That represents a fundamental jolt to consumers＊ spending power. Nor does it seem likely that increased personal borrowing can fill the gap. Savings rates are already at historically low levels.  tell a similar story 每 sales volumes were down 1.2%. There are relative winners in these trends, of course. Supermarkets, and even a few clothing retailers, may be happier if punters decide to eat out less. But the general downturn in consumers＊ mood tallies with what many retail bosses have been expecting for months. Do not be surprised if we see more profit warnings.Farewell, Fusionex International. Never heard of it? Few people had until recent weeks. This small Malaysian software company was just another tiddler on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) until founder, chief executive and 41% shareholder Ivan Teh decided investors in London weren＊t giving his company the love and valuation he thought it deserved. A delisting was proposed and was duly passed on Thursday, with 85% shareholder support.What＊s the problem? Standard Life, for one, feels it has been unfairly outmanoeuvred. One can only agree. Fusionex shares were 130p before the delisting proposal; now they＊re 35.5p.The reason for the collapse in the share price is obvious. Few UK funds are even allowed to hold stock in unlisted Malaysian entities, so were obliged to get out if there was even half a chance of the resolution passing. That made the delisting more likely to happen, because it strengthened Teh＊s hand. The effect is a take-private on the cheap.No rules have been broken, it should be said. Rule 41 of the AIM says a company merely has to give proper notice of its intentions and secure a 75% majority.In other words, in the view of the , which regulates AIM, investors knew the risks, or should have done. Besides, it says, on equivalent US exchanges, the delisting threshold is a two-thirds majority.Yet such a lofty view feels completely wrong. AIM can boast many successes 每 online retailer Asos and tonic firm Fever-Tree 每 but the Fusionex saga shows the lightly regulated market at its worst. Minority investors have been exploited. The LSE, if it values the reputation of AIM, should review rule 41 immediately."															
"For the best part of a decade,  has wanted to become a ※normal§ country, and late on Thursday it appeared to begin that process, after creditors agreed to disburse 8.5bn (?7.4bn) of bailout funds aimed at putting the debt-stricken nation back on the road to recovery.The money, signed off after months of disagreement between the  and International Monetary Fund over how to reduce Athens＊ staggering debt pile, will be released in July, once European parliaments ratify the deal.Around 7.4bn will be initially disbursed so that Greece can honour debt repayments that mature mostly to the European Central Bank. The rest will be handed over once creditors are satisfied that the nation has complied with reforms. ※I am pleased to announce that we have achieved an agreement on all elements,§ Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem announced after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg. The 19-nation bloc, he said, had also agreed that Greece could get further help with making its debt sustainable, including the possibility of extending repayments by 15 years and linking them to growth rates. The deal 每 though far short of the debt forgiveness prime minister Alexis Tsipras＊s leftist-led government had hoped for 每 was greeted with jubilation. ※There is now light at the end of the tunnel,§ the finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, told reporters, insisting that it provided the clarity Athens had long sought. ※We didn＊t want the perfect to be the enemy of the good.§The government said Greece had finally got what it wanted. In the form of ※a clear commitment§ that Athens would complete its current bailout programme next summer and ultimately retap capital markets. Lenders had also agreed to reduce the primary budget surplus from 3.5% to 2% as of 2023.The ECB, whose stimulus programme the recession-hit country has been yearning to join, also applauded the deal. ※We take note of the Eurogroup discussion, which we see as a first step towards security debt sustainability,§ said a spokesperson.But it fell short of saying when, or if, Greece could join the quantitative easing programme that the Frankfurt-based ECB has emphatically linked to the country＊s vast 324bn debt mountain (the equivalent of 180% of GDP) being rendered manageable.Without that, Athens is unlikely to achieve market access any time soon 每 a negative sign for investors who would view the country＊s return to capital markets as evidence that after eight years of economic crisis and  the worst is behind it. Outside investment is seen as vital to Greece recouping some of the 27% loss in GDP it has suffered since its ordeal through bankruptcy began.The IMF managing director Christine Lagarde described the deal as being ※the second best solution§. While it had averted a credit default 每 and renewed crisis given the scale of debt repayments looming next month 每 it had not achieved the IMF＊s overall aim of making Greece＊s debt load sustainable. As such the Washington-based IMF would agree to back the bailout programme ※in principle§ via a stand-by arrangement, but would only contribute around $2bn (?1.5bn) to it once the eurozone could commit to debt relief. The agreement, she said, had allowed more time for those discussions to continue.Germany, the main contributor to the 300bn in funds the thrice-bailed-out nation has received since its first rescue programme in May 2010, had made IMF participation a condition of additional disbursements. While the breakthrough now puts any talk of Greece＊s ejection from the single currency to rest - and will be met with relief in EU capitals 每 it had barely been announced before seasoned Greece watchers were denouncing it as a fudge, once again aimed at kicking the can down the road. The Tsipras government had legislated a slew of extra austerity measures worth 4.6bn in savings in the hope of convincing creditors to finally give the Greek economy real breathing space through debt relief. Thursday＊s deal is unlikely to please many in his leftist Syriza party who had accepted to support the unpopular budget-cutting policies 每 to be enacted once the current three-year bailout programme ends in August 2018 每 only on the condition that debt relief would be achieved. Although the economy is growing again, more than a third of Greeks are estimated to be at risk of poverty. Despite detente between the creditors, the IMF and the eurozone are likely to remain at odds over the long-term prospects for the Greek economy. IMF officials do not believe EU assumptions that Greece can run a budget surplus (minus debt servicing) of 3.5% for years to come.The IMF is not calling for Greek debts to be cancelled but wants to ease terms, by extending repayment holidays and deadlines. Creditors agreed on short-term debt relief last year, but the IMF had been pressing for specifics on the long-term. It has previously warned that Greece＊s debts could spiral to 250% of GDP by 2050 without help."															
"een from a sofa, the world looks very different. And to listen to TV＊s sofa pundits is to hear a very different election. They would have you believe that Labour and the Conservatives have rarely been further apart. That voters face ※a clear choice§ between a hard left and a Brextremist right, the inedible and the unpalatable. Plausible and conventional, it＊s a classic sofa argument.It also misses the critical change in this election.To see what I mean, open . Straight away, she gets stuck into the ※burning injustices§ of modern Britain, demands ※a modern industrial strategy§ and a country ※in which work pays, with a higher national living wage and proper rights and protections at work§. Just five paragraphs in, and she＊s using language that would have made Gordon Brown stutter. This is the same Tory prime minister who , talks about ※a §, and investigates the Victorian practices of the gig economy＊s overlords.Something bigger is happening here than the usual Punch v Judy. , a social scientist at the University of York, has put the manifestos for the two main parties from every election since 1945 through a cutting-edge piece of software 每 then asked it to assess how alike they were in concepts and phrases. The result? The Conservative manifesto is closer to Labour＊s than at any point since the second world war.Saying ain＊t doing, of course. To see how little a promise can be worth, just . Yet manifestos remain the clearest summaries of what each party is thinking. And in 2017, May＊s Conservatives are a . No more wishfulness about a ※big society§, nor any bluster about a ※§.May＊s Conservatives worry about fairness, left-behind regions and depressed wages 每 just like Jeremy Corbyn＊s Labour. I can critique her solutions 每 indeed, give me a minute and I shall 每 but that one fact marks a massive break with previous elections.Unlike when David Cameron battled Ed Miliband, the country this pair of party leaders see is more alike than it is different. Both Corbyn and May look out on a workforce that is still poorer than it was in 2008; provinces and nations whose economies are mere feedstock for the spivs up from London; and a public deemed too uncouth for the tailored professionals of Westminster.Let me put it another way: this is Britain＊s first post-crash election. Over the decade since the , one or both parties have pretended that things are basically fine; that the game isn＊t rigged; that a few tweaks will fix the clearly malfunctioning economic model. This election is the first in which both party leaders drop the happy-clappy, catch up with just how bad things have got 每 and, at last, grope around for fixes.The point at which the false beliefs of Westminster bumped into the solid reality of Britain will be , when the de-industrialised and disenfranchised communities of south Wales and the north-east delivered Brexit for the coffee-morning pensioners and bug-eyed libertarians of the south. Of all the contenders for the Tory leadership, May was the first to see that the vote was a register of .It takes decades for an ideology to die 每 but among the power elites of London, you can finally see it happening. What the cultural theorist  每 the decade and a half that began with the fall of the Berlin Wall and ended with the  每 每 and that spanned Tony Blair, , garden decking,  and an ever-growing finance sector 每 is coming to a close.What replaces it is a much harder question. It took a Miliband for Labour to fess up that Britain＊s economic model 每 for which, under Blair and Brown, it was heavily responsible 每 was broken. May is clearly way out in front of her party, and the confusion is daubed all over her manifesto. The Tories want to stand up for the little guy, while cutting taxes for big corporations: to invest more, even while sticking to an austerity programme. May clearly wants to leave open the option to raise taxes, while  每 now.Mayism could mean Brexit Britain renaming itself Poundland 每 cheap goods and cheap workers 每 or it might mean a reversion to some kind of . Her party just doesn＊t know. Were it not for the Tories＊ slim majority, their crisis would be far more exposed. The sofa class don＊t do political economy, more＊s the pity, but if they did they＊d see the contradictions of Conservatism in 2017. The party of capital is now pursuing a policy 每 hard Brexit 每 hated by capital. The political arm of the City is about to rip a hole through the City. All these paradoxes are given almost physical representation on our tellies every night by May herself 每 a populist who doesn＊t actually like people.As a non-believer in New Labour, Corbyn has no such ideological awkwardness, while John McDonnell is one of the few people in the Labour party who didn＊t subcontract out their economic thinking to Brown and Ed Balls. But still, their team admit they have a way to go in rethinking Britain＊s economy 每 and they are having to do so against a famously hostile parliamentary party. The result is Corbyn＊s , which is chiefly remarkable for its unabashed defence of basic social democratic values. It＊s the programme you imagine Brown would like to have delivered 每 if only he hadn＊t been so busy triangulating.But behind the scenes, the party is doing much deeper thinking. I have seen an internal Labour report commissioned by McDonnell. It forms one part of what could be a far more radical programme after Thursday night. Some of the lines in it will give the Daily Mail stories for days 每 such as calling for a overhaul of the BBC trust (which is ※dominated by appointees from the corporate and financial sectors§) and hundreds of millions in public money to be spent on establishing workers co-ops. For the sympathetic reader, however, it contains some of the most imaginative thinking around economic democracy to come out of the party in decades (not saying much, sadly). In that, it sits alongside the  last week about the need for ※industrial patriotism§, and to give public backing to new sectors.All of this is miles away from exit polls and ballot counts in draughty school halls. But the bottom line is this: anyone who hoped 2016, the year of Trump and , was a one-off in political volatility is about to be mightily disappointed. What lies ahead is a long period of flux as both Labour and Tories grapple with what a post-crash Britain should do. It will be rough and bumpy 每 but necessary for their survival. Although it may not look that way from the studio sofas."															
"British households are cutting back as the  effect on the pound continues to raise living costs, according to a clutch of reports that show shops, car dealerships and other consumer-facing businesses coming under pressure last month.Uncertainty about the outcome of Thursday＊s election was also cited as a factor as the reports showed a drop in retail sales, a slowdown for the vast services sector and a fall in new car sales last month.They provided the latest signs that while manufacturers have picked up steam in recent months, those firms that rely on household spending have struggled, boding ill for the UK economy＊s overall prospects this year. Figures from the British Retail Consortium released on Tuesday showed that after an Easter-related bounce in April sales fell again in May, by 0.4% on a like-for-like basis from a year earlier. Taking less volatile figures for the last three months together, food sales rose but non-food sales were down.※After the surge in retail sales last month 每 the byproduct of this year＊s relatively late Easter 每 retailers have been brought back down to earth with a thump,§ said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at the BRC report＊s co-authors KPMG.※The impact of inflationary pressures on the nation＊s purse continues to play out in this month＊s figures, with shoppers evidently spending more on food and drink than on non-food purchases.§The upward push on prices stems largely from the pound＊s sharp fall since last June＊s Brexit vote. That has made imports to the UK more expensive and along with higher oil prices has lifted inflation to its . Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving workers worse off in real terms.A closely watched survey released on Monday suggested those pressures were also hurting the services sector, which a wide range of businesses from banks to hotels. The sector momentum in May and grew at the slowest pace since February, according to the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI report, which gauges sentiment among some 650 firms.Managers cited a drop in demand on the back of squeezed household budgets and delayed decision making among some clients ahead of the election. The report＊s main activity index dropped to 53.8 in May from 55.8 in April. However, that was still well above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.The poll, which excludes government services and retail but still covers half of the overall services sector, is used by investors and policymakers to help predict GDP growth. The compilers said that taken together with their relatively strong reports from the construction and , the services report still pointed to a rebound in growth for the UK following a, when GDP expanded just 0.2%.※The three PMI surveys are running at levels that are historically consistent with GDP growing at a robust 0.5% rate, albeit with the slowing in May posing some downside risks to the near-term outlook,§ said Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit.The survey suggested cost pressures eased off for services firms last month and they continued to hire new workers amid cautious optimism. However, many economists expect the UK will struggle to match its 2016 performance when it defied predictions of a post-referendum downturn and was instead one of the fastest-growing advanced economies in the world.Figures from the car industry added to signs of consumer caution. The number of new cars registered in May fell by 8.5% year on year to 186,265, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. It was the second month in a row that sales were down after a record March when there was a rush for new cars before tax changes on vehicle emissions.The SMMT suggested the looming election was prompting customers to hold off from buying new cars but that the market remained strong overall.Barclaycard was less upbeat about the outlook. Its latest figures showed consumer spending growth slowed to 2.8% year on year in May, the weakest for 10 months. The company, which processes nearly half of UK credit and debit card transactions, said shoppers cut their spending on goods such as food and clothes but still found money for experiences, such as cinema trips as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Alien: Covenant were released.Polling of 1,868 people conducted for Barclaycard by YouGov found 53% felt confident about their household finances, down from a high of 70% in March. A similar proportion, 52%, said they were ※feeling the squeeze§ from inflation."															
"Britain＊s trading position with the rest of the world improved markedly in the final three months of 2016, boosting hopes that the pound＊s sharp fall since the  vote can help the economy become less reliant on domestic spending.As sterling＊s fall made UK goods more competitive on overseas markets and boosted exports, there was a significant narrowing in the UK＊s current account deficit, the latest ONS growth figures showed. Economists said the rebalancing towards more exports would offset some but not all of the slowdown in consumer spending expected this year as incomes are squeezed.※While the drop in the pound is clearly boosting inflation, it is also having some offsetting positive impacts through bringing about a long-awaited rebalancing of the economy towards the external sector,§ said Paul Hollingsworth at the consultancy Capital .The current account deficit reflects Britain＊s trade gap with the rest of the world and the shortfall between money paid out by the UK and money coming in. In the fourth quarter of 2016 it more than halved to ?12bn from ?25.7bn in the third. It equated to 2.4% of GDP, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2011.The ONS said the improvement was mainly due to the sharp narrowing of the trade deficit, or the gap between exports and imports, which in turn was boosted by the fall in the pound since the EU referendum.Before last year＊s referendum on EU membership, the Bank of England had highlighted Britain＊s record current account gap and noted that the . The Bank＊s governor, Mark Carney, expressed concern that in the event of a vote to leave the EU, foreign investors would become more nervous about buying or holding UK assets.Economists said those fears had not gone away with the latest figures and the pound remained vulnerable to news of another widening in the current account.※The stock of overseas＊ investors assets in the UK equates to a massive 547% of annual GDP.  would depreciate further if only a small proportion of these investors took flight,§ said Samuel Tombs at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. ※Signs that the UK is heading for a hard Brexit could be a trigger for such a fire sale.§Howard Archer, an economist at consultancy IHS Markit, said the narrower deficit was welcome news for the UK economy. He too was cautious about the country＊s future trade performance and ability to attract overseas investors but said the current account deficit should be lower over the coming quarters.※Sterling＊s marked weakening appears to be increasingly feeding through to lift exports, helped by current decent global demand. Additionally, the trade deficit should be limited by softening domestic demand limiting imports,§ said Archer."															
"ribute bands are all the rage these days. So it should come as no surprise that the triggering of article 50 was marked by a homage to a band that toured the country in the summer of 2016: Project Fear.Project Fear 2017 has been playing its own versions of Beatles hits: I (Don＊t) Feel Fine, We (Can＊t) Work it Out and, of course, that all-time classic, While My Economy Gently Weeps. It has been quite a trip down memory lane to the days when the band＊s lead vocalist, , was predicting immediate recession in the event of a vote.In the event, consumers carried on spending and the economy carried on growing. That＊s not to say everything is going to be plain sailing in the two years of negotiations that lie ahead. Nor is it to deny that Britain has some deep structural problems that badly need fixing.But it does mean treating with caution predictions that Britain will end up 每 as  每 on Desolation Row. That was the argument when Britain rightly declined to join the single currency in 2003 and it proved to be spectacularly wrong. It is not inevitable that the UK will suffer damage from Brexit. If the right decisions are made, the economy can flourish. This will be made easier if there is a free trade deal between the UK and the EU 27, but access to the single market is actually less important than making the right calls domestically. The idea that  guarantees economic disaster is based on two assumptions, both questionable.Assumption number one is that Britain is leaving an EU that is doing well. That might have been true when the UK joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, but it is not the case today. Europe has taken longer to recover from the financial crisis than any other part of the developed world; four of its countries have needed emergency bailouts; one of its founder members, Italy, has seen living standards stagnate for two decades. Two European countries at either end of the continent suffered worst from the financial crisis: Iceland, which is not part of the euro, saw its banks go bust  than that endured by the US in the Great Depression and is still on financial life support.The single currency, which has amplified the impact of the financial crisis for many member countries, is part of the story. But so is a lack of economic dynamism. Consider the companies that have emerged from nowhere to have a big impact since the single market came into being in 1993: Google, Facebook, ebay, Amazon, Uber. The common feature is that they are all American. Many of these companies have emerged from US universities, which fill 17 of the top 25 places in the  Britain has five slots, the rest of the EU has none.  has become more sluggish as economic policy has become centralised. Per capita GDP in the original EU6 states gradually converged on American levels in the first four decades after the second world war, peaking at 80% in the 1980s. It has since fallen to 65% of US levels.Over the past decade the volume of UK exports to the EU has grown by only 4% due to stagnation in many eurozone markets, while exports to the rest of the world have grown by 42%. On current trends, the share of Britain＊s trade accounted for by the EU will be 30% by 2030, a level last seen in the early 1960s. The latest show that Britain runs a deficit with the EU, but a surplus with the rest of the world.The second assumption is that membership of the EU is all that stands between the thriving Britain of today and the low-wage tax haven of tomorrow. Actually, Britain is already a low-wage, low-investment, low-productivity economy that happens to be bolted on to a massive financial centre.It would be fatuous to argue that the EU is somehow responsible for the structural defects of British capitalism, because the dominance of finance over industry and the reluctance to invest in new plant and skills has been a feature of the economy for at least a century.But at the margin, membership of the EU has accentuated those trends. The economic geography of the single market involves an international division of labour so that countries concentrate on what they do best. Germany is best at precision engineering; Britain is best at finance and so has acted as the merchant banker for the rest of the EU. That has made London extremely rich, but widened the gap between the capital and the rest of the country. It is no accident that London was so strongly for remain in the referendum, but its economy has more in common with the crescent of prosperity running through northern Italy, eastern France, the Low Countries and the western L?nder of Germany than it does with the rest of the UK.Similarly, free movement of labour has allowed employers to meet extra demand by taking on more staff at the minimum wage or just above, rather than by investing. That helps explain why employment is at record levels, but productivity has been feeble.The cry from employers now is that curbs on migration will push up their costs and lead to consumers paying higher prices. Actually, consumers are already paying through the taxes that fund the in-work benefits which subsidise poverty wages.There is an argument that says the UK currently has the best of both worlds: it is inside the single market, yet outside the single currency. Up to a point that＊s true, but it ignores the fact that the recovery since the financial crash is built on unsound foundations. The feelgood factor is the result of ingesting large doses of monetary happy pills; ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing. Mainland Europe is just as addicted to the drugs.In their different ways, both Britain and the eurozone are zombie economies: Britain because the economy runs on worryingly high levels of debt; the eurozone because there is no political appetite for the further integration that might make the single currency work.The big challenge for the UK government is not negotiating a free trade deal to replicate as far as possible the access granted by the single market; it is to remedy long-running defects so that the economy is more competitive and sustainable. Trade does not lead to innovation and investment; rather innovation and investment lead to trade.Does the UK need Brexit to have a modern industrial strategy, to devolve power or boost public investment? In theory, no. In practice, change comes only during periods of upheaval, when it＊s clear the status quo is no longer working. Historically, it is crises that force governments, businesses and individuals out of their comfort zone. Brexit is just such a crisis 每 for both Britain and the eurozone. It would be a crying shame to let it go to waste. This article was amended on 4 April 2017. An earlier version said Iceland ※is not ＃ part of the single market§. To clarify: as a member of the European Economic Area, Iceland does participate in the EU＊s single market, with exemptions for agriculture and fisheries policies."															
"t could have been worse. That was Wall Street＊s initial response to the to raise borrowing costs in the world＊s biggest economy by a quarter of a point.For once, the market reaction was entirely rational. The increase in interest rates was expected and it would have been a real surprise had  and her colleagues at the US central bank decided against a move.Indeed, the  reported last week had led to speculation that the Fed might just be planning a half-point move. That would certainly have led to a sell-off in the stock market since it would have been a tacit admission that Yellen and the Fed were playing catch up.Some economists think that is indeed the case 每 and that just as in the early 2000s the Fed is doing too little too late. They point to inflation running at 2.7% and an unemployment rate of 4.7% as evidence that price pressures have already started to build.But the economic news has not all been upbeat. US growth was modest in the final three months of 2016 and the early evidence is that the first quarter of 2017 was no great shakes either. And while the unemployment rate is low, that is partly because millions of Americans have left the labour market altogether after giving up hope of ever finding work. The US is certainly not firing on all cylinders despite almost a decade of ultra-low interest rates and large dollops of money creation via the Fed＊s quantitative easing programme.Hence the key messages from Yellen on Wednesday were that rates will continue to rise but at a cautious pace. She stressed that the central bank expected the economy to grow at a rate that would warrant gradual increases in interest rates. That will be taken as a hint that there will be two more rises during the course of 2017.The Fed has now raised interest rates three times in the past 15 months. Clearly, the period of ultra-low borrowing costs is at an end. The so-called normalisation of rates is under way.But it is also obvious that the Fed sees the new normal as being quite different to the old normal. In the mid-2000s, Alan Greenspan＊s Fed raised interest rates 17 times in gradual quarter-point jumps until they topped 5%. This time, the Fed sees rates peaking at a much lower level 每 about 3% 每 and as things stand they won＊t get there until 2019.In the short term, the steady increase in  will support an already strong dollar. One of the ironies of QE is that it was supposed to encourage investors to buy risky assets yet has led instead to a flight into safe havens such as the greenback and US bonds.The growing differential between US rates and those in Japan, the eurozone and the UK will lead to further support for the dollar unless the American economy shows signs of weakness.With  and spending increases, Wall Street currently sees that as unlikely. But Yellen is aware that Greenspan＊s softly-softly approach to raising rates ended with an almighty financial crisis and the biggest US slump since the 1930s. She is keen to avoid a repeat performance."															
"t＊s the missing chapter: a key to understanding the politics of the past half century. To read Nancy MacLean＊s new book, : The Deep History of the Radical Right＊s Stealth Plan for America, is to see what was previously invisible.The history professor＊s work on the subject began by accident. In 2013 she stumbled across a deserted clapboard house on the campus of George Mason University in Virginia. It was stuffed with the unsorted archives of a man who had died that year whose name is probably unfamiliar to you: James McGill Buchanan. She says the first thing she picked up was a stack of confidential letters concerning millions of dollars transferred to the university by the billionaire .Her discoveries in that house of horrors reveal how Buchanan, in collaboration with business tycoons and the institutes they founded, developed a hidden programme for suppressing democracy on behalf of the very rich. The programme is now reshaping politics, and not just in the US.Buchanan was strongly influenced by both the , and the property supremacism of John C Calhoun, who argued in the first half of the 19th century that freedom consists of the absolute right to use your property (including your slaves) however you may wish; any institution that impinges on this right is an agent of oppression, exploiting men of property on behalf of the undeserving masses.James Buchanan brought these influences together to create what he called . He argued that a society could not be considered free unless every citizen has the right to veto its decisions. What he meant by this was that no one should be taxed against their will. But the rich were being exploited by people who use their votes to demand money that others have earned, through involuntary taxes to support public spending and welfare. Allowing workers to form trade unions and imposing graduated income taxes were forms of ※differential or discriminatory legislation§ against the owners of capital.Any clash between ※freedom§ (allowing the rich to do as they wish) and democracy should be resolved in favour of freedom. In his book , he noted that ※despotism may be the only organisational alternative to the political structure that we observe.§ Despotism in defence of freedom.His prescription was a ※constitutional revolution§: creating irrevocable restraints to limit democratic choice. Sponsored throughout his working life by wealthy foundations, billionaires and corporations, he developed a theoretical account of what this constitutional revolution would look like, and a strategy for implementing it.He explained how attempts to desegregate schooling in the American south could be frustrated by setting up a network of state-sponsored private schools. It was he who first proposed privatising universities, and imposing full tuition fees on students: his original purpose was to crush student activism. He urged privatisation of social security and many other functions of the state. He sought to break the links between people and government, and demolish trust in public institutions. He aimed, in short, to save capitalism from democracy.In 1980, he was able to put the programme into action. He was invited to , where he helped the Pinochet dictatorship write a new constitution, which, partly through the clever devices Buchanan proposed, has proved impossible to reverse entirely. Amid the torture and killings, he advised the government to extend programmes of privatisation, austerity, monetary restraint, deregulation and the destruction of trade unions: a package that helped trigger economic collapse in 1982.None of this troubled the Swedish Academy, which through his devotee at Stockholm University Assar Lindbeck in 1986 awarded James Buchanan the . It is one of several decisions that have turned this prize toxic.But his power really began to be felt when Koch, currently the seventh richest man in the US, decided that Buchanan held the key to the transformation he sought. Koch saw even such ideologues as Milton Friedman and Alan Greenspan as ※sellouts§, as they sought to improve the efficiency of government . But Buchanan took it all the way.MacLean says that Charles Koch poured millions into Buchanan＊s work at George Mason University, whose law and economics departments look as much like corporate-funded thinktanks as they do academic faculties. He employed the economist to select the revolutionary ※cadre§ that would implement his programme (Murray Rothbard, at the Cato Institute that Koch founded, had urged the billionaire to study Lenin＊s techniques and apply them to the libertarian cause). Between them, they began to develop a programme for changing the rules.The papers Nancy MacLean discovered show that Buchanan saw stealth as crucial. He told his collaborators that ※conspiratorial secrecy is at all times essential§. Instead of revealing their ultimate destination, they would proceed by incremental steps. For example, in seeking to destroy the social security system, they would claim to be saving it, arguing that it would fail without a series of radical ※reforms§. (The same argument is used by those attacking the NHS). Gradually they would build a ※counter-intelligentsia§, allied to a ※vast network of political power§ that would become the new establishment.that Koch and other billionaires have sponsored, through their transformation of the Republican party, and the hundreds of millions they have poured into state congressional and judicial races, through the mass colonisation of Trump＊s administration  and lethally effective campaigns against everything from public health to action on climate change, it would be fair to say that Buchanan＊s vision is maturing in the US.But not just there. Reading this book felt like a demisting of the window through which I see British politics.  highlighted by the Grenfell Tower disaster, the destruction of state architecture through austerity, the budgeting rules, the dismantling of public services, tuition fees and the control of schools: all these measures follow Buchanan＊s programme to the letter. I wonder how many people are aware that David Cameron＊s  stands in a tradition designed to hamper racial desegregation in the American south.In one respect, Buchanan was right: there is an inherent conflict between what he called ※economic freedom§ and political liberty. Complete freedom for billionaires means poverty, insecurity, pollution and collapsing public services for everyone else. Because we will not vote for this, it can be delivered only through deception and authoritarian control. The choice we face is between unfettered capitalism and democracy. You cannot have both.Buchanan＊s programme is a prescription for totalitarian capitalism. And his disciples have only begun to implement it. But at least, thanks to MacLean＊s discoveries, we can now apprehend the agenda. One of the first rules of politics is, know your enemy. We＊re getting there."															
" love physics. Brick by brick, you can build new theories from established ones and know that they will apply not just on Earth but throughout the entire universe. The upsides are incredible: I worked on the  of plasmas (the stuff stars are made of) for nuclear fusion. If nuclear fusion succeeds in its objectives, it could mean the end of our reliance on fossil fuels, the end of climate change, and energy security for at least millions of years. The experiments in fusion push the limits of nature. Every time Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory＊s Ignition Facility in California fires its fusion laser, the world＊s most energetic, material is heated from 18 degrees above absolute zero to hotter than the centre of the sun in just a few nano-seconds. The work was as exciting and intellectually rewarding as you might expect.But recently I decided to abandon the rules that govern nature for the rules that govern people and markets: economics. Why would I do such a thing? Scientists are among the most trusted groups in society. Economists meanwhile ＃ well , as shown in polls by YouGov, for example. Worse still, economics is frequently confused with finance, banking, the short-term ups and downs of the stock market, or just a desire to make as much money as possible. Even  seemed to blame economists for the financial crisis. Respect for economics as a profession is very low, and  have been woeful compared with science communication. The first reason I thought about changing subject is that all is not well in science research. Precarious short-term contracts  even for researchers with as much as 10 years＊ experience. Higher Education Statistics Agency () data show that 34% of all existing jobs in higher education are temporary and a  from 2010 found that as few as 3.5% of those obtaining PhDs go on to get permanent positions at universities. Even prestigious short-term positions such as junior research fellowships look increasingly like extravagantly titled post-docs with little chance of progression. None of this encourages researchers to stay in science. And although the UK has very  for a G8 country, this isn＊t a UK problem: it＊s , too. Even if it weren＊t, opportunities in other countries can be difficult to take up in practice if you have a partner or family. For my colleagues and I this meant very difficult choices. Much as I loved physics, it just couldn＊t commit.Meanwhile, I was starting to develop feelings for economics. Rather than the rules that govern the behaviour of particles, it is concerned with the rules that govern the behaviour of people; in many ways a much more complex problem. I began to learn that, just as working as a physicist had taught me to see the world in a revelatory new way through the lens of the laws of nature, so economics could reveal a new vista: one in which the conduct of people is explained by their incentives. Economics can tell us how to make everyone better off, for instance , how to change incentive structures to get  and, less importantly but just as interestingly,  All of this means that economics can do a huge amount of good in improving people＊s lives. We usually point to science, technology, engineering and medicine as the drivers of what is good about the modern world, but I think economics has a role to play that is every bit as important: while the laws of the natural world are fixed, social laws are not, and economists can shape policy to best serve the interests of humanity. And while the lack of trust in economists is troubling, I see it as an exciting challenge rather than a reason to steer clear of the subject.So, on 5October 2015, I stood in front of the Bank of England on my first day of becoming a researcher in economics, ready to switch particles for people. The Bank of England was expressly created in 1694 ※to promote the publick Good and Benefit of our People§. Working at a central bank means that the policymakers who can steer the course of the economy are just down the hallway, and are eager to put the best research into practical use for the public good. The kinds of questions occupying central banks right now are some of the big questions of the age: How does the interconnected and global economy work? How can we design economic systems to be more robust and to deliver better outcomes for everyone? How might the  affect jobs, or ?These are also truly unprecedented times for macroeconomics. While the financial crisis is over, my generation is likely to bear the scars of ,  and  for the rest of our lives. The post-crisis period has been distinctly unusual: interest rates are the lowest they have ever been in recorded history, the UK has seen the most sustained drop in real wage growth since the 1800s, and UK productivity growth over the last decade .These facts matter. A lot. As Nobel memorial prizewinner Paul Krugman quipped, ※productivity isn＊t everything but in the long run it is almost everything§. Robust economic growth may not sound as sexy as hitting things with giant lasers but higher GDP tends to mean that we can afford more research, healthcare, welfare and education, that more people are able to find gainful employment, and that firms are better able to invest and innovate.Just as I hoped economics would be good for a scientist, so I think scientists can be good for economics. While historically economics has been insular, with , and a  in research papers, change is afoot. Macroeconomics＊ most highly   have been calling for new perspectives since the financial crisis. Some macroeconomists naively called the period before the great financial crisis the ※great moderation§, a term with echoes of the complacency of scientists at the end of the 19th century who thought they had reached ※the end of physics§. Just as quantum mechanics brought down classical mechanics and started a revolution, the great financial crisis has led to a re-appraisal of some of the core assumptions of macroeconomics.With this reappraisal has come the willingness to adopt techniques, ideas, and even people from other subjects. In my team at the Bank of England I work with a neuroscientist, a linguist, physicists, mathematicians, econometricians, data scientists, computer scientists and, yes, even economists. Subjects such as network science, psychology, , evolutionary theory,  (a field that can trace its origins back to plasma physics) and computer science are being incorporated into the macroeconomic mainstream. Some of this interest in outside topics existed well before the crisis, but the crisis has acted like a catalyst, speeding up the adoption of new ideas. Just as inter-disciplinary approaches have borne great fruit in the natural sciences, so I believe economics will benefit from being more collaborative. There＊s even been progress on . An exciting twist is that there is more economic data available than ever before. Macroeconomic theories have always been impossible to test in controlled experiments but more data mean that theories can more easily be tested and refined by natural experiments: not only are there more scientists in macroeconomics, there＊s  too.We live in interesting times shaped as never before by the complex set of dependent trades, relationships and incentives that we call the global economy. Research in economics can help us to understand it. Moreover, being in a central bank means that important research finds its way directly to policymakers. All of which means it＊s a great time to be doing economics research, and a great time to be doing it in a central bank. So I＊m sorry, physics: I still love you and always will, but I＊m happy that I left you for economics."															
"eremy Corbyn has rightly said that Labour＊s position on Brexit is to focus on a deal that . We are all united behind that goal. For us that means . A country can be a member of the single market without being a member of the EU and we must be clear 每 ※access§ to the European single market is both different and inferior to ※membership§ of the single market. Why? Because if we leave the single market, whatever the level of access is negotiated, working people across Britain will be worse off and revenue to the exchequer will plummet 每 revenue the next Labour government will need to bring an end to years of damaging Tory austerity.The single market is not a simple free trade zone. It is, uniquely, a framework of rules that protects people from the worst excesses of globalisation and unfettered capitalism, in addition to easing trade across the continent. If we have mere access to the single market, we are talking about leaving this framework of rules and achieving mere reductions in tariffs for trade with the .If Britain stays in the single market, we will continue to benefit from EU laws and court judgments that outlaw discrimination in the workplace; deliver vital rights to workers on holiday pay, maternity and paternity leave, the right to join a union, and much more; protect our natural environment from pollution; and keep workers safe through stringent health and safety requirements. Large multinational companies work across borders to maximise their profits to often reduce these protections; the next Labour government, as a member of the single market, can work with other European countries to resist this and advance social justice. If we leave the single market, and ask for mere ※access§, we will be compromised in achieving these goals.This is why so many people in the Labour movement are supporting British membership of the single market after Brexit. Frances O＊Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, has said that ※if we leave the single market, . It＊d be bad for jobs, for work rights and for our living standards.§ The USDAW trade union has warned that leaving the single market ※§.And who is leading the charge to junk our membership of the single market? A motley crew of hard-right, pro-Brexit Tories. Michael Gove. Boris Johnson. . Iain Duncan Smith. Priti Patel. Theresa May wants us out because her government is totally dominated by its obsession with leaving the single market. They want us to leave precisely because they want to roll back the social protections delivered by single market membership. Redwood authored a plan to cut regulation in Britain by 25%. Patel went one further, calling on the  每 those rules that protect working people 每 to be ※halved§. We should not be providing political cover to hard-right Tories who stand diametrically opposed to Labour values.The argument for leaving the single market is often focused around the need to end the free movement of people. However, we argue, and many experts agree, that changes to our immigration system can be made while keeping us inside it. Within the European treaties, free movement is not unconditional 每 at the moment we can require EU citizens to leave if they have no job or a prospect of a job three months after their arrival. Restrictions on free movement are explicitly allowed for reasons of ※public policy, public security or public health§. Liechtenstein, which is outside the EU but in the single market, perfectly legally imposes quotas on EU migrants. French president Emmanuel Macron＊s chief adviser has floated the idea of a  between Britain and the EU that would allow us to restrict free movement.Another reason often cited for not remaining a member of the single market is that the state aid rules that apply in it stop governments from pursuing active industrial strategies to support their industries. But these have not stopped the likes of Germany having a national investment bank or France and the Netherlands supporting their industries through government procurement spend.Ultimately, leaving the single market will make it much harder for a Labour government to end these years of . The economic damage it would cause would reduce the tax take, meaning less money could be spent on public services. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has forecast that leaving the single market for a free trade agreement could cause a , extending austerity even further.To win next time, Labour must provide a strong opposition to the Tories, stand up for the values of our voters, and continue to fight for the interests of all 每 not least  who have the most to lose from an extreme Tory Brexit and who voted for the first time in 2017 for Labour, thinking we would stop the Tories in their tracks. This has to mean fighting unambiguously for membership of the single market. At the very least we should strongly oppose May＊s decision to take membership off the table in these negotiations. An ambitious and confident alternative government 每 with Corbyn at the helm 每 should not throw in the towel as May has done, but could seek membership with reforms on immigration and the other matters we seek.

"Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) workers are much more likely than white workers to be in insecure jobs such as zero-hours contracts, according to the Trades Union Congress.The TUC is urging policymakers and employers to tackle bias and racism in the workplace after its  found one in every 13 BAME workers is in temporary or zero-hours work, compared with one in 20 white workers.Its analysis of the 3.1 million BAME employees in the UK, showed that nearly a quarter of a million were in temporary jobs or on zero-hours contracts that do not guarantee workers a minimum number of hours in any given week.Black workers in particular faced insecurity at work, and were more than twice as likely as white workers to be in temporary and zero-hours work, the research found. One in eight black workers were employed on that basis, compared with one in 20 white workers.※Black, Asian and ethnic minority workers are being forced into low-paid, insecure work. And it＊s getting worse,§ said TUC general secretary Frances O＊Grady.※This problem isn＊t simply going to disappear. Dealing with insecure work has to be top of the list for the next government. And we need a real national strategy to confront racism in the labour market.§The report builds on previous research by the TUC that found BAME workers were also  with fewer hours of employment than they would like and that  than their white peers.The latest report highlights a sharp rise in the number of black workers, and black women in particular, on temporary contracts over recent years. Between 2011 and 2016 the number of black workers on temporary contracts jumped 58% 每 more than seven times the 8% increase for white workers. The number of black women on temporary contracts soared 82% in that time, compared with a 37% increase for black men.The TUC is calling on the next government to ban mandatory zero-hours contracts so that guaranteed hours are offered to all workers. That call chimes with  to ban all  and put a halt to unpaid internships if it wins next week＊s snap general election.The trade union group is also calling for rules that force employers to publish ethnic monitoring reports on recruitment, pay and employment type. That push for more transparency echoes a key recommendation in a , published earlier this year, that highlighted a number of factors holding back BAME workers, including recruitment processes and management bias.The report＊s author, the businesswoman Ruby McGregor-Smith, called on employers to come clean about their lack of diversity by publishing a breakdown of their workforce by race and pay band. She urged ministers to enforce such reporting by law if employers do not comply."															
"Britain＊s manufacturers stepped up production and hiring last month to keep pace with strong demand from home and abroad.The closely watched poll of factory sentiment came in just ahead of City economists＊ expectations and suggested firms were shrugging off any uncertainty created by the general election. However, the responses from about 600 companies were collected between 12 and 25 May 每 before opinion polls  in the Conservatives＊ lead.There were still signs that the Brexit blow to the pound was ramping up manufacturers＊ costs in May, but the pace of price rises eased off recent highs. There was also further evidence that the pound＊s weakness was helping exports by making UK goods cheaper for overseas buyers.The headline factory activity index on the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI edged down to 56.7 in May from April＊s three-year high of 57.3. A reading above 50 signals expansion; below signals contraction. The  (pdf) briefly fell below that watermark after last June＊s EU referendum but has now been in growth territory for 10 months.※The strong PMI numbers suggest the manufacturing sector has gained growth momentum in the second quarter after the sluggish start of the year,§ said Rob Dobson, a senior economist at survey compiler IHS Markit. ※The ongoing strength of the domestic market remains the main driver of the upturn. Growth of new export business played a lesser role in comparison, with the trend in foreign demand continuing to improve only in fits and starts, despite the assistance of a historically weak sterling exchange rate.§The survey＊s forward-looking measures suggested that the manufacturing sector could maintain its relatively solid pace of expansion. Growth of new orders, backlogs of work and business optimism were all strong. Against that backdrop, manufacturers took on new workers at the fastest pace since mid-2014.The upbeat survey will provide some support to those commentators who believe a strong manufacturing sector can offset some of the economic pain from a consumer spending slowdown this year. Higher prices and slow wage growth have eroded household budgets, denting the main driving force for UK GDP growth. The consumer squeeze was a key factor in the . Survey data has suggested the second quarter got off to a stronger start but economists warn that uncertainty stemming from Brexit negotiations could derail any upswing. They also advise against overplaying the importance of any strength in the manufacturing sector given it only makes up a 10th of the economy."															
"China＊s credit rating has been downgraded by Moody＊s for the first time in almost 30 years over fears that slowing growth and rising debts will weaken the world＊s second largest economy.The agency lowered China＊s sovereign rating by one notch to A1 from Aa3, putting it in the same category as countries such as Japan and Israel. The outlook was raised to stable from negative. Moody＊s said the downgrade reflected its expectations that ※China＊s financial strength will erode somewhat over the coming years, with economy-wide debt continuing to rise as potential growth slows§.The last time Moody＊s cut China＊s credit rating was 1989, the same year as . The new move frustrated Beijing, where the finance ministry accused Moody＊s of overestimating the risks facing the economy.※Moody＊s views that China＊s non-financial debt will rise rapidly and the government would continue to maintain growth via stimulus measures are exaggerating difficulties facing the , and underestimating the Chinese government＊s ability to deepen supply-side structural reform and appropriately expand aggregate demand,§ the ministry said in a statement.The downgrade is likely to increase 每 if only modestly 每 the cost of borrowing for Beijing and Chinese state-owned organisations, and it remains within the investment grade rating range. The negative view initially weighed on Asian markets, commodities and China＊s currency on Wednesday.Moody＊s said Beijing＊s planned economic reforms would not avert a significant rise in debt: ※While ongoing progress on reforms is likely to transform the economy and financial system over time, it is not likely to prevent a further material rise in economy-wide debt, and the consequent increase in contingent liabilities for the government.§Government stimulus has been a key driver of growth in recent years, but it has also led to a sharp rise in credit and debt levels. Moody＊s expects growth to slow to about 5% over the next five years. Last year the Chinese economy grew  每 the weakest since 1990. Moody＊s also cut the rating of 26 state-owned enterprises by one notch, shortly after the main sovereign downgrade. The list included China National Petroleum Corporation,  Three Gorges Corporation, Guangzhou Metro Group, and Dongfeng Motor Corporation.China＊s finance ministry insisted the country＊s GDP would continue to grow at medium to high levels ※ and that will provide fundamental support to fend off local government debt risks§. The ministry added: ※China＊s government debt risks will not change dramatically in the period of 2018-20 from 2016.§Moody＊s expects government debt to rise to 40% of GDP by the end of 2018, and to 45% by 2020.Luc Froehlich, head of investment directing for Asian fixed income at Fidelity International, said China was facing a number of issues: ※The downgrade is yet another sign of the challenges faced by China, which is juggling rising leverage, declining economic growth rates and ongoing structural reforms.※Despite these mounting pressures, we are confident that China＊s central bank and its regulators are firmly in control of the situation.§Chang Liu, China economist at Capital , said activity in the country was likely to slow further in the forthcoming quarters as officials continue their efforts to rein in credit risks. He said a weaker property market could also start to weigh on the wider economy.※The property sector may also become a headwind to growth in the coming quarters. There are already signs that property sales are cooling due to recently imposed curbs on residential purchases. If this continues, developers may begin to slow the pace of construction.§ The sovereign downgrade brought Moody＊s into line with Fitch＊s rating; Standard & Poor＊s rates China one notch above its two rival agencies."															
"The  governor, Mark Carney, has fallen victim to an online prankster who got him to joke about one of his predecessor＊s supposed drinking habits.Carney was caught out by the same hoaxer who .The prankster, who uses the Twitter handle , emailed Carney from a Hotmail account pretending to be Anthony Habgood, the chair of the Bank＊s court. In the exchange, posted on Twitter, Carney appears initially to fall for the prank and tentatively accepts an invitation to a ※soiree§ in June. But the governor is quick to dismiss his correspondent＊s message as ※not appropriate at all§ when the impostor claims to have engaged some ※rather dashing bar ladies§ for the evening.The Bank declined to comment on the exchange. It has insisted in the past that it takes online security very seriously but the prank on the nation＊s top central banker may raise questions about whether more precautions should be taken.While the prankster got a swift slapdown for his sexist comments, he did manage to draw the Canadian banker on the topic of morning drinking.According to the exchange as posted on Twitter, the prankster used anthonyhabgood@hotmail.com and wrote under the subject line ※I see reports of Jane Austen in the papers today§:Carney replied: The comment was probably a reference to  by the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, in which he told the Observer that at lunches, the former Bank of England governor Eddie George ※would start with a martini, never eat vegetables and incredibly good clarets would appear from the vaults§.Carney appeared to exercise more caution than Staley, who responded to emails sent by a ※John McFarlane§, the name of the  chairman.The email exchange showed Staley being told ※you owe me a large Scotch§ after the bank＊s difficult annual general meeting,  over the latter＊s attempts to unmask a whistleblower who had been making allegations about the previous conduct of a new recruit in the US.In the exchange, Staley appeared to lavish praise on McFarlane, who was instrumental in hiring the American chief executive in 2015."															
" will vow to ※fix the broken housing market§ and arrest a decline in social housing by announcing a scheme designed to boost the number of new council homes for rent.In an attempt by the prime minister to reach out to low-paid workers, she will announce a plan to offer funds, loans and new powers to councils and housing associations to help them build a new generation of social housing for renters. She will also pledge to give the new tenants the option to buy the property after 10 to 15 years.It is a recognition that there are currently 300,000 fewer homes for social rent than 20 years ago. However, there will be questions over the extent of real funding for the project.※A Conservative government led by me will not duck the big challenges we face as a nation and there are few issues that are greater than the need for good-quality, affordable housing,§ May will say on Sunday. ※Whether you rent or buy, everyone needs the security of a place to call home but too many ordinary working families are stuck on council waiting lists, facing unaffordable rents and struggling to save for that first deposit.§Meanwhile, Labour plans to bring in a ※§ on financial transactions if it wins the general election, in a move to raise billions more for public services.The party believes the measure will generate an extra ?4.7bn a year to pay for a huge increase in state spending, bringing an unequivocal end to the government＊s austerity measures.It also announced that it will undertake the biggest crackdown on tax avoidance ※in the country＊s history§ and force anyone earning more than ?1m a year to publish their tax returns.It marks the next phase of the party＊s decision to ask businesses to pay more towards funding the state. , the shadow chancellor, has already announced plans to increase corporation tax from the current rate of 19% to 26% by the end of the decade.It comes as a new Opinium poll for the  shows that the Tories still enjoy a commanding lead, despite seeing their advantage shrink by one point for the second week in a row.

"heis a stark reminder of the havoc a Tory government will create over the next five years if it wins a sizable majority next month.From the holes it identifies in NHS funding to the need for an investment bank to promote infrastructure spending, the document has something to say about many of the areas crying out for government intervention. It works as a handy guide to those parts of the economy, the welfare system and public services the next administration must address 每 or risk the foundations being further undermined.Listening to Tory MPs in parliament over the past year, you would think that the person behind the wheel of a white van was all they cared about. Ministers seemed to be of the same mind. They treated stories about nurses quitting their jobs, mental health services on their knees and schools making cutbacks as side issues when there were roads to repair, motorways to widen and broadband cables to install.The white van driver was at the heart of the Brexit vote and that person＊s needs came first. Figures from the car industry illustrate how driving has become a national obsession to rival shopping. Three years of double-digit sales growth have put a shiny new piece of metal on wheels outside millions of homes. (Set aside for a minute the fact that these cars were mostly acquired with credit plans and are not really bought at all, but leased. Just accept that it is one of the major developments in consumer spending in recent years.)And what do people with average or above-average incomes need if driving and shopping are their main pastime? Why, the most expensive car their credit rating will buy, a bigger road to drive it on and, when the shopping is online, superfast broadband.This is not to say that the private sphere of cars and broadband connections are irrelevant when considering the future of the economy. It＊s just that the public sphere of hospitals, social care, further education, youth services, hostels for the homeless and libraries matters too, but is a second- or third-rank consideration.Almost every spare penny in Philip Hammond＊s spring budget went on infrastructure spending 每 that infrastructure being almost exclusively roads. Hammond, a former transport minister, also kept fuel duty on hold to keep his audience of drivers sweet.In too many instances,  lazily offers as its remedy more cash for civil servants to spend. Not to take the economy back to the 1970s 每 that criticism is unfair 每 but back to the early noughties, paid for by higher taxes.However much the extra spending is justified or demanded by the people affected, Labour has failed to understand 每 or deliberately forgets 每 that there is no appetite among mainstream voters for governments of any colour to spend vast sums on their behalf. More specifically, what capacity, experience or qualifications does Labour＊s senior team have for spending such vast sums wisely? That is the supplementary question people ask, and the answer is none on all three counts.Mainstream voters also don＊t want to be taxed at a higher rate. McDonnell says that for the vast majority, taxes will remain the same, which is true: his new income tax threshold would start at ?80,000 and VAT will be frozen.But an income of ?80,000 is a level that many people can aspire to, even if their income is lower now. And charging an extra 5p in the pound to this group is punishing.Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and those behind the New Labour project in the 1990s understood the mood of the public and its reluctance to commission the rebuilding of the country＊s infrastructure without people who looked and acted like structural engineers on board.For all the missteps Blair made in subsequent years, he understood that elections were not about laying out economic programmes and waiting for everyone to realise what good sense they made. New Labour officials worked tirelessly to convince hundreds of niche audiences 每 from the youth club to the rotary club 每 that it was not only justified in its analysis, but capable of implementing a programme of reforms.There may be some who believe it is worth spending billions of pounds renationalising Royal Mail and taking university finances back under state control. But you need to spend years convincing people that the government is a better custodian of these assets.And why would a sensible government bother when public services are crumbling and renters on low incomes are having to borrow money to pay their rent?Labour says it will commission more affordable homes than the Tories. But who can say they will be built to a higher standard than the cheap and flimsy flats currently thrown up by the private sector? Can a denuded local authority planning department guarantee that? No it can＊t.The wish-list manifesto contains many sensible measures, but there is so much work needed to put flesh on those bones. No one is going to say to themselves that if Jeremy Corbyn＊s Labour says extra funding for this or that would be money well spent, it will be. It takes more work than that."															
" tool that measures fear may sound like something out of a horror movie, but the Vix index has nothing to do with the entertainment industry. Also known as the fear index, the Vix is a key indicator of stock market health.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, to give it its proper name, tracks the extent to which traders are optimistic or fearful about the future performance of US stocks 每 and last week it fell to 9.77, its lowest level since 1993.The good news is this means traders have few fears about any imminent events affecting the performance of shares. The bad news is the last time it fell below 10 每 to 9.80 每 was in 2007, just months before the financial crisis.What has left financial experts perplexed is the eerie calm that prevails in the markets 每 at a time when many parts of the world are being unsettled by geopolitical events.Incendiary executive orders from US president Donald Trump, uncertainty over Brexit, and nuclear tests in North Korea have all caused widespread concern.The Vix is based on data collected by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 index 每 of America＊s largest publicly quoted companies 每 over a 30-day period. It is considered an international barometer, although there is an equivalent in Europe called Vstoxx.Volatility is calculated by analysing options contracts 每 which are like insurance policies taken out by share traders. For example, a trader who has bought a stock for ?100 but is worried it could fall in price might take out a put option. This is a contract granting the trader the right 每 but not the obligation 每 to sell the stock at a set price, say ?90, on or before a specific date, no matter how far the price has fallen.This brings a degree of certainty over the price a trade will bring, but requires the investor to pay a premium in return. A trader confident that a price will rise may take out the opposite sort of option 每 a call 每 betting that the market will move higher.Sometimes called the market＊s ※fear gauge§, the Vix is frequently interpreted as a measure of anxiety levels among investors, based on the levels of insurance 每 by way of put options and call options 每 they feel they need to purchase.It is computed as a blended measure of the prices of put and call options, and gives an indication of how much option-traders expect the market to move in the near future.The index has in the past ranged from lows of about eight to highs of 80 or so. Anything higher than 30 is considered high, and below 15 low. It has fallen below 10 in only three periods: now, in 2007 and in 1993.The Vix has been published on a real-time basis since 1993 as an indicator of the health of the markets. More recently it has been possible to speculate on the index itself, gambling on it rising or falling.Experts say that, rather than a reaction to bluster and to events that may never happen, it is a measure of what option-traders think might happen in the markets over the subsequent 30 days.The low figure shows traders do not seem that panicked. While there is a lot going on in the news, not a lot is actually affecting the market as yet.Hannah Randall, a spokeswoman for CBOE, says: ※It＊s important to know that the Vix is not a gauge of the news per se. One of the roles of the market is to ascribe value to new information, and anticipate how that information may then affect asset prices.※So with that in mind, it＊s not unreasonable that dramatic headlines don＊t necessarily equal a high Vix. Right now, even with news flow moving as fast as it is, the Vix suggests the market remains fairly sure of its 30-day outlook.§This still does not explain the counter-intuitive view taken by traders faced with a wall of worrying news.Tim Edwards, a senior director at S&P Dow Jones Indices, explains that a lot of the big fears worrying the markets have been taken off the table.※First there were very aggressive expectations for the US earnings season, but firms seem to have made decent profits,§ he says.※Then the markets were worried about the Dutch and French elections, amid concern that populism was going to run rife in Europe. The reasonable results were a relief all round. And the traditional summer bunfight over Greek debt looks like it is not going to happen.§Edwards also says that the environment in the US has changed. ※Policies like quantitative easing affected all firms by moving everyone in one direction or the other, but in the aftermath of the US election some sectors are doing well and some badly.§"															
"he bad news is that another economic crisis could strike within two years. The good 每 or better 每 news is that such a shock is not nailed on. It＊s a 50% chance. But the developed world is approaching a T-junction. One road leads to higher growth and a more inclusive form of capitalism while the other turns towards recession, instability and turmoil.The speaker is Mohamed El-Erian, one of the biggest names in financial markets, who advised President Obama. Born in New York to Egyptian parents, he spent 14 years at Pimco, the world＊s biggest bond fund manager. Six of those years were as chief executive before he quit, citing the need to have a different perspective on life and spend more time with his family. His daughter, when she was 13, handed him a 22-item list of key moments in her life he had missed.He was educated in the UK, at Cambridge and Oxford universities, and began his career at the International Monetary Fund. These days he is chief economic adviser to Allianz, the German financial powerhouse that owns Pimco and where the former UK prime minister Gordon Brown is another adviser.One of El-Erian＊s signals of trouble in the system is . Others include the fact that 30% of the world＊s government debt traded with negative yields at one point last year 每 meaning investors were paying to own an asset from which they could only lose money. Then there was the election of President Trump, plus a French election in which both establishment parties were blown away in the first round. No one would have predicted all those events 18 months ago.Why aren＊t the financial markets in uproar at the loss of so many supposed certainties? On Brexit, El-Erian says politicians were smart to slow down the process, extend the timetable and avoid being forced into decisions by markets. It allowed investors to stop obsessing over ※hard§ and ※soft§ forms of exit and think in terms of ※slow Brexit§.※We are still now in the pause phase, including up to and after your general election. Thereafter markets will slowly, and I stress slowly, start to get impatient and start to pay more attention than they have before now to negotiating stances on both sides.§Similarly with Trump: the protectionist part of his campaign, which was meant to be scary for markets, looks less frightening today. In fact, says El-Erian, protectionism was never a ※day one§ problem: ※He inherited a spaghetti bowl of trade agreements.§ At the end of the day, El-Erian expects concessions that allow the president to say trade is ※still free but fairer§.What was the day one issue? ※The legacy of too many years of low growth and insufficiently inclusive growth: that the breakage to the system accumulates over time and it＊s very hard to predict tipping points.§This is the nub of El-Erian＊s analysis of why the developed world is approaching a fork in the road. The inequality generated by the current low-growth climate has three elements: inequality of wealth, income and opportunity. The last of the three 每 manifested in high youth unemployment in many eurozone countries, for example 每 is the most explosive element.※The minute you to start talking about the inequality of opportunity, you fuel the politics of anger. The politics of anger have a tendency to produce improbable results. The major risk is that we don＊t know how much we＊ve strained the underlying system. But what we do know is we are getting signals that suggest it＊s under enormous stress, which means the probability of either a policy mistake or market accident goes up.§The head-scratching part is that financial markets are not reflecting these worries. Measures of volatility stand at their lowest since 1983. ※If you talk to investors, they will tell you how worried they are about geopolitics,§ says El-Erian. ※And, if you ask them how they are positioned, they will tell you ＆almost maximum risk＊.§There is an explanation of sorts, he thinks. Investors have been conditioned to think central banks can suppress volatility. They also see that the low growth appears stable. And they think the piles of cash on some companies＊ balance sheets will come their way in the form of dividends and share buybacks. ※You need a major shakeout to change that mindset,§ he says.But there is ※unambiguous evidence§ that these ※artificial§ conditions can＊t last, he says. After the financial crisis of 2008-09, there was a small chance to engineer a new growth model in which governments would come through with infrastructure spending and reforms.Instead, the sense of urgency went away. Central banks stemmed the crisis, but the rest of the package didn＊t follow. We are now seeing the limits of relying on central banks, El-Erian believes.※The politics have become too disruptive, the finance has become too disruptive. Depending on where you view the political process, we＊re either going to take a turn towards higher, more inclusive growth that will reduce political polarisation and the politics of anger. Or, alternatively, low growth becomes recession, artificial financial stability becomes unsettling volatility, and the politics get a lot messier.§How do we take the high, benign road? El-Erian has a four-point plan.First, ※we need to get back to investing in things that promote economic growth, infrastructure, a more pro-growth tax system for the US, serious labour retooling ... If you＊re in , youth employment is an issue you＊ve really got to think about very seriously.§Second, countries that can afford to do so must ※exploit the fiscal space,§ meaning borrowing to invest or cutting taxes. He puts the US and Germany unambiguously in that category ※and to a certain extent the UK§.Third, pockets of extreme indebtedness must be addressed, a lesson he learned working with the IMF in Latin America in the 1980s. ※When you have a debt overhang, it＊s like a black cloud,§ he argues. ※It sucks oxygen out of the system. You cannot grow of it: whether it＊s Greece or student loans in the US, you need to deal with debt overhangs.§ The process of debt forgiveness is hard, he concedes, because some people are unfairly rewarded 每 ※but the alternatives are worse.§Fourth, regional and global governance needs repair. He compares the eurozone to a stool with one-and-a-half legs instead of four. The complete leg is monetary union, the half is banking union. The missing legs are fiscal integration, meaning a common budget, and political harmonisation. No wonder the eurozone is unstable, he says: ※You can do three legs, you can＊t do one and half.§To return to El-Erian＊s core T-junction analogy, none of the required manoeuvres sound easy. ※You don＊t need a big bang,§ he replies. ※If you want to take the good turn you have to see some progress on some of these elements. If you don＊t, then we take the other turn.§ He ascribes equal probabilities 每 ※it＊s a political judgment.§What＊s an investor to do? El-Erian says his own approach, which he admits is hard for the average person to copy, is framed like a bar-bell. At one end, he＊s invested in high-risk startups where you don＊t need all to succeed. At the other, he＊s in cash and cash-like investments. In the middle, he＊ll invest in public markets only tactically.The bottom line: ※I＊m risk off.§"															
"t was an audacious plan for an unloved bit of Manchester. A ?25m arts centre to be built on a derelict plot that had not felt a cultural pulse since the closure, 15 years earlier, of the legendary . It would be called , formed by the merger of two proud but financially imperilled institutions 每 the  cinema and gallery, and the  每 and would, its backers hoped, revive a forgotten corner on the city＊s southern edge.※There was confidence from the city leadership that it would work, but a lot of my peers and colleagues in the arts were saying to me, ＆Who＊s going to go there?＊§ says Sheena Wrigley, executive director of Home, which includes two theatres, five cinema screens, an art gallery and a restaurant and bar. ※It was a very unprepossessing area with a big car park and one large office block. It wasn＊t visible or on a main thoroughfare.§Programming would swim far from the mainstream, too. The centre opened in May 2015 with a challenging play about two thwarted lovers trying to survive a recession in a city like Manchester. This week the cinema is showing , a subversive Shakespearean noir, and , an erotic Korean period thriller. The free gallery includes an exhibition of vibrant art from post-Franco Spain and an exploration of the role of .Wrigley admits to having been nervous when she and her team set an ambitious target of 550,000 visits for the first year. ※But we smashed that in six months and did just shy of a million,§ she says. And they kept coming: as Home approaches its second birthday, it is about to welcome its two-millionth visitor. ※It＊s fascinating to me that you can open a venue of this kind and size and it can find its audience straight away in a difficult period,§ Wrigley adds. ※Of course, I would like to say it＊s all about good artistic choices, but something else is going on.§Wrigley is right. A series of studies is revealing strange things about our spending habits. They call it the ※experience economy§, which gives it the sense of a grand theory. And there is science behind it, but it＊s also very simple: regardless of political uncertainty, austerity and inflation, we are spending more on doing stuff, choosing instead to cut back on buying stuff.The latest figures come from Barclaycard, which processes about half of all Britain＊s credit and debit card transactions. Figures for April show a 20% increase in spending in pubs compared with the same month last year. Spending in restaurants went up 16%, while theatres and cinemas enjoyed a 13% rise. Meanwhile, department stores suffered a 1% drop, vehicle sales were down 11% and spending on household appliances fell by 2.5%.Barclaycard says the trend began to emerge about a year ago. And retailers are feeling it. In March, Simon Wolfson, chief executive of Next, blamed the clothing chain＊s  on the move from buying things to doing things. More startlingly, Ikea, the world＊s biggest furniture retailer, told a Guardian conference last year that consumption of many goods had reached a limit. ※If we look on a global basis, in the west ,§ said Steve Howard, the company＊s head of sustainability.It would be easy to assume that contemporary influences are at work here. The world is a bit of a depressing place right now, so let＊s have a nice evening out rather than buy a sixth pair of shoes. But theories abound of a much broader shift. And Ikea is arguably late in calling ※peak stuff§. In 2011, Chris Goodall, a British environment writer, used government data called the UK＊s  to track consumption of stuff, and  and everything that followed. He believed we had .And as we consume less, we are doing more. ※If you think about the 20th century, the big dominant value system was materialism, the belief that if we had more stuff we＊d be happier,§ says James Wallman, a trend forecaster and the author of , in which he charts the move from possessions to experience. ※The big change to what I call experientialism is more about finding happiness and status in experiences instead.§The happiness bit perhaps stands to reason, but studies suggest the anticipation of an experience has a crucial, additional value. In a 2014 paper called , psychologists Amit Kumar, Thomas Gilovich and Matthew Killingsworth showed how people report being mostly frustrated before the planned purchase of a thing, but mostly happy before they bought an experience. That feeling lingers longer, too, tied up as it is with memory. ※We call it hedonic adaptation,§ says Colin Strong, the head of behavioural science at Ipsos, the market research group. ※And the hedonic payoff of experiences is much greater.§We are also less likely to compare experiential purchases than we are products, in a way that means we are all happy with what we buy, regardless of what we can afford. ※So if you have a Nissan and your neighbour has a Porsche, there＊s no doubt who has the better car, and if you ask the Nissan driver to swap, they will,§ Wallman says. ※But if you ask people who went on holiday to the Seychelles or south Wales, it＊s clear who had the fancier holiday, but surveys show the person who went to Wales won＊t swap because they had an equally good time.§If the experience economy has a levelling effect, research also suggests that part of the reason for its rise is its greater potential as a status booster.This supports the idea, questioned by some (and not backed up by Barclaycard, which does not account for age), that younger people 每 namely millennials 每 are driving the consumer shift. ※It used to be that our car, or handbag or wallet showed our status. Now we post Facebook pictures from a chairlift in Chamonix or the latest music festival,§ Wallman says. ※Social media is supporting this change. Posting pictures of what you just bought is gauche; posting pictures of something you＊re doing is fine.§ Strong also thinks the ※slightly impoverished nature of millennials§ is compelling them to get out more.At Home, however, Wrigley says that while students and young professionals are pouring through the doors, the venue＊s appeal is crossing generations. ※A lot of arts organisations peak at around age 45, but ours is very flat,§ she says. ※We have a lot of older explorers 每 people who worked in professional services or local government, say, and are looking for a quality experience. And baby boomers who have been able to stop work in their 60s and have pensions to spend.§Restaurants are capitalising fast, opening at a record pace in cities all over the country. In London, restaurant guide Harden＊s counted 200 new openings in its 2017 edition. Cities including Manchester and Glasgow have seen similar or even greater booms. Russell Norman, founder of , is about to open his 12th outpost in Bristol, having taken the chain to Brighton, Exeter and Leeds since it landed in London in 2008. The restaurants are as busy as ever, but Norman has been surprised by booming recent demand for gift vouchers and private party requests. ※When we opened in Exeter we expected it to be an all-day offering, but we＊re really finding that people are coming for special occasions, as an event, or an experience,§ he says.Businesses already dealing in experiences are enhancing them to benefit from the shifting economy. Theatres would once never have considered putting a restaurant downstairs, but now you＊d be mad not to. The restaurant at Home in Manchester is taking ?2m a year, Wrigley says, almost double what was expected. At the , where ticket sales are up 12% on last year, the restaurant is booming, too. ※We don＊t have to be just excellent theatre-makers, but excellent business people,§ says Rachel Tackley, the executive director at the venue in West Sussex. ※It＊s about creating theatres as destinations where you can spend more than two and a half hours watching the show.§Marston＊s, one of the country＊s largest pub groups, with more than 1,500 pubs, is racing to meet demand for more than pints of beer. Traditionally ※people use pubs, but go to restaurants,§ says the Wolverhampton-based firm＊s managing director, Pete Dalzell. The group has shed hundreds of ※wet-led§ traditional pubs in recent years, and opened more than 150 pub-restaurants since 2009. Last year revenues were up 7% to ?905.8m, and the average pub profit has doubled since 2012. ※We＊re opening up a new range of offers for consumers who are choosing to spend disposable income doing something with friends rather than buying something,§ Dalzell adds.If the writing is on the wall for the purveyors of things, their response is to make the walls more appealing. ※We＊re seeing a fundamental shift in pretty much all categories to retain being much more experiential,§ Strong says. Increasingly, this means using technology to create the feeling of a meaningful relationship between brand and buyer, online and offline. High-street clothing stores are deploying shop assistants with tablet computers on which they can call up your previous purchases and tastes based on online browsing. And with smart marketing, even the dullest essentials are being sold as part of a brand experience. In the US, one Los Angeles TV producer, frustrated by the high price of razor blades, launched an online subscription service in 2012. Dollar Shave Club began posting blades for as little as $3 a month and, with the help of a viral ad campaign, earned 12,000 orders in the first two days. Deliveries come with an irreverent magazine. Customers felt part of something, free from the cut-throat corporate economics of brands such as Gillette, which is owned by Procter & Gamble. It soon had more than three million subscribers, and in 2016 Unilever, P&G＊s big rival,  每 and its members 每 for $1bn. ※People have got that we can move from a transactional relationship mediated by big-scale advertising to much more of a one-to-one relationship with the customer,§ Strong adds.That relationship is strong in Manchester, where Wrigley says she has been surprised by the scale of Home＊s success. The venue is already being overshadowed by rising office and apartment towers, and a new hotel. It has become the beating heart of a neighbourhood that was a wasteland only four years ago. ※That＊s the magic of experientialism,§ Wallman says. ※It＊s not anti-consumerist or anti-capitalist. Money is still going into the economy and creating jobs 每 we＊re just spending it on experiences.§ Wallman, 43, has been following the trend for more than 10 years, and has seen it transform his own life. At his wife＊s prompting, he has just acquired a second pair of trousers, but is holding out with his one pair of shoes and five holey T-shirts. ※I＊d rather do things,§ he says. ※I took the kids to the Natural History Museum on Sunday. We went camping recently, I go climbing, play football. And it makes us happier.§"															
"rom the outset, the motto of Emmanuel Macron was ※rassemblement§ (coming together): he aimed to unite a divided nation. Political divisions, he claimed, : the left/right divide was perpetuated by parties whose sole objective was to beat their rivals to power. Beneath theatrical politics, there must be a population with common, liberal aspirations, who felt constrained by regulation and especially labour laws, crushed by taxation, burdened by the state. By creating a new, grassroots movement, Macron would gather the energies dormant in civil society, transcend political divides and effect no less than a ※revolution§ ().No doubt, many in the professional classes and the media enthusiastically embraced the great liberal dream of a passionately moderate society. Ever since the bourgeoisie rose to prominence at the end of the 18th century, it has aspired to being perceived as the bearer of universal values. Once again, this aspiration has been thwarted.Even against the much-vilified , Macron took the presidency with the weakest mandate ever for a Fifth Republic president, and will preside over a society more divided than ever.Twenty million people voted for Macron; 10 million for Le Pen (4 million more than in the first round); and a staggering . That less than half of the electorate felt compelled to form a ※republican front§ against the Front National tells us how profoundly antagonistic they are to the new man in charge. Yet Macron promised, , that his policies would reduce the tensions that his campaign failed to defuse. I believe he is sincere.Macron is a complex political figure. At meetings, he resorts to every populist trick, emphasising his persona and biography, resorting to slogans and light shows. Yet last Friday, he gave a  to Mediapart in which he was articulate, precise and refreshingly candid. He also sketched a philosophy of history that explains why he behaves so differently in different contexts. According to Macron, liberal democracies have emerged out of the progressive enrichment of the bourgeoisie who, unfortunately, have lost sight of their responsibilities. He therefore inscribes his defence of economic liberty within the context of a broader ※cultural revolution§ (his words) which would regenerate the middle class and enable it to fulfil its historical role as the pre-eminent class with responsibilities towards the others. In this view of history, there is no place for social struggles or trade unions, and no role for the working class. It therefore makes sense that when addressing them via televised meetings, Macron resorts to infantilising advertising tricks, but when addressing the middle class on Mediapart, he is at his convincing best, eager to explain how entrepreneurs and professionals should exploit the opportunities he will open for them to create chances for others.Unfortunately, I do not think they will.As my  makes clear, I am a supporter of . Yet I was an academic before becoming an activist and I appreciate candid, articulate people, so I am willing to give credit where credit is due: Macron does intend to tinker with the workings of the market to make its impact on the most vulnerable less brutal. Yet his policies will not bear the fruits he himself expects. Macron＊s faith in the bourgeoisie fails to take into account the systemic pressures it is itself under: under an unbridled capitalist regime, profit-making is not fuelled only by greed, but also by economic necessity. Even with the best will in the world, the bourgeoisie cannot channel capital towards such urgent, but unprofitable, issues as the environmental crisis. They cannot afford to raise wages or reconstruct devastated civil services in the context of globalised competition. They will have to take advantage of deregulation to further cut wages and increase working hours. And they will not be able to muster the charisma to convince the masses to sacrifice their own wellbeing on the altar of competitiveness.The tragedy of Macron is that he is a highly articulate upholder of an illusion that has been dispelled time and time again since the subprime crisis. That the defence of an economic system that has exerted such centrifugal pressure on society as to nearly dissolve it can still pass as ※pragmatic§ is truly staggering, and shows that what goes by the name ※pragmatism§ has become the most deeply entrenched of ideologies.The only pragmatic approach to the woes of  (and beyond) is to boldly reinvent the common good by completely changing the terms of the problem: first, the environment. Second, the jobs needed to tackle the environmental crisis. Third, the economic system that would enable the funding of these jobs (spoiler alert: it is not neoliberalism).Fourth, the construction of international relations compatible with this economic system (second spoiler alert: the EU as it stands is not such a construct). Only by reasoning thus 每 in the correct order of priorities 每 can one instil the kind of hope that motivates people to rise beyond divisions. This hope is what caused the surprise of the French presidential election: the rise of . While Macron＊s appeal was to put fresh faces in charge of well-known policies, that of M谷lenchon lay in a programme that dared to offer radical solutions to 21st-century issues: climate change, inequality, and the strengthening of democracy against special interests.Interestingly, while Macron gathered most of his votes from the wealthier sections of society and Le Pen from the poorest, votes for M谷lenchon were equally spread between all socio-economic groups (and he was the favoured candidate of the youth). Can France Insoumise continue its rise now the election is over? The stakes are high 每 enough for an academic who became an activist to fully enter the fray: I will be France Insoumise＊s candidate to the legislative elections for the constituency of French people resident overseas."															
" has received some rare praise for its reform push from Germany＊s finance minister, who has raised hopes that the debt-stricken country will get more bailout funds soon.Wolfgang Sch?uble, who recently said Greece must implement unpopular economic reforms or leave the eurozone, appeared to soften his tone in an interview published over the weekend. He implied that a review into Greece＊s compliance with reform demands was progressing and could pave the way for the release of more bailout funds that are  to help Athens meet debt repayments due in July.※If the Greek government keeps to all the agreements, the eurozone finance ministers could conclude the review on 22 May and soon after that release the next tranche,§ Sch?uble .The German finance minister said: ※The longer it takes, the more it unsettles the markets and businesses.§The interviewers said Sch?uble had praised Greece＊s progress on reforms. He also said that thanks to a tough negotiating stance from Greece＊s creditors, Athens had agreed to reform state pensions in order to fit the economic circumstances. ※That is not easy, I know,§ he said. ※And it wants to improve the tax system so that revenues start rising again from 2020.§ was agreed in August 2015 and the country is anxiously awaiting for a tranche of those funds to be released so that it can avoid a default on debt repayments.

Berlin has said the IMF＊s involvement is crucial if support for Greece is to continue.The IMF has made repeated warnings that Greece＊s debt burden of about 330bn is unsustainable. It has argued that refusing to write off some of the Greek debt burden will crush Greece＊s economic prospects. In contrast, the EU institutions have said that deferring repayment terms 每 rather than waiving payments 每 will allow the Greek economy to grow and pay its dues.Sch?uble＊s words of encouragement follow official figures in April showing that Greece managed to .

"eopolitical tensions, uncertainty about the future of the EU and an increasingly unpredictable US president form the fraught backdrop to this year＊s spring meetings of the  and World Bank this week.The prospect of rising protectionism also looms large for the IMF, a multilateral organisation set up during the second world war to foster cooperation between economies. Its co-host, the , faces similarly daunting challenges to its mission to cut poverty and inequality.As the two bodies prepare to bring together thousands of delegates in Washington, including finance ministers, central bankers and business leaders, we look at five key themes they will discuss.Donald Trump＊s arrival in the White House has sparked worries about a new wave of protectionism among international bodies such as the IMF.Fearing Trump and other populist politicians around the world could further dent already moribund international trade, the fund will undoubtedly use this week＊s meeting to issue fresh warnings around what it sees as the perils of protectionism. The IMF＊s managing director, Christine Lagarde, has said  to an improving global economy. The fund and other bodies are expected to reinforce that message this week, by arguing that rolling back the clock on globalisation would cost jobs and hit living standards.But talking heads in Washington will have to concede that part of Trump＊s electoral success was born out of discontent among many voters who felt harmed by globalisation. There was some admission of that, in the run-up to the meeting, in  from the IMF, the  and the World Trade Organisation. The three multilateral bodies said the opening up of markets had been good for growth but admitted that action was needed to help ※left-behind§ individuals and communities. Ensuring gains from globalisation are better shared out will probably be a key feature of talks, though it remains to be seen how good intentions will translate into action.It is not just in the UK that productivity growth has been poor since the financial crisis. This key gauge of economic efficiency, often measured by output per hour worked, has been stubbornly low in most advanced countries over the past decade. That has repercussions for growth and living standards.On the IMF＊s reckoning, GDP in advanced economies would be about 5% higher today if the pre-crisis trend had continued for growth in ※total-factor productivity§ 每 a broad measure of what goes into production that includes things such as research spending. As Lagarde put it in a recent speech: ※That would be the equivalent of adding another Japan 每 and more 每 to the global economy.§The IMF head wants governments to take urgent action to turn things around by investing in education, cutting red tape and incentivising research and development. At the same time, delegates at the IMF＊s meetings will need to be mindful that solutions such as automation risk widening inequality if those who lose their jobs to robots are not given other opportunities.By contrast to last year＊s spring meetings for the World Bank and IMF, two electoral uncertainties are out the way: the UK＊s referendum on EU membership and the race for the White House in the US. But the political outlook is no more certain than a year ago. The vote for Brexit means the UK and EU face a tortuous two years of negotiations, and Trump has .Added to that is the French presidential election, which is looking  after an apparent surge in support for the leftwing candidate . Voting in the first round takes place on the closing day of the IMF meeting, with wild card M谷lenchon up against independent centrist Emmanuel Macron, far-right leader Marine Le Pen and centre-right candidate Fran?ois Fillon.German elections follow in September when . She faces . Merkel＊s Christian Democrats have also seen their support eroded by the far-right Alternative for Germany.After last year＊s electoral upsets, the central bankers and finance ministers gathering in Washington will be sharing their fears that populism could get another boost in 2017 with consequences for the global economy.The Washington meetings are being held against the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions, just one factor driving an increase in international migration. Growing numbers of people are moving country in search of better lives, compelled by economic, political and security concerns.The IMF and World Bank have previously . Young workers arriving in countries with low unemployment rates such as Germany can fill skills gaps and help ease long-term pressures on the state from an ageing population, for example.But as anti-immigrant sentiment fuels support for populist movements in a number of countries, delegates in Washington will also be keenly aware of the risks if immigrants are not properly integrated into labour markets and if migration continues to rise rapidly.The World Bank＊s president believes more needs to be done in developing countries so their populations do not feel under such pressure to migrate.Before the spring meetings, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim called for an urgent development push as he highlighted how . Failure to meet the resulting aspirations of people in developing countries risked creating the conditions for war, terrorism and increased migration, he warned.The Bank is particularly worried about recent low growth in Africa, and Kim wants  to be used to turn the  into trillions in investment from the private sector.Central bank policy, in particular in the US, and the relative strength of the dollar will be hot topics at the meetings.The US Federal Reserve has  after a long stretch of record low interest rates following the financial crisis. The rate rises can be seen as a vote of confidence in the world＊s biggest economy. But the tightening is not without repercussions for the rest of the world.Poor countries and emerging markets have taken out big loans in recent years from western countries where interest rates have been low.  by a strengthening in the US currency.Still, there may be some respite from the currency effect if Trump ups his recent rhetoric on . The US president, who worries a strong dollar makes his country less competitive, has also renewed his claim that other countries are devaluing their currencies, but . The US Treasury has indicated it is looking to the IMF to keep a close eye on global exchange rate policies. It could push for reassurances from the Fund on this surveillance role during the meetings.Even after the US rate rises, monetary policy in advanced economies remains historically loose. As such, the talking heads in Washington will doubtless make the ."															
"Ask an economist or a technology expert and they will happily tell you that decades of data reliably show .Far fewer of us now work on farms, for example, thanks to super-efficient machines that do the bulk of the work. Such technology has boosted productivity and, with it, living standards. As a result, more people work in leisure industries such as hospitality or hairdressing, serving all those people with higher disposable incomes and more free time. So far so good. And were the pattern to continue, one could envisage the realisation at last of the , perhaps to just 15 hours.The problem with this rose-tinted view of automation, however, is its focus on big averages that take little account of individuals＊ experiences. Sure, the number of  may well be higher than the number lost to technology. But that is little consolation to someone who loses their job in a Midlands car plant to a robot and discovers most of the new openings are far afield in the coffee bars and hotels of London.Nor do studies of what has gone before allow for the fact that the pace of technological change will probably be quicker in the future. In other words, evolutions that took place over previous decades may well have been gradual enough for most people to find new ways of making a living, with varying degrees of difficulty. But faster and more widespread technological changes in the future are unlikely to be so easy to adapt to.For governments, this imposes a pressing need to step in and ensure the .

If the government fails to act, the result could all too easily be a spike in unemployment and poverty in places with the lowest skilled workers 每 a very high price to pay for a bit of average productivity growth."

"British households ran down their savings to a record low at the end of 2016, raising fears that the UK is on course for a fresh consumer debt crisis in the wake of the Brexit vote.The saving ratio 每 which estimates the amount of money households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income 每 fell sharply in the fourth quarter last year to 3.3% from 5.3% in the third.It was the lowest since records began in 1963, according to the  (ONS), and suggested that people are increasingly dipping into their savings to maintain spending at a time when prices are rising. A fall in disposable incomes over the fourth quarter also raised concerns that people will increasingly rely on debt-fuelled spending as a squeeze in living standards takes hold.※Today＊s figures should set alarm bells ringing. The last thing our economy needs right now is another consumer debt crisis,§ said the TUC general secretary, Frances O＊Grady. ※But with wage growth stalling and prices rising, many households are having to rely on credit cards and loans to get through the month. People raiding their piggy banks and borrowing more than they can afford is what helped drive the last financial crash.§, underpinned by an acceleration in credit card borrowing, was one of the main threats to the UK banking system. Real household disposable income, which adjusts for inflation, shrank by 0.4% compared with the previous three months, the steepest drop in nearly three years.UK economic growth since the financial crisis has been heavily reliant on consumer spending. The ONS confirmed that the wider UK economy grew by 0.7% between October and December, but economists said a weaker consumer backdrop could hinder growth in the coming months. Growth in 2016 was unrevised at 1.8% as the ONS updated its estimates.Martin Beck, a senior economic adviser to forecasting group the EY Item Club, said the falls in savings and disposable income were ※worrying signs§ for the health of household finances, not least because inflation is expected to climb higher.※Given that this pre-dates the worst of the inflationary pressures, it provides further evidence that 2017 is likely to be a very tough year for the consumer, with little or no scope to offset the headwinds from higher inflation by borrowing more,§ Beck said., the highest rate for more than three years. Inflation is expected to rise further to about 3% in the coming months as the sharp fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum increasingly feeds through to higher shop prices.Rachael Griffin, a financial planning expert at fund manager Old Mutual Wealth, said the figures were a ※wake-up call§ for people who were prioritising short-term spending over financial security.※A worrying number of households do not have any sort of cash savings or insurance to protect against financial difficulty if life throws unexpected challenges at them. Building up a cash buffer to cover at least three months of essential spending is a sensible first step,§ she said.The saving ratio rose sharply in the aftermath of the financial crisis but has been falling since the second half of 2015 as stronger growth in consumer spending has outweighed the rate of growth in household disposable income. The ONS said the sharp drop in the fourth quarter was partly due to technical reasons, including changes in pension fund investments. Pension companies have moved significant amounts of their investments out of high-yield shares into lower-yielding government bonds, reducing the income earned by households from pension funds.But the statistics office also said there had been a noticeable deterioration in people＊s perception of the general economic backdrop and their own financial position.Commenting on the latest estimate of fourth quarter growth, the head of GDP at the ONS, Darren Morgan, said: ※Growth in the final quarter remained unrevised at 0.7%, with buoyant contributions from the retail and wholesale sectors in the run-up to Christmas. Services dropped slightly in January with weak performances from hotels and the motor trade. However, the long-term picture is still one of robust growth.§"															
"n 2013, the  that looked at the automation of work, assessing the likelihood that robots and other technologies would replace humans. It concluded that of the 702 job categories examined, 47% were susceptible to automation within the next 20 years. The report completely upended our ideas about the future of work.Now, a new report by the  (NBER) in the United States is set to be an even bigger wake-up call. Written by economists Daron Acemoglu (MIT) and Pascual Restrepo (Boston University), it not only adds support to the Oxford Martin conclusions, it actually suggests the jobs are already lost and unlikely to come back.It contends that in the US between 1990 and 2007, the addition of each robot into manufacturing industries resulted in the loss, on average, of 6.2 human jobs. It also suggests automation depressed wages by between a quarter and a half of one per cent. ※Using this approach,§ the report says, ※we estimate large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages across commuting zones.§There is another important insight: these jobs losses and lower wages are likely to have a lasting and devastating effect. Author Daron Acemoglu  that, ※even if overall employment and wages recover, there will be losers in the process, and it＊s going to take a very long time for these communities to recover. The market economy is not going to create the jobs by itself for these workers who are bearing the brunt of the change.§These are game-changing findings, so let me put them into context of the overall debate.There has been a rather unproductive back-and-forth over whether or not robots are going to take our jobs. This dead end approach was something I warned about in my book  when I wrote, ※Let＊s not go down the same route we have with climate change and mindlessly divide ourselves into camps of sceptics and advocates. Let＊s instead  and make the imaginative leap, together, into a workless future that can liberate us all.§Much of the argument has rested on the claim that technology ultimately creates as many jobs as it destroys (an approach that author Calum Chace calls the ※§). Probably the most influential proponent of this argument is MIT economist David Autor. His important paper, , although careful to allow for the fact that past behaviour is not always a great predictor of future outcomes, nonetheless notes that ※journalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor§.As recently as last week, Australian economic commentator, Ross Gittins, ran a similar line in  decrying so-called ※futurologists§ for scaring everyone about job losses. He wrote, ※improving the productivity of a nation＊s labour increases its real income. When that income is spent, jobs are created somewhere in the economy. Technological advance doesn＊t destroy jobs, it ＆displaces＊ them from one part of the economy to another.§This claim, of course, was always as much a guess about the future of work as anything offered by dreaded ※futurologists§, but the point is, the NBER report makes it even more tenuous than it was. In fact, Acemoglu and Restrepo specifically argue there is little evidence of new jobs being created, saying the results ※indicate a very limited set of offsetting employment increases in other industries and occupations§. What lends the NBER report added authority is it doesn＊t rely on modelling to predict what robots are likely to do to jobs in the future, but on hard data to look at what robots are already doing to jobs in the present. The results are so startling that even the authors were surprised, having previously taken .So where does this leave us? Well, we need to keep things in perspective. The future of work is a hugely complex issue, social and political as much as technological, and one new report, however important, hardly settles the matter. Nonetheless, Acemoglu and Restrepo＊s findings do give us a new baseline for our discussions. In so doing,  because if there really are fewer jobs, we are going to need new ways of distributing wealth. The report also challenges the neoliberal tenet that unregulated markets are a surefire way to full employment, and it can reasonably be taken to imply a large role for governments in managing the change that is coming. Additionally, it undermines the persistent claim that technology will create enough jobs in the future because this is what happened in the past.Most importantly, the results suggest politicians and others who carelessly promise ※jobs and growth§ need to stop waffling and start taking seriously the fact that the future of work is going to be a very different beast to the past and present of work. We are likely to face not just different sorts of work, but far fewer jobs. How we respond to this reality will be a huge test for our democracies, and this report is an important contribution to the ongoing debate."															
"his live incarnation of Guardian columnist  about the surge of worldwide global protest comes from the performance-lecture tradition but opens out into something altogether more democratic. It＊s , both personal and deeply political.Staged and filmed at the  over three days, and due to be broadcast on BBC2 later this year, it is another welcome example of how theatre increasingly sees its role as an initiator of debate and a forum to share our lives and experiences. A theatre in which we don＊t just watch, but also actively participate.The show recognises that it privileges Mason＊s voice but offers us one too: as the protesters shouting in Tahrir Square; through our own observations about the world as we see it. The actors 每 Khalid Abdalla, Sirine Saba, Lara Sawalha and , playing a version of himself 每 are not just performers but activists and eyewitnesses. This is a piece of theatre that could run and run, changing all the time as events unfold and the world shifts on its axis.

Is making revolution so exhausting that inevitably people run out of steam? There is an extraordinary piece of film showing the faces of Greeks sitting in the street as news came through that the government had done , which would be coming for its pound of flesh. They are the faces of defeat, each one as crumbled as the Parthenon.

By the go-getters oozing talent and entrepreneurialism that are helping to advance the whole world.Now, we may disagree about the extent to which success deserves to be rewarded 每 the philosophy of the left is that the strongest shoulders should bear the heaviest burden, while the right fears high taxes will blunt enterprise 每 but across the spectrum virtually all agree that wealth is created primarily at the top.So entrenched is this assumption that it＊s even embedded in our language. When economists talk about ※productivity§, what they really mean is the size of your paycheck. And when we use terms like ※§, ※redistribution§ and ※solidarity§, we＊re implicitly subscribing to the view that there are two strata: the makers and the takers, the producers and the couch potatoes, the hardworking citizens 每 and everybody else.In reality, it is precisely the other way around. In reality, it is the waste collectors, the nurses, and the cleaners whose shoulders are supporting the apex of the pyramid. They are the true mechanism of social solidarity. Meanwhile, a growing share of those we hail as ※successful§ and ※innovative§ are earning their wealth at the expense of others. The people getting the biggest handouts are not down around the bottom, but at the very top. Yet their perilous dependence on others goes unseen. Almost no one talks about it. Even for politicians on the left, it＊s a non-issue.To understand why, we need to recognise that there are two ways of making money. The first is what most of us do: work. That means tapping into our knowledge and know-how (our ※human capital§ in economic terms) to create something new, whether that＊s a takeout app, a wedding cake, a stylish updo, or a perfectly poured pint. To work is to create. Ergo, to work is to create new wealth.But there is also a second way to make money. : by leveraging control over something that already exists, such as land, knowledge, or money, to increase your wealth. You produce nothing, yet profit nonetheless. By definition, the rentier makes his living at others＊ expense, using his power to claim economic benefit.For those who know their history, the term ※rentier§ conjures associations with heirs to estates, such as the 19th century＊s large class of useless rentiers, well-described by the . These days, that class is making a comeback. (Ironically, however, conservative politicians adamantly defend the rentier＊s right to lounge around, deeming inheritance tax to be the height of unfairness.) But there are also other ways of rent-seeking. From Wall Street to , from big pharma to the lobby machines in Washington and Westminster, zoom in and you＊ll see rentiers everywhere.There is no longer a sharp dividing line between working and rentiering. In fact, the modern-day rentier often works damn hard. Countless people in the financial sector, for example, apply great ingenuity and effort to amass ※rent§ on their wealth. Even the big innovations of our age 每 businesses like  and Uber 每 are interested mainly in expanding the rentier economy. The problem with most rich people therefore is not that they are coach potatoes. Many a CEO toils 80 hours a week to multiply his allowance. It＊s hardly surprising, then, that they feel wholly entitled to their wealth.It may take quite a mental leap to see our economy as a system that shows solidarity with the rich rather than the poor. So I＊ll start with the clearest illustration of modern freeloaders at the top: bankers. Studies conducted by the  and the  每 not exactly leftist thinktanks 每 have revealed that much of the financial sector has become downright parasitic. How instead of creating wealth, they gobble it up whole.Don＊t get me wrong. Banks can help to gauge risks and get money where it is needed, both of which are vital to a well-functioning economy. But consider this:  of GDP. Based on this equation, if the financial sector only grows, it won＊t equal more wealth, but less. So here＊s the bad news. In the United Kingdom, . In the .In other words, a big part of the modern banking sector is essentially a giant tapeworm gorging on a sick body. It＊s not creating anything new, merely sucking others dry. Bankers have found a hundred and one ways to accomplish this. The basic mechanism, however, is always the same: offer loans like it＊s going out of style, which in turn inflates the price of things like houses and shares, then earn a tidy percentage off those overblown prices (in the form of interest, commissions, brokerage fees, or what have you), and if the shit hits the fan, let Uncle Sam mop it up.The financial innovation concocted by all the math whizzes working in modern banking (instead of at universities or companies that contribute to real prosperity) basically boils down to maximising the total amount of debt. And debt, of course, is a means of earning rent. So for those who believe that pay ought to be proportionate to the value of work, the conclusion we have to draw is that many bankers should be earning a negative salary; a fine, if you will, for destroying more wealth than they create.Bankers are the most obvious class of closet freeloaders, but they are certainly not alone. Many a lawyer and an accountant wields a similar revenue model. . Untold hardworking, academically degreed professionals make a good living at the expense of the populations of other countries. Or take the tide of privatisations over the past three decades, which have been all but a carte blanche for rentiers. One of the richest people in the world, , earned his millions by obtaining a monopoly of the Mexican telecom market and then hiking prices sky high. The same goes for the Russian oligarchs who rose after the , who bought up valuable state-owned assets for song to live off the rent.But here comes the rub. Most rentiers are not as easily identified as the greedy banker or manager. Many are disguised. On the face of it, they look like industrious folks, because for part of the time they really are doing something worthwhile. Precisely that makes us overlook their massive rent-seeking.Take the pharmaceutical industry. Companies like  and  regularly unveil new drugs, yet most real medical breakthroughs are made quietly at government-subsidised labs. Private companies mostly manufacture medications that resemble what we＊ve already got. They get it patented and, with a hefty dose of marketing, a legion of lawyers, and a strong lobby, can live off the profits for years. In other words, the vast revenues of the pharmaceutical industry are the result of a tiny pinch of innovation and fistfuls of rent.Even paragons of modern progress like Apple, Amazon, , Facebook, Uber and Airbnb are woven from the fabric of rentierism. Firstly, because they owe their existence to government discoveries and inventions (every sliver of fundamental technology in the iPhone, from the internet to batteries and from touchscreens to voice recognition, was invented by researchers on the government payroll). And second, because they tie themselves into knots to avoid paying taxes, retaining countless bankers, lawyers, and lobbyists for this very purpose.Even more important, many of these companies function as ※natural monopolies§, operating in a positive feedback loop of increasing growth and value as more and more people contribute free content to their platforms. Companies like this are incredibly difficult to compete with, because as they grow bigger, they only get stronger.Aptly characterising this ※platform capitalism§ in an article, : ※Uber, the world＊s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world＊s most popular media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world＊s largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate.§So what do these companies own? A platform. A platform that lots and lots of people want to use. Why? First and foremost, because they＊re cool and they＊re fun 每 and in that respect, they do offer something of value. However, the main reason why we＊re all happy to hand over free content to Facebook is because all of our friends are on Facebook too, because their friends are on Facebook ＃ because their friends are on Facebook.Most of Mark Zuckerberg＊s income is just rent collected off the millions of picture and video posts that we give away daily for free. And sure, we have fun doing it. But we also have no alternative 每 after all, everybody is on Facebook these days. Zuckerberg has a website that advertisers are clamouring to get onto, and that doesn＊t come cheap. Don＊t be fooled by endearing pilots with free internet in Zambia. Stripped down to essentials, it＊s an ordinary ad agency. In fact, in 2015 Google and Facebook pocketed an astounding  in the US.But don＊t Google and Facebook make anything useful at all? Sure they do. The irony, however, is that their best innovations only make the rentier economy even bigger. They employ scores of programmers to create new algorithms so that we＊ll all click on more and more ads.  just as  and Amazon has overrun the book trade. The bigger such platforms grow the more powerful they become, enabling the lords of these digital feudalities to demand more and more rent.Think back a minute to the definition of a rentier: someone who uses their control over something that already exists in order to increase their own wealth. The feudal lord of medieval times did that by building a tollgate along a road and making everybody who passed by pay. Today＊s tech giants are doing basically the same thing, but transposed to the digital highway. Using technology funded by taxpayers, they build tollgates between you and other people＊s free content and all the while pay almost no tax on their earnings.This is the so-called innovation that has Silicon Valley gurus in raptures: ever bigger platforms that claim ever bigger handouts. So why do we accept this? Why does most of the population work itself to the bone to support these rentiers?I think there are two answers. Firstly, the modern rentier knows to keep a low profile. There was a time when everybody knew who was freeloading. The king, the church, and the aristocrats controlled almost all the land and made peasants pay dearly to farm it. But in the modern economy, making rentierism work is a great deal more complicated. How many people can explain a , or a ? Or the revenue model behind those cute Google Doodles? And don＊t the folks on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley work themselves to the bone, too? Well then, they must be doing something useful, right?Maybe not. The typical workday of Goldman Sachs＊ CEO may be worlds away from that of King Louis XIV, but their revenue models both essentially revolve around obtaining the biggest possible handouts. ※The world＊s most powerful investment bank,§ wrote the journalist , ※is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.§But far from squids and vampires, the average rich freeloader manages to masquerade quite successfully as a decent hard worker. He goes to great lengths to present himself as a ※job creator§ and an ※investor§ who ※earns§ his income by virtue of his high ※productivity§. Most economists, journalists, and politicians from left to right are quite happy to swallow this story. Time and again language is twisted around to cloak funneling and exploitation as creation and generation.However, it would be wrong to think that all this is part of some ingenious conspiracy. Many modern rentiers have convinced even themselves that they are bona fide value creators. When current Goldman Sachs CEO  was asked about the purpose of his job, his straight-faced answer was that he is ※§. The Sun King would have approved.The second thing that keeps rentiers safe is even more insidious. We＊re all wannabe rentiers. They have made millions of people complicit in their revenue model. Consider this: What are our financial sector＊s two biggest cash cows? Answer: the housing market and pensions. Both are markets in which many of us are deeply invested.Recent decades have seen more and more people contract debts to buy a home, and naturally it＊s in their interest if  (read: burst bubble upon bubble). The same goes for pensions. Over the past few decades we＊ve all scrimped and saved up a mountainous pension piggy bank. Now pension funds are under immense pressure to ally with the biggest exploiters in order to ensure they pay out enough to please their investors.The fact of the matter is that feudalism has been democratised. To a lesser or greater extent, we are all depending on handouts. En masse, we have been made complicit in this exploitation by the rentier elite, resulting in a political covenant between the rich rent-seekers and the homeowners and retirees.Don＊t get me wrong, most homeowners and retirees are not benefiting from this situation. On the contrary, the banks are bleeding them far beyond the extent to which they themselves profit from their houses and pensions. Still, it＊s hard to point fingers at a kleptomaniac when you have sticky fingers too.So why is this happening? The answer can be summed up in three little words: Because it can.Rentierism is, in essence, a question of power. That the Sun King Louis XIV was able to exploit millions was purely because he had the biggest army in Europe. It＊s no different for the modern rentier. He＊s got the law, politicians and journalists squarely in his court. That＊s why bankers get fined peanuts for preposterous fraud, while a mother on government assistance gets penalised within an inch of her life if she checks the wrong box.The biggest tragedy of all, however, is that the rentier economy is gobbling up society＊s best and brightest. Where once upon a time Ivy League graduates chose careers in science, public service or education, these days they are more likely to opt for banks, law firms, or trumped up ad agencies like Google and Facebook. When you think about it, it＊s insane. We are forking over billions in taxes to help our brightest minds on and up the corporate ladder so they can learn how to score ever more outrageous handouts.One thing is certain: countries where rentiers gain the upper hand gradually fall into decline. Just look at the Roman Empire. Or Venice in the 15th century. Look at the Dutch Republic in the 18th century. Like a parasite stunts a child＊s growth, so the rentier drains a country of its vitality.What innovation remains in a rentier economy is mostly just concerned with further bolstering that very same economy. This may explain why the big dreams of the 1970s, like flying cars, curing cancer, and colonising Mars, have yet to be realised, while bankers and ad-makers have at their fingertips technologies a thousand times more powerful.Yet it doesn＊t have to be this way. Tollgates can be torn down, financial products can be banned, tax havens dismantled, lobbies tamed, and patents rejected. Higher taxes on the ultra-rich can make rentierism less attractive, precisely because society＊s biggest freeloaders are at the very top of the pyramid. And we can more fairly distribute our earnings on land, oil, and innovation through a system of, say, employee shares, or a .But such a revolution will require a wholly different narrative about the origins of our wealth. It will require ditching the old-fashioned faith in ※solidarity§ with a miserable underclass that deserves to be borne aloft on the market-level salaried shoulders of society＊s strongest. All we need to do is to give real hard-working people what they deserve.And, yes, by that I mean the waste collectors, the nurses, the cleaners 每 theirs are the shoulders that carry us all.

"The US  has sought to head off rising inflation with a third interest rate rise since the 2008 financial crash and the second in three months, taking the base rate from 0.75% to 1%.The central bank set aside concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on consumer spending to confirm analyst projections that it is prepared to increase rates several times this year to keep a lid on inflation as it rises above its 2% target level.The Fed＊s chair, , said a wide range of indicators showed the US economy was in rude health, allowing its interest rate setting committee to push rates back towards historically normal levels. Policymakers voted nine to one to raise rates.Speaking after the decision, Yellen said she had met Donald Trump＊s treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, ※a couple of times§ but had only been ※introduced§ to the president himself. ※I fully expect to have a strong relationship with secretary Mnuchin,§ she said. ※We had good discussions about the economy, about regulatory objectives, the work of the FSOC [Financial Stability Oversight Council] global economic developments, and I look forward to continuing to work with him.§ She said she had had a very brief meeting with Trump ※and appreciated that as well§.Earlier in the day the Department of Commerce said retail sales had inched up by 0.1% in February, and that they had been better than it had previously estimated in January.The Department of Labor said consumer prices were 2.7% higher in February than a year earlier. After excluding the costs of food and energy, inflation was 2.2%. A housing market index from the National Association of Home Builders also surged to its highest level since 2005. US stock markets moved up on the news, rising 90 points in the minutes after the decision, and US crude rose 2%. The increases were modest  that interest rates were on an upward path. Investors were also caught out by Yellen＊s bullish comments in the wake of the announcement and by projections showing that 11 of her 17 policymaking colleagues saw borrowing costs rising another three times in 2017.Dennis de Jong, the managing director of the currency trader UFX.com, said: ※Given the bloating effect Donald Trump＊s presidency has had on US inflation, it would have been more of a surprise had Fed Chair Janet Yellen not announced a rate hike at today＊s Federal Reserve meeting.※Trump＊s grand plans for American infrastructure spending have signalled an about-turn for US economic policy 每 after just one rate increase in ten years, we＊ve now seen two in the space of three months, and plenty more are expected for 2017.※This all spells bad news for US borrowers, who will likely have to foot a larger bill over the coming months. With at least three more hikes on the cards by the end of the year, today＊s news could hit many where it hurts the most 每 the pocket.§Some economists argue that weak wages and productivity growth in the US will limit the Fed＊s rate increases to a handful before reaching a peak at around 2%.Gus Faucher, the deputy chief economist at the stockbroker PNC, said: ※I think the concern, in terms of why the Fed is raising rates now, is that inflation is picking up. The unemployment rate is 4.7% and that＊s putting upward pressure on prices.§He told the Guardian economic forces were acting against a return to interest rate levels of 4-5% seen before the 2008 crash.※We have slower labor force growth because of the ageing of the baby boomers, [and thus] slower productivity growth in terms of output per worker,§ he said. ※That has reduced the potential for long-run growth, it＊s reduced inflationary pressures, and I think rates in the future will be lower than they have been in the past.§Faucher also said further interest rate rises could dent consumer spending, which has come to rely on cheap loans.※I do think eventually that higher interest rates are going to have an impact on rates for car loans, so that may be a problem for automakers. It may be a problem for big-ticket durable items, home appliances, stuff like that.§ There is a ceiling on those effects, though, and Faucher doesn＊t think they will affect home loans. ※There isn＊t much bleed over into mortgage rates; it＊s mostly the short-term borrowers,§ he said.Fed policymakers are known to be concerned that the tax cuts and extra government spending Trump has demanded could overheat the economy and lead to a deep recession. Should that happen, the Fed will want to have substantial interest rates in place. "															
"Fresh evidence of the impact of the post-Brexit depreciation in the value of the pound will be revealed on Tuesday with the release of the latest set of official inflation figures.City analysts believe there will have been a pause in June in the steady increase in the cost of living to 2.9% in the 12 months since the EU referendum, but most believe the respite will prove temporary.And with annual earnings growth at 2%, the release of the latest inflation data from the Office for National Statistics is likely to prompt renewed speculation about a slowdown in consumer demand caused by prices rising faster than wages. was running at 0.6% when the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016 but it has risen subsequently as a result of higher oil prices and dearer imports caused by the 12% decline in the value of the pound over the past 12 months.That has taken the annual inflation rate to its highest level in and close to the level where , the governor of the Bank of England, would be forced to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, explaining why Threadneedle Street had failed to keep the annual increase in the cost of living to within one percentage point of the government＊s 2% target.Consumer spending helped keep the economy expanding strongly in the six months after the  vote, but the growth rate slipped to 0.2% in the first three months of 2017.Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation was likely to peak at 3.2% later in the year even though the July figure would show no change.Tombs said the recent fall in global oil prices would help motorists by reducing the cost of motoring, while smaller increases in air fares, and toys and games in June 2017 than in the same month a year earlier would also dampen inflationary pressure.※Food inflation, however, is continuing to grind higher in response to sterling＊s collapse,§ Tombs said. Victoria Clarke, UK analyst at Investec, said the impact of air fares was likely to shave 0.1 points off the annual inflation rate to 2.8%, but said this did not mark a turning point. ※We actually see inflation climbing a touch further to 3% later this summer and holding around that level until year end.§But Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital , said the squeeze on consumers would be nowhere near as pronounced or as prolonged as it was after sterling＊s last major depreciation in 2008.※With the effects of the lower pound appearing to be fading at the start of the production line, CPI inflation looks to have almost peaked already and we think that it will gradually start to head down towards the 2% target from next year,§ she said. ※Meanwhile, there are reasons to think that nominal wage growth should start to pick up in the quarters ahead, as higher inflation makes it more difficult for employers to award lower wage rises, a gradual pick-up in productivity growth improves firms＊ ability to grant larger pay increases and the past tightening in the labour market leads to at least some strengthening in pay growth.§ "															
"t the foot of this blackened and devastating emblem of austerity, privatisation, and prejudice it was local residents, not the council, who assembled to support the survivors burned out of their homes. Their strength of community, their empathy and their tireless commitment to step in when the state did not, will come as no surprise to anyone who has lived in one of the UK＊s many high-rises, council blocks, or so-called ※sink estates§. Because while many denigrate them as , the reality inside is very different.At a time when many of the millions of people in the UK who live in high-rises and blocks will be looking around their homes with a new sense of fear, it has never been so necessary to celebrate them, and the communities that live within them. I grew up in a block of flats in Bethnal Green, Tower Hamlets, in an area which has over the last 20 years come to echo the stark inequality and class divides of Kensington. When my parents moved in 30 years ago, it was a predominantly Bangladeshi community, poor and left to its own devices. Our flat was a local-council managed ※hard to let flat§ that had suffered smoke damage from a small fire, my dad remembers. ※No one on the housing waiting list wanted the flat; there was the damage, and the fact that 90% of the estate was Bengali 每 it was considered a sink estate.§When I was growing up, the front door was often jammed open by kids who had forgotten their key fobs, there was graffiti in the halls, and the rubbish bins were sometimes set on fire. Drug dealers worked the courtyards beneath the blocks, and still do. From the outside, these blocks could appear to outsiders to be alienating, imposing, isolated. But step inside and the story was very different. Make a home there, or in one of the other close-knit estate communities across the UK, and the view changed. For my parents, the density of communal life intensified when they had a child.※An invitation to help with homework was repaid with ferried dishes of steaming rice and dahl, various tools were lent and returned for DIY, I-just-need-to-pop-out-for-a-minute babysitting swapped for English lessons, simple repairs 每 like fixing a tap, became boxes of mangos. Soon we upgraded to baby birth celebrations, wedding invitations and Eid dinners,§ my dad remembers.None of this is unique to my family, and nor is it a fairytale. It will be familiar to many who have lived in close proximity with others in blocks and high-rises across the UK, where poor housing management 每 lifts breaking, communal stairs left uncleaned 每 does not always, as in JG Ballard＊s , result in the eventual breakdown of the social fabric. Instead, it can engender a fierce camaraderie, community and friendship that cuts across class and ethnic lines. Loretta Lees, professor of human geography at Leicester University, has conducted vast studies of high-rises across . She is quick to dispel the myth that big blocks leave families isolated and unhappy. ※One of the critiques of ＆streets in the sky＊ is that they are not the same as ＆streets on the ground＊ 每 that they don＊t foster the same sense of community. But actually, people meet each other in lifts, foyers, corridors 每 there is exactly the same communality as in a low-rise.§The negativity inherent in the way in which we have viewed these blocks, for decades, has allowed those in power to discount the concerns of residents. People in social housing, many on low incomes, were killed in a horrific fire at that could perhaps have been prevented had they, and their communities, been taken seriously. But if you stereotype as a sink estate the homes of hundreds of people, or allow them to be widely characterised by parts of the press as benefits cheats, scroungers, lowly immigrants and criminals, and their fears and demands can be ignored without consequence. So it seems to have been with Grenfell.These well-worn myths peddled about high-rise living and council blocks form a convenient part of a rampant privatisation agenda that aims to demolish and replace these towers. As the twin spectres of dereliction and privatisation haunt blocks across the UK, given fresh impetus by the politics of austerity, we must defend the high-rise and the council block with vigour. We must be resolute to see them for what, in most cases, they are: thriving communities, symbols of diversity, resilience and empathy. They have a right to be taken seriously, to be made safe, and to be cherished. "															
" is resisting Theresa May＊s demands for an end to austerity amid Treasury concerns that loosening the purse strings will lead to a black hole in the government＊s finances.The chancellor has used discussions with the prime minister since the election to press the case for a cautious approach to the public finances, despite the widespread view among Conservative MPs that seven years of spending cuts and pay restraint handed seats to Jeremy Corbyn＊s  party.Hammond has already  since moving into the Treasury almost a year ago but is opposed to the idea that his planned planned autumn budget should result in far higher borrowing to fund new spending pledges.The pressure to ease up comes just as Hammond can trumpet some progress on cutting the deficit 每 which is the gap between what the government receives in income, such as through taxes, each year and what it spends. For the financial year just ended in March, the deficit was ?48.7bn, down a hefty ?23.4bn from the previous year. That was also ?3bn smaller than forecast at the time of Hammond＊s maiden budget in March.The government＊s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said in March that the deficit was expected to widen again this year to ?55.2bn but then shrink every year over the following four years. The public finances are still expected to be in the red well into the next decade.John Hawksworth, chief economist at consultancy group PwC, said: ※People are certainly fed up with austerity. The political rhetoric is going to change. The question is whether it will be reflected in the hard numbers.§Carl Emmerson, at leading thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said any change of tack was likely to take the form of higher borrowing by the government. ※We could see more borrowing because of the desire to spend a little more than current plans imply, and because of a lack of desire to put up taxes to pay for it,§ he said.Hammond and May must also consider whether the Conservatives should match Labour spending pledges, like , that proved popular with young voters.But some economists point out that more spending will not necessarily translate into a much bigger hole in the public finances. Martin Beck, from the consultancy Oxford , believes increasing borrowing to fund more spending or tax cuts would help the economy grow faster, which in turn could speed up deficit reduction.※There＊s a strong case for doing more fiscal loosening,§ said Beck. ※It could boost demand. It might not be completely self-financing but the idea you wouldn＊t get more activity from more spending and tax cuts is silly and higher activity generates tax revenues.§But Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said it was clear that Hammond took a different view and was unreceptive to the idea of permitting a big increase in the deficit. Bell said one way to pay for spending increases would be to delay some of the more expensive proposed tax cuts 每 raising the personal allowance, increasing the upper rate threshold and reducing corporation tax 每 that the government has lined up for the current parliament. Against this backdrop, some of the pressures on the chancellor include:The praise for the emergency services for the way in which they responded to the Manchester Arena bombing, the Borough Market attacks and the fire last week in Grenfell Tower has made it much tougher for the government to stick to its . If the cap held until its planned end in 2020, , making it harder to recruit and retain staff.?3bn for each percentage point increase in public sector pay.The government has protected the budget for schools but a growing population means that funding per pupil is set to fall in the four years from 2015-16 to 2019-20.  and the education secretary, Justine Greening, will be pressing Hammond to do the same. ?4bn to ensure per pupil funding remains unchanged.George Osborne announced  in his summer 2015 budget as part of his plan to put government finances back into the black by 2020. These included less generous child benefit, a freeze on in-work benefits and restrictions on housing benefit. Some changes have been introduced but most expected savings will occur in the new parliament.?9bn to reverse welfare cuts due to come in during the current parliament. ?2bn: cost of Labour＊s planned social security package.The election meant the government had to shelve a number of revenue-raising measures until after polling day. These would have been passed comfortably in the event of the expected large Tory majority but are now at the mercy of a hung parliament. These include the ※making tax digital§ programme aimed at putting more of the tax system online, restrictions on corporation tax relief and scrapping non-domicile status. ?7.6bn in total: ?4bn from corporation tax; ?2.2bn from making tax digital; ?1.4bn from cracking down on non-doms.One of Labour＊s most popular policies was the  and reinstate maintenance grants, and the Tories might face pressure to match it if they are to secure a younger vote that could be the swing demographic in the next general election. Corbyn said he would fund this move by levying a 45% income tax on those earning more than ?80,000 and 50% tax on those earning more than ?110,000. The Conservatives promised in their manifesto not to raise income tax.?9bnSpending on the NHS has been ring-fenced since 2010, sparing health from the deep cuts that have affected most other Whitehall departments. Even so, the  since the last year of Gordon Brown＊s government 每 just one third of the average annual increase since it was founded in 1948.

"At present there are fears that survivors of the fire will be housed outside the borough, on the . This represents the continuation of a trend whereby local authorities uproot homeless families from their communities and send them to boroughs miles away: by 2015. Those asked to relocate out of borough are generally poorer and black and minority ethnic groups. In the case of the Grenfell Tower, were residents rich, their money would allow them to stay in the borough by renting privately or through insurance. But the local authority housed these residents while ignoring their warnings of the dangers of the building.

"The US  announced it was raising short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday as the central bank continued to unwind the huge economic stimulus plan brought in after the great recession.After a two-day meeting, the Fed raised the target range of the federal funds rate from 1% to 1.25%, the third consecutive quarterly increase. The move follows a record run of jobs growth in the US that has driven the unemployment rate down to its lowest level in 16 years.※Information received since the federal open market committee met in May indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year,§ the Fed said in a statement.The committee signaled that more rises were on the horizon and that it ※expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate§.One member of the Fed＊s committee objected to the rate rise. Neel Kashkari, chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, wanted to maintain the existing target range for the federal funds rate.Kashkari, who has been tipped as a potential successor to the current chair, Janet Yellen, has consistently warned against raising rates, fearing that it might harm the recovery. ※We are still coming up short on our inflation target, and the job market continues to strengthen, suggesting that slack remains,§  after objecting to a rate rise earlier this year.The Fed also put out a statement about its plans to unwind its gigantic bond portfolio, bought as part of its bid to restart the  after the 2007-09 recession.In the wake of that recession, the Fed went on an enormous spending spree, buying bonds in order to keep interest rates down and encourage spending to kickstart the economy. After three rounds of so-called quantitative easing, the Fed acquired $4.5tn worth of bonds, including $1.8tn in mortgage securities.The committee said it planned to ※gradually reduce the Federal Reserve＊s securities holdings§. In a press conference, Yellen said the Fed intended the sale to be a quiet process that her colleague Patrick Harker, the Philadelphia Fed president, joked should be like ※watching paint dry§.The latest move by the Fed shows that the central bank continues to believe that the US economy is strengthening. Economic activity has ※been rising moderately so far this year§, household spending has ※picked up§ and and hiring remains ※solid§, the Fed said.The Fed＊s meeting was the first since  was released. Continued hiring brought the unemployment rate down to a level unseen since 2001 and it was the 80th consecutive month of jobs growth. Hiring has, however, ※moderated§, as the Fed pointed out, and Yellen has expressed concern about the high number of people still in part-time work who are looking for full-time employment.Greg McBride, Bankrate＊s chief financial analyst, said: ※As expected, the Federal Reserve followed through with an interest rate hike 每 the third in the past six months and fourth in the past 18 months.※But this could be the last hike for a while. Until we see a reversal of the recent weakness in economic growth, retail sales and inflation, the Fed will be on the sidelines.§"															
" in Britain have fallen for the third month in a row, for the first time since the height of the financial crisis in 2009.The fall further dragged down the annual growth rate in May, to 2.1%, the lowest in nearly four years, providing further evidence that the housing market is losing steam, .Its closely watched monthly house price index showed that the average price of a home fell by 0.2% between April and May, to ?208,711. This compares with monthly declines of 0.4% in April and 0.3% in March. The annual growth rate of 2.1% is the lowest since June 2013, and compares with 2.6% in April.Robert Gardner, Nationwide＊s chief economist, said: ※It is still early days, but this provides further evidence that the housing market is losing momentum. Moreover, this may be indicative of a wider slowdown in the household sector, though data continues to send mixed signals in this regard.§He noted real incomes were under pressure as inflation had overtaken wage growth, although the number in work continued to rise at a healthy pace and the .The UK＊s other main house price index, from mortgage lender Halifax, is also on a downward trend. , taking the average property price to ?219,649 每 nearly ?3,000 below the peak in December 2016.Gardner dismissed suggestions the slowdown was linked to the general election on 8 June. ※If history is any guide, the slowdown is unlikely to be linked to election-related uncertainty.  trends have not traditionally been impacted around the time of general elections. Rightly or wrongly, for most homebuyers, elections are not foremost in their minds while buying or selling their home.§Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, agreed. ※Prices have been unaffected by previous elections and, unlike in 2015, none of the major parties plans to increase property taxation.§Gardner said it was too early to say whether the slowdown was a blip, a reflection of the squeeze on household budgets or due to mounting affordability pressures in key areas of the country.However,  believes house prices will slow further and household spending is likely to weaken along with the wider economy, as rising inflation further squeezes household budgets. The building society is predicting a small increase in house prices of around 2% this year, as the housing shortage will provide some support for prices.Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington  Finders, said: ※The slowdown is anything but uniform. Properties in some regions are seeing double-digit price reductions, yet at certain price points in the most in-demand areas, gazumping and intense competition between buyers are the order of the day.※If there is one universal it is the chronic shortage of supply. Where there are more buyers than homes for sale, prices will inevitably edge upwards.§"															
"As the election on 8 June nears, the debate has intensified over how much Britain＊s frothy cappuccino-drinking economy can cope without endless dollops of interest-free credit.Financial regulators are worried about it. So are the debt charity workers who pick up the pieces when the debt merry-go-round grinds to a halt. And they should be worried. Many of the biggest, shiniest new cars zipping round UK streets would still be sitting on the garage forecourt  that rival mortgages for their rock-bottom rates.On the high street, shops have in recent years relied more heavily on consumers using their credit cards for big purchases. Back in 2014 these shoppers could avoid paying the 18.9% interest commonly applied to credit card balances and use the two, even three-year interest-free period many card operators allow.As we know from recent experience, when debt bubbles burst, they hit everyone and drag the economy down into recession.  shows that the mania for borrowing last year and the year before has paused somewhat since January. That should be seen as good news. Net mortgage lending is down at levels seen a year ago while unsecured borrowing on credit cards and loans has stabilised at a growth rate of of just over 10% a year.But not everybody at the Bank of England will be content to see consumers putting their credit cards in a drawer. The economists attached to the BoE＊s interest rate-setting committee know the economy runs on debt. To adapt a well-known first world war poster, they know Britain needs borrowers. If a reminder of this basic economic rule was needed, it was made clear earlier this month when the latest UK GDP figures appeared. The relative lack of borrowing in the first three months of the year coincided with a dive in GDP growth from 0.7% in the final quarter of 2016 to 0.2% in the first quarter of this year.The BoE has busted a gut to keep the mortgage market afloat with one scheme after another to subsidise everything from deposits to the lenders themselves. It must have been upsetting to see a fall in approvals for house purchases in April for the third month in a row.Now there are signs that the credit habit is returning as almost zero interest rates work their magic again, Easter＊s spending is out of the way and wage rises are being outpaced by inflation. Analysts say GDP growth in the second quarter will be higher for this very reason. Is that a return of consumer confidence with shoppers shrugging off the election, they ask? Or is it, as the debt charities suspect, cash-strapped consumers rolling over their debts and taking out a bit more credit just to get by?The latest consumer surveys back up the debt charities. Markit＊s household survey revealed Britons are the gloomiest they＊ve been since 2014 about their personal finances. The GfK consumer confidence survey was down in May, according to the seasonally adjusted version. So it could be that extra borrowing is born of distress rather than confidence. And the starting point for extra borrowing on credit cards and loans is already 10% more each year.Of the nation＊s spenders, the Financial Conduct Authority estimates that 3.3 million are in ※persistent credit card debt§, which means they are paying 18.9% interest or more and suffering the consequences. That leaves Britain with a choice between accepting the assurances of regulators that they can manage the UK＊s tottering personal debt mountain or clamping down and risking lacklustre, sluggish growth. It is Bonus Bingo time again. The four top directors at  Industries, an engineering group and turnaround specialist, are to share share a bonus pot of ?160m, paid in shares.

This money might have built some of the companies it owns into world-beating businesses. Instead, take Elster, a maker of smart electricity meters among other industrial components, which was sold in January to US firm Honeywell. The charge to Honeywell was ?3.3bn and two final salary pension schemes in deficit.A clever deal, no doubt. But not the kind of deal that helps UK plc, especially when the pound is low and UK businesses vulnerable to takeover. "															
"t hardly counts as news that the UK is really two economies but here are the hard numbers to demonstrate the point. London, the south-east and the east of England recorded net fiscal surpluses in 2016 每 in order words, tax receipts exceeded public spending on a per-head basis. The rest of the UK was in deficit, .Some differences were substantial. At one end of the scale,  showed a surplus of just over ?3,000 per person 每 the difference between revenues of ?15,756 per head and spending of ?12,686. Northern Ireland had the biggest deficit 每 about ?5,400 per person 每 and Wales was next at ?4,500.Regional differences are to be expected, of course. And, remember, the data doesn＊t seek to reflect factors such as a brain-drain towards the capital, which might affect one＊s view of the extent to which London and south-east can be said to ※subsidise§ the rest of the UK. The most important statistic is that the UK, as a whole, has had a net fiscal deficit every year since 2003.Yet two conclusions seem clear. First, if  presents challenges for London, with its heavy weighting towards financial services, the problem is the rest of the UK＊s too. As matters stand, London and the south-east are the UK＊s cash cow.Second, an independent Scotland would face hard choices. The deficit per head in  was ?2,824 last year, according to the ONS data. To reduce that figure as a standalone nation, taxes would have to rise or spending would have to fall, other factors being equal. That makes the currency question 每 one of the central debates in the 2014 referendum 每 critical.Back then, the Scottish National party said a post-independence Scotland would continue to use the pound sterling. The economic logic looked weak at the time, and remains so: Scotland would be embracing a currency union that could damage its own competitiveness at the moment of separation and make balancing the budget harder, especially if the oil price was low.The ONS data is published free of vulgar political interpretation, obviously. But that ?2,824 per head deficit figure for Scotland shouldn＊t be ignored. If another referendum lies around the corner, voters deserve to be told whether an independent Scotland would continue with the pound, use its own currency or join the euro. There are pros and cons to all those options 每 but clarity is essential.The natural home for the troubled Co-operative Bank would be the Nationwide Building Society, many would say. The  is a mutual. Like the Co-op Bank, it proclaims its social purpose. And it has experience of takeovers, having absorbed many laggards from within the building society sector over the years.Regulators at the  would probably be delighted by such a union. From their point of view, the capital woes of the Co-op Bank are the source of a small but annoyingly persistent headache. There＊s just one problem with the takeover theory: there＊s nothing in it for the Nationwide.Its , but the result was perfectly respectable. As the chief executive, Joe Garner, points out, the society is not in the profit maximisation game. It is a member-owned organisation with some freedom to manage its profits upwards or downwards, depending on how it wants to balance incentives between savers and borrowers. As long as profits continue to arrive around the ?1bn mark, capital can be replenished and investment can continue. Why mess with this formula?One might say the Co-op Bank＊s 4 million retail customers would be a nice addition. So they would be, but they would arrive with unwanted baggage, such as the Co-op Bank＊s ※legacy§ issues from its ill-fated Britannia merger in 2009 plus commercial and local authority lending operations. The Nationwide isn＊t interested in such distractions. It should continue to steer clear.When confronted by an email hoaxer,  than . This news is mildly reassuring.It is alarming, however, that a mischievous web designer can reach Mark Carney by using a humble  account. Long passages of the Bank＊s annual financial stability report are devoted to cyber-risks. Regulators have bigger threats in mind than the danger that the governor might get duped in a prank but the Bank＊s defences, as Carney might put it, seem ※not appropriate at all§."															
"The former prime minister  has strongly attacked Theresa May＊s claim to be the champion of Britain＊s struggling families, warning that the Conservative government＊s welfare cuts would leave more people in poverty than under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.In his first major intervention in the election campaign, Brown said May＊s policies would reverse the progress made in tackling poverty under  and leave the country more ※economically divided and socially polarised than any other prime minister in living memory§., Brown highlights recent research from the  showing that slow growth in wages and less generous welfare payments would result in a sharp increase in relative poverty over the next five years.He said: ※There will soon be more people in poverty in May＊s Britain 每 15.7 million citizens 每 than ever there were in Margaret Thatcher＊s Britain. And almost 1 million more children condemned to poverty than even in the darkest days of Thatcher-Major rule.§People are judged to be living in relative poverty if they are in a household that has to manage on less than 60% of median income. Brown＊s budgets during his 10 years as Tony Blair＊s chancellor focused on measures to reduce poverty, including the introduction of tax credits for the working poor and increases in child benefit.He said child poverty, which stood at 34% when John Major lost the 1997 election, was reduced to just over 27% by the time David Cameron became prime minister in 2010, but was now back on the rise.Assuming current official forecasts for wage growth and inflation are correct, Brown said there would be 5.1m children living in poverty 每 or 35.7% of the total 每 by 2021-22.※Think about that: one in every three boys and girls condemned to a childhood of poverty, every one of those children denied the necessities of life, the means of fulfilling their potential. That fact alone blows apart any Conservative claim to be the party of the many,§ Brown said.Household budgets of less well-off families have received a double blow this year. Wages have failed to keep pace with prices, while cuts to tax credits have come into force after being announced by George Osborne in 2015 as part of a renewed attempt to reduce the size of Britain＊s budget deficit. Child benefit is now only paid on the first two children and housing benefit has been made less generous.Despite some softening of the welfare cuts since May became prime minister, Brown said the impact on families was still severe.※Despite a 35% rise in prices this decade, child benefit will have risen by only 2%. Housing benefit no longer covers the rent, heating allowances fail to cover the cost of fuel and crisis loans that used to cover cookers or beds have been dramatically slashed.※But here＊s the most shocking fact of all. Two-thirds of the children now in poverty are from families where someone is working. Forget all the rancid Tory talk of ＆skivers＊ and ＆shirkers＊: these are men and women working hard, but on breadline wages 每 with their lifeline, tax credits, being systematically pulled away from them.§Brown said poverty was set to rise even among pensioners, a group that is protected by the triple lock, a guarantee that the state pension will rise by inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.The former prime minister said pensioner poverty affected one in three older Britons in the early 90s, but that rate had fallen to one in 10 by the time Labour left office in 2010. He said the trend was now set to deteriorate, with 400,000 more elderly poor by 2022.※We are learning the hard way that social progress has to be fought for decade by decade,§ Brown said."															
															
" has posted its slowest growth rate in two years, ceding its status as the world＊s fastest-growing major economy to China, with economists blaming the downturn partly on last year＊s shock decision to recall the country＊s two highest-value bank notes.Analysts said the 6.1% GDP growth figure for the January to March quarter 每 compared with China＊s 6.9% 每 reflected a general economic slowdown in the south Asian giant, compounded by the shock demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes, worth approximately ?6 and ?12.The move led to months of acute cash shortages across India that hit the country＊s manufacturing and construction sectors particularly hard, the former recording slower growth than in the same period last year. The construction sector contracted by 3.7%.The cash recall was intended to hasten the country＊s transition towards a formal economy and close down the booming economy of untaxed cash transactions, which aid corruption, the funding of terrorist groups and keeps counterfeit notes in circulation. It was also expected to unearth stashes of untaxed wealth in a country where just 1% pay income tax. India＊s Reserve Bank is yet to say how much ※black money§ was deposited in banks but early indications suggest it was less than expected.Gurchuran Das, an economic commentator, said the lagging growth was well below the rate India required to create enough jobs to match the number of new entrants to the workforce, estimated to be roughly 1 million people a month.※It shows that demonetisation was a big mistake,§ he said. ※What this has done is put us back about six months. We should have been inching towards 8% annual growth, but have ended up around 7.1%.※We＊ve really got to be at 9% growth to create the jobs we need,§ he said. ※Already we were having problems creating those jobs, but demonetisation has exacerbated it by a couple of quarters.§He said the economy had bounced back after cash shortages eased in January and the country was likely reach 8% growth in the next three to four years, a prediction shared by the global ratings agency Moody＊s.Arvind Subramanian, India＊s chief economist, said the reduction in growth was ※quite expected§ after demonetisation, and that the replenishment of cash stocks and the monsoon period would help the economy rebound.Growth in India has been slowing since the middle of 2016, , but Das said the country＊s economy was generally wellmanaged. ※The inflation rate is the lowest it＊s been in five years, the fiscal deficit has come down, and India has in fact become the largest destination for foreign investment in the world,§ the former CEO of Procter & Gamble India said.He added that the key to creating high-productivity jobs in the formal sector was expanding India＊s share of global exports, currently around 1.7%.India is preparing to introduce a national goods and services tax in July that is expected to make the country a more attractive destination for foreign investment, cut red tape for business and increase trade between states. But Moody＊s has warned the country needs to further reduce debt levels if it hopes to boost its international credit rating, currently just above junk status.Although the implementation of demonetisation was seen as botched by some, the policy is thought to have been a political coup for the Indian prime minister, . In March, he decisively won an election in India＊s largest state that was seen as a referendum on the scheme."															
"Theresa May＊s is deeply corrosive of British politics, because she knows it is a target that is unlikely ever to be met.Downing Street aides privately acknowledge that having failed to get net migration down to ※the tens of thousands§ for six consecutive years 每 net migration stands at 273,000 每 they are just as unlikely to succeed in the next five years.But they argue there is only one thing worse than missing the target and that is not having a target at all. They believe if they ditch it they will immediately be accused by Ukip and the Daily Mail of having given up on cutting immigration.Perhaps more importantly, dropping the target would also mean having to admit that over the last 25 years Britain has become a country of net mass migration, where economic growth has been partly fuelled by the skills and labour of both European and non-European migrants who have largely paid their way once here.That would also mean May having to drop the political pretence that it is possible to deliver deep cuts in immigration in an age where hundreds of thousands of people each year individually make a choice to move to countries where the jobs exist, and not necessarily with the intention to settle. This is what used to be called labour mobility rather than immigration.So, what are the chances of May＊s government hitting a migration target that she failed to hit during her six years as home secretary? The big difference is that leaving the EU means, so the argument goes, that European migration can be brought under control for the first time.EU net migration is running at 165,000 a year while non-EU net migration, which has been subject to government control for the past six years, actually matches it at 164,000. So even if EU net migration was reduced to zero there would still be some way to go to get it down below 100,000.Nearly every industry or public sector institution, including the  and , has lined up since the Brexit vote to stress how much their operations rely on European migrants to keep them going. Even if the government ends free movement from the EU and closes the door on low-skilled labour there will still be immense pressure for exemptions. Skills gaps are already beginning to appear across Britain as the supply of European migrants has slowed in the face of the refusal to guarantee the rights of EU nationals after Brexit. However, experience also shows that even if the door were closed to low-skilled European migrants they would still come to Britain, but illegally, as long as there were jobs in which they could earn more than they do at home. As Labour recognised in the 2000s if governments do not provide a legal door for immigrants then they will find an illegal way into the country.May told the Commons home affairs select committee a year ago: ※Pulling out of the  is not the silver bullet that suddenly solves all our immigration issues.§What about taking students out of the net migration figures, which half of her cabinet colleagues have reportedly advised her to do at one point or another over the past three years? May has repeatedly ruled out taking students out despite evidence that most go home after their studies and the damage their inclusion is doing to the reputation of British higher education overseas.The net flow of international students is about 90,000 a year and removing them would reduce the current figure from 273,000 to 183,000. But May has rejected this option, arguing that it would be seen as ※fiddling the figures§. It would, of course, be a one-off change in the definition but there is increasing evidence that students do not stay on illegally after their studies 每 evidence the recently introduced exit checks are expected to confirm.There is only one sure way May could deliver on this target and that would be to crash the economy. Britain＊s high levels of net migration are a direct result of the UK＊s relative position as the ※jobs factory of Europe§. Unless May has some secret plan to cut migration that she has yet to share with the country, she must be hoping that she never meets her target because if she crashes the economy then we will all pay a price for a target that not even she believed in."															
"With Emmanuel Macron＊s defeat of the rightwing populist Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election, the EU and the euro have dodged a bullet.But geopolitical risks are continuing to proliferate. The populist backlash against globalisation in the west will not be stilled by Macron＊s victory, and could still lead to protectionism, trade wars, and sharp restrictions to migration. If the forces of disintegration take hold, the UK＊s withdrawal from the EU could eventually lead to a breakup of the trade bloc 每 Macron or no Macron.At the same time, Russia has maintained its aggressive behaviour in the Baltics, the Balkans, Ukraine, and Syria. The Middle East still contains multiple near-failed states such as Iraq, Yemen, Libya, and Lebanon. And the Sunni-Shia proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran show no sign of ending.In Asia, US or North Korean brinkmanship could precipitate a military conflict on the Korean peninsula. And China is continuing to engage in 每 and in some cases escalate 每 its territorial disputes with regional neighbours.Despite these geopolitical risks, global financial markets have reached new heights. So it is worth asking if investors are underestimating the potential for one or more of these conflicts to trigger a more serious crisis, and what it would take to shock them out of their complacency if they are.There are many explanations for why markets may be ignoring geopolitical risks. For starters, even with much of the Middle East burning, there have been no oil-supply shocks or embargos, and the shale-gas revolution in the US has increased the supply of low-cost energy. During previous Middle Eastern conflicts 每 such as the 1973 Yom Kippur war, Iran＊s Islamic revolution in 1979, and Iraq＊s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 每 oil-supply shocks caused global stagflation and sharp stock-market corrections.A  is that investors are extrapolating from previous shocks, such as 9/11, when policymakers saved the day by backstopping the economy and financial markets with strong monetary and fiscal policy easing. These policies turned post-shock market corrections into buying opportunities, because the fall in asset prices was reversed in a matter of days or weeks.Third, the countries that actually have experienced localised asset-market shocks 每 such as Russia and Ukraine after Russia＊s annexation of Crimea and incursion into eastern Ukraine in 2014 每 are not large enough economically to affect US or global financial markets. Similarly, even as the UK pursues a ※hard Brexit§, it still accounts for only about 2% of global GDP.A fourth explanation is that the world has so far been spared from the tail risks associated with today＊s geopolitical conflagrations. There has not yet been a direct military conflict between any major powers, nor have the EU or eurozone collapsed; Donald Trump＊s more radical populist policies have been partly contained; and China＊s economy has not yet suffered from a hard landing, which would create sociopolitical instability.Markets have trouble pricing such ※black swan§ events: unknown unknowns that are unlikely but extremely costly. For example, the market could not have predicted 9/11. And even if investors think another major terrorist attack is likely, they cannot know when.A confrontation between the Washington and Pyongyang could also turn into a black swan event, but this is a possibility that markets have happily ignored. One reason is, notwithstanding Trump＊s bluster, the US has few realistic military options: North Korea could use conventional weapons to wipe out Seoul and its surroundings, where almost half of South Korea＊s population lives, were the US to strike.Investors may be assuming that even if a limited military exchange occurred, it would not escalate into a fully fledged war, and policy loosening could soften the blow on the economy and financial markets. In this scenario, as with 9/11, the initial market correction would end up being a buying opportunity.But there are other possible scenarios, some of which could turn out to be black swans. Given the risks associated with direct military action, the US is alleged to be using cyber-weapons to eliminate the North Korean nuclear threat against the US mainland. This may explain why so many of North Korea＊s missile tests have failed in recent months. But how will North Korea react to being militarily decapitated?One answer is that it could launch a cyber-attack of its own. North Korea＊s cyber-warfare capabilities are considered to be just a notch below those of Russia and China, and the world got an early glimpse of them in 2014 when it hacked Sony Pictures. A major North Korean cyber-attack could disable or destroy parts of the US＊s critical infrastructure and cause massive economic and financial damage. That remains a risk even if the US can sabotage North Korea＊s entire industrial system and infrastructure. Or, faced with disruption of its missile programme and regime, North Korea could go low-tech, by sending a ship with a dirty bomb into the ports of Los Angeles or New York. An attack of this kind would most likely be difficult to monitor or stop.So, while investors may be right to discount the risk of a conventional military conflict between the US and North Korea, they also may be underestimating the threat of a true black swan event, such as a disruptive cyberwar between the two countries or a dirty bomb attack against the US.Would an escalation on the Korean peninsula be an opportunity to ※buy the dip§ or would it mark the beginning of a massive market meltdown? It is well known that markets can price the risks associated with a normal distribution of events that can be statistically estimated and measured. But they have more trouble grappling with ※§: risk that cannot be calculated in probabilistic terms."															
															
"You report that the chancellor has, once again, told the Indians that ※there is no quota, no limits, no restrictions on Indian students applying to British universities§ and that ※90% of Indian students who apply for a student visa, get a student visa§ (, 5 April).All of that is (nearly) correct so, all must wonder, what is the problem? But it is far from the full story and does not explain why the numbers have shrunk so dramatically. As one hopes government ministers understand 每 and as Indians clearly do understand 每 the real reason why such a high proportion obtain visas is that far fewer apply for them in the first place, believing that the rules and restrictions are now so strict and the entitlements (especially to part-time and post-study work) so limited, that far fewer believe they will qualify or that the UK is the right destination for them.

Overseas students not only have an enriching time studying at our world-class universities (, Chris Patten, 4?April), but there are enormous long-term benefits to the UK. Analysis by the British Council in 2014 showed that one in seven countries has a leader who studied at a British higher education institution. The goodwill that this builds towards the UK contributes hugely to our ※soft power§. Chris Patten is spot on. The UK is seeing a massive decline at a time when a large number of German universities are now offering English language international graduate programmes to entice students from the Anglosphere. But it is Australia where the difference is most striking and staggering. The  (22 February) that the number of international students in Australia was at a record high 每 554,119. That＊s 100,000 more than the UK, despite Australia only having 43 universities compared with 130 in the UK.As a result, international education is now Australia＊s third biggest export. And the revenue from international student fees is staggering. In 2016, the universities of Melbourne and Sydney combined made more than A$1bn from international students 每 A$526m for Melbourne, A$480m for Sydney.In the Sydney Morning Herald, Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia, pointed to the students who will no longer be coming to the UK as a boon for Australia: ※Because of , European students will no longer be able to study for free in the UK.§Australia＊s education minister Simon Birmingham says he will leave no stone unturned to maximise opportunity for growth.

While Germany＊s external surplus, at 8% of GDP, is big 每 too big 每 it is not the result of currency manipulation by Germany. The real culprits are an inflationary credit bubble in southern Europe, the expansionary policies of the European Central Bank, and the financial products US banks sold to the world. So, instead of blaming Germany, Trump would do well to focus on institutions in his own country.Germany＊s trade surplus is rooted in the fact that the country sells its goods too cheaply. Here, the Trump administration is basically right. The euro is too cheap relative to the US dollar, and Germany is selling too cheaply to its trading partners within the eurozone. This undervaluation boosts demand for German goods in other countries, while making  reluctant to import as much as it exports.The euro is currently priced at $1.07, whereas OECD purchasing power parity stands at $1.29. This implies a 17% undervaluation of the euro. Moreover, Germany is 19% too cheap within the eurozone if one uses as a baseline a calculation by Goldman Sachs from 2013 and subtracts the appreciation in real terms since that time. On the whole, this implies that Germany＊s currency is undervalued by about a third.So the fact that German products are undervalued is indisputable. The question is why the exchange rate has strayed so far from fundamentals.The undervaluation within the eurozone has its roots in the inflationary credit bubble triggered by the announcement and implementation of the euro in southern  after the Madrid summit of 1995, which brought with it drastic interest-rate cuts in these economies. Interest rates in Italy, Spain and Portugal fell by about five percentage points, and in Greece by roughly 20 percentage points.The cheap foreign credit brought about by the euro enabled these countries＊ governments and construction sectors to raise wages faster than productivity increased, thereby pushing up prices and undermining the competitiveness of their manufacturing sectors. Germany, which was at that time in a deep crisis, kept inflation low, in line with the requirements of the Maastricht treaty, so it became cheaper and cheaper in  terms.The undervaluation of the euro, by contrast, has two root causes. One is the European Central Bank＊s ultra-loose monetary policy, particularly its programme of quantitative easing (QE), under which 2.3tn of freshly printed money is being used to buy eurozone securities.Part of that money is flowing abroad in search of higher returns, thus leading to euro depreciation. This is indeed a form of indirect currency manipulation. It should be noted, however, that the ECB＊s governing council adopted QE and other expansionary measures, despite the fierce opposition of the German Bundesbank. So this is not a policy for which Germany can be held responsible.The second root cause of the euro＊s undervaluation lies within the country over which Trump presides. Thanks to the dollar＊s status as the world＊s main reserve currency, the US financial industry has managed in recent decades to offer international investors a potpourri of alluring products. This has driven up the dollar＊s value and chronically undermined export competitiveness, much like the financial products offered by the City of London did in the UK by fuelling sterling appreciation in the years of undisputed EU membership.Economists speak of ※Dutch disease§ in situations like this, because the emergence of the Netherlands＊ gas industry in the 1960s placed upward pressure on the guilder, decimating the manufacturing sector. Whether a country sells gas or financial products to the rest of the world doesn＊t matter all that much; the point is that the successful sector crowds out others by causing real exchange-rate appreciation. In lamenting the strong dollar＊s effect on manufacturing employment in the US, Trump should look to Wall Street, not Germany.He should also consider that those alluring US financial products, which have so afflicted America＊s export sector, have sometimes been pie in the sky rather than legitimate investment opportunities. Both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton prompted brokers with their Community Reinvestment Act to help the US poor achieve home ownership by means of generous loans, even though it was clear from the outset that many of these borrowers would never be able to repay the money.The brokers sold their claims to the banks, which in turn cunningly packaged them in opaque asset-backed securities that they then palmed off to the world with sham AAA ratings. ※Stupid German money§ was the term used on Wall Street for the funds that flowed in to finance America＊s social policy.That scam was exposed during the financial crisis. In 2010, Germany＊s government had to support its banks with 280bn, by establishing two bad banks to take over these problematic financial products. Viewed from this perspective, a large number of the many Porsches, Mercedes, and BMWs delivered to America have never been paid for at all. The US president should take this into consideration before threatening a trade war 每 or even indulging in a Twitter spat 每 with Germany."															
"he phone call had come through just after eight in the morning while Phil ※The Undertaker§ Hammond was eating breakfast. It was the prime minister ordering him to bury Class 4 NICs. He had tried telling her that doing a U-turn on your only real budget measure less than a week after it had been announced made him and the government look hopelessly incompetent, but Theresa wasn＊t having any of it. The Tory backbenchers were on her back. The Daily Mail was on her back. And now she was on his back.Six hours later The Undertaker rather sheepishly arrived in the Commons to try to explain how it was that, though he still absolutely stood by his budget because it was his budget that was his, he now wanted to fundamentally change it because although he hadn＊t broken any promises in the Conservative party manifesto, as that＊s not the sort of thing he would ever dream of doing, he had in fact broken the promises he had made in the Conservative party manifesto.It had been absolutely right to raise NICs and that＊s why he wasn＊t doing it. And no, before anyone asked, he hadn＊t worked out how to fill the ?2bn black hole that had just opened up in the country＊s finances. Give him another six months. Maybe changing to one budget a year wasn＊t such a good plan after all.Not even Jeremy Corbyn＊s hapless efforts to take advantage of the government＊s uselessness at prime minister＊s questions could cheer The Undertaker up. He was a proud man. A vain man. A man who still kept his Mr Funeral Director of the Year 1978 award on his mantlepiece. A man who sensed he was now living on borrowed time. A man both dead and undead. He＊d screwed up at the first hurdle. Another cock-up and he would be a goner.The Undertaker only knew one way. When in doubt, keep digging. ※It wasn＊t either myself or the prime minister who realised we had broken the Tory party manifesto which he hadn＊t broken,§ he said. ※It was the BBC＊s Laura Kuenssberg.§ Great. So neither the chancellor nor the prime minister had a clue what was in their own manifesto? ※No, no, no,§ said The Undertaker hurriedly. ※What I really meant was that when I had leaked that we were planning to break our promises to the media ahead of the budget, no one had raised an eyebrow, so I thought it was all going to be OK.§By now only The Undertaker＊s head was still showing above the grave he had just dug for himself, and Labour backbenchers were queueing up to deliver the coup de grace that their front bench had failed to land. The Undertaker＊s misery was only compounded by the support from his own benches. Being told he was a brave man could only mean one thing. There were a lot of MPs who were mighty pissed off they had spent the past week defending a crap policy that had now been ditched. The Undertaker made one last appeal. ※I want to restore the faith and trust of the British people,§ he mumbled, dimly aware he had just done the exact opposite ※especially as we embark on the process of leaving the EU§.He might not have been quite so quick to say that if he had listened to David Davis give evidence to the Brexit select committee earlier in the day. Therapists often like to see their patients first thing in the morning because they are then at their most undefended and aren＊t awake enough to portray themselves in a good light. It certainly worked a treat with the Brexit secretary, who appears to have aged five years in the last few weeks. Though that could have something to do with the large quantities of sodium pentothal he had just taken.The Treasury select committee chair, Hilary Benn, warmed up with a bit of free association. Did no deal mean WTO tariff barriers? ※Yes,§ said Davis. Would there be border checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland? ※Yes.§ Would the EU/US open skies agreement be dead in the water? ※Yes.§ Would we lose passporting rights of financial services? ※Yes.§ Did this mean that the foreign secretary was idiotic to say that dropping out of the EU on WTO terms would be fine? ※Yes.§ Whoops. He had just landed Boris in it. Still, Boris wouldn＊t have thought twice about knifing him.Benn then went for the throat. Had Davis made any calculation of the exact costs of leaving the EU on WTO terms? ※God no,§ said Davis breezily. ※I know how it＊s going to work out. I just haven＊t quantified it.§ Every member of the committee 每 even the leavers 每 stared into the abyss. Davis had just admitted the government was saying no deal would be better than a bad deal when it didn＊t even know the cost of no deal. A parish council wouldn＊t get away with that level of unaccountability. Davis shrugged. There was something liberating about telling the truth. Why not let the country know that the chancellor hadn＊t a clue about the economy and Brexit was heading for the rocks? It wasn＊t as if there was an effective opposition to stop them."															
"he government＊s U-turn on the unfair ?2bn national insurance hike for the self-employed is a humiliation for chancellor , who has shredded his reputation after only his first budget 每 and broke a manifesto promise to do it. Labour opposed the measure from the start: Jeremy Corbyn made our opposition loud and clear in his immediate budget response, and Labour MPs hammered the same message home over the next few days. Opposition came from all sides of the house, and from business organisations like the Federation of Small Businesses, leaving the Tory leadership completely isolated. will be a huge relief to all those self-employed workers and businesspeople, earning as little as ?8,000 a year, who faced a serious increase in their tax bill at a time when average pay for the self-employed has fallen dramatically 每 their average earnings are .This was not a progressive measure: the tax hike would be a larger proportion of income for someone on ?18,000 than it would be for someone on ?80,000. Nor did it arrive with an improvement in the benefits and conditions offered to those in self-employment, which remain substantially worse than those in employment. And in the context of the government＊s , hammering the self-employed was plainly unfair.Perhaps most of all, it illustrates just how out of touch this government is. Perhaps if Hammond 每 a millionaire 每 had spent a little more time thinking about the consequences, and a little less time writing jokes for his budget speech, he would have realised this. But if he was unable to notice that a ?2bn additional tax burden for low and middle earners was grossly unfair, it was surely up to the prime minister and the cabinet to step in. But Theresa May hailed the tax hike as ※fair§.They and the chancellor now face serious questions: when did they become aware of the proposed change? They must have been, since the Treasury trailed it over the weekend before the budget. And did they not think to intervene, block the measure, and save the worry for millions of families?This is the third Tory budget in a row that has resulted in a major U-turn: 2015 saw the tax credits shambles, with cuts in the budget reversed by the autumn statement. In 2016, they reversed cuts to personal independence payments for people with disabilities. Now this. In every case, it was Labour opposition, along with that from across civil society, that forced the U-turns.And in every case we have been left with significant black holes in the budget as a result of the Tories＊ economic incompetence. The chancellor has promised to fill his ?2bn gap by the autumn. But clarity is needed before then. The additional money was intended to pay for additional social care funding. Social care under the Tories has already suffered from ?4.6bn of cuts, , with more than a million frail and elderly people being denied access to the care they need. So it is essential that Hammond makes clear how this ?2bn of missing funding will be made good. It is critical that he does so not by imposing further cuts on our public services, whether the NHS or schools, and nor do we wish to see further unfair stealth taxes on low and middle earners. The chancellor could choose instead to reverse the cuts being made to taxes on big corporations or the super-rich.Above all else, on a day when Brexit secretary David Davis announced he had made no economic assessment of Britain leaving the EU without a trade deal, it is abundantly clear that this is a government that cannot be trusted with the nation＊s finances. And it is a government prepared to threaten workers, the self-employed, and small businesses with tax hikes even as it slashes taxes for corporations and the super-rich. Labour would make different choices 每 reversing tax cuts for big corporations and the super-rich, and investing for the future, while always balancing day-to-day spending."															
"or more than 25 years, Walter Hang has helped local governments, engineers and homeowners make sense of hazardous waste. To do that, he digs into the enormous data vault maintained by the  (EPA) and pinpoints information that is useful for his clients to assess the health and financial risks from nearby industrial properties and toxic waste sites.Hang, who runs Toxics Targeting, now fears this trove of knowledge will become more difficult to access as the EPA＊s newly minted chief, Scott Pruitt, begins a broad rollback of regulations and shrinks the agency＊s staff. President Trump has vowed to weaken the EPA, contending that its rules for protecting public health stifle business development. The Trump administration has already some information on EPA websites and moved to agency employees.What Trump doesn＊t acknowledge is that EPA data isn＊t just an enforcement tool. The agency employs more scientists than any other government agency except Nasa. Decades of work by those scientists have generated valuable information about air and water pollution, chemical toxicity and hazardous waste cleanup. This information has enabled businesses to develop new products and services 每 and create jobs in the process.No one has estimated the financial benefits of making EPA data easily accessible to the private sector. But anecdotal evidence shows it plays a significant role in many billion-dollar industries, from lending and real estate to  and and manufacturing. For example, chemical companies use the data to come up with less toxic compounds.Banks won＊t loan money to a property developer without ensuring that the land is free of contamination, which can be an expensive liability. They rely on pollution data from the EPA, says Hang, who compiles the information into reports for companies in real estate development and transaction.※We are trying to make sure we get as much data as we can, and we＊re trying to make sure we don＊t have data gaps,§ Hang says.Hang isn＊t alone in worrying about access. Several campaigns, carried out mostly by university professors and students, to download and secure EPA data have sprung up since the November election. One of the first of such efforts began not in the US but in Canada. Matt Price, a history professor at the University of Toronto, helped organize ※§ events in December. Offering free pizza and coffee, these events recruited a small army of volunteers who began downloading EPA data to secure servers.Price says he and his colleagues sprang into action after experiencing their own ※§ by former Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, a conservative who slashed funding for science and ended important environmental monitoring projects. Price and others stepped up to preserve Canadian environmental data during that crisis.※We probably focused immediately on the EPA because of the extremely hostile language that came out of the Trump campaign around the EPA,§ says Price. ※We have put a kind of faith in the state as the long term guarantor of the integrity of scientific data. I think that faith may be misplaced.§Many companies rely on the agency＊s data to build products that tackle some of the biggest health and environmental problems. They sign research and development agreements with the EPA, which provides technical assistance in return for a share of any sales a company generates as a result.EPA had active in 2015, which yielded $232,318 in royalties for the agency. The previous year, 129 contracts produced royalties of $438,786., a San Francisco company that develops air-quality sensors and software, is working with the EPA to improve the devices＊ sensitivity in detecting pollution. EPA air pollution data, gathered for decades at a regional scale, serves as an important reference and quality check for the company. Aclima has partnered with Google to collect air quality data by putting its mobile sensors on the StreetView cars that Google uses to create its maps. It plans to offer the resulting data to the public later this year.Aclima CEO Davida Herzl says the EPA＊s air pollution data plays a ※foundational§ role in everything the company does. ※Anytime we lose information that is important to public health, that is a concern,§ Herzl says. ※It would be a massive blow to the business community in ways that aren＊t always discussed. Innovation and private sector research is happening on top of that foundation of science that EPA has been developing for over 30 years now.§Even businesses that are set to benefit from Trump＊s plan to loosen environmental regulations are worried about losing access to EPA data, which they need for complying with state or local laws and for their own internal accounting of efficiency and performance, says Gretchen Goldman, research director at the Center for Science and Democracy, a program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.The American Gas Association, which represents natural gas distribution utilities, recently notified members to download any EPA data they need in case it is removed from the agency＊s website. Pam Lacey, the association＊s chief regulatory counsel, says gas utilities use EPA data and other online resources to track methane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. The data shows distributors have cut methane emissions by 74% since 1990.※They continue to do more work and they＊d like to be able to keep the data that demonstrates what they＊ve done and what they＊re doing on an ongoing basis,§ Lacey says. ※Also, some companies have their own internal goals for sustainability, and they would want to use that official EPA data.§None of the EPA data has been restricted or eliminated yet, say the scientists involved in the data backup campaigns, but they aren＊t taking any chances. Their concern stretches beyond protecting existing EPA data, however. Major budget cuts, if implemented, means the agency may be unable to collect new data.EPA officials within the  did not respond to a request for comment.※Their goal is to defund programs that gather data,§ says Jared Blumenfeld, former administrator of EPA Region 9 (California, Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii), who left the agency in May 2016. ※It＊s much, much harder in a digital age to get rid of data. It＊s a lot easier to not fund science so you don＊t have the data in the first place.§"															
"repare for the age of the driverless car and the robot that does the housework. That was the message from the World Economic Forum earlier this year as it hailed the start of a new industrial revolution. The first industrial revolution was about water and steam. The second was about electricity and mass production. The third harnessed electronics and information technology to automate production. Now it is the turn of artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science,  and quantum computing to transform the global economy.※The speed of current breakthroughs has no historical precedent§, the WEF said. ※When compared with previous industrial revolutions, the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace.§But if this really is the dawning of a new age, it seems somebody forgot to tell the people with the power to turn ideas into products. The multinational companies that bankroll the WEF＊s annual meeting in  are awash with cash. Profits are strong. The return on capital is the best it has been for the best part of two decades. Yet investment is weak. Companies would rather save their cash or hand it back to shareholders than put it to work.One possible explanation for this corporate caution is that businesses think bad times are just around the corner. If, for example, companies thought the tepid recovery from the financial crisis was a brief respite before another downturn, it would make sense to stash some money away now. Any UK company that fancies a risk-averse approach has the perfect excuse for sitting pat: the uncertainty caused by .But this is not an entirely convincing explanation. As the economist Paul Ormerod noted in a  corporate hoarding was going on well before Brexit became an issue and it affects all western capitalist countries, not just Britain.Ormerod illustrates the point by contrasting the behaviour of the US corporate sector over the past decade with that during the Great Depression. If ever there was a time when companies might have been excused for salting their cash away it was the 1930s, when the US economy contracted by a quarter.Yet in the dark years after the Wall Street Crash, the US corporate sector ran down its cash pile, so much so that it had negative savings in the years from 1930 to 1934. The new breed of US executives have done things differently. US corporate saving has been higher since the crash than it was in the decade before it.Another explanation is that the smart people running companies know what they are doing, and are simply waiting for the right moment to invest in the . This is not entirely convincing either, since one of the core principles of investing is that the biggest profits are reserved for those who seize the opportunities first.Other reasons canvassed for the lack of investment are that cutting-edge companies need less physical capital than they did in the past, and more money in the bank unless somebody comes along with a takeover bid.But the most obvious explanation of all is that the people running companies are dominated by short-term performance targets and the need to keep shareholders sweet. Up until the 1980s, investment by the US corporate sector averaged 4% of GDP while dividends averaged 2% of GDP. Today, it is the other way around. Distributed profits used to average 35-45% of total US corporate profits in the 1950s, which is why there was plenty left over to invest in growing the business. Yet for the past few decades, the trend has been unmistakable: less money for investment, more set aside for dividends. In the UK, 2017 is expected to be a record year after analysis by Capita showed that shareholders grabbed north of ?33bn in the second quarter.Were he still alive, Milton Friedman would have said company bosses were doing exactly the right thing. Friedman believed strongly in shareholder value maximisation. Shareholder value maximisation has certainly delivered for the top 1%. They own 40% of the US stock market and benefit from the dividend payouts, and the share buybacks that drive prices higher on Wall Street. Those running companies, also members of the 1%, have remuneration packages loaded up with stock options, so they too get richer as the company share price goes up.But what of the other 99%? Where do they fit into this cosy little world? Well, the short answer is that what gains they get to the value of their pensions from rising share prices are dwarfed by the impact of weaker investment. And it is the lack of investment that explains why the recovery from the recession has been so feeble, why productivity has been so poor, why average incomes have flatlined and why growth has been accompanied by a buildup in consumer debt.It hardly needs saying that this was not quite what was promised when the Thatcherites and the Reaganites took control 40 years ago. Then, weak growth was blamed on over-mighty trade unions and a state that spent and borrowed too much. Private investment, it was said, was being crowded out by wasteful public investment. Governments that borrowed for their pet projects drove up market interest rates, making investment less attractive for an army of frustrated entrepreneurs.This explanation no longer holds. Both official and market interest rates have been ultra-low for a decade. Trade unions have been smashed. Nationalised industries have been privatised. So where＊s the investment?Back in the ※bad old days§, a loose social contract applied. Companies gave a slice of their profits to shareholders but invested the bigger portion of them. Higher investment led to higher productivity which in turn financed higher wages, higher demand and higher profits. Both capital and labour benefited from this arrangement.The new model 每 that saw the fruits of weaker growth go disproportionately to the 1% 每 was never likely to work as well and, sure enough, by all the key metrics 每 investment, living standards, productivity 每 growth rates are lower now than they were when Friedman and his disciples took control. What was promised was a new golden age of capitalism. What they have delivered is a world on the brink of secular stagnation.If innovation is going on apace (which it is) and companies have cash in the bank (which they do), one solution is simply to wait for the moment when entrepreneurs rediscover what Keynes called their animal spirits. Another would be for governments to say enough is enough. If, despite the lowest ever borrowing costs and repeated cuts in corporate taxation, the private sector won＊t invest in the fourth industrial revolution, the public sector will. The argument for a national investment bank in the UK is that entrepreneurs are not actually very entrepreneurial and that opportunities are being squandered as a result."															
"espite everything that has happened over the past few days, the Mansion House speeches are still scheduled to take place this week 每 with the difference this year being that guests had been preparing for the showpiece by speculating who might be the star mystery guest.It was always going to be the chancellor, of course, but the mystery was who might be holding that great office of state come Thursday, when the City＊s finest minds (plus the usual load of bankers and fund managers) gather to hear what the second lord of the Treasury and the governor of the Bank of England have to say about the state of the UK economy.You may recall that the current occupant of No 11 is one , who hasn＊t been allowed out in public much of late 每 presumably after getting stuck behind a door secured with the triple lock that was going spare following the drafting of the Tory manifesto.Even governor Mark Carney 每 who was in purdah for the election 每 seemed about as vocal as Hammond, who was thought to be in line for the sack straight after last Thursday＊s poll.Not now. Strong leadership in the national interest has meant Hammond has been retained and will now have to knock out a speech for Thursday. Not that anybody thinks our leaders make it up as they go along, or anything.Here＊s just what you need this week: a chance to vote.Admittedly, you need to be a shareholder in  (IAG) 每 and you will have to go to Spain to cast your ballot in person, as that is where the owner of British Airways is holding its annual meeting.This is the firm＊s usual location for this set-piece, but it sounds rather convenient this year, what with IAG suffering the worst month of any British institution (apart from the Tory party) following the , which left thousands of passengers＊ holiday plans in tatters.So, if you＊re a UK-based investor wanting to ask IAG boss Willie Walsh about the farce, then please take your chances on a BA flight.Still, if IAG thinks the meeting＊s location might soften any questions about inconveniencing passengers, the company may be mistaken; a more local issue might preoccupy IAG＊s Spanish investors just as much.Soon after the last AGM, the group＊s budget airline Vueling also cancelled flights after ※operational difficulties§. Vueling＊s boss then? Alex Cruz 每 now in the line of fire as BA＊s chief exec.One of the reasons that the City appears able to adapt to all sorts of crises is that its inhabitants follow the teachings of Marx 每 Groucho Marx.As the great man (almost) said: Those are my opinions, and if you don＊t like them I have some more. And this just about sums up how the Square Mile will advise clients this week.The financial sector has been enjoying a nobly consistent hit rate with its predictions, collectively failing to foresee a Tory majority in 2015, the Trump and Brexit votes of 2016 and now a hung parliament.But no matter. Like people who trip in the street only to pretend they are really breaking into a run for the bus, the City will continue to advise clients on the future with an astonishing self-confidence this week.As Chris Leyland, deputy chief investment officer at financial firm True Potential, said on Friday (after polling ※investment partners§ UBS, Goldman Sachs, Allianz and Schroders): ※Investors in a well-balanced and well-diversified portfolio remain best positioned to achieve their goals. Our portfolios are one of the most diversified, agile investment products available right now and are designed for precisely this type of volatile environment. We see no reason to shift our position.§ Shameless."															
"British businesses have rejected claims by leading Brexiters that trade with the rest of the world can replace free access to European markets, arguing that quitting the single market and customs union without a trade deal with the EU will harm their growth prospects. and Peter Sands, senior fellows at Harvard University＊s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, UK businesses owners warned that a bad deal, or no deal, on Brexit would be disastrous for British jobs, investment and growth.The warning comes as financial speculators circle London＊s stock markets and investors bet on the value of the pound, triggering a period of intense volatility while No 10 attempts to restore a sense of confidence in the government.On Friday, in the hours immediately after the surprise election result, . The markets recovered as it seemed that the Conservatives had reached a deal with the DUP, but on Sunday the status of that deal looked less clear cut.Figures out this week are expected to add further pressure on Theresa May as she fends off criticism of her plans to maintain cuts to government spending and restrict public sector pay. Analysts forecast the UK＊s inflation rate will remain at elevated levels under May while wages remain stagnant, forcing ministers to admit that living standards will continue to plummet during the summer and most likely into the autumn.Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, said: ※Any possibility of another election 每 and uncertainty over who will lead the next government 每 puts downward pressure on sterling in the short term.§More than 50 business owners and trade associations were interviewed for the report by Balls and Sands. It found they were ※highly sceptical§ that unfettered access to the EU market would be replaced with a growth in trade with other parts of the world. Balls said: ※At the time of the referendum, many British companies thought that  might lead to a reduced regulatory burden. But now they＊re worried that if Britain leaves the single market and the customs union, the opposite will be true.§Companies said they wanted to remain in the single market or customs union, and if this was unachievable they wanted an agreement that made trade as frictionless as possible. The prospect of reverting to WTO standards, which the government has suggested by saying that no deal is better than a bad deal, was of concern to many who feared a sharp increase in tariffs.Balls said: ※British companies are desperate to move beyond the empty rhetoric that ＆Brexit means Brexit＊. They are clear that both ＆no deal＊ and a ＆bad deal＊ would be disastrous for British jobs, investment and growth.§ The study came as the first poll of UK business leaders since the election found a plunge in confidence in the economic outlook and concern over the make up of the government. The survey of almost 700 members of the Institute of Directors found 65% believed uncertainty over the makeup of the government was ※a significant concern§ for the UK economy. It also showed that 57% were pessimistic about the economy over the next 12 months, compared with 37% the previous month. Reaching a new trade deal with the EU should be the overall priority for the new government, respondents said.A survey for the Resolution Foundation found many employers were unprepared for a new era of lower migration. Of 500 employers with staff from the EU or EEA, almost half had ※totally unrealistic expectations of what the post-Brexit immigration regime might be§, the thinktank said. It added that 17% of firms expected no change to the system of freedom of movement, while 30% expected to see it maintained for those with a job offer.The foundation said Britain＊s post-Brexit migration policy should not be solely determined by what businesses wanted, but it was vital that the new government listened to them and gave them chance to prepare. Torsten Bell, the thinktank＊s director, said: ※Whatever people＊s views on Brexit, the journey not just the destination matter hugely to growth, jobs and living standards. Now is the time for both firms and government to focus on how we navigate that journey and the changes to our labour market it brings.§"															
"Squeezed British households have cut back their spending for the first time in almost four years, according to figures that underscore the pressures from rising prices and political uncertainty.Visa, the credit and debit card processing business, said its vast database of spending patterns shows there was a drop in spending across a broad range of categories last month, including clothing, household goods, food and transport.That chimes with recent signs the UK economy is struggling to eke out growth this year and has  as the effects of last summer＊s Brexit vote start to bite.Economists are worried that the inconclusive result of last week＊s snap general election will add to the mood of uncertainty among consumers and businesses alike. That will compound the pressures from the pound＊s sharp drop since the EU referendum, which has pushed up the cost of UK imports and stoked inflation.Official figures due this week are widely expected to confirm that workers suffered another drop in real pay in April as wage growth weakened further and failed to match rises in living costs. Separate figures for May are forecast to show inflation held at 2.7%, the highest for more than three years and well above a Bank of England target of 2%.Despite that overshoot, the Bank＊s policymakers meeting to set interest rates this week are likely to reaffirm that they are happy to tolerate higher inflation for now as they continue to keep borrowing costs low to shore up growth and employment. The monetary policy committee will be one member short again this month after the resignation earlier this year of the Bank＊s deputy governor, Charlotte Hogg, .Economists polled by Reuters expect the depleted committee to vote seven to one to leave interest rates at the record low of 0.25%. Only Kristin Forbes, who leaves the MPC this month, is expected to continue voting for a rate rise to curb inflation. Her colleagues will likely emphasise the pressures on consumer spending.The figures from Visa appear to vindicate their cautious approach. The payments company said spending dropped 0.8% year-on-year in May, the first decline since September 2013.※Our index clearly shows that with rising prices and stalling wage growth, more of us are starting to feel the squeeze,§ said Kevin Jenkins, UK & Ireland managing director at Visa.※Retailers of non-essential goods were among the worst hit, with clothing and household goods seeing sharp declines in sales.§Spending on experiences such as eating out and cinema trips continued to rise, but at a softer pace in May, according to the Visa report, compiled by data company IHS Markit.There was further evidence of consumer caution in shopper numbers for May. They showed a 1% drop in footfall, which measures people going into shops but not necessarily buying anything. It was the first such drop since February, driven by a 2% fall in high street footfall and a 1.3% decline at shopping centres. Retail parks defied the broader trend, with a 1.5% rise, according to the figures from the British Retail Consortium and retail analysts Springboard.※May was clearly a month of moderation for UK shoppers,§ said Springboard＊s Diane Wehrle. She also noted signs in the footfall data 每 collected from electronic sensors around the country 每 that fewer people were staying on past 5pm to eat out after shopping trips, a further indication households had become more cautious.Economists expect that the pressure on household finances will translate into a drop in retail sales volumes in official figures due to be released on Thursday. A Reuters poll points to a 0.8% drop in sales in May after a  when Easter holidays and warm weather appeared to buoy trade.Beyond the retail sector there have been signs of a slowdown in other parts of the economy, with official figures last week showing output in the manufacturing and construction sectors missed expectations on the latest measures. A survey from Lloyds bank on Monday will add to the mood of caution. It suggested most regions in England suffered a slowdown across manufacturing and services firms in May.Business activity in England continued to grow, but the rate of expansion fell to a three-month low, according to the Lloyds regional purchasing managers＊ index (PMI). Wales, by contrast, enjoyed a pick-up in business activity growth.Gareth Oakley at Lloyds Banking Group highlighted that the survey＊s price measures had come down from recent highs, easing some of the pressure on businesses.※Although there were some signs that political uncertainty and a squeeze on household budgets from rising prices had dampened growth rates, businesses across England and Wales reported further increases in both output and new orders in May,§ he added."															
"The UK has slumped to the bottom of the league table of advanced economies after  registered stellar growth in the first three months of the year.Canada was the final member of the G7 to report its growth figures, which confirmed the UK as officially the joint worst performing member so far this year. The announcement marked a significant decline for the UK economy, which a year ago was outshining Germany, the US and Japan. In February it was announced that .However, the latest figures for Canada, which showed that growth accelerated to 0.9% in the first quarter, putting it top of the  performers, has left Britain languishing alongside Italy at the bottom of the table. Germany is in second spot at 0.6%, followed by Japan with 0.5%, France 0.4% and the US at 0.3%. The UK and Italy are then level on growth of just 0.2%. provides the latest evidence that the early resilience to the EU referendum result last June is now wearing off as higher inflation puts consumers under pressure.  because the referendum result sent the pound sharply lower and has raised the cost of imports to the UK. That higher inflation has hit household budgets and dented the main driver of UK growth, consumer spending.The Bank of England said earlier this month that it expected  from 1.8% in 2016. But it warned that living standards would fall this year because inflation would be higher than pay growth.Credit ratings agency Moody＊s added on Wednesday that the Brexit-related slowdown in the UK had been more modest than expected and that it had raised its forecast for growth this year to 1.5% from 1%. It added: ※Nonetheless, Moody＊s still expects weaker growth as investment spending slows as  negotiations get under way and consumers feel the impact of accelerating inflation.§There do not appear to be any such concerns in Canada, however, where the national statistics agency said real gross domestic product grew at an annualised rate of 3.7% in the first three months of the year, helped most recently by a boost to household spending and a turnaround in business investment. The figure was below expectations of 3.9%, according to Thomson Reuters, but was still lauded by economists.※At the end of the day, we have to call it strong no matter what,§ said Derek Holt, an economist at Scotiabank. ※A lot of other countries would like to be in this position. If we continue to get growth numbers like this, absent trade policy risks, it＊s going to be tougher for the Bank of Canada to avoid rate hikes at some point in the distance,§ Holt said.The Canadian economy also appeared to be on a solid footing going into the second quarter, with growth rising by a better-than-expected 0.5% in March on the back of stronger activity in the manufacturing and retail trade sectors. Growth was also supported by businesses rebuilding their inventories, which economists said could be reversed in coming quarters. Meanwhile, consumers continued to spend, particularly on vehicles. Wages rose by 1% compared with the previous quarter and the savings rate fell to 4.3% from 5.3%."															
"London＊s thriving economy generates a ?26.5bn surplus that is recycled by the government to provide financial help to Britain＊s less well-off regions, according to an official breakdown of the public finances. has demonstrated the importance of the capital and highlighted how taxes and public spending are used to narrow the north-south divide.Experimental data from the ONS showed that only three regions of the UK 每 , the south-east and the east of England 每 ran a budget surplus in the 2015-16 financial year, the latest year for which figures are available.Every Londoner provided ?3,070 more in tax revenues than they received in public spending, while people living in the south-east ran a surplus of ?1,670 per head. The east of England turned a small deficit in 2014-15 into a surplus of ?242 per head in 2015-16.By contrast, spending exceeded tax revenues by ?5,440 per head in Northern Ireland and by ?3,820 in the orth-east. Scotland, which has seen its public finances badly affected by the plunge in global oil prices, ran a deficit of ?2,830 a head.The ONS figures show that London has recovered rapidly from the financial crisis of 2007-08, which wiped out the region＊s fiscal surplus of close to ?25bn a year. The latest figures show London even more strongly in the black than it was before the crash, with a surplus up from ?18bn to ?26.5bn in the past two years.Tax receipts per head in London of ?15,750 were almost double those in the two regions raising the least revenue 每 Wales at ?7,980 and the north-east at ?8,200.Northern Ireland and Scotland attracted the highest expenditure per head, at ?14,020 and ?13,050 respectively, with the lowest expenditure per person in the south-east and east of England at ?10,580 and ?10,590 per head.Despite the tax revenues generated by London, the south-east and the east of England, the UK ran a deficit of just over ?72bn in 2015-16 每 or ?1,100 per head.The ONS said the size of the deficit had narrowed to below ?50bn in 2016-17, although the consumer-driven slowdown in spending since the start of the year meant the shortfall for the first month of the current financial year was more than ?1bn up on April 2016.Analysts said the weakness of VAT receipts were evidence of the more difficult environment for consumers during a period when prices have been rising and wage growth has been stuck at 2%.The CBI＊s latest health check of the retail sector 每 its monthly distributive trades survey 每 found that the boost to spending seen in April was short-lived. Of the 117 retailers questioned, 29% said sales were higher in May than a year earlier, while 27% said they were lower. The balance of +2 percentage points compared with +38 points in April.Alpesh Paleja, the CBI＊s principal economist, said: ※Retail sales flattened out this month, as the bounce in April unwound. It＊s clear that households are increasingly feeling the pinch, as rising inflation pushes down on real earnings. Taken together with higher import cost pressures from a weaker pound, this is creating a challenging environment for retailers.§The ONS said the ?10.4bn deficit in April was ?1.2bn higher than in the same month a year earlier. City analysts had been expecting the deficit to fall to ?8.9bn.Annual spending growth of almost 6% exceeded a rise of nearly 4% in tax receipts, reflecting the slowdown in the economy＊s growth rate from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016 to Borrowing in 2016-17 was lowered by a number of one-off factors that will not be repeated this year. As a result, the  has forecast that the deficit will rise to ?58bn in 2017-18. The OBR said the ONS estimate for April relied heavily on forecasts and the total was likely to be revised later.There was better news for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, from the ONS＊s revisions to the deficit in 2016-17, which was cut by ?3bn to ?49bn 每 the lowest since the economy was close to on the brink of recession in 2007-08."															
															
"or Donald Trump, the measure of a country＊s economic strength is its current-account balance 每 its exports of goods and services minus its imports. This idea is of course the worst kind of economic nonsense. It underpins the doctrine known as mercantilism, which comprises a hoary set of beliefs discredited more than two centuries ago. Mercantilism suggests, among other things, that  is the world＊s strongest economy, because it has the largest current-account surplus.In 2016, Germany ran a current-account surplus of roughly 270bn (?228bn), or 8.6% of GDP, making it an  of Trump＊s ire. And its bilateral trade surplus of ?51bn with the US presumably makes it an even more irresistible target. Never mind that, as a member of the eurozone, Germany has no exchange rate to manipulate. Forget that Germany is relatively open to US exports, or that its policymakers are subject to the EU＊s anti-subsidy regulations. Ignore the fact that bilateral balances are irrelevant for welfare when countries run surpluses with some trade partners and deficits with others. All that matters for Trump is that he has his scapegoat.Back in the real world, the explanation for Germany＊s external surplus is not that it manipulates its currency or discriminates against imports, but that it saves more than it invests. The correspondence of savings minus investment with exports minus imports is not an economic theory; it＊s an accounting identity. Germans collectively spend less than they produce, and the difference necessarily shows up as net exports.Germany has a high savings rate for good reason. Its population is  than most. Its sensible people are sensibly saving for retirement. They are accumulating assets now so they can de-accumulate them later, when old-age dependency ratios are higher.This is why the advice German leaders receive from White House advisers and even from some German economists 每 that Germany would be better off abandoning the euro and letting its currency appreciate 每 makes little sense. Changing the exchange rate would not diminish the incentive for Germans to save.Moreover, allowing the exchange rate to appreciate would discourage investment in capital-intensive traded-goods sectors. To be sure, a stronger currency might increase investment in services by raising the relative price of non-traded goods. But the incentive to invest in services would have to be boosted massively, given that the sector is not capital intensive, to offset lower investment in export industries.Better than fiddling with the currency would be to address saving and investment directly. Here is where the two principal parties vying in Germany＊s upcoming election differ. Chancellor Angela Merkel＊s Christian Democrats suggest cutting taxes. This makes sense insofar as the German government is a ; the 2016 budget surplus was 23.7bn, a record high.The problem is that there is no guarantee that German households, being voracious savers themselves, will spend the additional income. Extending investment tax credits to German firms might be more effective in boosting spending, but doing so would be politically problematic in a country where labor＊s share of national income is already declining.Martin Schulz＊s Social Democrats, on the other hand, favour raising public spending, by investing in infrastructure in particular. In the current European environment of near-zero interest rates, there＊s little risk that additional public investment will crowd out private investment. And Germany has massive unmet needs in health care, education, and communication and transportation infrastructure.Some will object that infrastructure and public services are nontraded goods, so more spending on them won＊t boost imports or narrow the current-account balance. But if the government, in a fully employed economy, redirects resources toward the production of non-traded goods, households and firms will have to find other ways of satisfying their demand for tradables. The only sure way of doing that is by purchasing additional imports, spending on which will inevitably increase.The question, ultimately, is why Germany should seek to reduce its current-account surplus. One answer is to get out of Trump＊s sights. A , offered by the International Monetary Fund, is that doing so would be good for a world economy in which investment is in short supply, as evidenced by record-low interest rates. It would be good for southern Europe, which needs to export more, but can only do so if someone else, like the largest northern European economy, imports more.Most of all, more investment in infrastructure, health, and education would be good for Germany itself. Well-targeted public investment can raise productivity and boost living standards, ameliorate concerns about inequality, and address Germany＊s economic weaknesses. For example, there are exactly  in the top 50 globally. More public funds would make a difference. ※The world＊s strongest economy§ can do better."															
"redit where it＊s due. After the accounting catastrophe in Italy and a big fine from Ofcom for overcharging for broadband access on the home front, . It has awarded no bonus to chief executive Gavin Patterson and the outgoing finance director. It has clawed back bonuses from both men for past years because the Italian scandal caused a ?268m overstatement of profits. That penalty will cost Patterson ?338,000. His incentive package for this year has also been reduced because the share price is 25% lower than a year ago.In a rational world, praise would be unnecessary. After BT＊s hellish year, any bonus would have been outrageous, as Patterson happily agreed. Yet too many other companies, confronted by equal share-price disasters for investors, fail to apply common sense.Elizabeth Corley, chair of Pearson＊s remuneration committee, should call her BT counterpart, Tony Ball, for a lesson in what using ※discretion§ means. , an astonishing decision that triggered .Corley herself suffered an embarrassing 27% vote against her re-election, but Ball can probably expect to be returned at BT with the usual Soviet-style majority. Once upon a time, Ball＊s own pay demands were deemed so excessive by ITV that . On this occasion, his hard-nosed approach was spot-on.To complete the package, BT will terminate PriceWaterhouseCoopers as auditor. The aim is to get a new firm in place next year, which resolves Patterson＊s previous odd vagueness about PwC＊s future. The auditor can＊t grumble. , which was uncovered by investigators summoned from KPMG after a whistleblower＊s tip-off, may have been sophisticated but its size was enormous. It shouldn＊t happen at a large FTSE 100 company.The smack of firm governance will give BT＊s shareholders some comfort as they assess a year in which almost the only bright spot was the clean integration of mobile operator EE. The public sector market was weak, the global services division needs a job-cutting overhaul, and the TV business ended the year with a ※soft§ quarter.Overall, top-line operating profits were ?7.6bn, against an original goal of ?7.9bn, and this year＊s outcome could be ?7.5bn. The differences sound slight but they mean this year＊s dividend, while still being ※progressive§ in the jargon, won＊t progress by the previously-promised 10%. The shares fell 4.5% to a whisker below 300p, a price seen as long ago as 2013.Non-shareholders, though, have reasons to be cheerful.  business Openreach, where Ofcom has applied its own governance shake-up by insisting on legal separation and a separate board of directors, will consult with rivals on how to invest more in fast fibre networks that run to customers＊ doors. It＊s impossible to tell yet how much extra money could flow, but this is exactly the type of development the regulator wanted to see. As with Patterson＊s non-bonus and PwC＊s exit, it＊s what we expect.Some say Mark Carney will never get the chance to raise interest rates during his term as governor of Bank of England, which is due to end in June 2019. The man himself clearly doesn＊t like the idea that the deliberations of the monetary policy committee will be a snooze-fest as far as the eye can see. Carney warned that  if inflation continues to overshoot its target and if the Brexit process is ※smooth§.Well, yes, Carney＊s scenario is plausible. The Bank underestimated inflation slightly in the last three months and, for all the argy-bargy with Jean-Claude Juncker, the market still expects the UK and EU to agree a deal. A responsible governor must also give fair warning to those credit-happy consumers who have been spending merrily.Just don＊t expect the market to take much notice of the Bank＊s hawkish squawks. Forecasts for inflation in a year＊s time were revised down slightly in Thursday＊s report. Meanwhile, the Brexit uncertainty clouds everything. The consensus in the City is that it＊ll be at least a year before the debate over raising interest rates becomes truly interesting again. That sounds about right.We can all feel a little sorry for . Yes, there was a giveaway in the subject field 每 ※The fool doth think he is wise§ 每 but the initial deceit was cutely done.The revelation in the exchange, however, was the degree of fawning gratitude that Staley was prepared to display after an annual shareholder meeting in which McFarlane came to the defence of his chief executive, who is under fire for seeking to unmask a whistleblower.※You came to my defense today with a courage not seen in many people,§ wrote Staley. ※How do I thank you? You have a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humour with grit. Thank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect for your guile.§Maybe the gushing language is an American thing. Or maybe Staley applied the lard because he thought that is what McFarlane might want to hear. But the tone jars. A chief executive who is quite so thankful for his own survival looks a little too insecure."															
"The Labour pledge to raise corporate taxes (, 10 May) is the economically responsible reaction to the failures of corporate tax competition. The deductive mathematical models from supply-side economics that justify low corporate taxation assume that ※the state§ is purely self-seeking and ※the firm§ an efficient bundle of contracts that creates wealth. They ignore the historical functions of actual states as the primary force for social integration and development in capitalist systems. They ignore the shift of actual large corporations away from the ※retain and reinvest§ model of the post-war period to the extractive ※downsize and divest§ model of the present, to use  terms.Supply-side theory insists that reduced corporate taxation equals increased productive investment and long-term wage growth, but where is the evidence for this outcome? The ※competitively§ lower taxed UK has seen slower improvements in productivity than Germany, France, Sweden, Norway or the US, which retains the highest corporation tax of all. British business expenditure on R&D as a proportion of GDP has declined in the last decade and the UK has suffered a historic drop in real wages. In an era of unprecedented corporate profits and high cash holdings the evidence for the redundancy of tax relief is remarkable: UK corporate tax cuts have apparently translated straight into higher shareholder payouts and share repurchases to further inflate the share price: ie they have been absorbed into the prevailing US and UK dynamic of financial value extraction that underpins the escalating wealth of the 1%, not an investment dynamic.Investment funds typically consider a?dividend payout ratio (the relationship?of payout to earnings) of over 55% as indicating a drain on long-term earnings potential and unsustainable. By August 2016 the ratio for the FTSE 100 stood at 107%.Large corporations may decry Labour＊s tax policy but the OECD evidence is that firms intent on long-term investment (rather than, say, mergers and acquisitions to secure tax breaks) are primarily concerned with the skills base, infrastructure and R&D. Labour＊s corporate tax policy is essential not just to help pay for this human and fixed capital investment but to wean large UK firms off the crack of wealth extraction and back to wealth creation. How can there be ＆strong and stable＊ government until that happens?cs It is encouraging that housing policies are gaining more attention in the election debates. However, there is an elephant in the room called council tax and the basis on which it is levied. A revaluation of domestic dwellings is long overdue and it is needed to put local authority finance on a sound footing. My house is in the middle band but it is now worth at least three times the average price of houses in Bristol.I can＊t be the only one who could be persuaded to pay more if by doing so it would put an end to the closure of parks, libraries, children＊s and day centres, public toilets and the continual erosion of bus services etc. These collectively provided services are vital aspects of citizenship which the market can never replace."															
" lovers are suffering a Brexit-related hangover as the price of the average bottle has soared since the referendum to hit an all-time high of ?5.56.Prices have risen more in the first three months of the year than in the past two years, according to the drinks industry, which is warning of more increases ahead.The average 75cl bottle topped ?5.50 for the first time towards the end of last year, and hit ?5.56 in the first quarter of 2017, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA).Miles Beale, its chief executive, said: ※Unfortunately, for both British businesses and consumers, we are clear that this is not a one-off adjustment, but rather that wine prices will continue to rise.§The main culprit is the weak pound. The slide in sterling prompted by the shock referendum result has driven up the cost of imported goods, which has made food, drink and other everyday items more expensive. The pound has lost 11% against the euro since the  vote. Despite a burgeoning domestic wine-growing industry, which produces about 5m bottles a year, almost all the wine sold in the UK is imported.The WSTA said Brexit＊s impact had led to a 3% increase in wine prices in the 12 weeks to 25 March, which compares with a 1% increase over the previous two years 每 2015 to 2017. For example,  of his  to ?11 from ?9.95 last December.For UK wine lovers there is worse to come. The 3.9% rise in alcohol duty announced by the chancellor in the spring budget, which took effect on 13 March, adds a further 8p to the average bottle if passed on in full by wine retailers. The WSTA had lobbied for a 2% cut in duty to help the industry.Experts predict wine prices will continue to go up as the triple whammy of Brexit, rising inflation and duty increases take their toll. . The WSTA predicted in February that the cost of an average-priced bottle of champagne would go up by 5% or ?1 per bottle, while a bottle of prosecco would increase by 9%, adding a further 59p a bottle.An alternative to imported wine is , which has gained increasing acclaim at home and abroad, although it tends to be more expensive. The small producers do not benefit from economies of scale such as those in other countries and have smaller yields because of the colder climate.The industry body said the UK had done its best to absorb rising import costs after the referendum, but it was only a matter of time before any cushioning against a weaker pound ran out and they were forced to pass on costs to consumers.Specialist wine retailer Naked Wines, owned by Majestic,, adding about 50p to some of its most popular wines, due to the weaker pound. Its chief executive, Rowan Gormley, told customers he would not ※start a war with suppliers over price§ or compromise on quality to hit profit margins.Some larger retailers such as supermarkets have put pressure on their suppliers to absorb rising costs. The weak pound has proved a boon to some UK-based merchants of fine wines, who have enjoyed rising demand from dollar buyers in Asia and the US, according to industry title Decanter. with severe delays and gridlocks, which could prompt a resurgence of alcohol smugglers. Britain imports 1.8bn bottles of wine every year worth ?2.8bn, including 1bn bottles from the EU (55%).Beale said: ※We all know that Brexit will be complicated, but something has got to give and government must start showing its support for the UK wine industry and the 275,000 jobs that our industry supports by tackling our excessive duty rates at the autumn budget.§The sector employs 172,000 people directly, in wine shops, production, bottling and trade, and supports a further 105,000 in the supply chain.More than half (56%) of what Brits paid for a bottle of wine in March, before the latest duty rise came into effect, went on alcohol duty (?2.16) and VAT (93p). Duty is even more for a bottle of sparkling wine, at ?2.77. By contrast, 14 countries in the EU have zero rates for wine. Only 21% of the price of a bottle of wine sold in France or Spain goes on tax, mainly VAT, and 19% in Germany.But this has not put Brits off drinking wine. The UK accounts for nearly 15% of the world＊s wine imports; it is the second-largest importer by volume (behind Germany) and by value (behind the US). It is the sixth-biggest market by consumption."															
"Britain should stop giving the state pension to the rich and instead spend the money on benefits for the poor, according to the .The Paris-based thinktank said that ending payments to the wealthiest 5% to 10% would allow the government to give more to people in greater need of support.Under the current system, anyone who has paid national insurance for 30 years is eligible for the , regardless of wealth.In comments reported by the , Mark Pearson, deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs with the OECD, said that like other countries, the UK faced the rising costs of an ageing population, with more pensioners and fewer people of working age.※Faced with these pressures, are you going to ask people of working age to pay more, or people to work longer before they can claim their pension?※Or another way to ensure an adequate pension is to think about whether the pension should only be paid to those who really need it, to ease the tyranny of the maths. Giving less [pension] to the people at the top would free up resources to increase general benefits.§ Pearson said Britain＊s pension system was among the least generous of the OECD＊s 35 member countries. The basic state pension is worth ?6,360 a year, and the full new state pension introduced in 2016 is worth ?8,297 a year. ※The UK pension is pretty low,§ he said.The state pension has become a key focus in the early stages of the general election campaign, with .Under the existing system, the basic state pension increases each year by the same as average earnings, the inflation rate or 2.5% 每 whichever is the highest.Tom McPhail, head of policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, rejected the OECD＊s idea of removing the state pension from the richest members of society.※It sounds like a pretty bad idea. If you want to take money away from the rich, the tax system is usually a better place to go,§ he said. ※It has the potential to be quite socially divisive and one of the essential and valuable elements of the state pension is the reasonably clear and simple entitlement structure 每 if you pay your national insurance, you will qualify for it.§McPhail added it would be politically unwise to start undermining the principles of the universal state pension, and could potentially exacerbate intergenerational tensions."															
"Worried lenders are starting to put the brakes on Britain＊s consumer borrowing binge and plan to get tougher on credit card users, according to a  survey.Its  showed they had cut access to credit in the opening months of this year and plan to limit it further. The proportion of lenders expecting to restrict access to credit between April and June was the highest since the financial crisis in 2008. Those plans will be welcomed by financial regulators after their  as Britons have racked up debt on cards, car leasing schemes and personal loans.But the prospect of households having less access to cash to spend will add to . Consumer spending has been the main driver of the robust growth that has defied gloomy forecasts from economists since the EU referendum. But there is growing evidence that the engine of growth is losing steam, with .The Bank＊s quarterly survey of lenders showed a net balance of 18.8% expect to tighten the availability of unsecured credit 每 money not borrowed against a home 每 to consumers over the second quarter of 2017. That was the highest proportion since late 2008. Lenders also reported the availability of such credit fell ※slightly§ in the first quarter of the year. It was the first drop since the autumn of 2012.There were also signs in the survey that firms had become more nervous about investing before Brexit negotiations, with demand for corporate loans affected.The news on tighter consumer lending conditions follows  to fund big purchases, such as cars, as well as day-to-day living costs as rising inflation takes a bigger chunk out of incomes.The Bank of England＊s own figures show , which includes credit cards, car loans and second mortgages 每 was up by nearly 11% in the year to November, the . The pace of growth has since .Policymakers have said they are worried about the risk to banks and other lenders from rising consumer borrowing, while charities have warned that households are becoming increasingly vulnerable to even small rises in interest rates.Reflecting its concerns, the Bank＊s financial policy committee recently announced a review into the credit quality of new lending 每 underwriting standards and the risk models used by banks. The Bank＊s survey showed credit scoring criteria for granting credit card and other unsecured loans had tightened in the first quarter. Lenders expected credit scoring criteria on credit card lending to ※tighten significantly§ in the second quarter, the Bank said.Demand for credit card lending was reported to be unchanged in the first quarter, but was expected to increase slightly in the second quarter. The Bank would be pleased that lenders had tightened credit scoring criteria and were planning to tighten them further in the second quarter, said Howard Archer, an economist at the consultancy IHS Markit.※If the fundamentals for consumers do weaken further as expected over the coming months, it is vital that banks adopt tight lending standards in granting unsecured consumer credit, or it risks causing serious debt problems for the economy,§ said Archer.※This would be reinforced if the Bank of England felt compelled to raise interest rates due to mounting concern over the potential inflation overshoot,§ he added, referring to signs inflation will continue to rise from its three-year high as the weak pound raises import costs for the UK.But the survey was not such good news for commercial banks, said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.  shares were among the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 index on Thursday.※Unsecured consumer credit is a pretty high margin business for banks, so less lending here will result in lower overall margins at the group level,§ said Hyett.For corporate lending, the Bank said its survey showed that following ※significant falls§ in demand from small and medium-sized businesses in the final three months of 2016, there were further falls in demand for lending from medium-sized businesses in the opening months of 2017.※Lower capital investment was reported to be exerting a significant drag on demand for corporate lending in the first quarter, although increased merger and acquisition activity had pushed up on demand,§ the Bank＊s report on its survey said. That echoed a survey by the British Chambers of Commerce, which found firms enjoyed an export boost from the weak pound over the first quarter but that their investment intentions remained low amid worries about rising costs and the economic outlook."															
". The euphoria that sent share prices on Wall Street to record levels has quickly dissipated amid fears that the new president is dangerously unpredictable.Evidence that Trump does not really have a clue about what he is doing is mounting by the day. The failure to get Congress to agree to a repeal of Obamacare was the first sign of trouble, since it raised questions about whether the White House would be able to pass an economic stimulus package.But there has been more to unsettle investors since then 每 much more. First there was the U-turn over Syria, then the sabre rattling over North Korea. Now Trump has decided, in flat contradiction of what he said on the campaign trail, that .The kindest interpretation of this latest flip-flop is that Trump wants to keep Beijing sweet while the US launches military action against North Korea, although this prospect is not exactly designed to make investors any less nervous. A more accurate assessment of Trump＊s first three months in the job is that he is making it up as he goes along.Not only did Trump backtrack on China＊s alleged currency manipulation in an interview with the , he hinted that Janet Yellen might after all get a second term in charge of the Federal Reserve and said he thought the dollar was getting too strong.On this last point, at least, there was some sense in what the president had to say. It is all very well sabre rattling about the imposition of tariffs and putting taxes on imports but a rising currency would blunt the impact of any protectionist measures by making US exports dearer. That＊s assuming, of course, that there will be any protectionist measures. On current form, there probably won＊t be.Trump appears to think that the strength of the dollar is a vote of confidence in him. If only. The greenback is strong because the Fed is the one major central bank in the world that is raising borrowing costs, and investors have been assuming that the US central bank will accelerate the pace of interest rate increases in response to a Trump-inspired pick-up in growth. That scenario is starting to look less likely.The response in the currency markets to Trump＊s latest comments was predictable. Traders took their signal from the White House and dumped the dollar. More significantly, perhaps, demand for gold and the Japanese yen, traditional safe havens in times of uncertainty, rose to their highest level since the US presidential election last November.Share prices remain close to their record highs but for how long? Cannier investors have taken one look at Trump＊s Dr Strangelove-style foreign policy antics and decided to park their money elsewhere. US defence stocks look like a decent bet; the rest of the stock market does not. Caveat emptor.Governors of the Bank of England have never had trouble making their feelings known. Once upon a time they did it by raising the gubernatorial eyebrows. These days they do it through the deliberations of the financial policy committee. The net result is the same. Lenders sit up and take notice.The : too much credit card debt; too many payday loans; too many cars being bought on attractive-looking finance deals. It wants lenders to be more cautious because it knows that all the conditions are in place for a credit card crash: ultra-low interest rates, a strong labour market, lenders vying with each to offer the tastiest deals and inflation rising faster than wages. There is a temptation for consumers to use debt to bridge the gap between their incomes and their spending aspirations, and plenty of lenders are only too willing to feed the habit.Lenders seem to be getting the message. The  marks a step-change. After years of making it easier to take on debt, the availability of credit fell in the first three months of 2017 and is expected to fall further in the second quarter. The result will be fewer people getting into financial trouble, less unaffordable spending and a more sustainable economy.That＊s the good news. But the survey also shows that loans to small- and medium-sized businesses have been falling, not because lenders are making it harder to borrow but because firms don＊t want to invest. That＊s bad news."															
"The bullying of disabled people can often be subtle. Over time, I＊ve become immune and also cynical. You filter out a lot of the abuse in order to get on with your life.But last week, I was at a pedestrian crossing in north London, and here＊s the question: am I being oversensitive if I react to a cyclist speeding towards me shouting abuse? He didn＊t stop and neither did I, meaning the poor dear in his black storm trooper helmet had to swerve to avoid me because I dared to be on the crossing. He did shout ※Fucking spastic!§ 每 which I suppose means he fine-tuned his abuse to include a repellent reference to impairment. I didn＊t respond. What would be the point?These days something like this seems to happen to me on a weekly basis, and I can＊t help thinking it has something to do with the way disabled people have come to feel like second-class citizens over the last seven years of coalition/Tory government. Because, apart from , or the tragic-brave subject of yet another prurient Channel 5 documentary, we＊re all fakes, aren＊t we? Lazy scroungers.A recent report by the  shows that in many areas 每 the report highlights nine 每 the situation for disabled people has gone backwards. It notes that 18.4% of disabled 16-64s in the UK are considered to be in food poverty, compared with 7.5% of non-disabled people; at least 47% of the housing benefit claimants affected by the so-called ※bedroom tax§ have a disability; and material deprivation rates for families which include a disabled person are 59%, compared with 36% of the total population. The report also shows that disability hate crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales increased 44% in 2015/2016.Crucially, the report emphasises continuing poor access to transport and other services, ※creating a barrier to independence ＃ and enjoyment of day to day activities.§ The report also notes an overall increase ※in the percentage of disabled adults who reported having difficulty accessing services in areas of health, benefits, tax, culture, sport and leisure§. In 2012每14, 45.3% of disabled people experienced these difficulties, compared with 31% of non-disabled people.When you become disabled 每 and 83% of impairments and health conditions are acquired in adult life 每 you immediately fall into this low, mostly disregarded social status, and experience heightened risk of social exclusion. If your social care package is cut, for example, and you lose direct assistance in getting out of bed, or organising appropriate transport, your opportunities to leave the house immediately plummet. If you can＊t get to a pub or your favourite shop, or if you can＊t maintain contact with friends, then your presence, input and visibility in your community decreases exponentially. Frankly, non-disabled society forgets you exist and when you fight to break out of this exclusion, to claim your rightful place in society, you suddenly become an easy target.Exclusion has defined disabled people in the public imagination as being powerless, and lacking fundamental rights. And this stigmatisation and alienation, in my experience, drives an increase in bullying and abuse. Name-calling has of course been around for ever, and is always directed at those perceived as different and the other. I＊ve experienced it all my life, but it＊s changed significantly in recent years because it seems government-sanctioned. There is a nasty, insidious economic rationale to all this: you lot cost money, therefore you don＊t belong and you＊re taking up unnecessary space and resources.Theatre maker and comedian Jess Thom, co-founder of the project  has written about a jaw-dropping experience she had on public transport, when she was subjected to a barrage of abuse, including . Three months ago, my car was keyed the day I had my blue badge displayed. A friend reports that she was harassed out of a restaurant for needing help to eat. Elsewhere, another was told he couldn＊t come in 每 aggressively 每 because ※that thing§, his wheelchair, wouldn＊t fit in there. These experiences can make disabled people feel they don＊t want to face the world. Getting on the bus can feel like going into battle 每 because if there is any issue with the ramp, or if there＊s enough space to accommodate a wheelchair (now supposedly a legal right for us) 每 there＊s always the looming potential for bullying. I＊ve been bullied off a bus by passengers 每 an incident which reached its height when the driver joined in. The bullying included remarks about my wheelchair, its position on the bus, and references to me and my physical impairments.Aged campaigner that I am, it＊s hard to know what new initiatives will change these ingrained attitudes; we can only keep telling our stories and work to dismantle the social construct that separates disabled people from the non-disabled. Remove the barrier: enforce the Equalities Act. This means genuinely addressing issues of access at all levels, from access to a workplace to provision of accessible formats 每 from large print to audio description, British Sign Language and subtitling.At a local level, disabled people＊s organisations have campaigned tirelessly to improve our environment, and this is evident in dropped kerbs, tactile paving, access to council buildings and services. The change has been significant in my lifetime, but even so, we remain second-class citizens, and disabled people must be part of the equation of intersectionality, inclusion and diversity, every single time. Perhaps some humans will always bully other humans, but exposing the chronic levels of abuse disabled people experience 每 and the second-class status that contributes to this 每 has to be a start in addressing it."															
"A prolonged period of low interest rates will tempt banks to take greater risks and sound the death knell for final salary pensions, the  has warned.A new study from the IMF said a continuation of the cheap borrowing environment seen since the global financial crisis a decade ago would pose a ※significant challenge§ to financial institutions and force them to make fundamental changes to their business models. Although interest rates , the IMF said Japan＊s experience suggested an imminent and permanent end to the current low interest rate environment could not be guaranteed. Some economists, such as the former US treasury secretary Larry Summers, say the global economy is gripped by so-called , in which excessive savings and weak investment lead to weaker growth and lower interest rates.The IMF, in a chapter from its forthcoming Global Financial Stability Review, said the decline in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates since the mid-1980s had been caused by slow-moving structural factors such as weaker growth and the desire of an ageing population to save more for their retirement. It was possible that the pace of innovation had slowed, while rising savings and an appetite for advanced-country financial assets in emerging nations had also put downward pressure on interest rates in the west over the past 15 years.Japan has had ultra-low interest rates for almost three decades, while other developed countries cut borrowing costs aggressively in response to the deep financial and economic crisis that began almost a decade ago.The Bank of England held borrowing costs at 0.5% for more than seven years , the lowest level in its 323-year history. The European Central Bank has adopted a similar approach and its president, Mario Draghi, has said there would be no early rate rise for the eurozone.The IMF said a low interest rate environment would hit the earnings of banks and pose ※long-lasting challenges for life insurers and defined-benefit pensions funds§.It added: ※Smaller, deposit-funded and less diversified banks would be hurt most, which could increase the pressure to consolidate. As banks reach for yield at home and abroad, new financial stability challenges may arise in their home and host markets. These hypotheses are supported by the experience of Japanese banks.§Life insurers and pension funds would probably need to raise more capital because permanently low interest rates would make it more difficult to make the returns needed to fund existing liabilities taken on when borrowing costs were higher.The IMF said defined-benefit schemes 每 already under threat in many developed countries 每 would tend to become less attractive than defined-contribution schemes, where the risk is taken by the employee rather than the employer.The study said ageing populations would mean a reduction in demand for credit but increase demand for health and long-term care insurance. Smaller banks would need to consolidate and policymakers would need to beware of calls for a softer touch regulatory regime.※Prudential frameworks would need to provide incentives to ensure longer-term stability instead of falling prey to demands for deregulation to ease the short-term pain,§ the IMF said.It said efforts should be made not just to facilitate consolidation of smaller banks but also to ※limit excessive risk-taking and avoid a worsening of the too-big-to-fail problem§.The IMF＊s view that low interest rates might be here to stay was challenged by the ratings agency Fitch, which said borrowers should prepare for a significant shift in the global interest rate environment over the next few years.Fitch said it expected US real interest rates to increase to levels that were more closely aligned with the country＊s economic growth potential, taking them close to pre-crisis levels. ※With the Fed having now achieved its inflation and employment objectives, becoming more focused on the risk of labour market tightening and starting to discuss the unwinding of its balance sheet, we expect interest rate normalisation will take place by 2020 and that the Fed Funds rate will reach 3.5% to 4%,§ said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch. Markets currently believe the Fed will need to make only modest adjustments to official US interest rates in the coming years, with the Fed Funds rate unlikely to rise much above 2% by 2020. Fitch said it did not accept that there had been a lasting shift to a new equilibrium."															
"European diplomats based in the UK say the British government is stepping back from its threat to leave the EU without a trade deal if negotiations break down.In private, say diplomats, UK officials recognise the ※havoc§ that this would cause, and have come to regret the threat to turn the UK into a deregulated offshore tax haven, implicit in  in January, when she warned that ※no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal§.They claim the conciliatory signals from UK government officials are an attempt to lower the temperature asthe prime minister prepares to send the UK＊s article 50 letter on Wednesday, triggering the start of two years of intensive  negotiations.Many EU diplomats told the UK government in the wake of May＊s Lancaster House speech that the threat jarred with the tone of the rest of what she said, and had made it harder to build a political consensus for a deal in .One UK-based ambassador, with deep knowledge of the , said: ※They [British ministers] have realised that ＆no deal is better than a bad deal＊ won＊t fly. They are worried about people in this country who have an ideological and political intention of creating chaos. The civil service have told them it would create havoc.§The EU diplomats revealed their anxiety that May has been too willing to bend to the prevailing wind with some of her own backbenchers and the Brexit-supporting press, setting up expectations that they believe she will struggle to meet.One source said the decision of Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, to be as open as possible about the talks is in part an attempt to educate the UK public about the dangers of not reaching a deal, and leaving the bloc on what is known as World Trade Organisation terms.※It is not possible to overestimate the threat the UK press poses to reaching a deal. We have to counteract that by being open,§ said one diplomat.In briefings given to EU diplomats, British civil servants and ministers have told the EU governments not to expect anything substantially new in the article 50 letter when it is delivered on Wednesday, although there may be some clarification about the extent to which the government is willing to countenance a transitional deal or implementation phase.The diplomats added that for the first time there have been hints from the UK government suggesting they might accept a continued role for the European court of justice as arbiter in any transition, a point emphasised by Barnier in his speech last week. The issue of the jurisdiction during a transition, although not fundamental to the final deal, is likely to be one of the most difficult to negotiate, as it could mean May having to accept that the UK will still be subject to the jurisdiction of the ECJ at the time of the next general election in 2020. EU sources said it would not be possible for trade disputes between the UK and the EU over the single market rules to be decided by the UK supreme court.The source said that in private UK civil servants accepted ※that the UK, as part of a transitional arrangement, could stay in the customs union for a limited period of time. But they don＊t want to go public on this.§ Civil servants have acknowledged that the number of goods that would need to be tracked would rise from 17m to 350m a year.The diplomats also predicted that the UK was likely to change its rhetoric towards immigration, suggesting that the British realised that strict limits on immigration were a bad idea for British society and the economy, and there was a need to focus more on control and not quantitative limits. ※They will talk themselves out of the 100,000 [limit] thing,§ one diplomat said. Diplomats point out the number of migrants likely to be seeking to enter the UK from the EU is set to decline since growth is picking up on the continent and there will be greater competition for labour.The sources added that they had been told to expect the first round of negotiations to focus on technical issues of how the talks will be conducted. Thereafter, the issues of the Irish border, citizens＊ rights and the bill for the divorce settlement are expected to dominate discussions until after the German elections in September.The diplomats insist that the EU will not be raising a specific sum that needs to be reimbursed by the UK, but instead will talk about the principles underlying any calculation. The money is ※peanuts in the big picture§, the source added.Diplomats insist EU countries will refuse to discuss giving the UK access to their markets post-Brexit until Britain reveals whether it will discriminate against EU goods."

"larm bells are jangling at the Bank of England. Households have been on a borrowing binge.  is being underpinned by debt, with an increased dependency on personal loans, payday loans, car finance and 每 in particular 每 credit cards. 每 and rightly so. Household debt as a proportion of national income peaked at 160% at the time of the financial crisis and fell only modestly thereafter. Now 每 having bottomed out at 140% of GDP 每 the ratio is on the rise again.The Bank＊s financial policy committee wants to know whether the increase marks a return to the bad old days when lenders put themselves in jeopardy by making it far too easy to obtain credit. A report into credit quality being conducted by the  will be the trigger for action if it finds that competition for business has led to a dilution in credit quality.It seems improbable that the PRA will come to any other conclusion. As the Bank said in its  report, consumer credit growth exceeded 10% in the year to December 2016. Lenders have slashed the cost of borrowing: the interest rate on a ?10,000 unsecured loan has fallen from 10% in 2009 to below 4% currently. There has also been a marked lengthening in interest-free periods available for those who transfer their credit card balances.Some loosening of credit conditions has been justified. Unemployment is low and the past couple of years have seen chunky increases in real disposable income. Lenders are in better financial shape than they were during the financial crisis and many households have used a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates to improve the state of their finances.That said, the growth in credit is too strong for comfort and if lenders do not of their own accord start making debt harder to come by, the Bank should force them to do so. Why? Because all the ingredients 每 bar one 每 are now in place for a traditional UK credit boom-bust. The economy is slowing, real incomes have started to fall, the housing market has run out of steam and unemployment is projected to start rising.Britain has been here before, many times. The current cycle began halfway through the last parliament, when the government provided incentives to lend and encouraged mortgage demand on the grounds that debt-driven growth was better than no growth. Five years later, the only thing lacking is a tightening of interest-rate policy from the Bank. It would take only a modest increase in interest rates to cause serious distress.The government has been left with copious amounts of egg on its face over the built in the 1960s. Greg Clark, the business secretary, has been forced to terminate a 14-year clean-up contract nine years early, and his department will have to pay compensation of almost ?100m because because the procurement process was mishandled to the detriment of two companies that bid for the contract.Clark is clearly extremely unhappy. He admitted there would be serious financial consequences from the ※defective§ way in which the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority had conducted the procurement process. The Magnox decommissioning has been an expensive fiasco from the start.The NDA erred not once but twice. Firstly, it was found by the high court to have ※manipulated§ and ※fudged§ a tender process for the ?6.1bn decommissioning, which tipped the process against a consortium of two US companies: Energy Solutions and Bechtel.Secondly, the NDA vastly underestimated the amount of work needed on the reactors, resulting in such a material change to the original specification that the contract will be put out for tender again. Decommissioning is a complex process and always costly. Even so, Clark＊s Labour shadow, Rebecca Long-Bailey, was right when she said there had been dramatic levels of incompetence.The short-term cost of all this will be the payouts to Energy Solutions and Bechtel, but this will doubtless be just a downpayment on a much bigger bill for a new decommissioning contract beginning in 2019. This is not the first procurement scandal and it is not the last, but it should lead to a rethink of who每 apart from the lawyers 每 is benefiting. Getting private firms to tender for public contracts is supposed to save taxpayers money, not cost them a bundle."															
"The  has asked UK banks, insurers and other financial institutions to draw up comprehensive plans for how they will deal with Britain＊s exit from the European Union, and will scrutinise them closely.Two days before Theresa May＊s government plans to  and begin two years of negotiation over the UK＊s departure, the Bank said City institutions would have to provide copies of contingency plans to reassure regulators that they were ready for ※a range of possible outcomes§. The Bank＊s financial policy committee (FPC) said after its last quarterly meeting: ※Risks to financial stability will be influenced by the orderliness of the adjustment to the new relationship between the UK and EU. The FPC will oversee contingency plans to mitigate risks to financial stability as the process unfolds.§  in January that the UK＊s departure from the EU was no longer seen as the biggest domestic threat to British financial stability compared with a year ago, though he added that Brexit could amplify some of the domestic risks.The FPC highlighted rapid growth in UK consumer credit and ※elevated§ global risks, mainly due to rising debt levels in China, as the main threats to Britain＊s banking system. The central bank launched a review into the credit quality of new lending 每 underwriting standards and the risk models used by banks 每 and said it would scrutinise these findings over the coming months. Banks also face a new, tougher, longer-term test of their financial resilience as part of the FPC＊s annual health check of the UK banking system, the outcome of which is expected to be published at the end of November.UK household borrowings were high by past standards and had begun to rise in relation to incomes, the FPC said. Consumer credit 每 the single largest slice of UK banks＊ balance sheets 每 has been growing rapidly, by more than 10% year-on-year, initially driven by car finance, the Bank warned. Last year banks had ?19bn of impairments on credit cards, compared with ?12bn on mortgage loans. Consumer credit now poses a greater risk than buy-to-let lending to landlords, which has cooled over the past year. Risks from Britain＊s commercial property sector have also been reduced after a fall in prices, the FPC said.The Bank＊s stress tests on seven leading lenders this year will for the first time include an exploratory scenario that will examine banks＊ resilience over seven years of weak global growth, low interest rates and high legal costs and fines for misconduct, and look at the viability of their business models.It will be conducted every other year, in addition to the regular annual stress test, which puts banks through another hypothetical scenario that tests their ability to weather a severe economic shock over a five-year period.Last year Royal Bank of Scotland, which is 73% owned by UK taxpayers, , while Barclays and Standard Chartered also struggled."															
"The global aerospace industry enjoyed a surge in aircraft orders in February, putting it on track for another record year of deliveries and boosting the UK economy.The number of commercial aircraft ordered by airlines jumped to 43 last month from just four in February 2016, according to ADS, the industry trade association.The figures are based on orders for the planemakers Airbus, , Canada＊s Bombardier, the Chinese state-owned firm Comac and Russia＊s Irkut. Growth was driven mainly by demand for single-aisle planes designed for short-haul travel.The industry delivered 100 aircraft to customers over the month, with a value of up to ?2bn to the UK economy. This value is from research and development and the manufacturing that take place in the country.  employs about 15,000 people in the UK and makes the wings for its planes at its factory in Broughton, north Wales.The number of deliveries in February was down slightly from 102 in the same month last year. A total of 1,443 commercial aircraft rolled off production lines last year, breaking the record for a sixth year. Nonetheless, ADS is forecasting deliveries will rise by 6%-7% this year to more than 1,500 new aircraft.Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS Group, said: ※Today＊s figures demonstrate continued success for the UK aerospace industry and good prospects for the rest of 2017. The industry is looking to build on 2016＊s record year for deliveries, as all major aircraft companies look to increase their production rates.§There was a backlog of 13,436 commercial aircraft on order in February, worth about ?220bn to UK industry. This is the third-highest backlog on record for civil aerospace, according to ADS.The aerospace industry has been held up by the government as a poster child for British manufacturing because it is a source of highly skilled jobs and has benefited from close collaboration with the government.However, the Brexit vote has created uncertainty about whether major employers such as Airbus could look to move manufacturing for the next generation of aircraft to other locations.Everitt said that it would be crucial for the UK to secure a good deal with the EU in Brexit negotiations so companies had the confidence to invest in Britain. ※, starting a two-year process to determine the UK＊s exit terms from the European Union.

"The UK＊s official statistics office is looking into using traffic sensors, mobile photo data and satellite images as new ways of measuring the shape of the economy.The  (ONS) is opening a new data science campus at its headquarters in Newport, south Wales, on Monday as part of a ?17m investment in the way the UK collects and presents data.It will explore new ways of measuring the economy, including using traffic sensors to gauge activity, mobile phone data to track commuter patterns and satellite images to estimate populations.The ONS is under pressure to present more timely and broader insights into the economy following criticism that official statistics  A  by the former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean last year called for the ONS to be more innovative and for economic statistics to be modernised.Number-crunchers at the new ONS hub have been tasked with harvesting information from the growing collection of  that has been created by new technology and the internet. Tom Smith, managing director of the new campus, said: ※There is a recognition at ONS that there is a real opportunity and a real need to step up our game in terms of the way we use those data sources and the techniques and the capacity that we have across ONS and across government.※I want to take some of that expertise that is used to sell advertising in the commercial space and use that to understand the world for public and social good.§The ONS will work with universities, governments, charities and businesses on developing its use of data. At the opening on Monday, data scientists and apprentices at the new campus will hear from the non-profit foundation  about how it uses satellite images and mobile phone data to map populations and track migration.Smith said the ONS could also use ※street level data§, such as the images on , to track economic activity. ※For example, can we say from the imagery that we have what this neighbourhood might look like in terms of deprivation levels, poverty levels, what businesses and economic growth is happening there. That brings in again a very different data source,§ he said ahead of the launch.The ONS will not look at individual data from mobile phones, Smith added, but aggregated data from a collection of devices could be a useful source of information on the economy.※Mobile phone ownership and use during the day can tell you something about where people are moving to, so home-to-office migration patterns,§ he said. ※But also the amount the phone is used gives you something around economic usage indicators.§Another international partner presenting to the ONS on Monday is its counterpart in the Netherlands.  will explain how it has used data from about 60,000 road sensors around the country. ※They give you a minute-by-minute readout of the amount of traffic passing and they are using that as an indicator of what＊s happening in terms of patterns of economic activity,§ Smith said."															
"Several  the European Union are among the most vulnerable to the economic impact of Brexit, according to new research published as the government prepares to trigger article 50.Researchers at the thinktank  studied regional differences in the reliance on exports to the EU, use of European workers and receipt of support grants. It found that Wales, the north-east and east Midlands all showed relatively heavy dependence despite being home to a preponderance of leave voters.The government hopes to soften the impact of leaving the single market by striking a new free trade agreement, but with EU , there are growing fears that it will instead crash out of the union without a deal.In this scenario, exporters would be forced to rely on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, which include  for many agricultural products and manufactured goods such as cars. The three regions that rely most on European markets are Wales, which sends 67% of its exports to the EU, the north-east at 62%, and Yorkshire and Humberside at 55%.The exercise also assumed that regional support funds from Brussels and easy access to European labour would disappear after , both factors with a disproportionate impact on certain regions.※Despite overwhelmingly voting in favour of leaving the European Union, Wales stands to be the region worst hit by the UK＊s departure from the EU,§ concluded the Demos report. ※Wales is also one of the UK＊s two leading exporters to the , with over 60% of its exports going to the EU, and so would be most affected by potential tariffs.§The correlation is not entirely one-way. Demos also found that leading remain parts of the country such as London and Northern Ireland would be among the hardest hit, while leave-voting areas such as the West Midlands, north-west and south-west would be less affected.None of the 12 regions studied recorded anything less than a medium risk of harm in one of the three categories, though Scotland 每 which voted heavily in favour of remaining 每 was among those with the least to fear. Researchers admit that the exercise can only provide a partial glimpse into what might happen due the large uncertainty over the course of negotiations. They were also unable to quantify the likely impact on service sector exports, which are not covered by WTO rules, and would see further pain heaped on regions such as London.Nonetheless, the regional analysis was supported by a separate exercise that looked at the impact on particular industrial sectors. ※With tariffs imposed on British goods at the levels currently faced by non-EU states, industries at risk of being hit by the highest duties will be agriculture, forestries and fishing; mining and quarrying; and manufacturing,§ it said. ※As a result of tariff changes, UK producers of dairy products, confectionery, alcohol and tobacco will be hit with the costliest duties, with the highest tariffs of exports into the EU at 33.5% for dairy produce.§With Wales in particular facing the possibility of extremely high barriers on the export of lamb to Europe as well as a  that is nearly three times higher than any other part of the country, the Demos research points to a high economic price for its decision to back Brexit."															
"The government＊s new ?3bn apprenticeship levy threatens to deepen Britain＊s north-south divide, according to a new analysis, with London and the south-east benefiting most from the government＊s shakeup of staff training.The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has warned that the  will raise less money and have a smaller impact in the areas that need it most. These areas are those that have been hit by deindustrialisation and suffer from low levels of qualifications, low productivity and low pay.The new levy is designed to increase the number and quality of apprenticeships in the UK, with the government aiming to create 3 million new placements by 2020. It will be paid by employers in England with a payroll of more than ?3m and charged at a rate of 0.5% of their annual wage bill. The Treasury has estimated it will raise nearly ?3bn a year.The government has championed its apprenticeship push as creating more opportunities for young people and for those people already in work who need new skills to progress. Justine Greening, the education secretary, has described apprenticeship schemes, where people earn and learn at the same time, as ※§.But the IPPR said its analysis of official figures suggested a disproportionate amount of investment would be stimulated in London and the south-east, where there was a relatively high number of big employers. Those areas have 38% of the UK＊s large businesses that would be targeted by the levy, but higher levels of employment and only 27% of the population, IPPR＊s research found. Clare McNeil, IPPR associate director for work and families, said: ※The government has said that it wants to break down the barriers to social mobility faced by young people in this country. It is clear to see that young people outside of London and the south-east face a much harder time finding a first job or training opportunity 每 particularly those not going on to university.※It is extraordinary then that the government has not analysed the regional impact of its new apprenticeships policy, which is likely to boost investment in training precisely in those areas where employment is higher, such as in London and the south-east, leaving unemployment hotspots in the north-east or Yorkshire with proportionately less funding.§The government has sought to underscore how some of its funding will be targeted at young people most in need of help getting on a career path. Under the new system, employers that are too small to pay the levy 每 around 98% of those in England 每 will have 90% of the costs of training paid for by the state. Extra support will also be available for employers with fewer than 50 employees who take on 16- to 18-year-old apprentices or young care leavers. Responding to the IPPR report, the apprenticeships and skills minister, Robert Halfon, said: ※I have been clear that everyone should benefit from our reforms to apprenticeships and there is no evidence of a north-south divide. We currently have the highest number of apprentices on record, with 900,000 this parliament and with numbers consistently high across the whole country.※We truly are investing in the whole of England by doubling funding for apprenticeships to ?2.5bn by 2019-20 每 twice what was spent in 2010-11 每 and giving employers more power than ever before to design training that meets their needs. §The IPPR is urging the government to change the apprenticeship levy system to redistribute some of the money collected to areas with the biggest training needs. It also wants a broader levy that would apply to all employers with 50 or more staff in order to raise more money.※Unless it changes the policy to ensure that investment is distributed more fairly between north and south, it will exacerbate existing regional disparities in opportunity for young people,§ McNeil said."															
" was in the summer of 1975. For those whose memories don＊t stretch that far back it was the time of the UK＊s first referendum on EU membership, Harold Wilson was prime minister and inflation was at at postwar peak of more than 25%.The contrast with today＊s labour market is stark. Joblessness stands at 4.7%, a level that many economists would consider close to full employment, yet there is not the glimmer of the upward pressure on wages that was so evident in the mid-70s.Back then, increases in the cost of living were matched by demands for higher pay, which in turn led to higher inflation. Eventually, governments of both left and right resorted to statutory incomes policies as they sought to bring inflation down.The latest data from the suggests that the UK now has a non-statutory incomes policy, enforced by employers rather than by Whitehall. Unemployment in the three months to January 2017 was 105,000 lower than in the previous quarter and employment was up by 92,000.Yet, wage pressure over the same period abated. Average earnings in the three months to January were 2.3% higher than a year earlier: in the three months to December 2016 they rose at an annual rate of 2.6%.These figures speak volumes about the modern labour market and in particular how the balance of power has shifted in the past four decades. Even when jobs are relatively plentiful and inflation is picking up, workers are unwilling or unable to press for higher pay.The reasons for this transformation is obvious: deindustrialisation and the growth of employment in the non-unionised service sector; curbs on the power of trade unions; an increase in labour supply. In addition, the one area where trade union density remains high 每 the public sector 每 is subject to a 1% pay cap. Here at least, statutory incomes policy lives on.While record levels of employment are welcome, the weakness of pay means that consumer spending is going to be squeezed hard over the coming months. Inflation is running at 1.8% and will soon overtake earnings growth. Most people will keep their jobs and they will still be able to afford their mortgages because the lack of any wage pressure means the will keep interest rates ultra low. But the feelgood factor will be noticeable by its absence."															
"t was one of . Before, during and after the 2010 general election, the man who served as David Cameron＊s chancellor for six years blamed his austerity measures on Labour＊s failure to ※fix the roof while the sun was shining§.What goes around comes around. The Office for Budget Responsibility was set up by Osborne in 2010 to keep tabs on the state of the public finances free from the clutches of politicians and has now published its . The UK has had a recession once in every decade since the 1970s and there is a 50% chance of there being another one in the next five years. Recessions play havoc with the public finances: three of those since the 1970s have seen the budget deficit 每 the difference between what the government spends and its income in any one year 每 rise to 6% or more.※Given their near inevitability, but unpredictable timing, there is little policymakers can do in advance beyond recognising that they will need to accept their fiscal costs at some point in the future,§ the report said. ※This is one reason why academic research and International Monetary Fund advice says that governments should aim to create fiscal space in normal times.§ Creating fiscal space in normal times is just a posh way of saying governments should fix the roof while the sun is shining.So how is the repair job going? Well, the good news is that the deficit is now running at only a quarter of its 10% peak. The bad news is that the ratio of national debt to national income 每 the accumulation of all the deficits racked up down the years 每 has doubled since the start of the crisis. The roof has not been fixed at a time when both short-term and long-term pressures are building.In the short term, Theresa May＊s government eased up on the deficit reduction plan inherited from Cameron and saw the result of the election as evidence of ※austerity§ fatigue. The cost of the overnment＊s survival 每 a ?1bn package of financial support for Northern Ireland 每 has led to demands for higher spending in other areas, most notably public sector pay.Longer term, the population is getting older, which means that health care costs are inevitably going to rise. That needs to be taken into account when the government is making its fiscal plans.So does the impact of Brexit. While the OBR＊s report was careful to make no assessment of the cost of leaving the EU, it did stress how sensitive the public finances were to even quite modest changes in the economy＊s long-term economic performance. Should the economy＊s long-term trend growth rate fall by 0.1 percentage point as a result of weaker trade and investment following departure from the EU, there would be a slow-burn effect on the public finances. Over 50 years, the cumulative impact of weaker growth and lower tax receipts would lead to the debt to GDP ratio being 50 percentage points higher.Even before Brexit, the OBR had been forced to reassess some of its key assumptions by virtue of the economy＊s failure to bounce back from the financial crisis and the deep slump of 2007-09. For many years it kept predicting that productivity growth would recover to its long-term trend of 2.2%. But this estimate was cut twice in 2016 每 first to 2% and then to 1.8%.It is always tempting, the OBR notes, for a government to indulge in a few tax and spending giveaways on the basis that the money will be clawed back by takeaways tomorrow. ※The risk there, of course, is that tomorrow never comes.§"															
"ince the ※Great Recession§ of 2007-09, the world＊s major central banks have kept short-term interest rates at near-zero levels. In the United States, even after the Federal Reserve＊s recent increases, short-term rates remain below 1%, and long-term interest rates on major government bonds are similarly low. Moreover, major central banks have supported markets at a record level by buying up huge amounts of debt and holding it.Why is all this economic life support necessary, and why for so long?It would be an oversimplification to say that the Great Recession caused this. Long-term real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates did not really reach low levels during the 2007-09 period. If one looks at a  over the last 35 years, one sees a fairly steady downward trend, with nothing particularly unusual about the Great Recession. The yield rate was 3.5% in 2009, at the end of the recession. Now it is just over 2%.Much the same is true of real interest rates. During the Great Recession, the  reached almost 3% at one point, and was almost 2% at the recession＊s end. Since then, the 10-year TIPS yield has mostly declined and stayed low, at 0.5% in May 2017.The fact that people are willing to tie up their money for 10 years at such low rates suggests that there has been a long trend towards pessimism, reflected in the recent popularity of the term ※secular stagnation§ to describe a perpetually weak economy. After former US Treasury secretary  used the term in a November 2013  at the International Monetary Fund, the New York Timescolumnist Paul Krugman , and it went viral from there.Although secular stagnation became a meme five years after the 2008 financial crisis, the term itself is much older. It first appeared in Harvard University economist Alvin Hansen＊s  to the American Economic Association, in December 1938, and in his published the same year.Hansen described the ※essence of secular stagnation§ as ※sick recoveries which die in their infancy and depressions which feed on themselves and leave a hard and seemingly immovable core of unemployment§. When Hansen delivered his speech, he expected the US economy＊s economic stagnation to persist indefinitely. The depression that had started with the stock market crash of 1929 was approaching its 10th year, and the second world war had not yet arrived. Only after the war began, in 1939, did the stagnation end.Hansen＊s Great Depression-era theory of secular stagnation was based on an observation about the US birth rate, which was unusually low in the 1930s, after having already declined dramatically by the late 1920s. Fewer births perpetuated the stagnation, Hansen surmised, because people did not need to spend as much on children, and felt less need to invest in the future. Indeed, according to World Bank statistics, the global average  has also fallen since the 2008 financial crisis. But low fertility had nothing to do with that crisis in particular, given that birth rates have been steadily declining for the better part of a century.Another explanation is that the 2008 crisis is lingering in our minds, in the form of heightened fear that rare but consequential ※black swan§ events could be imminent, despite moderately strong  and relatively low financial-market volatility (with some exceptions). A  by New York University＊s Julian Kozlowski, Laura Veldkamp and Venky Venkateswaran argues that it is rational to harbour such fears, because once a formerly unthinkable event actually occurs, one is justified in not forgetting it.My own theory about today＊s stagnation focuses on growing angst about rapid advances in technologies that could eventually replace many or most of our jobs, possibly fueling massive economic inequality. People might be increasingly reluctant to spend today because they have vague fears about their long-term employability 每 fears that may not be uppermost in their minds when they answer consumer confidence surveys. If that is the case, they might increasingly need stimulus in the form of low interest rates to keep them spending.A perennial swirl of good news after a crisis might instil a sort of bland optimism, without actually eliminating the fear of another crisis in the future. Politicians and the media then feed this optimism with rosy narratives that the general public is in no position to sort through or confirm.Since around 2012, the equity and housing markets have been hitting new records. But the same sort of thing happened regularly in the Great Depression: the news media were constantly reporting record highs for one economic indicator or another. A Proquest News and Newspapers search for the 1930-39 period finds 10,315 articles with the words ※record high§. Most of these stories are about economic variables. In 1933, at the very bottom of the depression, record highs were reported for oil production; wheat, gold and commodity-exchange-seat prices; cigarette consumption; postal deposits; sales or profits of individual companies; and so forth.Such rosy reports may give people some hope that things are improving overall, without allaying the fear that they could still suffer an economically catastrophic event. Barring exceptionally strong stimulus measures, this sense of foreboding will limit their spending. Narrative psychology has taught us that there is no contradiction: people can maintain parallel and conflicting narratives at the same time. When people are imagining disaster scenarios, policymakers must respond accordingly. "															
"mmanuel Macron＊s  sent a wave of relief and euphoria across Europe. But now a reality check is in order, because we do not yet know how the president intends to restore the French economy. The country has an  and its manufacturing sector is 12% below the level before the 2008 global financial crisis.Macron has indicated that he does not want to increase the retirement age,  or make it easier for companies to dismiss workers. At the same time, he wants northern eurozone countries to send money to southern countries to protect French financial and economic markets in these regions.This is an admittedly broad-brush portrayal of the programme that got Macron elected, but it is nonetheless to the point. What else could he possibly mean when he calls for the creation of a eurozone finance ministry that can accrue jointly guaranteed debt and collect its own taxes. What about when he asks for common eurozone deposit protection and unemployment insurance? The motive behind these ideas is all too obvious: support the domestic economy at others＊ expense.Macron also backs proposals for a eurozone parliament, proclaiming a two-tier . But that is simply a recipe for splitting up the EU.Turning the eurozone into a transfer union with its own parliament would deepen the divide between the eurozone countries and the EU＊s northern and eastern member states: Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. Because most of those countries will not join a European transfer union, they would be cut off permanently. As , the Polish president of the European council, has wryly observed, we already had a two-tier Europe up until 1989 and we should not wish for a return to that arrangement.German policymakers, for their part, could not easily help Macron bifurcate the EU even if they wanted to, because Germany＊s constitution grants the Bundestag the inalienable authority to manage the country＊s fiscal affairs. Even if every member of the German parliament agreed to transfer part of Berlin＊s fiscal sovereignty to a European-level institution, such a decision could still be made only through a formal referendum.Germany＊s powerful constitutional court has already made it clear that eurozone bailouts and other interventions represent the outer limits of what is possible under the country＊s basic law. The court may have deferred to the European court of justice on the question of the ＊s ※outright monetary transactions§ scheme, but it will not be able to do the same with respect to fiscal sovereignty, because the constitution is clear and the ECJ has no standing to interpret German constitutional law.That being said, it is important European integration moves forward. There is still much work to do to improve the EU＊s cross-border traffic routes and strengthen its security partnerships. Indeed, Europe should take a lesson from the wars of the 20th century and do away with national armies altogether. Only then will its union for peace become a reality, not just a platitude invoked by politicians.During the period after the second world war, European heads of state drafted a treaty to establish a European defence community. But the proposal fell through in 1954, when France＊s national assembly did not ratify it, against the recommendation of Charles de Gaulle. Later, the UK opposed a joint European military.But Britain will no longer be part of the EU, at least for the foreseeable future, and  has a young, dynamic new leader. So it is time to try again. The German people can probably be persuaded to agree to this form of integration, in the same referendum that will have to be held to approve Macron＊s fiscal plans. The same can be said for the people of eastern Europe.By pursuing true political integration based on a common army and security partnership for the EU, Macron can guarantee his place in the history books. To achieve this goal, however, he will have to break from his predecessors, who always categorically ruled out a political union. And he must acknowledge Germany＊s concerns that by establishing a fiscal union now, Europe would lose the opportunity to pursue a political union in the future.Combining Europe＊s military forces under a joint command is the only way forward. Creating a fiscal union without a political union would for ever block the road to European unification and set the people of the continent against one another more than the euro ever did. No one who wants to build a union for peace can afford to permit, much less encourage, such an outcome."															
															
"fter the most difficult decade in its history, life should be looking up for the International?Monetary Fund as it hosts the world＊s finance ministers and central bankers?in Washington DC this week. The global?economy . Financial markets look more stable. The US is running at full employment, China is expanding strongly, and the eurozone is going through one of its better periods. Spring is in the air, according to the Fund＊s managing director, Christine?Lagarde.Privately, the mood in Washington is less ebullient. The IMF has its doubts about whether the pick-up in activity 每 which has only been possible because central banks have kept interest rates at record lows since the deep slump of 2008-09 每 will endure. It points to the vulnerability of debt-laden American companies to rising borrowing costs, to the credit bubble that has kept China＊s economy booming, and to the 1tn of?non-performing loans weighing down banks in the eurozone.These are all timely warnings. Any one of the risks identified by the IMF could trigger a?global downturn at a time when the political consequences of the last recession are still reverberating. The IMF fears that a fresh dose of unemployment and a renewed squeeze on living standards would intensify populism, nationalism and protectionism 每 and it is right. For some time, the IMF has been pumping out reports warning that rising , not least because it was?bad for growth. Its latest , its half-yearly update on the state of the global economy, contains a chapter highlighting how workers have been?getting a smaller share of national income since the early 1990s.The problem is that the policy response to these trends 每 including that of the IMF itself 每 has been inadequate. While the IMF＊s macro-economic department has been urging a softer line on austerity, the teams sent in to sort out crisis countries have prescribed the same old medicine 每 cuts in wages and public spending, with a diminished role for collective bargaining. Brexit was one manifestation of the political backlash that inevitably resulted from the failure to ensure that the fruits of economic growth are more evenly distributed. The IMF has not really changed its view that leaving the European Union will be bad for the UK, despite revising up its growth forecasts . It thinks that the economy surfed through the second half of 2016 on a wave of consumer credit, but will still suffer longer-term damage. This will be reflected in the fund＊s annual health check on the UK, which was due to take place next month but has been delayed by the general election to later in the year.Donald Trump＊s victory last November is another manifestation of the same political forces, and a much bigger threat to the IMF. Theresa May has pledged to keep Britain open to trade; Trump at odds with everything the Fund stands for. A political gulf has opened up between the body created to sort out global economic problems and its biggest shareholder, the United States. The?IMF exemplifies the sort of elitist global organisation that Mr Trump has railed against on the campaign stump. Long-term critics of the IMF have been lined up for top international jobs at the US Treasury. For years, the IMF has been fending off critics from the left who saw it as the embodiment of neoliberalism and the Washington consensus. It is now being assailed by opponents from the right who think that by bailing out countries in trouble rather than leaving matters to market forces the IMF makes matters worse, not better.Ms Lagarde has been waiting to discover exactly what Mr Trump plans for her organisation. The lack of action so far signifies very little because the administration has had other things 每 repeal of Obamacare, a package of tax cuts, Syria and North Korea 每 on its mind. For the moment, Ms Lagarde is keeping her head down, hoping that in time Mr Trump will see the worth of her organisation. Past Republican presidents have appointed officials with a mission to cut the IMF down to size, only to support action in an emergency. Events matter more than people. But the IMF would be well advised to come up with some solutions to the problems of the people who voted for Mr Trump. Telling a car worker in Michigan that the answer to the loss of his job is to retrain as a care worker is not?going to cut it. Either with the car worker?or with the president."															
"ne of the real achievements of the coalition government was setting and reaching the target of spending 0.7% of GDP on development aid. UK aid spending has played a significant role in halving the number of people  and delivering the great improvements in global health and education that have been?achieved over the past decade.Britain＊s lead has encouraged others to follow: earlier this year,  of countries that had reached the UN-set target. It has enhanced British status and influence across the world. In a report earlier this month, MPs on the cross-party committee on international development concluded, , that ※ODA?[official development assistance] spending is in the national interest and is a strong investment contributing to create a more prosperous world, which pays far-reaching dividends including to UK taxpayers?at home§.Yet despite the commitment to global Britain, the Conservative right wants the target dropped. There are reports that aid spending may be siphoned off to boost the defence budget, or to help shelter refugees. The department itself is under threat of merger with the foreign office. On Thursday, the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, said that the 0.7% figure was ※critically, critically important§, and while, he was saying no more than Microsoft founder Bill Gates . Mr Gates, who has become a generous and influential figure in the fight against the diseases of poverty, warned that dropping the target would ※reduce British influence and cost lives§.David Cameron＊s commitment to international development marked him out 每 as he intended 每 from his predecessors. Until then, the pattern in Whitehall was that Labour , and the next Tory one dismantled it. It was bold to stick to the pledge 每 and even write it into law 每 as the chancellor embarked on a mission to hack back public spending as a?share of national income.However, after the first secretary of state for international development, Andrew Mitchell, there has been a steep decline in departmental weight. The current , often appears proudly sceptical of an idea that is now routinely belittled in principle and denigrated in practice. She fails to rebut claims of waste, and success stories are scarce. Yet the two-year committee inquiry found no evidence that waste was significant, or a consequence of the rapid growth in DfID＊s budget. Nor was there evidence that poor or wasteful spending was worse in DfID than any other government department or among international donors; spending was assessed as effective. The MPs recommended that rather than spend less, DfID should simply continue to strive to spend it better.But good aid needs transparency. Ms?Patel＊s enthusiasm for using public money to incentivise private investment is not necessarily wrong, but it does make it much harder to assess how well money is spent. In the same way, aid delivered through departments other than DfID is harder to track. Development is difficult; understanding the complexities of doing it well will always be a work in progress. But doing it is both a moral imperative and an exercise in the UK＊s national interest."															
"In defence of large companies named and shamed by Corbyn (, 12 April), Experian said that the data taken from its report showing very late payment of invoices do not apply to the majority of invoices. Capita said that only 10% of its payments are made later than 30 days of receipt. But?even such a small percentage of late payment by a large company can cause huge pressures down the supply chain, and it invites questions about corporate ethics. Jeremy Corbyn raises a valid alarm about a potential national scandal.  is right to ※declare war§ on late-paying companies. Data on the scale of the problem comes as no surprise. My late father worked into his 80s doing bookkeeping for a small engineering firm. They did minor maintenance on ships. Every time I spoke to my father about work, he seemed to be chasing up overdue payments (cheques in those days) from major shipping companies. On some occasions, his boss had to pay his employees out of his personal bank account. Nothing has changed. That＊s what big companies do. That＊s why they＊re big and why small businesses struggle or go to the wall. The claim by M&S to ※not recognise§ Jeremy Corbyn＊s figures in his accusations of late payments to suppliers is pathetic. The company protests that its average time from being invoiced to payment is 54 days, despite that already being almost double the standard one-month term. And obviously if that is the average, it means there are payments that take considerably more than 54 days, as Labour highlights. Your editorial on productivity (, 10 April) raises an important point about low productivity, but is disingenuous about causes.Those of us with children of average ability struggling to find decent employment in the labour market see daily the impact of a seemingly unlimited supply of qualified and hard-working immigrant labour which is exploited by the inefficient and incompetent management that characterises much of British business. Hire and fire is the norm, combined with awful working environments and marginal pay. Work benefits are history for most, sickness is penalised and opportunity non-existent.The underlying problem is that UK society has no understanding of professional management, just as it belittles manufacturing and most forms of commercial endeavour outside the professions. Productivity will not improve until wealth creators get the respect they deserve and this has to come through cultural change and education.The state can do two things. First, to only procure from companies with accredited management development; and second, to provide the infrastructure and fiscal incentives to remove any excuses for not developing this capability.It is up to opinion formers (like this newspaper) to overcome their distaste for ※trade§ and champion professional management and the state resources needed to achieve and sustain it. By all means worry about low productivity, the lack of a living wage and poor working conditions, but don＊t forget the elephant in the room: bosses are simply taking advantage of a ready supply of cheap migrant labour. Rather than pin our hopes on a difficult-to-police, statutory living wage, simply pursue an even-handed immigration policy that is not biased against Britain＊s unskilled citizenry. The market will increase unskilled pay.A reduction in the import of cheap labour will result in the transfer of purchasing power from the majority haves to the minority have-nots, as the many menial jobs that cannot be outsourced abroad become more costly. Not to do so is to say goodbye to a living wage. A key factor in the UK＊s awful productivity record is that far too much time and energy goes into devising elaborate schemes for generating funny money rather than putting in the effort needed to invest for the long term in actual wealth creation.For over a century the UK has shown a distinct preference for finance over industrial capital, a situation made even worse over the last 40 years since the deregulation of the City. This will not change until the rules are changed to make it more profitable to invest in the production of real goods and services than in the high-class gambling that is par for the course in the City. Given the Tories＊ reliance on City money it＊s doubtful that meaningful change will come from that quarter. "															
															
"he rise of populism has rattled the global political establishment. came as a shock, as did the victory of . Much head-scratching has resulted as leaders seek to work out why large chunks of their electorates are so cross.The answer seems pretty simple. Populism is the result of economic failure. The 10 years since the financial crisis have shown that the system of economic governance which has held sway for the past four decades is broken. Some call this approach . Perhaps a better description would be unpopulism.Unpopulism meant tilting the balance of power in the workplace in favour of management and treating people like wage slaves. Unpopulism was rigged to ensure that the fruits of growth went to the few not to the many. Unpopulism decreed that those responsible for the global financial crisis got away with it while those who were innocent bore the brunt of austerity.Anybody seeking to understand why Trump won the US presidential election should take a look at what has been happening to the division of the economic spoils. The share of national income that went to the bottom 90% of the population held steady at around 66% from 1950 to 1980. It then began a steep decline, falling to just over 50% when the financial crisis broke in 2007.Similarly, it is no longer the case that everybody benefits when the US economy is doing well. During the business cycle upswing between 1961 and 1969, the bottom 90% of Americans took 67% of the income gains. During the Reagan expansion two decades later they took 20%. During the Greenspan housing bubble of 2001 to 2007, they got just two cents in every extra dollar of national income generated while the richest 10% took the rest.The US economist Thomas Palley* says that up until the late 1970s countries operated a virtuous circle growth model in which wages were the engine of demand growth.※Productivity growth drove wage growth which fueled demand growth. That promoted full employment, which provided the incentive to invest, which drove further productivity growth,§ he says.Unpopulism was touted as the antidote to the supposedly failed policies of the postwar era. It promised higher growth rates, higher investment rates, higher productivity rates and a trickle down of income from rich to poor. It has delivered none of these things.James Montier and Philip Pilkington, of the global investment firm GMO, say that the system which arose in the 1970s was characterised by four significant economic policies: the abandonment of full employment and its replacement with inflation targeting; an increase in the globalisation of the flows of people, capital and trade; a focus on shareholder maximisation rather than reinvestment and growth; and the pursuit of flexible labour markets and the disruption of trade unions and workers＊ organisations.To take just the last of these four pillars, the idea was that trade unions and minimum wages were impediments to an efficient labour market. Collective bargaining and statutory pay floors would result in workers being paid more than the market rate, with the result that unemployment would inevitably rise.Unpopulism decreed that the real value of the US minimum wage should be eroded. But unemployment is higher than it was when the minimum wage was worth more. Nor is there any correlation between trade union membership and unemployment. If anything, international comparisons suggest that those countries with higher trade union density have lower jobless rates. The countries that have higher minimum wages do not have higher unemployment rates.※Labour market flexibility may sound appealing, but it is based on a theory that runs completely counter to all the evidence we have,§ Montier and Pilkington note. ※The alternative theory suggests that labour market flexibility is by no means desirable as it results in an economy with a bias to stagnate that can only maintain high rates of employment and economic growth through debt-fuelled bubbles that inevitably blow up, leading to the economy tipping back into stagnation.§This quest for ever-greater labour market flexibility has had some unexpected consequences. The bill in the UK for spiralled quickly once firms realised they could pay poverty wages and let the state pick up the bill. Access to a global pool of low-cost labour meant there was less of an incentive to invest in productivity-enhancing equipment.The abysmally low levels of productivity growth since the crisis have encouraged the belief that this is a recent phenomenon, but as , the trend started in most advanced countries in the 1970s.※Certainly, the productivity puzzle is not something which has emerged since the global financial crisis, though it seems to have amplified pre-existing trends,§ Haldane said.Bolshie trade unions certainly can＊t be blamed for Britain＊s lost productivity decade. The orthodox view in the 1970s was that attempts to make the UK more efficient were being thwarted by shop stewards who modeled themselves on Fred Kite, the character played by Peter Sellers in I＊m All Right Jack. Haldane puts the blame elsewhere: on poor management, which has left the UK with a big gap between frontier firms and a long tail of laggards. ※Firms which export have systematically higher levels of productivity than domestically oriented firms, on average by around a third. The same is true, even more dramatically, for foreign-owned firms. Their average productivity is twice that of domestically oriented firms.§Populism is seen as irrational and reprehensible. It is neither. It seems entirely rational for the bottom 90% of the US population to question why they are getting only 2% of income gains. It hardly seems strange that workers in Britain should complain at the .It has also become clear that ultra-low interest rates and  are merely sticking-plaster solutions. Populism stems from a sense that the economic system is not working, which it clearly isn＊t. In any other walk of life, a failed experiment results in change. Drugs that are supposed to provide miracle cures but are proved not to work are quickly abandoned. Businesses that insist on continuing to produce goods that consumers don＊t like go bust. That＊s how progress happens.The good news is that the casting around for new ideas has begun. Trump has advocated protectionism. Theresa May is consulting on an industrial strategy. Montier and Pilkington suggest a commitment to full employment, job guarantees, reindustrialisation and a stronger role for trade unions. The bad news is that time is running short. More and more people are noticing that the emperor has no clothes. and fails to win the French presidency, a full-scale political revolt is only another deep recession away. And that＊s easy enough to envisage.*"															
"all Street＊s uncritical love affair with  is over. For five months, traders have swallowed whole the idea that the president would swiftly get a  through a Republican-dominated Congress, giving a boost to growth and corporate profits in the process.Yet the first real test of Trump＊s ability to get lawmakers to do his bidding 每  每 has been a disaster. The resistance on Capitol Hill has left the financial markets wondering when 每 and indeed whether 每 Trump will be able to deliver on his fiscal boost.This dose of reality is long overdue. The initial market reaction to Trump was negative but brief. Within 24 hours, Wall Street banished all its doubts and bet everything on the notion that the new man in the White House would lift the  out of its low-growth rut.Yet the initial doubts were valid. Trump lacks political experience and so does the team around him. The new president＊s bully-boy tactics have gone down badly on Capitol Hill and not just with Democrats. There are plenty of  who find Trump and his methods odious.So, when it became clear last week that the repeal of Obamacare was not going to be legislative plain sailing, there was a predictable response on Wall Street: traders dumped shares. The relentless rise in the stock market since last November＊s election 每 每 came to an abrupt halt. Up until now, the markets have taken on trust that the president will deliver on his election pledges. And after Trump＊s humiliating defeat in Congress on Friday, there is no doubt the mood has changed.That＊s not to say Wall Street is going to see all the gains of the past few months wiped out. But while shares could continue to rise, markets look certain to be a lot more volatile than they have been since November.There are three reasons for this. The first is that it may be some time before Trump gets agreement for tax cuts and infrastructure spending. It could easily be delayed until 2018.The second is that the president＊s ambitions may well have to be scaled down. Trump wants to use the savings from replacing Obamacare with something cheaper to fund his fiscal boost, but the  said last week that the impact on the budget deficit would be substantially less than originally estimated: a reduction of $150bn (?120bn), rather than $336bn. Fiscal conservatives in Congress will probably demand that Trump finds savings elsewhere.Finally, corporate profits are set to be squeezed by a combination of rising wages, higher interest rates and a stronger dollar. Trump＊s fiscal package 每 assuming it is approved 每 would reinforce those pressures, because stronger growth would lead to greater demand for labour.With unemployment below 5%, earnings are already starting to pick up. The Federal Reserve, America＊s central bank, has  twice since Trump＊s victory and will accelerate the pace of future increases if there is evidence that tax cuts are leading to wage inflation.Higher US interest rates at a time when no other major central bank 每 the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan or the Bank of England 每 is contemplating a move will make it more attractive for investors to hold dollars. The US currency will go up, making American exports dearer.Until now, the markets have focused solely on the upside from Trump＊s economic strategy 每 the stronger growth 每 without taking into consideration any of the potential downsides: higher inflation, dearer borrowing costs and an overvalued currency.Those downsides will become more evident as time goes by. It is too early to say that Wall Street has fallen out of love with . But the whirlwind romance is over. The relationship is entering a new and more difficult phase.Hundreds of staff in high street banks have had a challenging few days.  while the Customers are shifting from banking in high-street branches to organising payments and direct debits on the internet and via smartphones, which is obviously putting pressure on traditional bricks-and-mortar sites. However, despite this, it is essential that a place is found for Co-op Bank. since its disastrous takeover of Britannia building society in 2009, which saddled it with bad loans. It nearly collapsed in 2013 when a ?1.5bn black hole was discovered in its balance sheet, but was eventually bailed out through a deal with hedge funds.This bailout never looked like a permanent solution to Co-op Bank＊s problems, and so it has proved. The hedge funds have put the bank up for sale to raise more capital, with a deadline of mid-April for preliminary expressions of interest. Banking sources are now talking about the possibility of a break-up of Co-op Bank, and the Bank of England is understood to be monitoring the situation carefully.It would send an unfortunate message about British banking if the Co-op brand, which still maintains its ethical policy, were to disappear from the market. This ethical policy means, among other rules, that the bank does not invest in companies selling arms to oppressive regimes, does not support organisations offering payday loans, and has a strict approach to gambling.Despite its problems, the bank still has about 4 million customers and 105 branches. It remains a substantial player. Unfortunately, its financial problems are also substantial. It slumped to a ?477m loss for 2016, its fifth consecutive year in the red. A rescue deal will not be easy, so the Co-op＊s owners and Bank of England must do all they can to help. A break-up would be bad for the industry.Consider these facts about , world＊s biggest educational publisher and 47% owner of Penguin Random House books. Last year it crashed ?2.6bn into the red, the biggest loss in its history. It has issued five profit warnings in two years, the last of which, in January, wiped ?2bn off its value. It has scrapped its profit targets and put its stake in Penguin up for sale in the hope of bolstering its balance sheet. Its net debt climbed from ?654m to ?1.1bn last year. 4,000 jobs were axed last year and the company is ※rebasing§ 每 which means cutting 每 its dividend payout to shareholders.Chief executive John Fallon said earlier this year: ※I am accountable ...?I fully accept that accountability for the fact that we got two big calls wrong last year.§ So why has Fallon (paid ?6m in his four years in the job) just been handed a ?345,000 bonus? On top of his ?780,000 salary. Could be because executive pay is truly in la la land."

But the history between the pair should ensure that relations remain frosty this week when Hardy is back in front of the same committee, now probing the future world of work.Hardy will no doubt have to talk through the way Transline has now refined some of its more controversial practices, including paying staff less than the minimum wage and the infamous ※strikes§ policy, where managers could sack workers for six ※offences§ such as spending too long in the toilet.

But if anyone plumped for 1489, then please take a bow (and do get out more).Coinage website 24carat.co.uk expands: ※The gold sovereign came into existence in 1489 under King Henry VII.※The pound sterling had been a unit of account for centuries. Now for the first time a coin denomination was issued with a value of one pound sterling.§Still, the upcoming switch means we will all be wrestling with problems such as finding the correct change to pay for a locker at your local swimming baths (same as now, then) to businesses like Tesco having to unlock thousands of supermarket trolleys because they＊ve failed to convert them in time.History does not record if similar issues taxed the subjects of Henry VII 每 who were presumably left cursing vending machines that couldn＊t take their sovereigns.Do you feel like popping out to the shops and buying yourself a new sofa? How about a washing machine? A new set of coffee mugs?Your answer to those questions will, no doubt, depend on how confident you＊re feeling about your financial prospects, and perhaps even on whether you actually need to buy any of those items. In any case, the buoyancy of the nation＊s financial mood will be of some importance this week, when the GfK consumer confidence survey is unveiled. Currently, the figure is slightly more interesting than usual, as the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee seems to be paying attention to the topic, while Alan Clarke, head of European fixed income at Scotiabank, is relatively pessimistic about what might emerge.He says: ※Confidence seems to have moved more closely in tandem with ... the inflation rate. The rationale is that higher prices leave consumers with less spare cash with which to purchase goods and services 每 making them less happy ... Given the continued rise in inflation it would not be unreasonable to expect consumer confidence to fall somewhat. We expect the index for fall from -6 in February, down towards -16 in the next two to three months.§The new sofa might have to wait a while, then."															
															
"Public sector workers have become the first group to suffer a cut in real wages since the recovery of 2014 as forecasters predicted that the rest of the working population would follow suit later this year.The Resolution Foundation said the situation  is expected to worsen over the rest of the decade  and high inflation eat into their take-home pay and living standards.The independent thinktank forecast that median real pay for the average public sector worker would fall below 2004-05 levels by the end of the current parliament in 2020.On current trends, the average pay of public sector workers will be ?1,700 lower in 2020 than its peak in 2010, it said.Pay figures for the years after the financial crash in 2008 show that private sector workers bore the brunt of the slump in wages. While private sector workers suffered wage freezes or worse, public sector pay improved, offsetting steeply rising inflation. But since the economy picked up in 2014 and prices flatlined, private sector workers have grabbed the lion＊s share of inflation-busting wage rises.Official figures for 2016 showed that full-time employees in the private sector enjoyed an increase of 3.4% in median weekly earnings on a year earlier compared with a 0.7% rise for workers in the public sector. Inflation jumped to 1.8% in January and is expected to rise between 2.5% and 4% by the end of the year.The Resolution Foundation said pay growth has been particularly weak in health and social work and could fall by a further 6% by 2020, though the lowest earners will be protected from falling pay because of planned increases in the national living wage.  calculated that midwives, teachers and social workers would see their real pay, which accounts for the impact of inflation, drop by more than ?3,000 by 2020 if the government sticks to plans to .Adam Corlett, an economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ※While rising inflation is applying the brakes to real pay growth across the board, the outlook for public sector pay looks particularly weak.※Pay is now actually falling and, worse, is expected to continue for the rest of the parliament, with levels at the end of the parliament dropping back to levels last seen in 2004. ※Although public sector pay restraint is important to the government＊s deficit reduction plans, falling real pay is likely to see increasing recruitment strains. ※The government should be planning now how to manage those strains, alongside any wider changes to policies like migration that will also have an impact.§Philip Hammond , but the chancellor said the extra money would be spent on opening new schools and not increasing teachers＊ pay or the amount spent on each pupil.Central government departments and local authorities must also find extra savings to meet more aggressive budget targets, limiting the scope for incremental increases in staff pay outside the annual pay constraints."															
"Zoe Williams is right: another credit crunch-induced ※crash§ is likely and the only affordable rescue package will be some form of quantitative easing (, 4 September). This time it must generate jobs for the ※left behind§ and others, rather than today＊s beneficiaries 每 the property- and share-owning rich. The Green New Deal group showed the potential of such an approach in its proposal for a ?50bn-a-year green infrastructure QE programme.This would pay to make the UK＊s 28m dwellings and 2m commercial and public sector buildings super energy efficient, dramatically reducing energy bills, fuel poverty and greenhouse gas emissions. It could also tackle the housing crisis by building affordable, highly insulated homes, predominantly on brownfield sites. This form of QE would provide job security and local business opportunities in every constituency, since its infrastructure improvements would take place across the UK.Such an approach is feasible, since the  governor, Mark Carney, in responding to questions from Green New Deal group member Caroline Lucas MP, is on record as saying that if the government requested it, QE could be used to buy assets other than government debt. He and the government should work on this jobs-everywhere approach. If they don＊t, Labour could be on to a winner with its ※peoples QE§ proposal to fund economic improvements nationwide.

"Rising prices on the back of the Brexit vote and the trend towards more insecure work will rob British workers of any growth in real wages this year, with repercussions for the wider economy, a new report has warned.With just over a week to go until a snap general election largely focused on looming Brexit negotiations, economists at the ratings agency Standard & Poor＊s are the latest to highlight .The referendum result did not deliver the drastic hit to economic growth that some had predicted but it did send the pound sharply lower. That has made imports to the UK more expensive, helping to push inflation up to its .On the latest official figures, inflation had overtaken meagre wage growth, leaving workers worse off in real terms. S&P expects that trend to continue this year and it says the next government will have to boost spending on infrastructure to improve the UK＊s sluggish productivity and turn the tide on household incomes.Boris Glass, one of the report＊s authors, said that after the UK＊s GDP growth , from 0.7% at the end of last year, the pattern was likely to continue as stresses on household finances weighed on consumer spending.※The resulting weakening of household purchasing power will likely translate into weaker consumer spending, which is a key factor behind the slow GDP growth we anticipate for the rest of this year, after the economy expanded by only 0.2% in the first quarter,§ he said.He said real wage growth should turn positive again next year, partly because employers will have adjusted pay for higher inflation by then. ※But several factors are likely to keep constraining pay growth in our view,§ he added.The recent return to falling real wages compounds the pain for British workers who suffered years of declining living standards in the wake of the financial crisis. Glass described the result as ※more than a decade of lost earnings growth in absolute levels§.While the biggest factor behind the latest rise in inflation was the Brexit vote, there were other reasons for weak wage growth, the S&P report said.One explanation was the UK＊s poor record on productivity, a measure of economic efficiency or what is produced for every hour worked. The  and what little improvement there has been has not been fully passed on to workers in higher wages, S&P said. ※Real wages have so far failed to catch up even with very weak productivity＃ What＊s more, with productivity growth remaining so sluggish, there is not much for real wages to catch up to. Real pay growth will likely remain muted until productivity numbers rebound,§ said Glass.※At least some of the productivity loss could be reversed by boosting investment spending, including on infrastructure. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to occur to the extent necessary in the near to medium term.§ He also warned that the overdue catch-up of real wages with productivity could be further delayed as a result of more muted growth prospects due to Brexit.But poor productivity growth was only part of the problem, Glass added. Real wages were currently still well below the norm, even at such low productivity levels.Another key factor in weak wage growth was the quality of employment, the S&P report said, noting official figures showing that in the fourth quarter of last year, .※These types of jobs, often in consumer-facing services where relatively low skill levels are required, made up almost one-quarter of all employment created since 2010 when the recovery started, and this seems to be part of a broader trend,§ it added.※Jobs created since the global financial crisis have tended to be in occupations with relatively low productivity and less secure, including low paid self-employment and part-time employment.§"															
"omething strange is happening in British politics. I＊m not talking about the divisive quagmire of Brexit or the frightening rise of xenophobia. I＊m talking about a broad cross-party agreement that the economic model of the last half a century has failed. I＊m referring to an (almost) ubiquitous call across the multi-coloured manifestos of the 2017 election to start building ※an economy that works§ 每 for everyone.Isn＊t it a bit odd to find this exact same turn of phrase across the political spectrum: , , , ? (Only Ukip has no truck with an economy that works.) It looks a little bit like someone has been copying someone else＊s homework; and it isn＊t entirely clear who. When Theresa May first used the phrase, on the steps of , she made it sound like her own idea. But in fact she lifted the language 每 lock, stock and barrel 每 from a  at the launch of Labour＊s inaugural . He promised to ※create an economy that works for all, not just the few§.A careful archivist could uncover a longer pedigree. The phrase appeared on the Green party＊s website long before Corbyn and May borrowed it. Interesting. The Greens picked it up from a campaign launched by the  每 an alliance of leaders driving action for a sustainable economy. Curiouser and Curiouser. Ultimately, we can trace it to the worldwide chorus of disapproval against the ※§ that created the financial crisis.Almost a decade on, it seems kind of obvious that . An economy that works has to be a good thing, right? Meaningful work, decent incomes, good life chances, reliable access to healthcare and education, affordable housing, resilient communities, inclusive societies, living in a world that doesn＊t trash the climate or the rivers or the soils. What＊s not to like about this vision 每 a tantalising promise to create a ※good society§?Of course it rather depends who you are. And what your life chances happen to be at the time of asking. There＊s a minority who have done rather well from an economy that doesn＊t work at all. The much reviled . A financial (and political) elite who＊ve managed to benefit massively from the machinery of growth: globalisation, financial deregulation, asset price speculation, collateralised debt obligations, credit default swaps. An impenetrable language hiding a tale of human misery. Not just to benefit, indeed, but to use their considerable power in persuading a captive state to stack the odds in their favour and sweep the risks under the public carpet. Privatised gain and socialised loss is the defining story of capitalism over the last decades.But it also depends how you set about translating vision into practice. How, for instance, does an economy that works, actually work? What does work itself look like in the economy of tomorrow? Work is more than just the means to a livelihood. It＊s a vital ingredient in our connection to each other 每 part of the ※glue§ of society.

The long-term implications are nothing short of disastrous.Some of this is on the radar.  of employment practices will be one of the first things to arrive on the next prime minister＊s desk. The chances are it will be an immensely useful document, particularly if it goes beyond the vaguely puritanical promises to crack down on tax evasion in the gig economy that currently pepper the blue manifesto. Even more so, if it dares to talk about the quality of work. Or if it begins to question the prevailing assumption that a hi-tech digitalised world of robots and AI is going to save us.Let＊s be clear. Technical innovation can deliver us a better quality of life, freedom from drudgery, the ability to be more productive. But there are also places where it makes no sense. Certain kinds of tasks rely inherently on people. The care and concern of one human being for another is a case in point. Its quality rests primarily on the attention paid by one person to another. And yet compassion fatigue is a rising  hounded by meaningless productivity targets.Craft is another example. It is the accuracy and detail inherent in  that endows them with lasting value. It is the attention paid by the carpenter, the tailor and the designer that makes this detail possible. Likewise it is the time spent practising, rehearsing and performing that gives creative art its enduring appeal. What 每 aside from meaningless noise 每 is to be gained by asking the London Philharmonic to reduce their rehearsal time and play Beethoven＊s 9th Symphony faster and faster each year?An economy that works must have something to do with investing in work itself. Care, craft, culture, creativity: these sectors offer a new vision of enterprise: not as a speculative, profit-maximising, resource-intensive division of labour, but as a form of social organisation embedded in the community, working in harmony with nature to deliver the capabilities that allow us to prosper.Much of this exists in the rainbow manifestos of the 2017 election, but there are differences of course. Labour, remarkably, has fully costed the vision. The Tories appear somewhat arrogant in failing completely to do so. The Lib Dems have understood that the vision needs to be personal. The Greens have gone furthest in offering innovative policy to deliver it. Their proposals to trial a land tax, to challenge executive remuneration and to introduce a  are radical, pragmatic and extremely timely in dealing with the challenges ahead.Manifestos will come and go but one startling realisation persists. The failed experiment of free-market, neoliberal economics that has haunted modern politics, undermined the fabric of society, disempowered government and left millions behind, may just be coming to an end. Building an economy that works for everyone has become a precise, definable and meaningful task. Tim Jackson is the author of Prosperity without Growth (Routledge)"															
															
"his week the Tories unveiled a poster , alleging that Jeremy Corbyn would deprive the army of munitions. But there＊s irony there; thanks to their own cuts to defence spending, British warships will have to sail without anti-ship missiles from 2018. Frigates without missiles, hospitals without doctors: that＊s what happens if you try to shrink the state but end up suppressing economic growth instead.Analysis from  shows that the share of national income we spend on schools, defence and policing has fallen significantly since the financial crisis in 2007-08. Services are at breaking point, and households are borrowing hand over fist to pay for childcare, rent and elderly?care. Labour can win this  with big, eye-catching pledges that put money back into schools, hospitals and?the pockets of hard-pressed families. To do that, it needs a tax bombshell it is prepared to drop. Labour has already promised to borrow ?350bn for investment over 10 years, but the money to save the NHS and schools has?to come?from new taxes.Where will the money come from? Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has indicated that Labour won＊t make any , and also looks set to rule out any rises in national insurance. So the money has to come from the wealth of the rich, the profits of big corporations, and from ending the culture of tax avoidance and evasion that pervades Britain, from the Mayfair mansion to the construction site.If Labour sticks to raising conventional taxes, this will create only a limited pool of extra money for public services 每 as these taxes barely touch the vast reservoirs of wealth that sit outside company profits and declared personal incomes. So a Labour government would soon push to the limits of what＊s achievable through the big three: VAT, corporation tax and income tax. For instance,  George Osborne＊s corporation tax cut, Labour＊s biggest conventional tax pledge to date, would raise ?12bn a year. The problem is not, as the , that this has been spent several times over: it has not. The problem is it＊s still only ?12bn. So Labour must take the plunge  French economist Thomas Piketty, and increase taxes on wealth.Wealth slips across borders and is hard to tax, says the conventional wisdom. Well, stand in central London and look upwards. Wealth is indeed slipping across borders 每 in the form of massive speculative property investments in Britain＊s cities. It does not matter how opaque the trusts, or how complex the tax wrappers. The actual glass, steel and concrete reside in the United Kingdom, and should form the centrepiece of a windfall tax of foreign property tycoons. The billions raised would still probably be in single figures, but there＊s lots more you can do once you establish the principle that to pay for a modern state you have to tax wealth in its modern form.Windfall taxes on bank profits and on bankers＊ bonuses, and a crackdown on offshore tax avoidance could 每 if Labour is prepared to be aggressive enough 每 collect serious amounts of money. So could a financial transaction tax. Touted for more than 20 years by , the sums raised by a so-called Tobin tax may not be spectacular, because many of its benefits come in the form of financial markets reducing risk and suppressing speculation, thereby lowering any potential tax take.But in February, former JP Morgan economist a plan to extend the UK＊s existing tax on share-dealing to bonds and derivatives. Even this modest proposal would generate ?5bn a year. In the form advocated by the , it could raise at least ?20bn.Whatever Labour does through wealth tax, it is going to have to bite the bullet and restore the 50p tax rate for high earners, even if it doesn＊t raise huge amounts. Taxing the top 1% should be a defining principle for a radical social democracy. Corbyn＊s  should say to those on six-figure salaries that, by paying a bit more, they are getting the cheapest health insurance money can buy, world-class services, a more socially cohesive society 每 and a?navy with actual missiles.This is the prize. Five billion here, two there, adds up to a war chest that Labour has to be prepared to use as symbolically and politically as the Tories use tax cuts. I am frustrated not by Labour＊s tendency to ※double spend§ its expected receipts 每 which is a Tory myth easily disproved with a spreadsheet. I am frustrated by the number of rows on that spreadsheet: Labour＊s tendency to scatter commitments among worthy causes instead of concentrating them on the principle that matters.That principle is that a state committed to social justice should provide high-quality universal services: a guaranteed state pension; an unsurpassed health service; free childcare and elderly care for all; and yes, a beefed-up policing, defence and security apparatus to meet rising global threats. And then it should make the case for a redistributive tax system to pay for them.To an electorate increasingly reconciled to the destruction and privatisation of these universal public goods, a Labour manifesto committed to massive extra spending on services would change the debate. It would be attacked on credibility grounds, as the broadcasters dutifully repeat the objections of rightwing thinktanks that?these taxes are uncollectable, or would suppress growth, or lead to capital flight. But a left-led Labour party could ensure it had more than Ed?Miliband＊s stone slab carved with vague intentions: a spreadsheet backed by professional economists prepared to call out the quack-medicine peddlers and defenders of unearned wealth.To work, a Labour tax and spend plan must hit only the rich, and benefit everyone 每 not just the poor. To keep Britain＊s economy geared to the needs of foreign oligarchs, tax dodgers and the?global banks, Theresa May is prepared to risk both our domestic economy and our national security. Labour should offer a radical alternative.It may fail. But it has failed in the past?through timidity and incompetence. If it fails while armed with a radical programme, at least we know what the electorate has chosen: a?navy without missiles, hospitals without doctors, workplaces without rights, exports without a market; a country without hope."															
"The president of the  has told Theresa May that  could lead to an increase in conflict, terrorism and migration and would damage Britain＊s international reputation.In a strongly worded response to reports that the government was considering dropping its commitment to devote 0.7% of national income to aid each year,  said the money the UK provided was vital not just for developing countries but for the future of the world.His comments came after Bill Gates in Africa if the government dropped the commitment because plans to eradicate malaria would be jeopardised. Like Kim, the Microsoft founder also stressed that the UK would lose influence. At ?13.3bn in 2016, Britain＊s aid budget was the third biggest in the world after Germany and US. Of the G7, only Britain and Germany currently meet the UN＊s 0.7% target for aid, and Britain is also one of the biggest donors to the . Kim said the UK＊s Department for International Development had played a vital role in efforts to rid the world of poverty. ※We were extremely encouraged when prime minister David Cameron fulfilled the commitment to 0.7%,§ Kim said at a press conference to mark the opening of the spring meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.※It is important for people in the UK to understand just how significant that was in expanding the UK＊s influence in the world. It would be very unfortunate for the UK to reduce its efforts. I would say the 0.7% that has been committed to is critically, critically important, not just for developing countries but for the future of the world.§The 0.7% pledge was originally made by Labour but it was only achieved after Cameron became prime minister in 2010. May is under pressure from the Tory right, Ukip and Conservative-supporting papers to cut aid spending. She pointedly refused this week to say she would keep to the commitment in the event of winning the forthcoming general election, prompting strong speculation that it will be abandoned.Kim said Britain＊s aid money had never been more important, joining a chorus of voices opposing the idea of reneging on the 0.7% pledge.Romilly Greenhill, a senior research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute, said it allowed Britain to punch above its weight on the international stage.※Bill Gates is right to say Britain＊s aid contribution is saving lives and putting children in school,§ he said. ※The first message is that it is needed, the second is that it is effective, and the third is that, in terms of a global Britain, it is very significant.※I＊ve observed a lot of UN negotiations and developing countries and richer countries see it as a real indicator of Britain＊s place on the international stage. It buys Britain a lot of kudos. Particularly when we leave the EU, it will demonstrate that we are punching above our weight.§Tamsyn Barton, the chief executive of Bond, the UK membership body for development groups, said: ※It would be a travesty if the UK＊s 0.7% commitment, made to help the world＊s poorest people, was not committed to by all political parties. This is not the time to shirk our global responsibility or step back from the world.§Charlie Matthews, ActionAid＊s head of advocacy, said: ※A truly global Britain must be outward looking. UK aid and the commitment to 0.7% is helping to feed millions of hungry people in east Africa whose lives have been devastated by drought.  saves lives and helps the world＊s poorest people, especially women and girls.§Jeff Crisp, a research associate at the Refugees Studies Centre at the University of Oxford, said dropping the aid pledge was not inevitable, but would be one way for May to appease the Tory right before difficult Brexit negotiations.※She will have to appease the right wing of her own party. One of the ways will be to get rid of it or to reduce it. Another way she could appease the right wing of the party would be to increase the way the overseas development budget will be used for things that are not strictly development.§Kim said: ※We＊re meeting at a time when we face overlapping crises, both natural and man made, all which add urgency to our mission: conflict; climate shocks; the worst refugee crisis since the second world war; and famine in parts of East Africa and Yemen, which the UN has called the worst in 70 years. With the famine in particular, the world was caught unprepared.§Kim said the multiple crises were linked to rising aspirations prompted by greater internet access. Aspiration matched by opportunity could create dynamic societies, he added.※But if those rising aspirations meet frustration we are very worried about more and more countries going down the path to fragility, conflict, violence, extremism and, of course, eventually migration. Because the other thing that access to the internet does is it increases people＊s desire to migrate.§Kim said there was a need to create successful developing countries that would buy goods from the developed west and so ensure that rising aspirations were not met with frustration.※This is not something that＊s theoretical. It＊s happening in front of our eyes. People have to think of aid as more than just giveaways.§"															
															
"ost politicians intend to do good, as they see it. It＊s an odd quirk in public attitudes that the idea of democracy is revered but its practitioners are, mostly, reviled: from graffiti in ancient Rome, it was ever thus. Political commentators need to appreciate the practitioners, however opposing their views.But there are some bad hats and chancers in politics. George Osborne, who leaves the grand stage of the Commons  saying, ※I want new challenges§, was a gamer,  to throw his dice in journalism and the City.It was the grave misfortune of so many millions that the sport he and his old friend David Cameron enjoyed for a while was playing with lesser people＊s lives in the great game of politics. But hey, it was fun while it lasted, and the heir to the 17th baronet is off to .To be not always serious is no sin: the Commons is leavened by a few wits and dandies, but Osborne＊s political games were sulphurous. He leaves behind acid burns on the national psyche that will take years to heal. He could leave his successors a there＊s- no-money note in blazing capital letters, bequeathing a national debt that increased by far more in his six years than it did in  每 but that＊s small beer compared with the scars he leaves on public attitudes.It was, I suppose, just politics as usual to profoundly misinform people about the economy he inherited. Gordon Brown＊s great service as prime minister was to rescue the entire banking system when it was hours from collapse, and to leave an economy growing again after that shock. This, Osborne, PPE graduate, well knew.Even as he rightly criticised Labour for lax regulation of banking and debt, he airbrushed his own repeated pre-crash calls for a lighter touch on his City backers. He seized the moment to justify setting about shrinking the state to below anything seen here or in similar European economies, though that tourniquet choked off the recovery he inherited. He left an even worse balance-of-trade deficit and the lowest productivity among equivalent countries in a house-price-dependent economy with virtually no new housing.Britain had ※§, he claimed. That＊s an image people understand all too well, though he knew it to be nonsense on stilts when applied to the national economy. In an echo chamber, he hammered in the message: you know Labour always borrows and spends recklessly; you know we could never afford all that extra funding for the NHS and education, all those 3,500 children＊s centres, all those splendidly revived proud city centres. His indelible political message dies hard, and Labour may take years to retrieve economic trust. So far, so politically cunning.Of course he knew he was talking nonsense economics, the proof there in his own budgets, one after another: he knew his promised deficit-free ※balanced budget§ was political rhetoric as it slipped from five to 10 to probably not even 15 years from 2010. If he was genuinely a fiscal-rectitude iron chancellor, he would have pursued that goal. Instead, he gave out a mammoth ?40bn in tax cuts to business and the better-off, in needless capital gains cuts and in this month＊s new ?1m inheritance tax threshold. His craftiest tax cut was in the popular raising of income tax thresholds labelled as helping the low-paid, though three quarters of the phenomenal cost goes to rewarding higher earners.His austerity was real enough for cutting public services to the very marrow, but generosity was the political game in tax cuts to mainly Tory voters. Other Tory allies ended up better off too:  每 something that would have delighted the Murdoch executives and their boss, with whom he had several meetings.But his economic failures can be repaired. They fade into insignificance beside his poisonous political legacy. He framed the political argument of this era and imposed his mendacious mantras on the national frame of mind so every man, woman and child in vox pops can repeat them over and over again.Most unforgivable, light years beyond politics-as-usual, was his systematic demonisation of the poorest. Even as he said  he cast the cruellest cuts on those with least. This month over ?12bn benefit cuts fall on the low-paid, the sick and disabled. His raising of the minimum wage barely touches what he took away in tax credits within universal credit, in benefit freezes, and in ever rising bars to qualify for anything.

"Britain＊s services firms have bounced back from a new year lull to expand at the fastest rate since late 2016.The latest health check of a sector that accounts for more than 75% of the economy＊s output showed the pace of activity picking up to a three-month high in March.Despite evidence that higher inflation was taking its toll of spending in hotels, restaurants, gyms and hairdressers, exporters of services were boosted by the fall in the value of the pound.The monthly survey from Markit/CIPS showed business activity rising from a five-month low of 53.3 in February to 55 in March. Any reading above 50 indicates that the sector is expanding.The survey reported that new product launches, strong client demand and the boost from a recovering global economy had all helped the service sector in March. Demand from the US was notably strong.Chris Williamson, the chief economist at IHS Markit, said that the rebound in the service sector did not change the picture of an economy growing less rapidly in the first three months of 2017 than in the final quarter of 2016.※The relative weakness of the PMI survey data compared to that seen at the turn of the year suggests the economy will have grown by 0.4% in the first quarter, markedly lower than the 0.7% expansion seen in the fourth quarter of last year,§ Williamson said.※Much of the disappointment in growth so far this year has been evident in consumer-oriented sectors, in part linked to spending and incomes being squeezed by higher prices.§ found some companies reporting -related uncertainty holding back investment decisions.Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at Capital , said the service sector survey 每 taken together with similar reports for manufacturing and construction 每 pointed to the economy growing at 0.5% in the first quarter.※March＊s strong UK Markit/CIPS report on services provides some reassurance that the economy won＊t slow too sharply this year, despite the intensifying headwinds,§ Gregory said.will produce its first estimate of 2017 first quarter growth later this month."															
"Britain＊s poor productivity performance before, during and after the  of a decade ago has left a gap of 16% with the other six members of the G7 group of industrial nations.International comparisons  show that output per hour worked continued to lag well behind the US, Germany and France in 2015 每 the last year for which data is available.The ONS said that every member of the G7 每 which also includes Japan, Italy and Canada 每 had seen productivity suffer since the deep slump of the late 2000s, but the impact had been twice as severe in the UK.Output per hour worked in Britain was 15.2% lower in 2015 than it would have been had the pre-recession trend continued, the ONS said. In the rest of the G7, the slowdown had been limited on average to 7.5%.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the UK gradually narrowed its productivity gap with the rest of the G7, but that improvement faltered in the years immediately preceding the financial crisis . Despite the UK＊s robust growth during 2015, the gap with the rest of the G7 widened from 15.8% to 15.9%.Britain＊s output per hour worked is now 22.2% lower than that of the US, 22.7% lower than in France and 26.7% lower than in Germany. Italy has shown no productivity growth since the turn of the millennium but still leads the UK by more than 10%.The only G7 countries with weaker productivity than the UK are Japan and Canada, the ONS said.A separate ONS release showed that output per hour grew by 0.4% in the final three months of 2016, up from 0.2% in the third quarter, the fourth successive increase.Steve Hill, the external engagement director at the Open University, said:※We know that higher and degree apprenticeships will give people from all walks of life access to greater opportunity, more choice and help shape the UK to become a nation of highly skilled workers. The UK＊s productivity keeps falling behind other developed countries, and this is unlikely to improve unless firms invest properly in training 每 the apprenticeship levy is an opportunity to do this.§"															
"s I talk to him, Ahmed pulls his chair into his store to escape the hot Tunisian sun. He is a retired teacher 每 the years of screaming children can be counted in the rings framing his eyes. Behind him is his merchandise. To make up for a small pension, Ahmed is selling kitchenware in a market near the Libyan border, over four hundred tiny concrete garages surround him, goods piled high: clothes, bags, microwaves. It looks like any other market, but note an invisible detail: everything sold here is illegal. Every good in this market has been smuggled into Tunisia. Ahmed, though he may not look the part, is a smuggler.I research smuggling, or ※informal cross-border trade§. I talk to people like Ahmed about their lives, their business, the experience of being a smuggler in the 21st century. I talk to people who live on the margins 每 of their countries, of the law, of development. I think listening to Ahmed is crucial in order to understand our society. Not because the margins are so exotic, or a living relic, a modern day Wild West. But because today, the margins are everywhere.We group people like Ahmed into the ※informal economy§, the black markets that aren＊t registered and hence don＊t show up in many statistics 每 that are surely too small to make much of a difference. Except that in Tunisia, where Ahmed lives, half the workforce is in the informal economy. In sub-Saharan Africa, it＊s two thirds. In south-east Asia, it＊s over 80%. Globally, informal is the new normal. This is not only an issue in the developing world: over two million people work in the informal economy in the UK; over 12% of its GDP is in the informal sector, and all these numbers are steadily rising.Think cleaners, nannies, construction workers, refugees. And while supermarkets may be members of the formal economy, many of the goods we buy there have made their way through complex global value chains, which commonly cross the informal economy. Think sweatshops, , unregistered miners. Researching the informal economy teaches us about the lives of many of the most vulnerable in our society - often uninsured, without contracts, sick days, unions, fair working conditions.But there is a far more fundamental reason why researching the informal economy is essential to understanding society today. Looking at the economy in the margins reminds us that all economies are still structured by power. While the neoclassical school has reduced economics to an efficiency game, the economies we find around us look different. They reproduce the power structures that are embedded in our societies.Even if formal institutions may promote equality of opportunity and perfect competition, they are embedded in a variety of informal rules and networks, which may benefit some and hurt others. Social capital, old boys networks, extended families, ethnicity, political connections - these determine who makes it big in the world of Tunisia＊s smugglers.They are the reason that Ahmed has a small booth selling kitchenware, while others, who have the right connections with the police, are making thousands every day, racing drugs across the desert. But to pretend that these institutions do not play a role in the UK formal economy would seem delusional even to a passing observer of economic life.Informal networks can help people get internships, jobs, they pass on information and influence legislation. Be it a certain Tunisian extended family and the market for smuggled gold, or the Bullingdon club and the market for male Conservative politicians, informal networks connect our society＊s power structures and economic life. They can be tools of accumulation and domination, or of support and relief.Thinking about informal economies therefore highlights features of our economies which are unregistered, and hence often ignored, but without which the price of clothes at Primark or the career of the current Foreign Secretary are difficult to explain. It turns our focus to a large world outside of official statistics and neoclassical economics. And it emphasises how closely our economies are structured by our societies, by their networks, attitudes, traditions, and stances on immigration. It forces us to take a fresh look at how economic dynamics are also changing our societies. Informal employment is on the rise, globally and in the UK. In the age of , Uber and TaskRabbit, we are witnessing an informalisation of working conditions for many employees, as the formal economy also wants a slice of the informal pie. Ahmed＊s market, formal-looking but entirely off the books, doesn＊t seem so exotic now. How is this going to change our society? How do we formalise the informal? Should we? Can we?So I talk to Ahmed, on the margins, to understand the margins that have opened up all around us."															
"With prices and wages heading in different directions, consumers are set to feel the pinch in 2017. Inflation surprised to the upside again on the latest figures.

Meanwhile, the January estimate of average weekly earnings suggested , down from 1.9% in December and 2.9% in November. Wage growth was below 2% in both the public (1.2%) and private sectors (1.9%).  analysts XpertHR suggest in their most recent survey that only 8.5% of pay awards over the next year will result in an increase to employees that is worth the same or more than the current rate of inflation. This pressure is likely to increase further through 2017 as the gap between wage growth and price rises widens. This is bad news for consumers and producers.Consistent with that, the  that retail sales volumes growth had eased. They expect retail sales to slow further during the year ahead as the fall in sterling feeds through to higher prices, reducing households＊ purchasing power. The agents also suggest that firms＊ employment intentions pointed to very slight growth in staffing over the coming six months. There has been a decline in the number of EU immigrants working in the UK. A similar pattern has occurred in the US with the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico declining sharply since Donald Trump won the election. Tourism is also down in the US.Surveys from the manufacturing, construction and services sectors in the UK suggest the economy has started to slow. In the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers＊ indices (PMIs), February＊s readings suggest 0.4% GDP growth in the first three months of the year, compared with 0.7% in the final quarter of 2016, according to the compilers. It is hard to see much good economic news this month. The  vote is now starting to have major negative consequences and it is only going to get worse. You were warned.UK inflation picked up sharply in February to 2.3%, indicating that the squeeze from higher global inflation and the fall in the pound is coming through to consumers. Meanwhile, total pay growth in the latest three months was just 2.2%. So for the first time in several years, inflation is now outpacing pay growth. This pattern is likely to persist through the year, as inflation is set to rise to 3% or more and pay rises are unlikely to keep pace with that rate of increase in prices.The resulting squeeze on consumer spending is already evident in the retail sales data. The deflator used for retail sales 每 which measures the prices of retail goods and petrol 每 has jumped up and is now 2.8% up on a year ago. The equivalent figure for February 2016 was minus 2.5%. In the three months December to February, the volume of retail sales was 1.4% down on the previous three months 每 the biggest decline on this measure for nearly seven years.There are other economic indicators pointing to a slowdown. The total number of UK employees increased by just 0.5% over the past year, according to the latest labour market data 每 the slowest annual rate of increase since the middle of 2012, when the economy was struggling because of the impact of the euro crisis. A key indicator of the growth of the services sector 每 the purchasing managers＊ index 每 also softened in March. Indicators of manufacturing activity are stronger, but all business surveys are showing a pickup in the rate of price increases, consistent with forecasts for a continued rise in inflation over the course of this year.Data released towards the end of last month have also confirmed that 2016 was the weakest year for business investment since the financial crisis, with the volume of capital spending down by 1.5% after six years of consistent growth. This is possibly a sign that uncertainty associated with the EU referendum is having a dampening impact on investment plans, and this uncertainty is likely to persist over the next couple of years as the article 50 negotiations with the EU proceed.I have been arguing for some time that interest rates should be gradually rising. The problem this year is that the slowdown in the economy could make that more difficult, even though it would be the right policy. The monetary policy committee will probably regret not having acted earlier as the pound continues to weaken and inflation surges."															
"British households are being warned to prepare for a tightening squeeze on living standards, as a Guardian analysis shows the  vote＊s blow to the pound is stoking inflation while pay packets are shrinking in real terms.As Theresa May prepares to trigger article 50 next week, kicking off the formal process of the UK leaving the EU, the economy continues to defy the doomsayers who predicted a sudden downturn after the referendum. But signs of a slowdown are now emerging as higher prices put pressure on companies and consumers alike.Nine months on from the referendum, the Guardian＊s monthly tracker of economic news shows inflation is at its highest level for more than three years, retail sales have lost momentum and  despite the lowest unemployment rate for more than a decade.But the housing market appears to have escaped the post-referendum downturn that some commentators were predicting and though consumer spending slowed at the turn of the year, it recovered somewhat last month.There is also evidence that Britain＊s trade performance has been boosted by the pound＊s fall since the referendum and strong tax receipts have helped improve the state of the public finances.To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE. shows a better than expected performance in five of the eight categories. Two were worse than expected.  and in February jumped higher than economists had forecast. but the pound remains down around 16% against the dollar with repercussions for an economy heavily reliant on imports.At 2.3% last month, inflation was the highest since September 2013 and above the Bank of England＊s 2% target. It is expected to rise further this year thanks to higher crude oil prices and because the weaker pound is making imports such as food ingredients and fuel more expensive. The latest official snapshot of living costs showed fuel cost 19% more this February than a year ago. as a long period of food price deflation came to an end. The pound effect on imported food was compounded for some groceries by shortages after bad weather in southern Europe hit crops. The price of an iceberg lettuce, for example,  每 from 54p in January 每 as .Intensifying fears over household finances and the outlook for consumer spending, wage growth again missed expectations in the latest official update, which covered the three months to January.  was still ahead of inflation. But for January alone, wage growth slowed dramatically to 1.7%, making it weaker than the main measure of inflation at 1.8% that month.Writing in the Guardian, a former member of the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee, David Blanchflower, .※With prices and wages heading in different directions consumers are set to feel the pinch in 2017,§ said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US.※It is hard to see much good economic news this month. The Brexit vote is now starting to have major negative consequences and it is only going to get worse.§The pressure on household finances bodes ill for the wider economy where consumer spending has been the main driver of relatively robust growth.At his budget earlier this month, Philip Hammond was able to announce a  from the government＊s independent forecasters. The Office for Budget Responsibility raised its  this year to 2% from 1.4% made at the time of November＊s autumn statement.But it highlighted many uncertainties ahead, and said there was little by the way of precedent to know how consumers and businesses would react to the Brexit process. Warning that support to the economy from household spending would wane as people contended with higher prices, the OBR predicted growth next year would be slower than previously thought, at just 1.6%.Business and consumer surveys appear to be bearing out that prediction, with  and .Figures on Thursday showed retail sales volumes rose in February, beating market expectations, but they were down when taking the latest three months together, signalling the weakest underlying performance for seven years.That picture chimed with a survey published this week suggesting .Closely watched polls of companies in the services and manufacturing sectors signalled that activity slowed last month as they grappled with higher costs. A better performance in the smaller construction sector was not enough to offset that weakness and the compilers of the reports 每 the  每 said GDP growth looked to have shifted down a gear to 0.4% in the first quarter from the relatively strong 0.7% growth in the final quarter of 2016. Some companies say skills shortages are exacerbating their cost pressures amid early signs that some EU migrants are starting to leave the UK. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said its analysis of official figures showed the biggest falls in EU workers were among graduates and those working in banking, the public sector and construction.The Bank of England has indicated it is watching dynamics in the labour market closely, in particular pay growth, as it continues to tread a tightrope between supporting growth and jobs while ensuring inflation does not rise too quickly.Under governor Mark Carney, policymakers have until recently stressed that they are happy to let inflation rise some way above its 2% target. But the minutes of the latest policy meeting suggested  from their current record low of 0.25%. Andrew Sentance, also a former member of the MPC, said the latest pick-up in UK inflation showed that the squeeze from higher global inflation and the fall in the pound was coming through to consumers. ※I have been arguing for some time that interest rates should be gradually rising. The problem this year is that the slowdown in the economy could make that more difficult, even though it would be the right policy,§ added Sentance, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC.※The MPC will probably regret not having acted earlier as the pound continues to weaken and inflation surges.§"

"ounded in 1860, awnings and blinds manufacturer  has seen its fair share of internal change and economic upheaval. The company also survived a major fire, in 1933. A feat managing director Nigel Sharrock, who took on the role in 1979, brushes off. ※Fires were a common occurrence in those days,§ he says.Sharrock took over from his father-in-law, who bought the business from the Robertshaws in 1960. The company, which has 24 staff, has also changed location a few times. Its most recent base is a factory unit in Bolton where all products are designed and manufactured. It is still a family business, with Nigel＊s wife Lesley, and son, Matthew, on the board. Sharrock says its 157-year survival lies in constant innovation, new machinery, family values and business sense. ※Even if you＊re doing really well today 每 don＊t stop there,§ warns Sharrock. ※Always look at new ways to innovate. You can＊t afford to stand still 每 the market and your customers＊ needs will change, and you need to be able adapt and evolve with them.§ Making the production process more efficient is part of how his business innovates. Investing in what Sharrock says is the UK＊s only integrated heat welding and hot-melt fabric-gluing machine is one example. Another is staff training: in the 2008 recession, the company made sure production staff were trained in all processes, rather than specialising in one as they had previously. More recently, the business has set up an apprenticeship scheme.Sharrock says it is important to attract and train new recruits as the company has an ageing workforce. ※Without introducing such a scheme we would soon struggle to have the right people in place to maintain our business growth.§David Smith, professor of innovation management at Nottingham Business School, says pinpointing what enables business longevity is difficult, but some factors do crop up regularly. A common plus is private ownership. ※Quite often, businesses survive because they are family businesses. The family retains control and they don＊t sell out,§ says Smith. They may also take a long-term approach to staff management. By retaining staff, Smith points out, businesses can more easily hold on to knowledge and skills and transfer them from generation to generation, which aids survival. However, he adds, a long-serving management and staff does not ensure endurance. ※There are cases when a new technology comes along and wipes out an industry in a very short space of time.§ Some broad examples include personal computers overtaking typewriters, digital cameras pushing out celluloid cameras and talkies usurping silent films.Some industries are less vulnerable to developments in technology but still have to adapt to wider uncertainties, such as recession. Take : Jacqueline O＊Donovan is now managing director of the company, which was founded by her father in 1959. She and her siblings Michael, Caroline and Anthony took over the company after their dad died suddenly in the mid-1980s. ※We＊ve all got senior roles and, over the years, we＊ve found our areas. The fact that there are four of us and we are spread across the business ensures we are a well-oiled wheel,§ says O＊Donovan.The business generated revenues of ?19.2m in 2016, and employs 160 people. O＊Donovan, who was just 19 when she became head of the business, faced her first recession in the late 1980s and says it was a family effort to sustain the business. ※Our level of service and attention to detail carried us through.§ While the business didn＊t make redundancies during this time, if someone left they were not replaced immediately. Instead their workload was shared out among the remaining staff. O＊Donovan believes being a woman in a male-dominated industry has helped her to see things differently. Take the business＊s uniform policy 每 all staff must wear its red and white uniforms (which match its vehicles) when delivering skips to householders. ※I say to my drivers: ＆how do you think your wife would feel if she didn＊t know that man at the door?＊ That＊s why we put uniforms on them, so they look smart and the brand is identifiable,§ she says.Staff training is also a focus. O＊Donovan learned how to be a trainer so she could oversee it personally. ※I＊ve got a real passion for upskilling staff. We＊ve got people who＊ve been here 10 to 15 years, because we have invested in them. It＊s important to keep the family feel to the business.§ O＊Donovan personally wishes each of her 160 employees happy birthday, for example. ※I think those little touches are important.§ Most of us will use a waste service at some point, this quality of being useful to all can lend a business longevity. Another type of business suited to survival, says Smith, are those that find niches and serve small, but profitable markets. These are often premium products, where customers savour the quality of the item and are happy to pay more. , founded in Glasgow in 1973 by Ivor Tiefenbrun, which manufactures music systems 每 amps, turntables and network music players 每 is one such enterprise. Unlike most manufacturers, it creates its products by hand and each bear the name of the person who assembled them. ※Craftsmanship may seem irrelevant in a high-tech, mass-production world, but for Linn it is the bedrock of all the company＊s products,§ says Gilad Tiefenbrun, the current managing director and founder＊s son. The business, which has a turnover of ?18m, exports across Europe, to the US and Japan. However, it has experienced hard times. The financial crash of 2007-08 led the company to cut its headcount from 300 to 150, for example. But it is now investing heavily in research and development, spending in excess of ?2m last year. ※Unless we continue to innovate, and come up with groundbreaking products, we don＊t have a future,§ says Tiefenbrun.Ever since his father founded the business, the company has aimed to be a leader in sound quality, says Tiefenbrun. ※We don＊t make anything unless it＊s better than what＊s available elsewhere. For us, good enough isn＊t good enough.§ Aside from innovating, Tiefenbrun says a solid company culture is vital to survival. ※Your company＊s values should be timeless, so that there remains the ability to adapt and grow within your industry, while still staying true to customer needs.§Enterprises that survive a long time have often developed an approach to business that defines how they operate, says Smith. In tough times, he says, most businesses choose between tight control and rationalisation (minimising costs) or innovation (new products and new markets), with the latter carrying a higher level of risk.※The ones that do survive often have core values that are well established,§ Smith adds. ※They don＊t opt for sudden, short-term gains, and tend to take a long-term view of things.§"															
"The UK construction industry could lose more than 175,000 EU workers 每 or 8% of the sector＊s workforce 每 if the country does not retain access to the European single market after , the government has been told.Such an outcome could put key infrastructure and construction projects at risk at a time when the sector was also facing other pressures, including the tax changes in the recent budget, said the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics).Its latest quarterly survey of the industry, conducted during the final three months of 2016, showed that 30% of construction professionals said hiring non-UK workers was important to the success of their business. The companies most affected are predominantly those working on big projects or based in the south-east.The government either has to secure continued access to the single market or put alternative plans in place for companies to easily employ non-EU workers as replacements, Rics said. Skilled construction workers have not been added to the UK shortage occupations list 每 an official list that will give some sectors priority during the visa application process. Jeremy Blackburn, head of UK policy at Rics, said: ※These figures reveal that the UK construction industry is currently dependent on thousands of EU workers [around 176,500].※It is in all our interests that we make a success of Brexit, but a loss of access to the single market has the potential to slowly bring the UK＊s ?500bn infrastructure pipeline to a standstill. That means that unless access to the single market is secured or alternative plans are put in place, we won＊t be able to create the infrastructure needed to enable our cities to compete on a global stage.※A lot of big projects may set up their own training centres but they will still need an international pool of labour. A simple first step would be to ensure that construction professions, such as quantity surveyors, feature on the shortage occupations list. Ballet dancers won＊t improve our infrastructure or solve the housing crisis yet their skills are currently viewed as essential, whereas construction professionals are not.§Rics said more should be done to increase the number of skilled UK workers, through initiatives such as apprenticeships schemes. According to its quarterly report, 20% of those surveyed said such schemes were not effective. Rics said it recognised it had to do more to educate industry about the benefits of apprenticeships.Blackburn said: ※Key to [building a resilient construction industry] will be growing the domestic skills base. As the industry＊s professional body, we are working with government and industry to develop that skills base, building vital initiatives, such as degree apprenticeships, in our sector to drive the talent pipeline forward.※This survey reveals that more work needs to be done to promote the indisputable benefits of these schemes to industry, and Rics intends to take this forward as a priority.§He added that which were announced in the budget, would also hit the sector, where about 40% of the workforce were in that category. He also pointed to a crackdown on VAT avoidance in the construction sector and tax changes to profits of overseas property developers: ※All of that coming together will make for challenges for the sector.§The construction industry has been recovering ground since the financial crisis, but there have been signs of a potential slowdown even before the Brexit process is triggered and the budget changes come into full effect. Government figures released last week showed that  with output in January down 0.4% month on month. Meanwhile new orders for the final three months of the year fell 2.8% quarter on quarter.Savills estate agency recently predicted , with up to half the planned developments in central London likely to be postponed or scrapped.

"Like a lot of people, I was very interested in the Institute for Fiscal Studies＊ criticisms of the parties＊ policy proposals 每 given that the latter would no more than somewhat ease the position of our severely cash-strapped health and social care services (, 27 May). Could the IFS now do us all a favour before this election gets underway and tell us once and for all what they think it would cost to ※fully meet our public care needs§ (viz, the figure which would meet all major needs, fully cover ongoing costs, and ultimately repay borrowing for associated capital expenditure) 每 as, for example, ※a percentage increase on existing direct tax rates§. Would, say, another 10% in all rates (2p on the 20% rate, 4p on 40% and 4.5p on the 45% rate) meet the bill? Or would the figure be more like 20% on all rates? Or some yet higher figure?At least we would then reach square one in deciding what we should do to fully sort this out, at and beyond this election: pay the estimated direct tax increases; find other ways of raising revenue; get people to take out more private insurance; or contemplate continued strain on our ill and our frail old people till kingdom come?. I＊m surprised that none of the reporters at the IFS presentation actually raised this. Come to think of it, the Guardian＊s own economic commentators may have their own estimates. In any event could someone, somewhere please enlighten us, preferably before we take to the booths? The Institute for Fiscal Studies＊ critique of the Conservative and Labour manifestos reported by Larry Elliott(, 27 May) has added to my confusion over their plans for the NHS. During the next five years the Conservatives promise to spend an extra ?8bn and Labour promises an extra ?30bn on the English NHS. According to the King＊s Fund, current annual spending on the English NHS is ?123.7bn, which means that, without any increase, and ignoring inflation, total spending over five years will be ?618.5bn. Against this vast sum the extra expenditure promised by both parties is derisory and the IFS＊s statement that the Conservative promise represents an annual real-term increase of 1.2% per annum is impossible to understand. It is clear that the Labour promise is nearly four times greater than that of the Conservatives, but is still totally inadequate. The funding of the NHS has hardly been discussed by politicians or the media during the election campaign so far and this fills me with great concern for the future of this precious institution. You report the claim by the IFS that Labour＊s plans ※will not work§ and would require taxing across the population because to tax the rich and corporations would not generate sufficient revenue. What is missing from the current election debate and almost all media coverage is a statement of how much wealth there is in the UK and its intense concentration in the top 10% of society. The most modest estimate of this is that over ?5tn is owned by this group; by comparison the entire national debt is just ?1.7tn.  is proposing to raise ?48.6bn in new taxes. The IFS should concede that this is peanuts compared to actual level of wealth which exists. There is a swelling tide of recognition that business practices have to change fundamentally if ※free§ market, shareholder-value-driven capitalism isn＊t to implode. Theresa May began her time in office with talk of building an inclusive economy, commissioning a review into mission-led business, and publishing two white papers on corporate governance and industrial strategy. An investor as respected as Larry Fink of Blackrock is making public statements on the urgency for change; academia and the public are all expressing increasing scepticism in the established business model.However, Felicity Lawrence demonstrates (, 26 May) that for many multinationals, and their professional advisors, either the message is not getting through, or is regarded as irrelevant. Clearly their claims are not consistent with the intent behind the relevant legislation, and no fundamental hardship was caused to them by the application of the laws as they were commonly understood to apply at the time. The ideal would be for the corporations voluntarily to state that, notwithstanding the technical merits of their case, they can see that they will do greater good to their wider stakeholder base by not depleting the public purse for the sake of a temporary boost to their bottom line. If that shift in perception is beyond those in charge, the government could seek to impose a one-off windfall tax, of an equivalent amount, on those businesses accepting the tax rebate. And if we cannot rely on business to do the right thing, or government to direct it to be done, then it falls on each of us to boycott the offending corporations to demonstrate there are consequences to such greed and venality, even when the law appears to condone it. Your article by Patrick Collinson () showing broadly similar tax rates across developed economies is somewhat misleading since it ignores the impact of the very high rates of local taxation in the UK that are used by government to mask the overall tax rates. By way of comparison, the Swedes, for example, pay no local taxes whatsoever, so the tax rates are all up front, not disingenuously disguised. Oh, and every Swedish citizen＊s tax return is a matter of public record as well."															
"Thousands of private investors who claim they were misled by  and its former chief executive Fred Goodwin into investing in the bank before it was rescued by the taxpayer are being urged to settle their legal case.An action group representing investors involved in the long-running legal battle has told its members it has decided to accept the 82p-a-share offer, which RBS presented to them.The case has been adjourned until 7 June to allow the shareholders to consider the ?200m settlement from RBS. If the deal is accepted, Goodwin and other former directors of the bank would no longer be required to give evidence in the high court.A letter sent to members of the RBS Shareholder Action Group on Saturday states: ※Having carefully considered the merits of the current offer ... we have decided to accept the offer of 82p per share on behalf of our membership. This is a decision which is fully supported by our legal advisers.※We understand that accepting an offer of slightly below the previously advised range of damages, being 92p per share and 234p per share, may be surprising to some claimants. However, there are a number of practical and legal risks which had to be considered.§The letter goes on to say that while ※the merits of the case against the bank remain strong, the merits against the individual director defendants has always been more mixed§.It also adds that, even if shareholders won the case, RBS would be likely to appeal against the claim as it relates to ※a previously untested piece of legislation§, while another trial to assess the level of damages would also need to take place.The claimants allege they were misled into buying the bank＊s shares in a ?12bn cash call in April 2008 每 six months before it was bailed out 每 and are bringing their action against the bank, Goodwin and three other former directors.It is understood the group needs the approval of 70% of the claimants to accept the deal. An action group source said institutional shareholders involved in the claim would accept, while the majority of retail investors being represented by share trading platforms had also indicated they would take 82p a share. Each of the two groups is thought to account for about 40% of the claimants.It is not known which way the remaining 20% of independent shareholders will vote, or if their views will be significant to the result. as they do not want a deal, because they want to hold former senior managers to account.The letter to claimants also confirms that Trevor Hemmings, who owns Preston North End football club and has been providing funding for the claim, has decided to accept the deal and was no longer prepared to provide funding 每 meaning any shareholders wanting to continue would need to find a new financial backer.The action group＊s letter adds: ※The claim is presently being funded by a substantial claimant in the action. That claimant has decided to accept the offer and they are no longer willing to fund the action. That means that there is currently no available funding to fund the legal and other costs to take the matter to trial.§While the court is not currently sitting, Mr Justice Hildyard wants an update this week and  before they reappear in court on 7 June.At that hearing, any shareholders wanting to continue will have to state to the court that they have the funding to carry on 每 a position that some involved with the case view as extremely difficult to finalise in the timeframe.The action group＊s letter adds: ※All of the [institutional investors] have now indicated that they will accept the 82p offer ... As a result, the economic platform of costs sharing will be destabilised, meaning a smaller number of claimants sharing the costs burden, and also increasing the potential liability for adverse costs which would be divided amongst fewer continuing claimants.※In these circumstances, the viability of the case continuing to trial is now significantly in doubt.§RBS has been facing a number of legal claims in relation to the April cash call.In December, the bank started to settle claims which had once amounted to ?4bn by announcing it had  among the various factions bringing claims. RBS has settled with 87% of them without admitting liability but to ※minimise material litigation expense and management distraction§.The previous settlements have been about 42p a share."															
"ext year I＊ll be leaving school and I don＊t know what that will mean for my life. Obviously a lot of 18 year olds feel this way, but for me it＊s different. I have profound physical disabilities and a learning disability.This is my first time voting and I know that, as a disabled person, my future will be greatly shaped by the next government.So on Tuesday I＊m going to the , with learning disability charity Mencap, to have my voice heard. Because this election came about so quickly, there is only going to be one disability hustings event with candidates from the main parties.Despite disabled people often being the first to feel the effects of government policies, we are the last to be listened to.I worry that during this election campaign, disabled voices aren＊t being heard and we can＊t let that happen. We are more affected than any other group by political decisions.Benefits and social care have changed so much for disabled people in the past few years that I really don＊t know what life will be like in 2018.I do know that it will be difficult for me to get a job.  with a learning disability are in full-time employment. But I have skills, and I＊ll have qualifications when I leave school. I＊m also a disability rights campaigner. I even managed to get  (toilets that mean people with more profound disabilities don＊t have to be changed on the floor) when I was just 16.I have a lot to offer, but many employers just put a block on it. They don＊t see past the disability and they don＊t know that all it takes is reasonable adjustments. But it＊s not just up to employers, the next government has to change things.The number of disabled people with a job hasn＊t really risen, and without government help it won＊t. Unless whoever forms the next administration promises to do something, people like me will leave school without the chance of finding work. It makes me sad because I＊d love to make a living doing something I＊m passionate about, like campaigning.So I know I＊ll be heavily reliant on benefits like .  don＊t get through the application process for PIP even though many qualify for it. I＊m less worried about me, my physical disability is so severe it will be hard for them to turn me down. But at the same time so many people who need PIP as much as I do get rejected. That＊s wrong and it＊s something the next government has to review.At tomorrow＊s National  Hustings, I also want to ask about the NHS. I＊m concerned about disability services in my community, beyond hospitals and outpatients, because these services are vital to help me live my life.I use a specialist seating system to get around, and in my area the services that provide this get contracted out to private companies. With the  in crisis, I don＊t know how much longer services like this will last. If they do go under, I don＊t have thousands of pounds to replace things like my chair. I think the people running the country should try and understand just how much these things change people＊s lives and listen to us.My future and the future of thousands of people like me rests with the new government. That＊s why my vote counts.People see me in my wheelchair and think, oh, we can push him aside. But people with a disability really have something to bring to the table, we can add so much to this country if we have the chance.I look at how things were 50 years ago and how things are now and I see a difference, but I think we have stopped moving forward. In some ways we are moving backwards. But we can make improvements. If the new government works with the disability community, if they listen to us, then with a lot of commitment and hard work I know we can make a change."															
" is considering making more products in the UK as the Swedish furniture chain bids to fend off Brexit-led price rises.The retailer already makes some sofas and mattresses in Britain, but UK boss Gillian Drakeford said it was actively examining how it might increase that work while looking at other products that can be sourced domestically.Drakeford told the Guardian that the chain＊s growing UK sales gave her the capacity and resources to source more locally.※We have a number of sofa suppliers in the UK we work with today and we are looking at what more products could we source in the UK.§ She said manufacturing and sourcing more locally could help offset the risks in importing goods.※Currency is our biggest challenge,§ she said, referring to the fall in value of the pound against the euro and the dollar, which despite recent fluctuations, is down by between 10% and 12% since the EU referendum. The lower value of the pound has made it more expensive to import goods while potential tariffs could also adds to costs.About 60% of Ikea＊s products are made in Europe with only a small proportion made in the UK.※We believe we can double market share here,§ Drakeford said. ※We＊ve been here for 30 years and will be here for the future.§She said inflation, which hit a three-and-a-half-year high of 2.7% last month, was feeding into the UK furnishings market and the company was determined to maintain its reputation for good value. So far this year, Drakeford said  had not seen shoppers holding back on buying expensive items such as kitchens and that the number of people visiting its stores had continued to rise.But she said: ※We know that wallets are going to be squeezed and inflation has started to kick in now and people are going to have less money in their pockets.§ All Ikea products are designed in Sweden but the group does develop local goods for certain markets if there is demand. Drakeford said any UK sourced goods would be developed alongside manufacturers. ※It＊s not us just going in and buying what you have,§ she said.She added that selling a bigger volume of items through its existing stores would help Ikea lower prices for shoppers. . Although Drakeford admitted there may be some price rises in the new Ikea catalogue when it is published in the UK in August, she said the price of some items which were clearly important to people would be cut.Earlier this week Ikea said it would as it opens stores in Sheffield, Exeter and Greenwich, south London. The chain has begun expanding again after . It is also experimenting with small stores in high streets and at a shopping centre.A double-digit percentage rise in online sales  for the 12 months to the end of August 2016. Today about 15% of Ikea＊s UK sales are online. Drakeford said she wanted to introduce a proper ※click and collect§ service in the UK early next year, which will allow shoppers to check availability for items in store online and order goods digitally for pick up later.She said the company wanted to test its four small stores for up to a year longer before deciding whether to open more. Drakeford said the stores held an advantage because they were closer to where shoppers lived.※Even after 30 years in the market we only reach 64% of the people. We know that there is huge market potential and our idea is to bring Ikea closer to the people,§ she said."															
"Theresa May＊s flagship manifesto proposal to shake up the funding of social care for older people has come under fire from the independent  and opposition parties.The IFS warned on Friday that the complex new system outlined in the Conservative party＊s manifesto, which would force more elderly people to pay for their own care, ※makes no attempt to deal with the fundamental challenge of social care funding§.While some households would fare better because of a higher, ?100,000 means test, the IFS said that overall the new system would be ※less generous§. It would fail to tackle the ※insurance problem§ that means individuals cannot plan for the risk of having to pay very high costs in their old age.On Thursday, the Conservatives announced plans to make people needing help in their own homes pay the costs of long-term social care, with only ?100,000 of the value of their estate protected. Announcing the plan, the party said it would ※address the fundamental unfairness at the heart of Britain＊s elderly care system and tackle the long-term challenges of an ageing society§.Labour attacked the plans as part of a , alongside the weakening of the triple-lock guarantee on the basic state pension and the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance.The shadow chancellor, , called the changes a ※savage attack on vulnerable pensioners§ on Friday as he sought to position Labour as the party representing older voters.Speaking in London alongside the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, McDonnell unveiled a new  election poster warning of a ※triple whammy for pensioners§. The slogan and poster deliberately echo a famous 1992 Conservative poster warning of a Labour ※double whammy§.McDonnell also criticised May＊s party for providing few projected costings for its pledges. He contrasted the Tory manifesto with Labour＊s, which offers a supporting document of assumed costs and tax revenues, and he predicted that this could be a tipping point in the election campaign.※Yesterday the Conservative party abandoned older people,§ McDonnell said. ※There was a triple whammy: the tearing up of the triple lock, the attack on the winter fuel allowance and the , so people can lose their homes.§He cited a calculation by the Resolution Foundation thinktank showing that the projected savings from means-testing the winter fuel payment meant five out of six pensioners, or around 10 million people, would lose the allowance. ※To be frank, I am angry,§ McDonnell said. ※This is a savage attack on vulnerable pensioners, particularly those who are just about managing. It is disgraceful and we are calling on the  now to withdraw it.§A Conservative spokesman said: ※Theresa May and her Conservative team are offering a long-term plan to ensure that elderly people in need of social care receive the dignified and high-quality care they deserve, with the funding to make the system sustainable.§Separately, the Conservatives were accused of hypocrisy after the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, confirmed that the winter fuel allowance would remain universal for pensioners in Scotland.Appearing alongside the prime minister to launch the Scottish Tory manifesto, which is more centrist in key areas than May＊s, Davidson said the Conservatives would use Holyrood＊s devolved powers to keep winter fuel payments as a universal benefit, because Scotland＊s winters were worse.The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: ※The Tories are utter hypocrites. How can they take cash off English pensioners and then give it to Scottish pensioners? It looks like a cheap election bung and it won＊t wash.※It is utterly scandalous that the Conservatives want to axe the triple lock and now do this. Theresa May and her ministers are just taking pensioners and their votes for granted. They don＊t seem to care about them.§Pensioners voted overwhelmingly for the Conservatives in the 2015 general election, and are more likely to turn out and vote than their younger counterparts. The former prime minister, David Cameron, repeatedly pledged to maintain pensioner benefits, but May appears to be sufficiently confident in her commanding poll lead to risk policies that could be unpopular with older voters.Speaking in Edinburgh on Friday alongside Davidson, the prime minister said the Conservatives would help Scotland to ※grow and flourish§ after Brexit, by investing heavily in the country＊s industries and deprived communities.Repeatedly referring in her speech to the ※Conservative and Unionist party§ and her ※unionist government§, to bolster her hardline stance against Scottish independence, May said she would offer ※a unionist government at the service of ordinary working families§."															
"Recent announcements from across the political spectrum have raised the issue of living wages and statutory minimum wages. With inflation rising and wages not keeping pace, no doubt the debate around what level statutory wages should sit at will continue in the weeks, months and years to come. In the meantime, we should champion businesses that go beyond what＊s legally required of them in supporting those at the lowest end of the pay scale by rewarding them fairly. Amid the predictions and pledges on what a minimum wage could look like in 2020 or 2022, there＊s a growing movement of over 3,000 responsible employers who aren＊t waiting for government to instruct them. Instead, today they are all voluntarily paying their employees, including subcontracted staff, at least the real living wage 每 currently ?8.45 an hour across the UK and ?9.75 in London, reflecting the increased living costs of the capital.Academics, business leaders and civil society representatives oversee the calculation process to ensure the wage rate is robust and fair. We don＊t predict; instead, we make sound calculations."															
"As senior representatives for modern languages in the UK, we are surprised and disturbed to hear that the University of Manchester plans to cut 35 posts in its School of arts, languages and cultures, alongside further jobs in business and in biology, medicine and health. Staff in German, French, Italian, Hebrew and Spanish have been told that their jobs are ※at risk§ because these areas supposedly recruit fewer and lower quality students than the Russell Group tariff average. We have not seen hard evidence of this claim; we do know that modern languages at Manchester have a stellar reputation nationally and internationally, and that the areas targeted for radical reduction have excellent student ratings for teaching quality as well as very significant research power. Recent harsh marking in modern languages A-levels has led to a mistaken perception of applicants as being of ※lower quality§; and at a time when there is a clear need to stimulate recruitment for modern languages across higher education, we urge the university to address the issue positively and proactively in the context of a proven and urgent need for graduates with languages in the UK (see, for example, the  and  reports).It is worth recalling that over ?3m has been awarded to Manchester precisely to support and encourage research in modern languages 2016-2020. The university signed a letter of support for modern languages which was received by the Arts and Humanities Research Council in connection with Manchester＊s Open World Research Initiative (OWRI) application in 2015.A proposal to shed linguists and cross-cultural experts is clearly against the best interests of the UK, now more than ever as we face the economic and societal complexities of leaving the EU. If it pushes through its plans regardless, the  will in the medium and longer term do the UK a great disservice. In the short term it will send a powerful and ill-timed signal about the perception of the value of European languages and cultures.The university states that its plan is to ※enhance the student and staff experience and improve research§. That seems an unlikely outcome of these cuts. Students of Manchester University are already expressing their profound concern, via (among other things) a  and a . We share their concern, and urge the university to reconsider.         "															
"t the end of the first quarter, according to the , American  for the first time exceeded its previous peak (in dollars), reached in the third quarter of 2008, just as the global financial crisis erupted. Although car loans and student debt have been rising especially rapidly, housing debt remains more than two-thirds of the $12.7tn total.As a share of income, household debt is nothing like the threat to the national economy that it was 10 years ago. But the new statistic is a reminder that American households don＊t save enough.Some would attribute Americans＊ tendency to spend 每 while Asians, for example, tend to save 每 to cultural factors. But there is an important policy component as well. US government policy is designed as if to encourage Americans to take on as much housing debt as possible.Economists hesitate to explain to people that they should borrow less. The advice sounds too schoolmarmish. It seems to lack empathy for those whose incomes are not keeping up with the standard of living that historical trends had led them to expect. But it does no one any favours to encourage over-indebtedness as a matter of policy, as the millions who lost their homes in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis discovered.Owning your own home is said to be an essential part of the American dream. There is nothing wrong with dreaming. But there is nothing wrong with renting, either. Buying a house is typically a consequence, not a cause, of a family＊s prosperity.Advocates of an ※ownership society§ argue that homeowners take better care of their property than renters, with positive externalities for the neighbourhood. But public encouragement of homeownership also . In the last US recession, many who lost their jobs could not move to other parts of the country where jobs were more plentiful, because they couldn＊t sell their homes. There is  that the housing crisis boxed in jobseekers.Encouraging home ownership isn＊t cheap. The overall effective annual subsidy to US housing debt has been  at roughly 1% of national income. The largest component of this subsidy is the tax deductibility of home mortgage interest, which costs a lot of revenue and is hard to justify on distributive grounds: the benefit goes only to those with incomes high enough to itemise deductions.If President Donald Trump manages to get any economic legislation passed at all in the coming year, it is likely to be a tax cut. Congressional Republicans say they want revenue-neutral, efficiency-enhancing tax reform, which is properly defined as lowering marginal tax rates but simultaneously eliminating distortionary deductions, thereby keeping revenues and the budget deficit stable. In that case, the deductibility of home mortgage interest should be among the first targets for reform. Yet the Trump administration has explicitly ruled out curtailing it.Particularly suspicious in the case of Trump is his support for giveaways in the tax code that benefit only real-estate developers like him. One such loophole lets developers deduct losses that exceed their investments. Another is the use of ※like-kind exchanges§ to avoid capital gains tax.But the problem goes well beyond Trump or the Republicans. The policies that favour mortgage debt are extremely popular. Virtually all politicians of both major political parties have long supported them, taking the goal of maximising homeownership as self-evident.Beyond the deductibility of home mortgage interest, borrowers are permitted to make down payments of as little as 5% (or even less) of the value of the house they buy, rather than the more standard 20%. Many other countries, such as  and , have regulations 每 loan-to-value ratios, for example 每 limiting how much households can borrow. They even manage to tighten the loan limits or tax measures counter-cyclically, which is the recommended way to help .But the US is not the only country with measures that tilt toward excessive housing debt. In the UK, for example, the help to buy initiative has subsidised home purchases with down payments of only 5%.Another way the US has long subsidised housing debt is through the huge quasi-government mortgage underwriters Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Both were privately owned but had an implicit government guarantee from taxpayers, a classic case of moral hazard. Sure enough, they were put in federal conservatorship in 2008. Congress could easily repeat the mistake of privatising them while failing to eliminate the implicit guarantee. Their capital standards should be raised, just as regulators have appropriately forced banks to do.The Dodd-Frank  bill, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010, contained many provisions to reduce the chances of another big financial crisis. But the law would have moved the financial system further in the right direction if many in Congress had not spent the last seven years  at it.Here is one example. The Dodd-Frank law wisely required banks and other mortgage originators to retain on their books at least 5% of the housing loans they made, rather than repackaging every last one for resale to others. The loan originators need to have ※skin in the game,§ in order to have an incentive to verify borrowers＊ creditworthiness. Under heavy pressure from Congress, that requirement was gutted in 2014.Ironically, the encouragement of housing debt in the US doesn＊t even succeed in raising homeownership rates relative to other countries: even at the peak of the housing boom, the subsidies drove up the price of housing more than the quantity. Homeownership was no higher than in many countries with more sensible mortgage policies (no tax deductibility), such as Canada. The 2007-09 crisis lowered it from 69% to 63%. And of course the housing debt distortion was itself a key contributor to the crash.Most economists have long frowned on US policies that subsidise homeownership. But most held their tongues. And now many Americans no longer want to hear from experts. When did that loss of faith happen? ? "															
"Uncertainty about who will lead  divorce talks for Britain is a ※very real problem§, the diplomat who helped draft article 50 has said, as he warned the UK faces a 45% chance of crashing out of the EU with no deal.John Kerr, a crossbench peer who served as the UK＊s ambassador to the EU, said there was ※a very real problem in the United Kingdom ... that it is not clear who the negotiators are going to be§.He was speaking before the Brexit secretary, David Davis, asserted that . But on the day Barnier published , senior sources in Brussels could not say who the Frenchman＊s opposite number would be. ※There are elections coming up,§ said a senior EU official. ※We are not speculating about who our interlocutor is.§Kerr said it was clear Davis was going to play a role in the talks, unlike Boris Johnson, but raised questions about his room for manoeuvre from No 10. ※It seems clear that the foreign secretary is not going to play any role in this negotiation,§ he said. ※It seems clear that Mr Davis is, but to what extent he is an independent operator I don＊t know.§Kerr, who worked for Davis during John Major＊s government, went on to describe the Brexit secretary as a clever man, who was ※nice, straightforward, honest [but] not particularly experienced in this sort of dossier§.According to sources in Brussels, May told Jean-Claude Juncker she would be chief Brexit negotiator, a prospect senior EU officials regard as completely unrealistic. The EU expects to hold intense week-long negotiating sessions in Brussels every month for the 14- or 15-month duration of the peak Brexit talks 每 an impossible job for a prime minister.The talks will be conducted in French and English with interpretation, as Barnier wants the right to speak in his native language. Talking to a small Brussels audience at the European Policy Centre, Kerr said the British government had made ※a very large negotiating mistake§ by not making the EU an early offer of the closest possible cooperation on foreign policy, counter-terrorism and intelligence sharing. He added that a ※small circle§ around May was controlling Brexit, with the Foreign Office, most officials and ministers cut out of the debate.He also did not hide his view that May ※seems to be in full cherry-picking mode§ in her attempt to keep hold of the parts of the EU she likes best, an approach the EU has vetoed. But he criticised the EU for the strict negotiating timetable that means the Brexit bill must be agreed before discussing future trade. The article 50 text, which Kerr played a role in drafting, states that the divorce deal shall take ※account of the framework for [the departing state＊s] future relationship with the Union§. He said the EU had made a legal and political mistake, arguing that such a strict division ※could have a price, by meaning the British will settle for a much smaller sum§. You can calculate the bill by reference to the past, but you must present it as the price of the future.§ EU officials rejected this thesis, but some think the atmosphere was poisoned by May＊s attempt to link security cooperation with a good Brexit deal, suggesting the pre-negotiation build up could have been different."															
"f your weekly shopping bills seem to be going up, even though the price of a pint of?milk is holding steady, there is a good reason for that. According to industry watchdogs, British supermarkets have responded to Brexit-induced inflation and the weaker pound by  such as light bulbs, water filters and dental floss.According to the Office of National Statistics, food prices rose in annual terms . Comparison website MySupermarket.co.uk compiled data from Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury＊s, Waitrose, Ocado and Morrisons and found that, while milk stood still at ?1 for four pints everywhere, the cost of an exotic fish supper has increased markedly since last October.※The items that are going up in?price are more likely to be luxury items such as fancy fish, decorative candles, or eclairs and doughnuts,§ says Aisling Lawless of MySupermarket.com.※Customers are less likely to notice those increases, because they don＊t buy those things very frequently. But you＊re going to?notice if your milk is more expensive. You might even go to another supermarket to see if their milk is cheaper, and the retailer could lose a customer. The supermarkets push up prices on non-essentials to avoid raising the prices of essential items.§Competition between the chains is keeping a lid on the cost of weekly staples, says Lawless, but as Brexit really begins to bite, that could become unsustainable. Almost half the food in UK supermarkets comes from overseas. ※We hope that British-produced products such as milk will stay around the same price. But consumers should pay attention to price increases on anything coming from outside the UK.§That doesn＊t just mean rolling tobacco 每 which increased in price by almost 38% between October and March 每 or smoked kippers, up by 7.3% in the same period. It?also means common fresh fruit?and vegetables, such as bananas, which went up in price by around 12% between January and February alone. Poor growing conditions, such as those in southern Europe which resulted in a shortage of iceberg lettuce in January and February, are also a?factor.Aubergines, meanwhile, are 13.33% more expensive than they were last autumn. Au revoir, ratatouille."															
"The managing director of the International Monetary Fund has delivered one of her strongest condemnations of , warning that putting up barriers to trade would be a ※self-inflicted wound§ to an improving global economy.Christine Lagarde used a to launch a strong attack on the go-it-alone approach championed by the US president during his election battle with Hillary Clinton.※In our hyper-connected world, national policies tend to have major spillovers across borders. We are all sitting figuratively in the same boat. Which is why we need to encourage countries to support strong international cooperation,§ she said.Speaking before the IMF＊s spring meeting next week, Lagarde added that international cooperation had been vital in preventing the deep recession of 2008-09 turning into a second .After Trump picked strong critics of the IMF to be key members of his treasury team, Lagarde defended her organisation, saying it had helped foster the international cooperation that had underpinned a ※phenomenal rise in incomes and living standards around the world§.She added: ※More recently, we worked together to ensure that the great recession did not become another Great Depression. Cooperation through a multilateral framework has benefited every country. Fostering more resilient growth therefore requires more international cooperation 每 not less.§Trump has threatened to put swingeing tariffs on Chinese goods and to impose a tax on imports coming into the US, as part of an economic strategy designed to put America first.Lagarde said cooperation was a better way of dealing with the global imbalances that had resulted in some countries, such as China and Germany, running trade surpluses while others, including the US, run deficits. This meant working together to ensure that countries observed a level playing field, including by avoiding protectionist measures.※Restricting trade would be a self-inflicted wound that disrupts supply chains, hurts global output, and inflates the prices of production materials and consumer goods. And low-income households are hurt the most as they consume the largest part of their incomes,§ she said.The IMF will release its half-yearly health check on the global economy next week, but Lagarde hinted that the growth prospects for 2017 would be revised up.After six years of disappointing growth, Lagarde said the global economy was gaining momentum, holding out the prospect of more jobs and higher incomes.She pointed out that the outlook had improved across the developed world, including in Europe, which had previously been lagging behind the US. Even so, emerging and developing countries would contribute more than 75% of global GDP growth in 2017.※At the same time, there are clear downside risks: political uncertainty, including in Europe; the sword of protectionism hanging over global trade; and tighter global financial conditions that could trigger disruptive capital outflows from emerging and developing economies,§ Lagarde said.Weak productivity remained a severe drag on strong and inclusive growth, she added, largely because of population ageing, the slowdown in trade and weak private investment since the financial crisis."															
"o what are we going to do about it? This is the only question worth asking. But the answers appear elusive. Faced with a multifaceted crisis 每 the capture of governments by billionaires and their lobbyists, extreme inequality, the rise of demagogues, above all the collapse of the living world 每 those to whom we look for leadership appear stunned, voiceless, clueless. Even if they had the courage to act, they have no idea what to do.The most they tend to offer is more economic growth: the fairy dust supposed to make all the bad stuff disappear. Never mind that it drives ecological destruction; that it has failed to relieve structural unemployment or ; that, in some recent years,  has been harvested by the top 1%. As values, principles and moral purpose are lost, the promise of growth is all that＊s left.You can see the effects in a  from the UK＊s Foreign Office: ※Trade and growth are now priorities for all posts ＃ work like climate change and illegal wildlife trade will be scaled down.§ All that counts is the rate at which we turn natural wealth into cash. If this destroys our prosperity and the wonders that surround us, who cares?We cannot hope to address our predicament without a new worldview. We cannot use the models that caused our crises to solve them. We need to reframe the problem. This is what the most inspiring book published so far this year has done.In , Kate Raworth of Oxford University＊s Environmental Change Institute reminds us that economic growth was not, at first, intended to signify wellbeing. , who standardised the measurement of growth, warned: ※The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income.§ Economic growth, he pointed out, measured only annual flow, rather than stocks of wealth and their distribution. points out that economics in the 20th century ※lost the desire to articulate its goals§. It aspired to be a science of human behaviour: a science based on a deeply flawed portrait of humanity. The dominant model 每 ※rational economic man§, self-interested, isolated, calculating 每 says more about the nature of economists than it does about other humans. The loss of an explicit objective allowed the discipline to be captured by a proxy goal: endless growth.The aim of economic activity, she argues, should be ※meeting the needs of all within the means of the planet§. Instead of economies that need to grow, whether or not they make us thrive, we need economies that ※make us thrive, whether or not they grow§. This means changing our picture of what the economy is and how it works.The central image in mainstream economics is the circular flow diagram. It depicts a closed flow of income cycling between households, businesses, banks, government and trade, operating in a social and ecological vacuum. Energy, materials, the natural world, human society, power, the wealth we hold in common ＃ all are missing from the model. The unpaid work of carers 每 principally women 每 is ignored, though no economy could function without them. Like rational economic man, this representation of economic activity bears little relationship to reality.So Raworth begins by redrawing the economy. She embeds it in the Earth＊s systems and in society, showing how it depends on the flow of materials and energy, and reminding us that we are more than just workers, consumers and owners of capital.This recognition of inconvenient realities then leads to her breakthrough: a graphic representation of the world we want to create. Like all the best ideas, her doughnut model seems so simple and obvious that you wonder why you didn＊t think of it yourself. But achieving this clarity and concision requires years of thought: a great decluttering of the myths and misrepresentations in which we have been schooled.The diagram consists of two rings. The inner ring of the doughnut represents a sufficiency of the resources we need to lead a good life: food, clean water, housing, sanitation, energy, education, healthcare, democracy. Anyone living within that ring, in the hole in the middle of the doughnut, is in a state of deprivation. The outer ring of the doughnut consists of the Earth＊s environmental limits, beyond which we inflict dangerous levels of climate change, ozone depletion, water pollution, loss of species and other assaults on the living world.The area between the two rings 每 the doughnut itself 每 is the ※ecologically safe and socially just space§ in which humanity should strive to live. The purpose of economics should be to help us enter that space and stay there.As well as describing a better world, this model allows us to see, in immediate and comprehensible terms, the state in which we now find ourselves. At the moment we transgress both lines. Billions of people still live in the hole in the middle. We have breached the outer boundary in several places.An economics that helps us to live within the doughnut would seek to reduce inequalities in wealth and income. Wealth arising from the gifts of nature would be widely shared. Money, markets, taxation and public investment would be designed to conserve and regenerate resources rather than squander them. State-owned banks would invest in projects that transform our relationship with the living world, such as zero-carbon public transport and community energy schemes. New metrics would measure genuine prosperity, rather than the speed with which we degrade our long-term prospects.Such proposals are familiar; but without a new framework of thought, piecemeal solutions are unlikely to succeed. By rethinking economics from first principles, Raworth allows us to integrate our specific propositions into a coherent programme, and then to measure the extent to which it is realised.I see her as the  of the 21st century: by reframing the economy, she allows us to change our view of who we are, where we stand, and what we want to be.Now we need to turn her ideas into policy. Read her book, then demand that those who wield power start working towards its objectives: human prosperity within a thriving living world. (Random House Business Books, ?20).

"fter nine dreary years of downgrading their GDP forecasts, macroeconomic policymakers around the world are shaking their heads in disbelief: despite a populist-propelled wave of political tumult, global growth is actually set to outperform expectations in 2017.It＊s not just American exceptionalism. Although US growth is very strong,  has been outperforming expectations by more. There is even happy news for emerging markets, which are still bracing for US Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes but have gained a better backdrop against which to adjust.The broad story behind the global reflation is easy enough to understand. Deep, systemic financial crises lead to deep, prolonged recessions. As Carmen Reinhart and I  a decade ago (and as numerous other scholars have since corroborated using our ), periods of six to eight years of very slow growth are not at all unusual in such circumstances. True, many problems remain, including weak banks in Europe, over-leveraged local governments in China and needlessly complicated financial regulation in the United States. Nonetheless, the seeds of a sustained period of more solid growth have been planted.But will the populist tide surging across the advanced economies drown the accelerating recovery? Or will the recovery stifle leaders who confidently espouse seductively simple solutions to genuinely complex problems?With the International Monetary Fund/World Bank meetings coming up later this month in Washington, DC, leading central bankers and finance ministers will have ringside seats at Ground Zero. Who can doubt that US president  will make a Twitter punching bag out of any of them who dares criticise his administration＊s planned retreat from open trade and leadership in multilateral financial institutions?Before then, Trump will host Chinese president Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, his ※winter White House§. It is hard to overstate how much rides on the Sino-US relationship, and how damaging it would be if the two sides cannot find a way to work together constructively. The Trump administration believes that it has the bargaining tools to recalibrate the relationship to America＊s advantage, including a tariff on Chinese imports or even selectively defaulting on the more than $1tn the US owes to . But a tariff would eventually be overturned by the World Trade Organisation, and a default on US debt would be even more reckless.If Trump can persuade China to open up its economy more to US exports, and to help reign in North Korea, he will have achieved something. But if his plan is for the US to retreat unilaterally from global grade, the outcome is likely to hurt many US workers for the benefit of a few.The threat to globalism seems to have waned in Europe, with populist candidates having lost elections in Austria, the Netherlands, and now Germany. But a populist turn in upcoming elections in either  or Italy could still tear apart the European Union, causing massive collateral damage to the rest of the world.French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen wants to kill off the EU because, , ※the people of Europe do not want it any more§. And while opinion polls have the pro-EU Emmanuel Macron beating Le Pen decisively in the election＊s second-round runoff on 7 May, it is hard to be confident in the outcome of a two-person race, especially given Russian president Vladimir Putin＊s support for Le Pen. Given the unpredictability of an angry electorate, and Russia＊s proven capacity to manipulate news and social media, it would be folly to think that Macron is a lock.Italy＊s election is not for another year, but the situation is even worse. There, populist candidate  is leading polls and is expected to pull in about a third of the popular vote. Like Le Pen, Grillo wants to pull the plug on the euro. And, while it is hard to imagine a more chaotic event for the global economy, it is also hard to know the way forward for Italy, where per capita income has actually fallen slightly during the euro era. With flat population growth and swelling debt (more than 140% of GDP), Italy＊s economic prospects appear bleak. Though most economists still think exiting the euro would be profoundly self-destructive, a growing number have come to believe that the euro will never work for Italy, and that the sooner it leaves the better.Many emerging-market countries are dealing with populists of their own, or in the case of Poland, Hungary, and Turkey, with populists who have already turned into autocrats. Fortunately, a patient Fed, a resilient (for now) China and a growing Europe and US will help most emerging economies.The outlook for global growth is improving, and, with sensible policies, the next several years could be quite a bit better than the last 每 certainly for advanced economies, and perhaps for most others as well. But populism remains a wildcard, and only if growth picks up fast enough is it likely to be kept out of play.? "															
" could damage the UK＊s efforts to tackle corruption and give multinationals leverage over the British government in bribery cases, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned.Business pressure to weaken bribery laws and an inability by the government to focus on non-Brexit issues are both risks associated with leaving the European Union, according to .While acknowledging the UK＊s ※solid progress§ in pursuing recent bribery investigations, the report warned that the proportion of cases relative to the country＊s importance in global finance was low.※Efforts must be sustained to improve detection of foreign bribery and achieve stronger enforcement of its anti-bribery legislation,§ it said.The report praises the UK＊s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for recent successes in pursuing major corruption cases, including  earlier this year.However, several civil society groups told the report＊s authors they were concerned that ※Brexit could increase the risk of UK companies threatening to relocate and potential loss of UK jobs as a bargaining chip in negotiations with prosecutors over charges§.※Given that the SFO has on its books some very large UK companies that are significant partners in the government＊s industrial strategy, this is a real concern for several NGOs in the UK,§ the report said.※This concern was echoed by the business community which highlighted the risk of losing impetus in the fight against foreign bribery.§Duncan Hames, director of policy for Transparency International UK, said the  report ※reinforces how important it is to maintain the independence and prosecution of serious bribery offences§.He added: ※Those kind of considerations and threats shouldn＊t have any influence whatever in prosecuting wrongdoing wherever we find it.§The report also warns that any potential economic downturn resulting from leaving the EU could damage government willingness to be seen to be aggressively regulating business.※A tightening of the economy could result in significant strain on public resources, including for law enforcement, and in pressure to weaken the Bribery Act or its enforcement to attract business,§ it said.Sue Hawley, policy director of the civil society group Corruption Watch, said her organisation had warned of this risk last year, but recent events, including the creation of , had already damaged the UK＊s stance as a country hostile to corrupt money.Hawley cited  as an example of the kind of political interference about which the OECD would be concerned.Despite condemnation by the OECD after the BAE debacle, UK guidelines to law enforcement still do not prohibit factoring economic or political considerations into any prosecution decision.Separately, the OECD report also identifies Scotland, where highly secretive ※limited partnerships§ can be incorporated, as notably vulnerable to money laundering. ※The controversial limited partnership status, or so-called ＆shell＊ companies, in Scotland appears to be vulnerable for misuse in money-laundering and corruption schemes,§ the report said.※This has prompted Scottish politicians to suggest that the murky nature of such arrangements is undermining Scotland＊s reputation as a place to do legitimate business.§In a statement a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ※The government welcomes this report by the OECD which recognises our active enforcement of anti-bribery laws and we are proud that the UK continues to be commended as a global leader in the fight against bribery.※We will consider the recommendations made by the OECD as we continue to make the UK a more hostile environment for all forms of economic crime, including bribery, money laundering and fraud.§"															
" from a two-month losing streak when spending in high street stores and online bounced back in February. volumes were up by 1.4% on January and 3.7% higher than in February 2016.Sterling rose on the currency markets after news of the rise was announced, but the ONS said the bounce back had failed to recoup all the ground lost in December and January. It noted that spending was being curtailed by higher petrol prices.In the three months to February 每 considered a better guide to the underlying trend than the monthly figure alone 每 sales were 1.4% lower than in the quarter ending in November.The ONS said the quarterly fall matched that seen in January, which represented the weakest retail performance since March 2010, when the economy was just emerging from recession.Prices of goods were 2.8% higher in February than a year earlier, the sharpest increase since March 2012, with the cost of petrol up by more than 18%.Kate Davies, the ONS＊s senior statistician, said: ※February＊s retail sales figures show fairly strong growth, though the underlying three-month picture shows falling sales as February＊s figures follow two consecutive months of decline in December and January.※The monthly growth in February is seen across all store types. The underlying trend suggests that rising petrol prices in particular have had a negative effect on the overall quantity of goods bought over the last three months.§A separate study of high street spending suggested that the recovery in spending during February might have continued in March.The monthly distributive trades survey from the CBI showed that retailers had enjoyed better than expected trading conditions and were optimistic about a further improvement in April. Of the 65 retailers surveyed, 44% said business volumes were higher than a year earlier against 35% reporting a fall.Anna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the employers＊ organisation, said retailers continued to be squeezed by rising cost pressures and intense competition, limiting their ability to raise prices. ※With household spending growth set to slow as inflation rises, retailers seem likely to remain under pressure through this year,§ he said.Ben Broadbent, one of the Bank of England＊s deputy governors, said in a  in London that the fall in the value of the pound was having an impact on spending in the shops.※The  led to a big drop in sterling＊s exchange rate,§ he said. ※One consequence is a rise in import prices and a squeeze on households＊ real income. We may already be seeing the impact of that squeeze on retail spending, which in real terms fell quite sharply around the turn of the year.§Broadbent added that the flipside of weaker retail spending was that UK goods sold overseas had become cheaper. ※While it＊s hit the income of households, however, the depreciation has come as a boon for many exporters. In sterling terms goods export prices rose 12% through the course of last year. This will significantly have boosted exporters＊ profitability and with it the incentive to invest in extra capacity.§A combination of a more competitive pound and no change for the time being in trading rules with the EU meant exporters were currently in a sweet spot, Broadbent added, although he said it was unclear how long this period would last.Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit said: ※The consumer, which has provided the main engine of UK economic growth in recent years, is showing signs of running out of steam. Looking at the underlying trend, retail sales are falling at the fastest rate for seven years as households struggle with rising prices and subdued pay growth.§"															
"t＊s not the beginning of the end (of Brexit) 每 but it＊s definitely the end of the beginning. Despite the fixation in the UK on the precise date and legal niceties of the article 50 process, the most important event of the weeks to come will not be the notification itself but the EU response to it, and the political and economic dynamics that sets into motion.If things go according to plan, we＊re headed for the usual EU negotiating scenario: long interludes of tedium and small print interspersed with episodes of late-night brinkmanship ending eventually in a compromise no one likes, but which everyone will describe as a victory.But if politics 每 either here or on the continent 每 derails the process, we could soon find that far from ※taking back control§, we have done precisely the opposite.Ministers have put a brave face on that possibility. When  set out her negotiating position in January, she said clearly that, if necessary, the UK would just walk away (※no deal is better than a bad deal§) while Boris Johnson claims that the UK would be ※perfectly OK§.Would we? At a minimum, this would mean uncertainty for business, for EU citizens resident here and UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU, not to mention the possibility of extended litigation about money and other issues. Other possibilities would be disruption at borders, for both travellers and businesses, as we and the rest of the EU reintroduce long-abandoned controls.But assuming we got over the immediate disruption, the most important direct consequence of leaving without a deal would be that trade with the EU would revert to 每 that is, the standard World Trade Organisation arrangements that countries without preferential trading arrangements use.For some ministers, this doesn＊t seem to be a problem. After all,  每 and our exports to the US are worth . So maybe doing the same with the EU ※§.And it＊s true that the WTO does provide a safety net. WTO rules mean the EU couldn＊t impose punitive tariffs on us out of spite 每 it would have to treat our exporters in broadly the same manner as those from the US. That, in turn, means average tariffs on our exports to the EU would be fairly low, perhaps only 4-5%.Even that conceals the fact that some sectors would be hit much harder 每 EU tariffs for agricultural products average 30-40%. Well over half of our trade in food is with the rest of the EU, so we＊d face a choice. We could stick with EU tariff levels to prop up our own farmers, in which case UK consumers would face higher prices and less choice. Or we could unilaterally lower or abolish tariffs 每 which would be good for consumers but would mean a wrenching and painful restructuring for UK farmers.But headline tariff rates are not the most important issue by any means. Take the car industry. Tariffs of 10% on cars would be bad enough. But much worse than that would be the . Parts used in Nissan＊s Sunderland plant, for example, come from all over the EU. And, equally, UK suppliers export components to Renault and Fiat.It is difficult to see how all this could survive the imposition of tariffs, not just on finished cars but on parts every time they cross a border 每 not to mention the extra costs and, more importantly, time spent if we introduce new customs controls.But perhaps the most fundamental issue is regulatory arrangements after Brexit. Take, for example, pharmaceuticals, one of our most important export sectors. To sell a drug in the EU, companies need to get it approved by the European regulator, the , which is in London. After Brexit, it will move to another member state (not surprisingly, a number of cities are already vying for it).So what happens next? Our drug companies will still need EMA approval if they want to market their products in the rest of . Will we set up our own regulator 每 which will take time and money, and even then manufacturers will not necessarily see getting UK approval as a priority, given that the UK market is much smaller than that of the EU or US? Or will we simply find a way of rubber-stamping approvals by an agency in which we no longer have any role? In other sectors, such as aviation or chemicals, the issues are even more complicated 每 legally, technically and, perhaps, politically.Fundamentally, the point is this. Yes, we trade successfully with the US and many other countries under WTO rules. But, when it comes to those countries, we haven＊t spent the last 40 years slowly and painfully integrating not just our trade but the fundamental infrastructure of our economic, legal, regulatory and bureaucratic processes. In economic terms, we are friends with the US, but we＊re not married to it. Divorces are always painful 每 but just walking away isn＊t going to lead to a happy outcome."															
"n Liverpool, : boarded-up libraries, closed-down day centres and shut nurseries. But, as in countless cities and towns across the UK, the bleakest of its marks are hidden behind closed doors: the young mum skipping meals to pay the rent because of the benefit cap, or the cancer patient kept awake by fear he＊ll be found ※fit for work§.What＊s unusual about Liverpool is not the scale of the crisis (though as of last year the city was the country＊s ) but the light the place is shining on it. This month Liverpool became the first city to add up the impact of austerity on its residents. This isn＊t cold economics or futile sums; it＊s a devastating, painstaking examination of what more than 20 policies have done to a whole city＊s families. And with it, as Liverpool reels from having 58% of its central government funding cut, a snapshot of how Whitehall is now pushing local councils to breaking point. As Liverpool＊s mayor, Joe Anderson, warned two years ago: ※.§Read through the exhaustive list of post-2010 cuts the council＊s study charts 每 from housing benefit to universal credit to benefit freezes 每 and it＊s hard not to feel we＊re witnessing the . For every four homes in Liverpool, one has been squeezed by cuts. That＊s 55,000 households 每 and it＊s children, women and chronically sick and disabled people who are squeezed hardest.These aren＊t cuts that come alone, either 每 a few quid that can be found by going without an extra pint at the weekend 每 but multiple changes at once. When, say, next month＊s , the odds are it will be hitting people already falling short on rent because they＊ve lost their council tax support. In politics, they call it ※cumulative impact§. In human terms, it＊s the equivalent of being struck over and over again.Carol Stevenson is not her real name but 每 as is case with all the lives documented by Liverpool＊s study 每 what＊s happened to the 63-year-old over the past few years is disturbingly real.Carol, living in one of the housing association three-beds in the city, is so severely disabled that she needs a 24/7 live-in carer. But the bedroom tax means she＊s had her housing benefit cut (she＊s exempt for the room her carer sleeps in but she＊s still penalised for the other one). At the same time, because of  to the council tax support scheme, she had to find money for some of her council tax. Then, as the government rolled out its tougher new benefit, personal independence payment, she had her disability benefit slashed too. In total, it means she＊s lost over ?40 each week. That＊s around ?2,100 every year.See Carol struggling to keep her head above water and you soon understand what years of Tory rhetoric 每 from ※we＊re all in it together§ to concern for those ※just about managing§ 每 really means. Two years ago, it emerged people living in Liverpool District B, the most deprived area in the country, were losing ?807 per household due to government cuts, while the wealthiest local authority, Hart district council in Hampshire, . Now, look at the breakdown of what＊s happening in Liverpool and just as the most deprived areas of the country are taking the , it＊s the families in the poorest wards of the city being hit hardest by policies like the bedroom tax. Austerity is not an equal opportunity sport: while the comfortable and healthy are protected, the poor and ill are devastated.The only reason Carol has got a roof over her head still is because the council started giving her a grant, a discretionary housing payment to make up her shortfall in rent. Forget the human cost for a moment, and that＊s the definition of counterproductive: central government brings in the bedroom tax and the benefit cap, and removes council tax support for low-income families 每 and a gutted local council like  has to pay over ?3.5m of its own funds to stop its residents being turned out on the street.The council has had to find another ?3m to provide hardship grants for families who no longer have enough to survive on: the basics of food, gas, a bed, or an oven. That＊s perhaps the nastiest aspect of Conservative cuts in recent years. As the government brought in policies that pushed people into crisis, it simultaneously pulled the emergency funds 每 like crisis loans and community care grants 每 that could help them.※In the coming year we＊re setting aside an additional ?2m on top of the ?7m we already spend,§ explains Anderson of the council＊s hardship schemes. ※But [it will] only go a relatively short way to offsetting the impact of austerity. We＊re fighting against a strong incoming tide.§By 2020, as  and , Liverpool council has to find another ?90m. In this decade of cuts, the lurking fear is just how easy it is to drown."															
"et＊s be fair to President Trump: the ※worst falls§ in . The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which passed the 20,000 mark only in January, was approaching 21,000 before Tuesday＊s decline that continued into Wednesday. The previous pace couldn＊t have been sustained for ever. Stock markets rarely run in straight lines, especially when the US Federal Reserve has raised rates twice in three months.It＊s a similar story in the UK. Just as the Dow remains above 20,000, so the FTSE 100 index closed on Wednesday 300 points above the 7,000 mark, which it last passed around Christmas time. The Trump bump to share prices has merely received a dent, which was to be expected.It would be also be fair to say the mood is nervous. If the president is running into political trouble in his attempt to repeal Obamacare, will there also be delays to his promised infrastructure splurge, the factor that has driven share prices higher? It＊s a fair question, and the answer will be critical for stock markets in the short-term.Yet the most interesting market movement is happening not in share prices but in oil. The price of a barrel of Brent dipped below $50 on Wednesday, down 11% since the start of the month. That wasn＊t part of the script when  and a few non-Opec countries, including Russia, agreed a deal to curb production at the end of last year.In the event, oil stocks remain high and US production is strong, presenting Opec with a serious headache. If it wants to force the oil price higher, its production cuts may have to be deeper for longer. It＊s not obvious that all its members 每 and especially the non-members 每 have the political will or financial flexibility.A lower oil price this year would be excellent news, not least for Downing Street and the Bank of England. It would dampen the currency-inspired inflation in other parts of the economy. If cheaper oil is accompanied by a minor stock market wobble, that＊s not so bad.Pumping huge quantities of untreated sewage into the River Thames is as bad as it gets if, like Thames Water, two of your aims are to ※prevent pollution§ and ※protect and, where possible, improve wildlife and conserve our cultural heritage§. Visible sewage was seen along nine miles of the river in 2012 and 2013, killing birds and fish.The sentencing remarks in a case brought by the Environment Agency (EA) were suitably damning. ※This is a shocking and disgraceful state of affairs,§ . The EA said it was the biggest freshwater pollution case it had mounted and ※a pattern of unprecedented pollution incidents§ could have been avoided if Thames had been open and frank in its dealings with the agency.Hit the owners where it hurts, then? That was the judge＊s aim. ※One has to get the message across to the shareholders that the environment is to be treasured and protected, and not poisoned,§ he said. But if he thinks a ?20.3m penalty will impress Thames shareholders 每 a crew of infrastructure and sovereign wealth funds who have done splendidly over their decade of ownership 每 he needs to raise his sights.Thames Water Utilities, the debt-laden operating company that sits under various holding companies, . Consider that a sum of ?20m equates to a single week＊s investment by Thames.Thames Water＊s chief executive, Steve Robertson ,cited the investment figure to show the company understands ※our huge responsibilities to the environment§. It would be equally true to say that, in financial terms, a ?20m fine will be lost in the wash of raw sewage.※Looking forward, the EU referendum has created uncertainty for the UK economic outlook and we remain cautious on the outlook for France,§ says V谷ronique Laury, the chief executive of , which owns B&Q and Screwfix.Never mind Brexit and the French presidential elections. Think of the uncertainty caused to the poor staff and shareholders as they tried to decipher Laury＊s ※key learnings§ from her five-year plan. Here is the third learning: ※We have identified the need to approach the wider transformation as a series of sequential ＆change releases＊ to ensure appropriate cross visibility and prioritisation.§ What?Maybe she means Kingfisher is going to do one thing and then do another. If so, it＊s a plan to keep life simple. Why not say so?"															
"hares, oil and the US dollar were all under pressure as  at the prospect that would fail to deliver on his growth-boosting promises.In the most nervous conditions since the immediate , stock markets in Asia and Europe fell in response to Tuesday＊s sharp decline on Wall Street.The biggest fall in US shares in five months prompted declines in Tokyo, Frankfurt, Paris and London, which in turn ensured another jittery opening in New York. In the City, the FTSE 100 closed 54 points lower at 7,324.72.Markets have become increasingly impatient with the new  for failing to follow through on pledges to use a package of tax cuts and infrastructure spending to raise the US growth rate.Share prices have risen steadily since Trump defeated in last November＊s race for the White House amid optimism that the US could be on the point of breaking out of the low-growth path evident since the world＊s biggest economy emerged from recession almost eight years ago.But sentiment has turned this week after it became clear that there is likely to be a protracted delay before the Trump administration can get tax cuts through Congress. Investors believe a failure to secure agreement on Capitol Hill to 每 the new administration＊s first legislative test 每 will lead to a further sell-off on Wall Street.On the foreign exchanges, money flowed out of the dollar and into the safe haven of the Japanese yen. Sterling rose to stand at just under $1.25 against the US currency.News of an increase in US oil stocks led to a fresh drop in the cost of crude, already under downward pressure on concerns that an Opec deal to curb production has started to unravel. A barrel of Brent crude was changing hands at less than $50 a barrel and is down 11% since the start of March.Jasper Lawler, a senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: ※It＊s overly simplistic to lay the blame for the market decline at Donald Trump＊s door. The first US rate hike this year, a slump in oil prices, the future of quantitative easing under higher inflation and end of quarter portfolio manoeuvring have played a part in markets changing course. Still, the Trump presidency, which has played such a large role in the rise in markets since November, is not to be ignored as a factor.§ Lawler added that what had been seen as the two biggest contributors to the idea that the world was reflating 每 a Trump-led fiscal boost and rising oil prices 每 had come unstuck in the past fortnight. The ※repeal and replace§ of Obamacare was being seen as an acid test of whether Trump could deliver on his fiscal plans and the difficulties encountered were a ※bad omen§ for tax reform."															
"The US central bank is poised to raise interest rates for only the third time since the financial crash of 2008. With its headquarters just round the corner from the White House, the Federal Reserve and its chair, , are in Donald Trump＊s sights. On the campaign trail Trump said Yellen should be ※ashamed§ of the Fed＊s low interest rate policy, and accused the bank of . Trump has called for higher rates, but Yellen can not take a positive presidential reaction for granted. The reaction of markets across the world is even less predictable. So what is the likely impact on the US and the global economy?The  last year and is expected to follow with a further rate rise on Wednesday. Some analysts expect a quarter-point rise, though most of the betting is now on a half point, pushing the base rate to a range of 1% to 1.25%.The  has grown for the last 30 quarters and shows no sign of slackening off. Consumer spending is robust and the latest jobs numbers showed employment increasing and unemployment staying low.Fathom Consulting, an economic forecaster, said spare capacity in the labour market was disappearing fast and it would not be long before wages started to rise rapidly. Wage rises push up demand, and that triggers higher prices. The Fed has a remit to control inflation, but also to mintain high levels of employment. By raising rates, it will appear to do both.The Fed is betting businesses will shrug off the extra cost of borrowing, continue to invest in the US economy and create jobs. Setting aside concerns about Brexit and a string of potentially destabilising elections on the continent, Fed policymakers have judged that the strength of the economy is enough to override a series of rate rises, . Consumers have embraced the Trump rhetoric of tax cuts and deregulation to continue spending, undeterred by the prospect of higher mortgage costs.Central banks like to signal their intentions, albeit in opaque language, to prevent investors being spooked. This rise was heavily trailed in recent weeks and has been priced in as a certainty by market participants in New York, London and Tokyo 每 though some would be surprised by a half-point rise. Turbulence could come from the foreign exchange markets if the dollar rises following a slump in the Turkish lira, Indonesian rupiah, Mexican peso or other developing world currency. More importantly, the bond markets could overreact.Much of the world borrows money in dollars or seeks to lend to the US government and US corporations in dollars. A rise in interest rates would encourage an influx of funds into the US, pushing up the dollar relative to other countries. A rise in the Fed funds rate would also increase the cost of borrowing.When the Fed first hinted in 2013 that it planned to stop pumping funds into the financial system, the prospect of higher borrowing costs for those holding dollar debts spooked the bond markets. Turkey and Russia were highlighted as countries with corporate sectors that expanded quickly based on heavy borrowing using dollar-denominated bonds. It was clear that much of Turkey＊s corporate sector could go bust if its interest bill jumped too far or fast.Such was the strength of the reaction, , who at the time chaired the Federal Reserve, abandoned his plan. A similar reaction preceded a rate rise in December 2015, and while markets regained their composure, the extra costs imposed on Turkey and Russia hit their economies hard and arguably shored up the position of their authoritarian leaders., even when Beijing was doing all it could to close the gap between the yen and the dollar. Now China is letting the yen fall and with interest rate rises in the US pushing up the dollar, the gap will widen, increasing the cost of US exports and reducing import prices. Trump can only complain about the currency, but he could make good on threats to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking a trade war.Annual US GDP growth since the 2008 crash has averaged 2.1%. This might seem like a healthy rate, but it is the slowest recovery from recession since the second world war. Business investment remains low and productivity in the US, as elsewhere in the developed world, is growing sluggishly. To boost borrowing and demand, the Fed needs to keep credit cheap.But Trump plans to make up for the tightening of monetary policy by cutting taxes and running up a huge budget deficit. , unleashing a surge in economic activity.Bloomberg said investors expect three more rises before the end of the year. Fathom Consulting said there was enough momentum in the economy for rate increases of 25  seven times between now and the end of next year."															
"There are at least 2,000 food banks operating in the UK, giving out emergency food parcels on a weekly basis to people in hardship, according to research that shines fresh light on the rapid growth of charity food provision in austerity Britain.The research complements established information on UK food bank use compiled by the Trussell Trust, Britain＊s biggest food bank network, which collects extensive data from its members and that it gave out a record 1.2m food parcels to families and individuals in need in 2016-17, the ninth successive year in which demand had risen.Emerging results from the mapping project undertaken by the  (Ifan), confirm that the Trussell figures represent only a partial picture of the scale of organised food bank provision, and suggest that the level of food bank use is far greater than headline figures indicate.Ifan＊s findings, seen by the Guardian, suggest that there are at least 651 grassroots food banks operating independently of the Trussell network, ranging from tiny voluntary groups that give out a few food parcels each week, to larger charity operations that hand out thousands of parcels to hundreds of clients each year.Prof Jon May, of Queen Mary University of London and chair of Ifan, said the figures emphasised the rapid rise in the number of food banks over the past five years, and the changing geography of poverty. ※There are now food banks in almost every community, from the East End of London to the Cotswolds. The spread of food banks maps growing problems of poverty across the UK, but also the growing drive among many thousands of people across the country to try and do something about those problems§.Frank Field, the Labour MP, a veteran poverty campaigner and chair of the Feeding Britain charity, welcomed the figures, and called on the next government to do more to understand the scale of hunger and food insecurity. ※These figures show the tide of hunger sweeping the UK. It＊s another piece in the jigsaw puzzle of destitution in this country.§The study counts the 1,373 distribution centres that operate out of Trussell trust＊s 419 food banks in its figures alongside the 651 ※independents§ to make a total of 2,024 food banks. It defines a food bank as an organisation that gives out food parcels on a weekly basis. It does not include informal food parcel distribution by social welfare charities, children＊s centres, churches, housing associations,  and other groups.Although the project maps the extent of food bank provision, it does not collect data on the volume of food aid provided by independent food banks, as unlike Trussell trust members, many do not record how much food they give out. However, some independent food banks contacted by the Guardian in areas where Trussell trust has no or little presence reported that they gave out substantial amounts of food aid. In Aberdeen, for example, two of the biggest food banks in the city,  and , gave out 15,000 food parcels between them in 2016-17. Sabine Goodwin, Ifan＊s researcher, who spoke to more than 50 food bank workers during the project, said most had reported rising demand for food aid. ※Many feel they are firefighting, finding a way to deal with the logistics of feeding more and more people, with no time to advocate for changes that would eradicate the need for food banks in the first place.§Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition at King＊s College London and an expert in food insecurity, said: ※Recent national survey data suggests that 8% of adults experienced not having enough money for food over 2016 每 this figure is likely to be many times more than the number helped by food banks. We need ongoing national survey monitoring to understand the scale of food insecurity, who is at risk, and the implications for child and adult health and wellbeing.§The Ifan survey reveals a wide variety of food-bank operating models: some faith-based, others non-religious; some with strict rules on the amount of food given to individual clients, others with open-ended commitments to families in need; some requiring clients to have a voucher validated by outside agencies, others operating a self-referral system. Successive governments have played down the rise of food banks,  that financial pressures on families caused by welfare cuts, benefit delays and low income helped drive increased demand for emergency food. Recently, the prime minister, Theresa May, attempted to brush off claims that nurses had been forced to use food banks by saying there were  why people use them.Ifan said the next stage of its research would be to map other forms of charity food aid in the UK such as school holiday hunger projects, drop-in meal centres, social supermarkets, , and soup kitchens.

"The Bank of England＊s rate-setting team could be reduced to seven members for the first time in nearly 11 years as election ※purdah§ rules will delay appointments until at least next month.The Bank＊s monetary policy committee (MPC) has eight members from the usual nine after deputy governor Charlotte Hogg was forced to resign in March.External MPC member Kristin Forbes is also due to step down in June, while chief economist Andrew Haldane＊s term ends next week.The Treasury has put recruiting on hold as it is unable to make appointments during so-called purdah rules on government announcements during the election period.While it is expected that Haldane will continue in his post until his re-appointment can be confirmed, the delay to replacements for Hogg and Forbes could result in the fewest number of individuals voting on rates since 2006.The MPC has not been down to seven members since July and August 2006 after the unexpected loss of David Walton, who voted in June 2006 and died later that month. It＊s next meeting to discuss rates and release quarterly inflation report is on 3 August.Hogg quit two weeks after she took up MPC role after a scathing report by MPs on the Treasury select committee found her ※professional competence falls short§ of the standards required for the role.Her omission about her brother＊s role meant she fell foul of the code of conduct rules she helped to draw up at the Bank.Hogg acted as deputy governor on top of her role as chief operating officer, but the role will now be split.Economists will watch closely for news of the replacement for Forbes, who has been the sole ※hawk§ voting for a rate rise for the past two decisions.Forbes has called for a rise from 0.25% to 0.5% amid fears over surging inflation, but a recent slowdown in growth is unlikely to convince fellow MPC members.Experts believe rates will remain on hold until 2019, with the latest official estimate showing growth was even slower than first thought at the start of 2017, at 0.2%.Investec economist Philip Shaw said while the departure of Forbes will leave the MPC without a hawk, it is unlikely to change the outlook for rates.He said: ※To our minds, the direction of the economy is pretty clear at the moment.※I＊m not sure whether the decision-making process will be sensitive to specifics of one or two new members.§"															
"It will take an extra ?15bn of spending cuts or tax rises to eliminate the budget deficit by the time of the 2022 election, a leading thinktank has said as it laid bare the damaging legacy of the financial crisison UK living standards and public finances. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that despite ※two parliaments of pain§, the Conservative-led austerity drive had made little difference to public spending when measured as a share of national income and compared with pre-downturn levels. Publishing its  as political parties prepare to set out their manifestos for the snap election on 8 June, the IFS said the deficit had fallen considerably since its peak in 2009每10. But the gap between public spending and income was still one of the biggest among advanced economies, it added. The thinktank found that while tax revenues had improved and were forecast to continue growing, there had also been a rise in public spending against the backdrop of a long and sluggish economic recovery.※The deficit is now roughly back to the level it was prior to the financial crisis, although is still above its long-run average. On the tax side, the impact on the public finances of substantial tax cuts has been more than outweighed by tax raising measures,§ said Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS and author of the report.※On the spending side, seven years of austerity has seen significant cuts to areas such as working-age benefits and public order and safety. But despite this, overall public spending remains slightly above its pre-crisis share of the economy. ※This is due to persistently poor economic growth and an increase in the share of national income devoted to health, pensioner benefits and overseas aid.§The financial crisis that began with a credit crunch in 2007 and escalated to the bailout of banks and a recession had led to a sharp reduction in national income for the UK, Emmerson＊s analysis showed. ※Even more striking is the weakness of the subsequent recovery,§ he said, noting GDP per adult only returned to its pre-crisis level around the end of 2015.Alluding to more than a decade of lost growth, Emmerson found that by 2022 GDP per adult would be 18% lower than it would have been had the economy grown by 2% a year since 2008 每 broadly the expected rate of growth at that time. ※This downgrade in expected income has adversely affected the finances of households and of the government,§ said Emmerson.His analysis found that in addition to plans already set out, the next government would have to find more savings and more revenues if it wanted to eliminate the deficit before a May 2022 general election. The Conservatives have repeatedly vowed to cut the deficit, which is the gap between what the government receives in tax and other revenues and what it spends on public services, benefits and other areas. In a small boost for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, figures for the last tax year showed the deficit had shrunk by 28% on the previous year to But some economists have questioned the merits of focusing on eliminating the deficit, arguing that an austerity drive since the crisis has been counter-productive because it dented already lacklustre growth, raised welfare costs and squeezed incomes.※There is nothing special in eradicating the deficit 每 it is a completely arbitrary goal,§ said Simon Wren-Lewis, economics professor at Oxford University.He added that how quickly a government chooses to cut the deficit and bring down the stock of national debt was a political choice.※The only clear message from economics is that adjustment in the debt to GDP ratio should be fairly slow to avoid sharp decreases in spending or large increases in taxes,§ Wren-Lewis said.The IFS said the UK still had the fifth largest deficit out of 35 advanced economies in 2016 as a share of GDP, behind Spain, the US, Japan and France. The UK＊s national debt was the sixth highest.※The latest forecasts suggest the deficit will fall over the next five years. But even had the next parliament run from May 2020 to May 2025 eliminating the deficit would have been far from straightforward§ said Emmerson.※Eliminating the deficit before a May 2022 general election would be even harder: a combination of tax rises and spending cuts worth ?15bn on top of current plans.§"															
"Britain＊s factories enjoyed their fastest growth for three years last month on the back of strong demand at home and abroad, according to a survey that will temper worries about a Brexit-driven economic slowdown this year.The manufacturing sector, which makes up about a tenth of the UK economy, enjoyed the strongest pick-up in new work since the start of 2014 and smashed expectations in April. Firms also took on new workers at a faster pace and ramped up production, the closely watched  (pdf) showed. Its main barometer of business activity jumped to 57.3 in April from 54.2 in March. That confounded forecasts for a modest slowdown to 54.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. A reading above 50 shows growth while one below indicates it is contracting. The measure for manufacturing only briefly fell below that no-change mark in the wake of last June＊s vote to leave the EU but then recovered along with readings for the construction industry and the much larger services sector.The latest manufacturing report signalled that strong demand came from the domestic market as well as overseas, continuing a pattern of export support for UK firms from the weaker pound. Sterling＊s sharp fall since the  vote has made UK goods cheaper in foreign markets. But it has also raised the cost of imports.The survey of more than 600 industrial companies follows official figures last week showing  as the effect of higher import costs worked its way through the economy,  and squeezing consumer spending.But while , manufacturers have reported a boost from the weaker pound and from a recovery in the global economy. PMI surveys published earlier on Tuesday showed .The PMI report＊s compilers said strength and demand from North America, Europe, Africa and Brazil were helping UK factories. But they cautioned against reading too much into April＊s bounce.※Although only accounting for 10% of the economy, the upturn in the manufacturing sector represents some welcome good news after the sharp slowing in GDP seen in the first quarter,§ said Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit.※The big question is whether this growth spurt can be maintained, especially given the backdrop of ongoing market volatility and a number of political headwinds such as elections at home and abroad. Other surges seen since the middle of last year have generally proved short-lived, as weak wage growth sapped consumer spending.§The report also raised concerns about manufacturers facing shortages of raw materials. That was adding to cost pressures and companies mentioned paying higher prices for a wide range of materials, including chemicals, metals and plastics. But input cost inflation had eased significantly since hitting a record high in January, Dobson noted.Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays highlighted the mixed effects of the weak pound on manufacturers.※Despite some easing, inflationary pressures will continue to take their toll on factory gate prices and ultimately manufacturers＊ margins, however, the weakness in sterling and an improving global outlook continue to provide export opportunities for the sector,§ he said.※What we don＊t want to see now is the prospect of fractious Brexit negotiations fostering a more cautious and uncertain approach to investment from the sector.§ Economists are looking ahead to PMI reports from the construction sector on Wednesday and the services sector on Thursday for more clues on how the economy fared last month. Some doubt how far a manufacturing improvement can make up for weaker consumer spending. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to forecasters the EY ITEM Club, said: ※With ＆the makers＊ accounting for little more than 10% of GDP, it will require a strong performance from the sector to compensate for headwinds from inflation and other sources affecting the dominant services sector.§But Ruth Gregory, UK economist at the consultancy Capital , said: ※After last week＊s surprisingly downbeat first quarter GDP figures ... today＊s survey provides us with optimism that the manufacturing sector should play a bigger role in offsetting the slowdown in the consumer services sector ahead.§"															
"Easier access to mortgages with a small deposit has offered some glimmers of hope for first-time buyers struggling to get on to Britain＊s housing ladder, according to a new report.Research on the amount of time it takes to save for a down payment on a home suggests buyers have been helped by the greater availability of mortgage loans at higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios.The estate agent Hamptons International said that in the final months of 2016 it would take an average single first-time buyer 11 years and nine months to save a 15% deposit. But reducing the deposit to 10% cut the saving time to eight years and three months. For a deposit of just 5% the time to save was four years.Hamptons highlighted Bank of England figures that suggest such deals with smaller deposits have become more widespread in recent years. The proportion of loans made at a 90% or more LTV ratio was 5% in 2016, up from 3.8% in 2015.Hamptons said that increasing availability of lending at higher LTV, combined with lower mortgage rates, had improved the ability to buy for first-time buyers. That cautious optimism over affordability chimes with other commentators on the housing market who have highlighted  as good news for first-time buyers.However, the estate agency cautioned that the fact house prices grew faster than incomes last year meant anyone going for a mortgage with a 15% deposit would have found it harder, not easier, to save for their down payment. The average length of time for a single first-time buyer to save a 15% deposit in the fourth quarter of 2016 was a whole year longer than in the fourth quarter of 2015.※It still takes an average single buyer nearly 12 years to save a 15% deposit for their first home. That＊s a whole year longer than at the end of 2015. But it＊s not all bad news,§ said Fionnuala Earley, residential research director at Hamptons.※Lenders are increasingly offering higher loan-to-value mortgages and the rates charged on them have come down more than for any other mortgage type.§A separate report from chartered surveyor e.surv found that buyers who put down a small deposit were making up an increasing share of the market. Richard Sexton, a director at e.surv, said: ※This is a trend which started at the end of last year and has continued into 2017. Likely buoyed by the number of government schemes and low mortgage rates across the board, small-deposit buyers are growing in strength in today＊s mortgage market.※A more first-time buyer oriented market is good news for all as new buyers help start chains and allow others to move up the housing ladder 每 vital for a properly functioning property market.§ "															
"Companies in Britain＊s growing gig economy are forcing workers into bogus self-employment and free-riding on the welfare state, an influential committee of MPs has said.In a damning assessment of modern employment practices, the parliamentary work and pensions committee calls on the next government to bring laws up to date so that workers are better protected from exploitation. Given concerns about the rising number of workers classed as self-employed contractors with no access to sick benefit or holiday pay, it wants the default status for people in the gig economy to be ※worker§ rather than ※self-employed§.In an  now curtailed by Theresa May calling a snap election, the committee questioned companies including Uber, Amazon, Hermes and Deliveroo that use self-employed workers widely. It also heard from their drivers.An abridged report into the committee＊s findings on Monday accuses companies of propagating a myth about self-employment and rebuffs their claims to be providing flexibility for workers. The committee, led by the Labour MP , criticised such arguments as fiction. It also highlighted that forcing people into self-employment as couriers, taxi drivers and other roles, rather than taking them on as employees, was depriving the state of badly needed tax revenues and creating an extra burden on the welfare system.※Companies in the gig economy are free-riding on the welfare state, avoiding all their responsibilities to profit from this bogus ＆self-employed＊ designation while ordinary taxpayers pick up the tab,§ said Field.※This inquiry has convinced me of the need to offer ＆worker＊ status to the drivers who work with those companies as the default option. This status would be a much fairer reflection of the work they undertake which seems to fall between what most of us would think of as ＆self-employed＊ or ＆employed＊. It would also protect them from some of the appalling practices that have been reported to the committee in this inquiry.§The committee＊s report found self-employment could indeed be ※genuinely flexible and rewarding for many§, but that people on employment contracts were also able to work flexibly. ※Flexibility is not the preserve of poorly paid, unstable contractors,§ said the report, published ahead of Wednesday＊s dissolution of parliament.Field said: ※It is clearly profit and profit only that is the motive for designating workers as self-employed.§The report comes ahead of the government＊s Taylor review of modern working practices, which is  that self-employed gig economy workers should be granted greater protections and benefits.The MPs＊ report will pressure companies further to change staffing practices. It follows an  last year that found Uber drivers were wrongly classified as self-employed and should be classed as workers.Uber plans to challenge the ruling in the courts later this year, and in the meantime has sought to quell criticism of its practices. The San Francisco-based ride-hailing firm said last week that it would  in exchange for a ?2 per week fee. Field dismissed Uber＊s move, saying the plan was ※just another way of pushing costs onto the workforce§.Uber said: ※The vast majority of drivers who use  tell us they want to remain their own boss as that＊s the main reason why they signed up to us in the first place. But we know drivers want more security too, which is why we are investing in a heavily discounted illness and injury cover offer for drivers.§The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced plans to increase those contributions in his maiden budget in March, but was  following a backbench revolt.Monday＊s report also notes that self-employed people and employees receive almost equal access to the services funded by national insurance contributions ※yet the self-employed contribute far less§. ※The incoming government should set out a roadmap for equalising employee and self-employed national insurance contributions,§ it said."															
"t was a perfect May dawn, . The beauty of the sunrise, the comprehensive wipeout of the Conservatives after 18 years, four defeats and a long and tightly choreographed election campaign produced a sense of euphoria. However hard Tony Blair and the people around him tried to suppress triumphalism, however cool the new prime minister sounded as he announced that he had been elected as New Labour and he would govern as New Labour, it seemed as if everything had changed, for ever. The Guardian reflected this enthusiasm: this election, the editorial at the time decided, ※now joins 1945 and 1906 as the third great progressive electoral landslide of the 20th century§.Like 1945, 1997 was a landslide that had been nearly a generation in the making.  had survived an existential struggle between social democracy and the Bennite left. And it had survived defeats 每 none more?painful or damaging than Neil Kinnock＊s unanticipated failure in 1992. The monstering of the party leader by the press shaped a party of extreme caution and?obsessive media management.But New Labour did not win only because of a well-constructed and lavishly funded campaign. It won because its architects 每Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Peter Mandelson,  and  每 all paid?attention to voters＊ concerns and aspirations and shaped party policy to reflect?and engage with them.And they did change Britain. Literally, by devolving power to Scotland, Wales and London and bringing peace to Northern Ireland. Emotionally, by legitimising a sense of patriotism while engaging with Europe and reinventing international development. They extended gay rights and restored public services, reforming and investing in hospitals and schools, prioritising the fight against poverty and introducing the minimum wage.But it is also true that the 13 years of New Labour did not transform the country as Attlee＊s 1945 government had done. They left none of the radical and lasting institutional change. They did more to affirm than to challenge the Thatcherite idea of the smaller state, and they never did enough to challenge the supremacy of market forces. They inherited and exploited an exceptional period of economic growth, but also the rise of a new threat: global terrorism that led to the catastrophic misjudgment of the war in  that overshadows the Blair years.The 1997 victory was, as the Guardian described it at the time, a ※vast public repudiation§ of the previous Conservative government. But success can also blind the successful. New Labour should have paid closer attention to regulating the City. Its failure to do so contributed to the banking crisis, which in turn destroyed Mr Brown＊s prime ministership. New Labour was relaxed about the complex mechanisms used in the financial world . They were not, and?nobody was checking.Likewise it is easy to see now that immigration was a crisis acquired in a fit of absence of mind. The distributional effects of?the policy, which has had a history of cultural convulsions, appeared ignored in favour of economic ones.  with profound consequences, as the?Brexit?vote showed.The longer a party is in power, the harder it becomes to stay engaged with its activists. They are almost always disappointed by how little of what they care about gets enacted, and often offended by the lack of attention that their efforts attract from the top. No Labour governments, not even Attlee＊s, have?ever been anythng but a disappointment to the people who campaigned most passionately for their election. What continues to infuriate many party members today is that New Labour felt like ※politics as usual§ rather than a radical force: that it changed the party rather than the country. There is something in this: Mr Blair converted Labour?to economic liberalism just as David Cameron converted the Tories to social liberalism. But after the economic crash, the accusation that New Labour would not stand up to powerful moneyed interests, mainly for fear of being considered anti-business, toxified the brand. Nor has Mr Blair been the best custodian of his own brand.History may be kinder than today＊s critics, in part because New Labour was a product of its time. But its failures jeopardised the alliance of progressive forces the party must now put back together to win again."															
"The  has warned that  unpredictable outcome poses a risk to global financial stability at a time when it is already challenged by heavily-indebted US corporations, and weak .Warning that banks were likely to be the sector of the City hardest hit by Britain＊s departure from the , the IMF said the costs of doing business would rise and regulation would become more complex.The half-yearly Global Financial Stability Report 每 one of the IMF＊s two flagship reports 每 said the benefits of London as a global financial hub stemmed from economies of scale and its expertise across a range of industries.While the IMF acknowledged that there was ※significant uncertainty§ about the outcome of the two years of article 50 negotiations, it added that ※the challenges stemming from  could undermine financial stability in ways that are difficult to estimate or predict at this juncture.§The IMF also noted that there could be financial stability benefits if  had a less concentrated banking system. The Washington-based organisation said global financial stability had continued to improve, helped by a pick-up in economic growth.But it expressed concerns about the ability of heavily-indebted US corporations safely to fund higher investment during a period of . It also warned that a tightening of policy from the Federal Reserve, America＊s central bank, or rising protectionism could add to the vulnerability of exposed firms in the emerging world, raising their debts by between $130 and $230bn.The IMF highlighted  as its biggest concern among emerging economies, noting that bank assets were now more than triple the size of its economy. ※China faces mounting risks to financial stability as credit continues to rise rapidly,§ it said.It said the economic recovery in the eurozone would not be sufficient to solve the problems of its ※persistently weak§ banks.※System-wide headwinds are a problem not only within countries but can also affect the profitability of large, systemically important banks in Europe. These institutions find it difficult to keep up with their global competitors, and in some cases this may be partly due to profitability problems in their home countries.§The IMF added: ※Left unresolved, a combination of weak profits, lack of access to private capital, and large bad debt burdens impedes recovery and could reignite systemic risks.§ Some European governments use the City＊s bond markets to raise money more cheaply than they could do at home, but the IMF warned that they could find it harder and more costly to do if business was moved out of London after Brexit.The IMF said banks were likely to be the hardest-hit sector of the City, followed by insurance, with asset management firms least affected.※Although there is a continuum of possible outcomes from Brexit negotiations, it is likely that financial firms＊ ability to operate across jurisdictions will be curtailed to some degree,§ the report said.  activities were likely to be the most affected by the loss of passport rights 每 which allow UK-authorised firms, banks and fund managers to conduct business in the other 27 states. ※Uncertainty about the negotiation outcome is pushing banks to anticipate Brexit-related costs,§ the IMF said. ※Banks have started preparing for a worst-case scenario, in which no agreement is reached, to avoid any possible disruption to their services. Duplication of some activities and business structures in different locations seems inevitable and represents an extra cost. Operating in different regulatory regimes will also increase the burden on banks.§ The IMF said the complexity of financial institutions was likely to increase after Britain＊s exit from the EU, making life harder for national supervisors. ※Even if there is a generous agreement on regulatory equivalence, the UK and other EU legal systems could start to evolve separately. Financial firms will be forced to develop new strategies for operating and competing in a reconfigured world, and business structures are likely to become more intricate,§ it said. Even though Britain is not a member of the single currency, the City has up until now been the place that ※clears§ trades in the euro by acting as a marketplace for buyers and sellers. This role is now under threat, but the IMF said that even if euro clearing and settlement remained in London, the burden on UK regulators would increase. They would have to ※take over the regulation of rating agencies and trade repositories from the European Securities and Markets Authority. Such a task could amount to reviewing and revising thousands of pages of EU regulatory rulebooks.§ "															
"oday＊s inflation figures  than at any time in the past three years. But that was not the most remarkable aspect of the data. Until recently, CPI 每 the monthly update on inflation 每 has paid little attention to housing costs, featuring instead a basket of goods and services. Now, the Office for National Statistics has put almost all of its focus on a newer and controversial measure called CPIH which adds owner-occupiers＊ housing costs to the basket. The?idea is to reflect the costs associated with living in one＊s own home, something that is estimated to take up a tenth of household expenditure. But so far it has failed to win the official badge of excellence, classification as a ※national statistic§ by the nation＊s fact-checker, the UK Statistics Authority. The ONS hopes that the change helps to bring official measures closer to individual experience. But rushing to include it before the way it is calculated has the kitemark of reliability risks fuelling, rather than healing, the scepticism that was exposed and partly legitimised in the EU referendum campaign.The trouble with statistics is sometimes the statistics themselves 每 last year, MPs on the Treasury select committee were scathing about the ※§ and failure to respond to consumer need of the ONS 每 but sometimes it＊s also a failure to understand what statistics can, and can＊t, explain. Their introduction in the ※Whitehall knows best§ years after the war transformed public policymaking. But in an age when people see themselves as individuals first, part of a community second, and when geographical and individual inequalities have grown sharply, official statistics have sometimes felt inadequate as a way of describing what life is really like. It was hard, for example, to believe in the idea of immigration as a national economic bonus when it was experienced as oversubscribed GP lists and overflowing classrooms.One response has been to provide much more localised, and sometimes individualised, analysis of the big picture. Economic growth nationally looks quite different when looked at regionally. The UK growth rate between 2014 and 2015 was 2.1%. But in the East Midlands, it was only 1%, and while it was higher in the West Midlands (1.6%), people in Solihull were still contributing less to GDP than their neighbours in Nottingham. Inflation itself affects different income groups differently. The economist Paul Donovan talks about inflation inequality: it is expensive to be poor, cheaper to be rich.  a striking contrast between the rises in costs faced by the richest 20% and poorest 20% in a number of advanced economies in recent decades. In the UK, between 1997 and the beginning of 2017, prices for the richest fifth rose 40% but for the poorest fifth they increased by 51%.The ONS boasts that  remains high: four out of five people trust them. It＊s politicians whose use of the information is questioned. The Department for Education has just had to acknowledge that the student satisfaction survey was not nearly robust enough to be used to assess university teachers＊ excellence.

"Failure to meet the internet-inspired aspirations of people in poor countries runs the risk of creating the conditions for war, terrorism and increased migration, the president of the  has warned.Speaking in London ahead of the Bank＊s spring meeting next week,  said an urgent development push was needed in order to meet the demands for a better life by those in developing countries, increasingly aware through their smartphones of how rich people lived.The Bank is particularly worried about recent low growth in Africa and Kim said  should be used to turn the countries into trillions of dollars of investment from the private sector.※Aspirations, linked to opportunity, can breed dynamism and inclusive, sustainable economic growth,§ Kim said, in a speech at the London School of Economics on Tuesday. ※But I worry that if there＊s no opportunity to achieve these aspirations, frustration may well lead to  and eventually migration.※We＊re already seeing worrying trends 每 2 billion people live in countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence. After a period of decline since the end of the Cold War, violent conflicts have increased rapidly since 2010. .§Kim said that an individual＊s happiness was linked not just to their own income but also to the incomes of others. As internet coverage had expanded, the comparison was increasingly with people in rich countries.※Keeping up with the Joneses used to be about keeping up with your neighbours. But it＊s no longer only about the Joneses living around you 每 , the Joneses could be anywhere in the world.§Kim said creating the right conditions for the private sector to invest was vital if the world was to meet the ambitious by the target date of 2030.The World Bank president believes that too much official aid has been spent on projects that the private sector could finance, and that instead of picking ※low hanging fruit§ official development assistance should be spent in more difficult areas.He said the top priority should be to ※systematically de-risk countries to enable private sector financing, while at the same time ensuring that these investments benefit poor countries and poor people. We should do this by crowding in the private sector whenever possible.§Kim added that he wanted a ※win-win§ outcome, where the trillions of dollars earning little interest were used to  and transport infrastructure. Investors looking for more lucrative opportunities should be mobilised to help meet the ※exploding aspirations§ of people all over the world.※This is a fundamental shift in our conception of who we are,§ Kim said. ※For too long, our first thought was how can we get the loan or the grant out of the door? But that＊s often not what＊s best for poor people and poor countries, and it＊s not what＊s best for the world. We need to have a different and difficult conversation about how we approach development finance.§He singled out climate change as an area where urgent action was needed. He said time was running out and joint public-private action on both mitigating the impact of climate change and adapting to the changing environment was required immediately."															
															
"UK households are the most downbeat about their finances since 2013, as families start to feel the pinch from rising inflation and , according to a new survey.This suggests consumer spending, until now the main driver of UK economic growth, will weaken in coming months.An index measuring household expectations for finances in 12 months＊ time dropped sharply to 45.3 in March, from 48.1 in February, according to economic consultancy IHS Markit. This signals the greatest degree of pessimism since November 2013.People living in the east Midlands were the most downbeat about their financial prospects, followed by those in the north-east and London.Inflation has picked up sharply in recent months as the weak pound has pushed up the cost of imported goods. Data released on Tuesday showed that inflation hit , with food and motor fuel becoming more expensive. This contrasts with near-zero inflation a year ago. Coupled with slowing wage growth, higher inflation leaves households worse off.Tim Moore, a senior economist at IHS Markit, said: ※UK households reported greater pressure on their financial well-being in March, as rising inflation has started to erode incomes and reduce cash available to spend. On average in the first quarter of 2017 survey respondents have reported the sharpest increase in their everyday living costs for three-and-a-half years.※A combination of rising inflation and subdued pay trends has forced households to recalibrate their expectations for the year ahead. After holding steady last summer, UK consumers are now more downbeat about their financial outlook than at any time since late 2013.§Higher inflation has increased the chances of an interest rate rise, and more than half of households (58%) are expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates in the next 12 months.The findings came as the , who toured the country between late November and late February, showed that retail sales volume growth had eased and was expected to slow further in the year ahead. The Bank blamed the sharp fall in sterling feeding through to higher prices, reducing households＊ purchasing power.At the same time, the weaker pound and stronger world economy had led to a ※marked rise§ in export volume growth and business investment intentions had picked up, pointing to modest growth in company spending this year, the Bank＊s report said.The report also found that some workers from the EU are leaving the UK because the sharp fall in sterling had eroded the value of earnings they send home. ※However, there were more reports of difficulties recruiting new EU migrant workers, due to a shrinking pool of candidates.§"															
"he idea of a tax on robots was raised last May in a  prepared by MEP Mady Delvaux from the committee on legal affairs. Emphasising how robots could boost inequality, the report proposed that there might be a ※need to introduce corporate reporting requirements on the extent and proportion of the contribution of robotics and AI to the economic results of a company for the purpose of taxation and social security contributions§.The public reaction to Delvaux＊s proposal has been overwhelmingly negative, with the notable exception of , who . But we should not dismiss the idea out of hand. In just the past year, we have seen the proliferation of devices such as Google Home and Amazon Echo Dot (Alexa), which replace some aspects of household help. Likewise, the Delphi and nuTonomy driverless taxi services in Singapore have started to replace taxi drivers. And Doordash, which uses Starship Technologies miniature self-driving vehicles, is replacing restaurant delivery people.If these and other labor-displacing innovations succeed, surely calls to tax them will grow more frequent, owing to the human problems that arise when people lose their jobs 每 often jobs with which they closely identify, and for which they may have spent years preparing. Optimists point out that there have always been new jobs for people replaced by technology, but, as the robot revolution accelerates, doubts about how well this will work out continue to grow. A tax on robots, its advocates hope, might slow down the process, at least temporarily, and provide revenues to finance adjustment, like retraining programs for displaced workers.Such programmes may be as essential as our work is to healthy human life as we know it. In his book ,  emphasised the fundamental importance of maintaining a ※place in society 每 a calling§. When many people are no longer able to find work to support a family, troubling consequences ensue, and, as Phelps stresses, ※the functioning of the entire community may be impaired§. In other words, there are externalities to robotisation that justify some government intervention.Critics of a robot tax have emphasised that the ambiguity of the term ※robot§ makes defining the tax base difficult. The critics also stress the new robotics＊ enormous, undeniable benefits to productivity growth.But let＊s not rule out so quickly at least modest robot taxes during the transition to a different world of work. Such a tax should be part of a broader plan to manage the consequences of the robotics revolution.All taxes, except a ※lump-sum tax§, introduce distortions in the economy. But no government can impose a lump-sum tax 每 the same amount for everyone regardless of their income or expenditures 每 because it would fall most heavily on those with less income, and it would grind the poor, who might be unable to pay it at all. So taxes have to be related to some activity indicative of ability to pay taxes, and whatever activity it is will be discouraged as a result.Frank Ramsey published a  in 1927 arguing that to minimise taxation-induced distortions, one should tax  activities, and he proposed how to set tax rates. His abstract theory has never been a fully operational principle for actual tax rates, but it provides a powerful argument against presuming that the tax should be zero for all but a few activities, or that all activities should be taxed at the same rate.Activities that create externalities might have a higher tax rate than Ramsey would have proposed. For example, taxes on alcoholic beverages are widespread. Alcoholism is a major social problem. It destroys marriages, families, and lives. From 1920 to 1933, the United States tried a much harsher market intervention: outright prohibition of alcoholic beverages. But it turned out to be impossible to eliminate alcohol consumption. The alcohol tax that accompanied the end of prohibition was a milder form of discouragement.Discussion of a  should consider what alternative we have to deal with rising inequality. It would be natural to consider a more progressive income tax and a ※§. But these measures do not have widespread popular support. If support is not widespread, the tax, even if imposed, will not last.When taxes on high incomes are raised, usually in wartime, it turns out to be only temporary. Ultimately, it seems natural to most people that taxing successful people to benefit unsuccessful people is demeaning to the latter, and even the recipients of the handout often do not really want it. Politicians know that: they usually do not campaign on proposals to confiscate high incomes and pad low incomes.So, taxes must be reframed to remedy income inequality induced by robotisation. It may be more politically acceptable, and thus sustainable, to tax the robots rather than just the high-income people. And while this would not tax individual human success, as income taxes do, it might in fact imply somewhat higher taxes on higher incomes, if high incomes are earned in activities that involve replacing humans with robots.A moderate tax on robots, even a temporary tax that merely slows the adoption of disruptive technology, seems a natural component of a policy to address rising inequality. Revenue could be targeted towards , to help people replaced by new technology make the transition to a different career. This would accord with our natural sense of justice, and thus be likely to endure."															
"udging by his comments, Mark Carney is blissfully unconcerned about  for the first time since 2013. The governor dismissed the unexpectedly sharp rise in the cost of living as a ※single data point§ when quizzed about it at a conference on ethics in banking held at the Bank of England. ※We are talking about much bigger issues§, There＊s little doubt that voters are unhappy about the morals 每 or lack of them 每 of those working in the financial services industry. But they are also concerned about living standards. After the latest rise, the annual rate of inflation is the same as annual growth in average earnings. Next month, wages will lag behind prices and real incomes will start falling. For millions of voters, there are not many bigger issues than that.In truth, of course, Carney is more concerned about inflation than his apparent nonchalance would suggest. A combination of a rebound in oil prices and the fall in the pound since the EU referendum has resulted in a steady increase in inflation since the middle of last year, and there are more price rises in the pipeline.Competition between retailers will help keep inflation in check but the double whammy from energy prices and sterling could hardly have come at a worse time, since businesses are already having to cope with a higher minimum wage, pension auto-enrolment and the apprenticeship levy.  is on course to hit 3% later this year.The pound rose on the currency markets on the possibility that interest rates will go up sooner than expected. That still looks premature given the lack of price pressure. Indeed, the squeeze on real incomes is likely to bear down on consumer spending over the coming months, and this will eventually feed through into lower inflation.But Carney will have to justify the Bank＊s inactivity as inflation moves further above its target during the spring or summer. He could argue that Threadneedle Street does not need to raise interest rates when the economy is set to slow anyway. He could say that the Bank will only need to act if and when wages start to rise in response to higher prices. He could even say that the economy is becoming a bit better balanced. But he will need to say something because this ※single data point§ will soon be followed by others."

"Hipster culture is officially mainstream after the rising popularity of vegan diets, cycling and artisan gin were reflected in the annual shakeup of the shopping basket used to measure UK inflation.Non-dairy milks made from soya, rice and almonds have made it into to the basket for the first time, reflecting the growing trend of dairy-free diets according to the .Gin and cycling helmets also made a return to the basket after long absences, while menthol cigarettes and basic mobile phone handsets are out.The ONS updates the basket once a year to better reflect the lifestyle of the modern consumer in Britain.※The once-parodied trappings of hipster subculture 每 from well-groomed beards to a taste for the retro 每 appear to have become increasingly mainstream in the last few years,§ said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS. ※So perhaps it isn＊t a surprise to see items in the latest basket of goods and services which seem as though they could be at home in a hipster household.§Children＊s scooters are also in, replacing swings. Fees for stopping cheques are out, while council tax has been included.The ONS said charities such as , which campaign to change public attitudes and encourage people to try vegan for the month of January, had contributed to the growing popularity of non-dairy milk, increasingly thanks to lifestyle choices rather than decisions driven by allergies.※A few years ago, those avoiding cow＊s milk because of lactose intolerance or for ethical reasons were drinking soya, but there＊s been a rising demand for alternative plant milk substitutes, including rice, hemp and 每 most popular 每 almond,§ the ONS said. Gin has been reintroduced after a 13-year absence. The ONS said the one-time favourite of the middle-aged suburban couple had become a staple of the younger drinker. Growth in the number of small gin producersand gin festivals have also helped to boost its popularity. The value of gin sold by manufacturers in the UK almost doubled from ?126m in 2009 to ?239m in 2015.Michael Andrews, the director of ambient buying for Waitrose, said gin sales had risen 16% over the past year. ※With the UK experiencing a ＆ginaissance＊, it＊s no wonder gin has entered back into the basket this year. It has consistently been our fastest-growing spirit and with so many new boutique brands entering the market this shows no sign of slowing.§Bicycle helmets made it back into the basket after a 12-year absence, as the success of British cyclists such as Jason and Laura Kenny in the Olympics and Chris Froome in the Tour de France fuelled enthusiasm for the sport.The number of Brits interested in taking up cycling almost doubled in the last two years from one in 10 in 2014 to one in five in 2016, according to the market-research company Mintel.※While cycling is famed for its Mamils [middle-aged men in lycra], Brits most likely to aspire to cycle are those aged 16 to 24, with young women more interested in cycling than young men,§ said David Walmsley, a senior leisure analyst at the firm.Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at the accountancy firm KPMG,said the changes to the inflation basket broadly reflected a growing trend of healthier living. ※The ONS basket of goods offers a fascinating peek from behind the curtain at today＊s typical household shopping list,§ he said. ※As in previous years, factors including changes in consumer tastes, technological advancements and the latest fads and trends all carve out a new, modern-day consumer. ※The updated basket clearly mirrors the consumer shift towards health, fitness and Free From [gluten-free], as well as the resurgence of traditional tastes and activities, albeit often with a modern twist.§Basic mobile handsets were ejected from the 2017 basket, pushed out by more popular smartphones and a reflection of changing technology and fewer models being available in the shops.

"American companies have a long history of weighing in on political and social issues. But the election of Donald Trump has fueled public pressure on businesses to go much further to take a stand on specific policies 每 and made it difficult for those that wish to remain neutral.Trump＊s recent decision to revoke a legal guidance that allowed transgender students to use bathrooms of their choice drew a from companies such as Yahoo and Apple. Before that, his actions on immigration, environment and women＊s reproductive health 每 along with his propensity for tweet-attacking companies he doesn＊t fancy 每 had already fanned intense public outrage that in turn has to publicly take sides. ※It＊s rare for companies to be this publicly visible on an issue so early in a new administration,§ said David Boaz, executive vice president of libertarian think tank Cato Institute.So what＊s the cost to businesses for taking sides 每 or failing to do so?The most high profile fight so far involves the executive order that initially banned travelers, even those with valid visas and green cards, from seven Muslim-majority countries. More than 100 companies, including Google, Microsoft and Netflix, supporting lawsuits to suspend the order. It＊s not surprising that Silicon Valley would speak out against the ban, since many of its workers are immigrants.While taking part in legal challenges may seem an expensive undertaking, it often costs far less than what some of the giant firms spend on lobbying, Boaz said. ※If you＊re  or even Uber, $1m is not that much,§ he added.Some companies have been willing to spend money in other ways to express their political views. Google and Airbnb, for example, took out to register their views on gay rights, immigration and religious tolerance. A 30-second spot at the Super Bowl this year.For Uber, failing to take a strong stance against the travel ban initially was a costly mistake. The company when it offered cheaper rides to JFK airport in New York City instead of joining other taxi drivers in a protest. Uber＊s action prompted of people to delete their Uber app and upset its employees. In response, the company set up a $3m legal defense fund for its immigrant drivers, and its CEO, Travis Kalanick, stepped down from Trump＊s economic advisory council.Consumer boycotts have become a popular way to register political views, and that has been a challenge for companies that try to stay neutral. Nordstrom was caught in the midst of this when it became a target of a campaign, launched before the election, to boycott companies that do business with Trump family members. When it announced last month that it was due to poor sales, it faced a tweet-lashing from the president and boycotts from his supporters.※You don＊t normally see supporters or detractors of a presidential candidate acting in such a mobilized block against companies,§ said Brayden King, professor of management at Northwestern University＊s Kellogg School of Management. ※It reflects the highly polarized political environment we＊re in right now, and people are seeing every part of their life as reflected through the mirror of politics.§But the hubbub with Nordstrom  the company much, Bloomberg reported. While sales of Ivanka＊s line  last year, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, the merchandise likely accounted for of Nordstrom＊s annual sales. Late last month, the company posted  that beat Wall Street＊s expectation.Staying neutral can be tough to accomplish for businesses these days. A 2014  from public relations firm Global Strategy Group showed that 56% of Americans believe companies should stand up for what they believe in, regardless of whether the issue is controversial or not, compared to 44% in 2013.Same-sex and transgender issues in particular have drawn strong reaction from the business community. Nearly 70 companies, including Ikea, Apple and General Electric,  against state legislation in North Carolina that would force transgender people to use bathrooms that matched their gender at birth. In 2012, Nike, Microsoft and Starbucks announced their support of a Washington state bill to. Dan Cathy, CEO of fast food chain both a ※Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day§ from one side and ※National Same-Sex Kiss Day§ from the other side when he made several statements against gay marriage.The North Carolina law in particular prompted so many companies to suspend or cancel business deals that studies have emerged to try to calculate the financial toll. Research by the UCLA School of Law said the law would cost the state $5bn in economic activities per year. Last November, that the state had experienced $630m in lost business since the state passed the law in March last year.With Trump, businesses should brace themselves for further battles ahead, King said. The president＊s environmental plans in particular are at odds with many large companies＊ goals to cut carbon emissions and engage in broad scale conservation efforts, such as reducing water use and transitioning to renewable energy. Trump has vowed to eliminate environmental regulations, arguing that those rules are costly to companies.Just this week, the EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, , a view that contradicts overwhelming scientific evidence.※Environmental stewardship and sustainability are going to be big issues of contention,§ said Irv Schenkler, clinical professor of management communication at New York University＊s Stern School of Business. ※Many large corporations have committed themselves to alternative energy, but the outlook is that the new administration is going to take a very different tack in this regard.§Figuring out when to speak up and when to keep mum will continue to be a big challenge for companies in this divisive political climate, Schenkler said. Offending a thin-skinned president could jeopardize a company＊s lobbying effort on other issues, such as corporate tax cut.Trump＊s tendency to hold a grudge and berate companies recalls the practice of former president Richard Nixon, who maintained a that included business leaders such as Charles Dyson of Dyson-Kissner and Frank Heineman, president of Men＊s Wear International. ※He used the IRS and other government agencies to harass those that opposed him,§ said West.But keeping silent also hasn＊t proven to be a good option for high profile companies.※They have a duty to fight for the interest of their company,§ King said. ※Business should not be afraid of the government.§"															
"British consumers are bracing themselves for an expensive and uncertain future, with four out of five fearing price rises on household essentials such as food, drink and clothing, a survey has revealed.Eighty-three percent of Britons admit they are concerned about price hikes in goods and services, while 59% are most worried about the soaring cost of groceries, according to a poll for Mintel＊s 27th annual British Lifestyles report. Spiralling holiday costs are a concern for 35%, with 26% fearing higher prices for clothing and shoes. As shoppers have become used to ultra-low food prices following several years of deflation, impending price rises could prove painful for household budgets, the report warns. The slump in the value of sterling following the  vote last June has pushed up the prices of imports, especially of food and clothing.With food prices widely expected to increase in 2017, average spending on grocery shopping looks likely to increase unless shoppers find ways to maintain spending through trading down or reducing waste. Britons have also become less materialistic, the report notes, prioritising spending on leisure activities and experiences over material possessions in what is dubbed Despite political turbulence following the vote to leave the EU, Mintel said consumer spending edged up 3.7% last year to ?1.2tn. While growth was seen in nearly all the 17 sectors tracked by Mintel, it was notably lower across all fast-moving consumer goods markets, reflecting supermarket price wars and the impact of discounters  and By 2021, it is projected that Britons will spend ?1.4tn per annum 每 equivalent to 17% growth over the next five years. Beyond concerns over rising prices, Britons are also fretting about ※bigger picture§ issues. The research (from an online poll of 2,000 people aged 16 and over) was carried out in February before Theresa May called the snap general election. But as many as 81% of UK consumers are concerned about the future health of the NHS, while 68% are worried about the UK economy and 67% are nervous about the state of the environment. In contrast, less than half of all adults (48%) are worried about their ability to pay the bills and less than two in five (37%) are concerned about the burden of personal debt.※Our research underlines particular concern about the rising cost of in-home food, and inflation is undoubtedly going to squeeze household budgets,§ said Jack Duckett, the senior consumer lifestyles analyst at Mintel. ※However, broader consumer confidence is still relatively strong. Despite rising prices, most people still expect their finances to hold up well over the next year. It＊s the bigger picture issues that the UK faces, such as the NHS and the economy, that are the main concern, rather than people＊s own finances.§ Unpicking some notable trends, the report highlights the impact of consumers＊ shift towards healthier eating.

Half (48%) of bottled water drinkers admitted concerns over sugar had prompted them to make the switch, triggering sales growth of 9% in 2016 to ?2.2bn.Pre-packed bread remains the most troubled segment of the bread and baked goods market, the report noted, with sales in value terms estimated to have fallen by 10% in 2016 to ?1.49bn.  are expected to continue 每 with traditional teabags losing out to green, fruit and herb varieties 每 while a deluge of cheaper,  have shaken up the sector for consumers wanting to recreate ※coffee shop§ versions of their favourite beverage at home.In beauty products and toiletries, 2016 proved challenging for the hair removal market, the report said, as more young women chose to shun shavers. Mintel＊s data shows that 83% of women aged 16 to 24 agree there is too much pressure on women to remove or groom body hair, while sales of shaving and hair removal products fell 5% to ?567m.

"ad  come back from her Easter walking holiday and decided against holding a general election, few would have blamed her. Going to the country on 8 June was always a gamble, as has become evident the longer the campaign has gone on.Consider the reasons for caution. It is mid-term when governments tend to be unpopular. The public is sick of politics after the 2014 Scottish referendum, the 2015 general election and last year＊s EU referendum. May had a workable majority and had vowed to go the distance.What＊s more, there were solid economic reasons to let things be. The recovery from the deep slump of 2008-09 has been the weakest in living memory. and . The 1970s was thought of as the most dismal decade for the economy since the second world war but the 2010s now hold this unwanted accolade. In terms of what＊s happened to living standards, it isn＊t even close.Confronted with the strong evidence that economic policy since 2010 has been a failure, May＊s response has been to offer more of the same. Deep welfare spending cuts are designed to balance the books, and would help do so if the Bank of England was in a position to respond with cheaper borrowing.But that can＊t happen because interest rates are at 0.25% and can＊t go lower. As a result, welfare cuts suck spending power out of the economy. That leads to slower growth, which explains why it will now take until the middle of the next decade under Conservative plans to run a budget surplus.Presumably, sticking to a deficit-reduction plan that isn＊t working fits with May＊s ※strong and stable§ mantra. But, in truth, the wrong mix of monetary and fiscal policy has left the economy weak and unstable. Weak because investment and productivity have been so poor. Unstable because growth has been so heavily reliant on .The ※strong and stable§ May has performed two U-turns in the past three months: on the  and on the . A third U-turn 每 relaxing fiscal policy (cutting taxes or raising spending) so that monetary policy (interest rates) can be tightened would make a lot of sense and is long overdue.As the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out last week, government resistance to changing its macro-economic approach will inevitably lead to increased financial pressure on the NHS. Although health has been exempt from the deep cuts that have affected most other Whitehall departments since 2010, the settlements have been nugatory by historical standards. Real spending has risen on average by 4% a year since the mid-1950s. In the 18 years of Conservative rule between 1979 and 1997, it increased by 3% a year. On current plans it will increase by 1.4% a year between 2010 and 2022. (Labour＊s plans are, incidentally, not a lot more generous. They would involve annual increases of 2% a year).When the consultancy firm Oxford Economics put the economic plans of the three main parties through its model it concluded that the continuation of austerity under the  would lead to stable although unspectacular growth averaging 1.9% a year over the course of the next parliament.By contrast, the consultancy noted that ※the more expansionary policies proposed by  and the Liberal Democrats would offer better outcomes in terms of GDP growth and allow monetary policy to be normalised sooner, without putting the public finances under strain.§ More specifically, the economy would be 1.9% bigger under the Lib Dem plans and 1% bigger under Labour＊s plans than under the Conservative plans.Higher growth under Labour and the Lib Dems would be the result of abolishing the 1% cap on public sector pay, an increase in public sector employment and plans to boost spending on public infrastructure by 50%. The claim by the Conservatives that higher borrowing would lead to much higher deficits and an explosion in the national debt is dismissed by Oxford  as the pre-Keynesian nonsense it is.※Our scenarios demonstrate that higher levels of capital and current spending could be accommodated without putting the public finances under undue strain. Therefore, in our view it is very difficult to argue that the macroeconomic benefits offered by the more austere Conservative plans are anywhere near large enough to offset the opportunity of stronger growth offered by the plans of the Liberal Democrats or Labour.§To sum up, May called an election when there was no need for one, when the public didn＊t want one, when living standards were falling, when the economy is dysfunctional, when the strategy of the past seven years has demonstrably failed, and when there is a viable alternative.Despite all that, there were reasons for May to take the bold approach. One was the experience of Gordon Brown, who would almost certainly have won an election in the autumn of 2007, when the financial crisis was in its infancy. A second was that many voters remain doubtful about the idea of higher borrowing even when it pays for itself. A third was that no matter how tough life is and no matter how tough it might get, the May calculus was that the public would assume it would be even tougher under Labour. She saw the opportunity of a presidential election in which she would be a handbag-wielding, Brussels-vanquishing Margaret Thatcher figure up against Jeremy Corbyn＊s Michael Foot.The idea was to keep the focus on the need to have a ※strong§ prime minister to deliver Brexit and 每 as far as possible 每 divert attention from the government＊s less than impressive economic record. When the economy did move centre stage, the plan was to brand Labour as the party of reckless borrowing and ideologically-driven nationalisation.In the first couple of weeks of the campaign, the May strategy was a storming success. The Conservatives were streets ahead in the opinion polls. There was talk of a landslide that would see the Tories beat Labour in Wales.But as the weeks have gone by, Labour has done better. Corbyn is better on the stump than May. The prime minister＊s rapid U-turn has raised doubts about whether she will be Mrs T redux in the Brexit negotiations. Finally, austerity fatigue and a leftward shift in public opinion on issues such as inequality and nationalisation, meant Labour won the battle of the manifestos.There are still 10 days until the election, a long time in politics. The polls suggest May will still win and she could still get her landslide. But if the majority is 50 rather than the 150 seen as possible earlier in the campaign, it will be a pyrrhic victory.

"hat a difference a few months make. As 2017 opened, eurozone politicians still raw from the shock of the Brexit vote and Donald Trump＊s presidential triumph were nervously awaiting elections in the Netherlands and France.They feared that discontent would propel the populist wave into the heart of Europe and usher in far-right, anti-euro leaders. In the event, the predicted surge for Dutch populist Geert Wilders  and in France, Front National candidate Marine Le Pen was  by pro-EU centrist Emmanuel Macron.Now, the economic picture for the currency union is looking brighter. Unemployment in the bloc is at its lowest for almost eight years and economic growth was 0.5% in the first quarter, well ahead of the UK＊s 0.2%.Business surveys suggest the new year momentum within the eurozone carried on in the second quarter. Based on one report, the flash eurozone PMI (purchasing managers＊ index) survey from IHS Markit, growth was at a six-year high in May. The EU recently , almost matching the 1.8% of 2016. It also expects unemployment to keep falling as the economic recovery finally spreads to all corners of the region.Experts say it is no coincidence that the approval ratings of populists are fading as the economy strengthens. ※Support levels for anti-establishment or populist parties have declined quite sharply over the past few months,§ says Andy Cates at Nomura.He sees a number of causes of the recent strength, including a revival in global growth; improved domestic demand; signs that capital spending is making a comeback; and sharp declines in youth unemployment. In the longer term there will be further support from member nations＊ public finances being in better shape, giving governments more space to shore up the recovery, he adds.Economists point out that the relationship between brighter economic news and diminishing popularity for anti-establishment parties works both ways. The decline of populism has in turn helped the economy. ※It looks like confidence in the European economy is returning rather quickly,§ says Bert Colijn of ING bank in Amsterdam. He says the brighter mood is down to the economic strength seen in official figures and surveys, and a change in the political atmosphere since the Dutch and French elections.※There is a sense that we＊ve turned a corner in terms of political risk. After Trump and Brexit there was a worry we would see more of this sentiment and this could be the big thing that topples the euro,§ said Colijn. But he cautions against getting carried away with what he describes as ※europhoria§. He see risks from  and from Italy, where unemployment remains high, particularly among young people. ※It would be silly to think all problems are out of the way.§Reinhard Cluse at UBS is also wary, pointing out that business surveys have tended to come in stronger than official growth figures: ※We are cruising at a high altitude. But this optimism is not fully reflected in the hard data.§Cluse expects the pace of growth in the eurozone to ease off in the second half of this year as higher inflation erodes household spending power and the European Central Bank starts to hint at taking away some of the stimulus of its . But that was no reason to be downbeat: ※Although we cannot perhaps maintain the growth rates of the first half, a slowdown from that does not mean bad news. In relative terms, Europe looks good.§Amid such optimism, here is a health check of five key eurozone economies, from Germany＊s powerhouse to perennially troubled Greece.After a long downturn and a property crash, Spain has enjoyed one of the eurozone＊s fastest rates of GDP growth and a robust rise in employment 每 even if a chunk of them are temporary jobs. Youth unemployment is still high by European standards but is down from more than 46% a year ago.Exports have been driving Spain＊s recovery, so strength in the rest of the eurozone and the world has helped. A rebound in consumer spending has provided a further fillip but rising inflation could dent that.The housing market has also recovered. But one important source of support for property prices appears to be declining: no other nationality buys as much property in Spain as the British, and .The recovery in the eurozone appears to have largely passed Italy by, judging by the latest data. GDP rose just 0.2% in the opening quarter of 2017. The sluggish recovery from a recession that only ended in 2014 has taken its toll on living standards. While unemployment in the wider eurozone fell over the past year, in Italy it crept up. But youth unemployment is down.Many economists feel Italy is the weak link in the eurozone and highlight risks that an election expected in early 2018 could usher in anti-establishment politicians like Beppe Grillo＊s Five Star movement. Adding to worries about Italy＊s potential to destabilise the eurozone, its debt levels remain high; it suffers from a marked north-south divide and its banking system is .Greece has slipped back into recession, with two consecutive quarters of contraction underscoring its fragile state after years of deep spending cuts and political upheaval. Nonetheless, forecasters remain optimistic that it can start growing again in 2017.Greece has the highest unemployment and youth unemployment in the eurozone, and households have been hurt by austerity policies pushed through to appease international creditors. More recently, sentiment has been hit by uncertainty about Athens＊s ability to afford loan repayments that fall due in July after eurozone finance ministers meeting this month failed to agree a deal to unlock a tranche of bailout funds for Greece. Hopes now rest on talks in mid-June.But economists feel the risks for the eurozone from Greece have receded since the peak of the crisis in 2012 and since 2015 when the anti-austerity party Syriza swept to power ※We are not where we were in 2015 and even then it didn＊t feel like it [the Greek crisis] was going to take down the eurozone the way people feared in 2012 and 2013,§ says Colijn at ING.Emmanuel Macron＊s victory this month assuaged short-term fears about a rise of the far-right Front National and anti-euro sentiment generally. But commentators have been quick to warn that the country＊s problems have not gone away. Reflecting the frustrations that turned many voters to political extremes, France has a relatively high youth unemployment rate, its overall jobless rate is more than double Germany＊s and economic growth is expected to remain sluggish this year.A victory for Macron in France brought big relief to its major trading partner, Germany, where business sentiment has soared. A closely watched business survey by Germany＊s Ifo institute last week showed confidence at its highest since records began in 1991.The figures paint a bright picture for Europe＊s largest economy and so far it appears to have suffered little fallout from Brexit or the election of protectionist Trump in another of its big trading partners. GDP growth accelerated in the opening months of 2017 on the back of robust exports, stronger state and consumer spending and a buoyant construction sector. That strength bodes well for chancellor Angela Merkel as she seeks a fourth term in September. Germany＊s election is not seen to present the same risks to the EU project as other polls. Merkel＊s main opponent is pro-European Social Democrat candidate Martin Schulz."															
"Labour has pledged to ban all , put a halt to unpaid internships and end the pay cap on public sector staff in an unashamedly leftwing pitch to British workers.In a move welcomed by union leaders but that will be attacked as ※anti-business§ and unaffordable by opponents, the 20-point blueprint also includes commitments to double paid paternity leave to four weeks, increase paternity pay and guarantee temporary and part-time workers the same rights as full-time employees.The shadow chancellor  said the policies would form ※the cornerstone of the next Labour government＊s programme to bring an end to the rigged economy that many experience in workplaces across Britain§. The package includes promises to increase the minimum wage to match the national living wage (expected to be at least ?10 an hour by 2020) and to introduce a maximum 20:1 pay ratio between the highest and lowest earners in the public sector and in companies bidding for public sector?contracts.McDonnell said: ※The scandal of six million people earning less than the living wage and four million children growing up in poverty are not inevitable. It only takes a change of government to bring these outrages to an end.§An Opinium/ poll puts  a massive 17 points behind the Tories, on 30%, but its support has increased by four points compared with a week ago. Backing for the Tories has risen by two points to 47%, with the Lib Dems down three points to 8% and Ukip down two points to 7%.Labour MPs will hope the appeal to working people will stem what many feared would become a drift of some traditional Labour supporters towards the Tories with less than six weeks to go before polling day on 8?June.The manifesto for working Britain is more leftwing than that unveiled by Ed Miliband ahead of the 2015 election, which itself was criticised by the Tories and Lib Dems at the time as one of the most ※anti-business§ in living memory.The 20-point blueprint aims to offer concrete measures to help those who  says are being exploited in an increasingly unregulated economy, including workers such as couriers and delivery drivers, and the 900,000 people employed by the big high street brands and other companies on zero-hours contracts.Len McCluskey, general secretary of the UK＊s biggest union, Unite, said: ※This positive platform from Labour is the antidote to the uncertainty and insecurity which plagues working life for millions in the UK.§Unison＊s general secretary Dave Prentis said: ※Ending the 1% pay cap would make such a huge difference to the lives of thousands of nurses, teaching assistants, town hall staff and other public service employees whose living standards have plummeted under the Conservatives. Calling time on zero-hours contracts would come as a huge relief to the many people who have no option but to work in this precarious and wholly unsatisfactory way.§The Communication Workers Union described the plans as ※some of the most important announcements from any political party on the world of work for a generation§.Labour has already said it will introduce . McDonnell also signalled that Labour＊s manifesto will pledge no rise in VAT or national insurance and he will argue the party should rule out reviving Miliband＊s mansion tax policy.The Tories will use the pledges to further question Labour＊s economic credibility and ask how they can be paid for without huge tax rises or a massive increase in borrowing.On Saturday Corbyn broke off from a campaign speech to speak about his personal history, motivations and views on leadership. In a tactic reminiscent of that employed by the former Labour leader Neil Kinnock and the former Tory prime minister John Major, Corbyn said: ※And now for a sentence I＊ve yet to utter in my political life: ＆Enough about you, what about me?＊§ He recalled his maiden speech in parliament 34 years ago, the part he played in anti-apartheid protests in London and other personal memories.Afterwards he denied it was part of a rebranding exercise but was a ※one-off§. ※As you know, I am very averse to talking about myself ＃ I am not going to spend the whole election campaign talking about myself any more. So you had the chance today,§ he said.Labour strategists are keen to contrast what they portray as a cold Tory prime minister, Theresa May, with what they insist is Corbyn＊s warmer personality. They are also anxious to contrast his willingness to take questions from the media with May＊s refusal to take part in TV debates."															
"lections have long been won and lost on the state of the economy. So Theresa May＊s decision to call a snap poll just as UK growth appears to be slowing has raised eyebrows. But with the  vote predicted to put more pressure on households as the year goes on, the prime minister may well believe this is as good as it gets for economic news.With less than six weeks to go to the election, a look at the economic backdrop reveals there is both good news and bad for the government.Defying the doomsayers, the predicted post-referendum slump in business activity simply has not happened. Companies are still spending and hiring. Employment is at a record high. Surveys suggest  as it makes their goods and services more competitive in overseas markets. Meanwhile, the global economy has shown signs of improvement, again helping exporters. But the flipside to the weak pound is higher import costs for businesses, leading . There are also fears that those reliant on consumer spending will suffer as higher living costs erode Britons＊ spending power.Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged to bring down borrowing and managed to deliver some good news on the deficit last week. Borrowing for the tax year ended in March was ?52bn, roughly in line with the ?51.7bn predicted by the government＊s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. That was a 28% drop from the previous year and , helped by strong tax receipts as the economy continued to grow in the months following the Brexit vote. But details of the most recent public finance figures suggest the government faces tough challenges to bring down the deficit further. March figures pointed to a slowdown in receipts from income tax and from VAT as retail sales were hit by higher prices in the shops.The pound＊s heavy losses have been the stock market＊s big gain since the Brexit vote. When sterling weakens, it helps the many companies in the FTSE 100 index that report in dollars and those that export from the UK. So while the pound is down around 13% against the dollar since the referendum, the FTSE 100 is up around 14% over the same period. Optimism about Donald Trump＊s planned tax reforms and spending spree has also lifted stock markets around the globe, providing a further fillip to the FTSE 100, which . That provides some feelgood soundbites for campaigning Conservatives. But ultimately, a share index populated by big international mining companies, pharmaceutical giants and banks tells you little about the UK economy.Among the dramatic predictions made for the UK ahead of last year＊s referendum, the International Monetary Fund warned that .In the event, house prices have been steady and are still rising in year-on-year terms. Recently, though, signs have emerged that the market is losing momentum. Nationwide＊s closely watched barometer of the market showed the average price of a home to ?207,699, following . The annual rate of house price growth slowed to 2.6%, the weakest since June 2013.But that cooling-off is by no means bad news in a market where first-time property buyers have long felt shut out by high prices.Economic growth beat expectations following the Brexit vote and the UK finished 2016 as one of the fastest growing advanced economies. However,  amid signs that rising inflation is hitting consumer spending, a key driver of the British economy.GDP expanded just 0.3% in the opening three months of 2017, down from growth of 0.7% the previous quarter. It was the weakest performance for a year and missed economists＊ forecasts for a more modest slowdown.The pound＊s drop makes imports to the UK more expensive and that effect has combined with higher crude oil prices to . That is above the Bank of England＊s 2% target and the highest since the autumn of 2013. After more than two years of falls, food prices are now rising again and consumers are starting to notice the increase in their day-to-day living costs. As a result, , with households becoming more gloomy about the outlook for their personal finances as well as the wider economy, according to polls.Inflation is rising but pay growth appears to be heading in the other direction, with employers unwilling or unable to award big rises. That cocktail is bad news for household finances because it leaves workers worse off in real terms. On the latest official figures, , marking the first drop in living standards in two and a half years. Regular pay was 1.9% higher than a year earlier while inflation was 2.3%. Looking ahead, economists expect inflation to rise further this year while wage growth remains weak. That bodes ill for an economy so reliant on consumer spending.One of the puzzles for policymakers last year was the resilience of consumer spending in the face of rising inflation. Bank of England governor Mark Carney noted that households appeared to be ※entirely looking through Brexit-related uncertainties§ but he  in order to keep up spending levels.Since his words of warning, there has been more evidence that Britons are indeed increasingly turning to credit cards and personal loans. They are also in a more precarious position when it comes to saving for tougher times ahead. The saving ratio 每 which estimates the amount of money households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income 每  at the end of last year."															
"Government borrowing fell to the lowest level since the financial crisis in the year to the end of March as the economy proved more resilient than expected in the aftermath of the  vote.Borrowing fell by ?20bn to ?52bn in the 2016-17 financial year after economic growth helped drive tax receipts higher, narrowing the gap between what the government spends and earns. It was the lowest level of annual borrowing since 2007-08, according to the Office for National Statistics, before the full impact of the financial crisis was reflected in the public finances. The lower deficit meant the chancellor, , essentially met his ?51.7bn target for borrowing in 2016-17, as outlined by the Treasury＊s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, at the time of the budget in March.Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said the lower deficit would be welcome news for Hammond.※This is helpful for the chancellor＊s and government＊s credibility, which is all the more welcome given the ,§ he said. ※Philip Hammond is clearly keen to keep fiscal ammunition up his sleeve 每 due to the major uncertainties and downside risks that the economy faces as it navigates its way out of the EU.§However, borrowing for the final month of the financial year was almost ?2bn more than expected at ?5.1bn. It was the highest borrowing in the month of March since 2015.The deficit has been falling since 2012-13, having peaked at almost ?152bn during the financial crisis in 2009-10. However, the OBR expects borrowing to rise again this year, to ?55.2bn, partly due to one-off factors but also because of .Hammond conceded last November , abandoning plans to run a surplus by the end of the decade.John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said the government would have to make difficult decisions on tax and spending.※It is good news that the deficit is coming down, but it is too soon to be complacent about the state of the public finances. In the longer term an ageing population and rising healthcare costs will also put pressure on the public finances,§ he said.※So while the deficit is now approaching a more sustainable level, there will still be some tough choices ahead on tax and spending for the next government.§Responding to the latest figures, the OBR cautioned that 2016-17 borrowing was likely to be revised over the coming months, because some of the data at this stage 每 such as cash VAT receipts 每 was based on forecasts and estimates. ※The figures typically take some months to settle down and revisions can be significant. In the six years since 2010-11, initial estimates of net borrowing have been revised down by an average of ?2.8bn over the subsequent 12 months,§ it said.In a separate report, the ONS said the richest fifth of UK households had an average income before tax and benefits of ?84,700 in the financial year ending 2016, compared with ?7,200 for the poorest. That was a ratio of 12 to one, down from 14 to one a year earlier following an increase in pay the poorest fifth.The ratio between the average income of the top and bottom fifth of households 每?63,300 and ?17,200 respectively 每 is reduced to less than four to one after accounting for benefits and taxes.However, the Equality Trust, which campaigns to reduce economic inequality, said its own analysis of the figures showed the richest 10% of households pay a smaller proportion of their income in tax than the poorest 10% of households.※When the super-rich are paying less in taxes than their cleaners, you know something has gone disastrously wrong with our broken, regressive tax system,§ said Wanda Wyporska, the executive director of the Equality Trust.※Time after time we see sensible reforms attacked and rejected in favour of tax cuts for billionaires. These do nothing for ordinary people struggling to keep a roof over their head.§"															
															
															
"onald Trump＊s comments about China during the US presidential campaign didn＊t exactly bolster high hopes for Sino-American relations once he was elected. Trump denounced China for ※§ and ※§. He repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency. The low point came last May, when Trump : ※We can＊t continue to allow China to rape our country. That＊s what they＊re doing. It＊s the greatest theft in the history of the world.§Given such inflammatory rhetoric, many people understandably felt considerable trepidation in the runup to Trump＊s summit with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at . It wasn＊t hard to imagine a refused handshake or the presentation of a bill for payment, like the one Trump  the visiting German chancellor, Angela Merkel, (a report denied by the White House).Instead, Trump treated Xi with considerable deference. One explanation is that he was preoccupied by the impending . Another is that it is easier to command Trump＊s respect when you have an aircraft carrier, 3,000 military planes, and 1.6 million ground troops.But the best explanation is surely that the US depends too heavily on , economically and politically, for even a president as diplomatically reckless as Trump to spark a conflict.Economically, the US and China are too closely interlinked through global supply chains to be able to cut ties. US companies not only compete with Chinese imports; they also rely heavily on them. Retailers such as Target and Walmart rely on Chinese imports to stock their shelves. Electronics companies such as Apple rely on workers in China to assemble their products. And the  that the US could easily source the same inputs from other countries is fanciful. Put simply, while Trump has repeatedly observed that China sells more to the US than the US sells to China, starting a trade war in an effort to correct this supposed imbalance would still cost American business very dearly.And if there is one constituency that Trump listens to consistently, it is business. Aggressive US trade sanctions against China would send equity prices plunging, alarming a US president who  by the level of the stock market. The 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff didn＊t cause the Great Crash, much less the Great Depression. But that tariff and the foreign retaliation it elicited , which was hardly helpful.Politically, too, the US cannot afford serious conflict with China, given the growing crisis on the Korean peninsula, which North Korean provocations and Trump＊s incautious reaction have brought to the fore. Posturing aside, Trump will be forced to recognise that . A surgical strike against North Korea＊s nuclear facilities would most probably not succeed, while a massive attack would provoke devastating retaliation against South Korea.The only  is tighter sanctions and political pressure to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. And the only party capable of tightening sanctions and applying effective political pressure is China, whose goodwill the US now regards as essential.Trump＊s about-face on China is of a piece with his ※recalibration§ on repealing Obamacare, reforming the tax code, organising a large-scale infrastructure-investment initiative, and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). In each case, his glib campaign slogans have run up against the hard reality of actually making policy.In all these areas, Trump is learning that he is hemmed in by the same constraints that led Barack Obama＊s administration to make the choices it did. As with Obama, the agent of change is turning out to be an agent of continuity.The US has some legitimate economic grievances against China 每 for example, over its treatment of American intellectual property and US beef and grain exports. But the appropriate venue for adjudicating such disputes is the World Trade Organisation. That is where Trump＊s administration, , is likely to end up.The Trump administration could yet label China a currency manipulator, rebuking it for keeping its exchange rate artificially low. It could do so either now or later in the year. But that accusation would be : the renminbi is now fairly valued, and China has actually been intervening to  the exchange rate, not weaken it further. Inside the Washington, DC beltway, however, facts are no longer what they once were. Singling out China for manipulation might still appeal to a president who values symbolism as much as Trump does.But little of consequence would follow. The US depends too much on Chinese cooperation to risk overly antagonising China＊s leaders. Labelling China a currency manipulator would be the economic policy equivalent of launching 59 cruise missiles at an isolated air base in Syria. It would be much sound and fury, signifying nothing."															
"It seems so obvious.  sets interest rates to hit the government＊s 2% inflation target. . Higher borrowing costs choke off inflationary pressure. Therefore interest rates should now be going up.In reality, it is a bit more complicated than that. The first thing the nine members of the Bank＊s monetary policy committee have to decide is whether the seen in the last couple of months is a temporary blip. It＊s quite clear it isn＊t. Food is going up, energy companies are raising their tariffs, retailers are passing on the higher costs of imports caused by a weaker pound.Last month＊s inflation figure was flattered by the timing of Easter, which led to a sharp fall in the annual cost of air fares. That one-off factor will be reversed in April. The question is not whether inflation will continue rising in 2017, but how high it will go. At least to 3% is the answer, perhaps a bit higher.The next thing for the MPC to consider is whether there is a risk of inflation becoming entrenched. That would happen if rising prices led to workers successfully negotiating higher wages to compensate them for the hit to living standards. There seems little sign that inflation will feed on itself, as it did in the 1970s.Paradoxical though it sounds, a combination of higher prices and stagnant wages is actually deflationary for the economy. That＊s because living standards come under downward pressure, leading to consumers tightening their belts and companies investing less. The Bank doesn＊t need to raise interest rates to bring down inflation. If it shows a bit of patience, inflation will come down of its own accord.That is provided there is not another downward lurch in sterling, because that would further raise the cost of imports and push the inflation rate closer to 4%. If the MPC sat tight under those circumstances, the financial markets might decide that the pound was a one-way bet and carry on selling.That would be the nightmare scenario for the Bank. Rising inflation would intensify the deflationary squeeze on living standards but make it nigh-on impossible to ignore the case for an interest-rate rise that would risk tipping the economy into outright recession.So what does the MPC do? Simple. Members of the committee make hawkish speeches in which they explain how serious they are about hitting the inflation target. A couple of them even vote for a rate rise, in the hope that the pretence of an early increase in borrowing costs supports the pound. Meanwhile, the MPC keeps its fingers crossed and hopes for the best.The impact of the financial crisis that began almost 10 years ago is well documented. Banks made reckless decisions and some of them nearly collapsed as a result. Lenders became risk-averse and stopped lending. The lack of credit stopped the economy in its tracks.The story of how RBS and HBOS teetered on the brink of disaster after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the autumn of 2008 is by now familiar. Less well explained is the link between the credit crunch and productivity recorded since the slump. Output per worker in the UK is around 15% lower than it would have been had the pre-crisis trend continued, and nobody really knows why.Maarten de Ridder, an economist at Cambridge University, thinks he has at least part of the solution to the productivity puzzle: companies that wanted to invest in research and development struggled to obtain funds from the stricken banks, resulting in a 32% fall in R&D investment in 2008-09, the years when the economy was in recession.Innovation takes time to bear fruit so de Ridder 每 每 compared sales in the US between 2011 and 2014 for firms that relied on the most credit-constrained banks and those that fared better during the financial crisis. He found that the most severely affected firms fell 12% behind those with the least exposure, with dramatic results for the wider economy. His results are even more relevant to Britain, where the post-crisis productivity slowdown has been even more pronounced. Had cash-starved UK firms been able to find the necessary finance, the economy would now be 5% bigger.Britain＊s R&D is, , on a gently rising trend so it may be firms that want funds for investment are now able to get them. But de Ridder says that in the event of another financial crisis the state should itself make credit available to ensure companies can carry on investing. That sounds eminently sensible."															
"Concerns about the Trump administration＊s ability to push through key reforms and deliver on a promised fiscal boost turned share markets across the Asia Pacific region into a sea of red on Wednesday.As investors dumped risky assets and rushed to safe havens such as gold and government bonds, the worries were amplified by a strongly worded editorial in the  published on Wednesday.The newspaper, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch＊s media empire, said the US president＊s unsubstantiated claims that he was bugged by his predecessor Barack Obama had undermined his credibility, a situation worsened by his failure to back down.※Yet the President clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle, rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims,§ the editorial said.The editorial board concluded: ※If he doesn＊t show more respect for the truth, most Americans may conclude he＊s a fake president.§Wall Street suffered its biggest fall for five months on Tuesday and the selling frenzy continued in Asia with Japan and Australia the biggest losers.The Nikkei was down nearly 2% while the ASX200 in Sydney fell 1.6%, its sharpest one day fall since the day of Trump＊s election in November, with the big banks and miners among the worst performers. The jitters looked set to continue into the UK and European session on Wednesday with futures trading pointing to a 0.7% fall in the FTSE100 when it opens.Investors view the Trump administration＊s struggles to push through its healthcare overhaul through congress as a bad omen for promised tax cuts.Ric Spooner of  said: ※Nervousness in international markets was driven by concerns over whether the US administration will be able to achieve the planned wind back of Obamacare and if not, what this means for its broader fiscal strategy.§With investor mood decidedly risk-averse, the Japanese yen scored some chunky gains against the US dollar, rising to a four-month high of 111.63. The greenback fell below a key level of 100 against a trade-weighted basket of its peers. Bonds gained with yields on two-year U.S. debt falling to 1.27% in overnight trades, retreating further from a 7-1/2 year high of 1.38% hit last Wednesday when the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates. Gold was on track to extend its overnight strong performance with the precious commodity perched comfortably at a two-week high of $1,248 per ounce. Commodities other than gold, however, have had a rough outing with copper and iron ore prices down by more than one percent each. Oil prices declined as concerns about new supply overshadowed the latest talk by OPEC that it was looking to extend output cuts."															
"rom the 1980s on, a dominant international approach has been taken towards the majority of the world＊s refugees. Concentrated in a small number of host countries, close to war zones, displaced people have been settled in what have become known as ※humanitarian silos§. Such places are usually remote, arid, dangerous and almost always have strict prohibitions on socio-economic activity. They are designed to deal only with the emergency phase of refugee intake, and yet the model has endured, leaving individuals and families stranded for years at a time.This strategy undermines autonomy and dignity. It also erodes human potential by focusing almost exclusively on people＊s vulnerabilities, rather than on rebuilding their lives. Inevitably, many of those directly affected by it become disillusioned and choose to move on, gravitating towards urban areas in the host nation or risking their lives crossing oceans to other countries.We need to rethink the humanitarian silo. What are the key rights that refugees are entitled to? The overarching right is to protection for the duration of the risk that they are fleeing. But since refuge typically lasts for years, this cannot be sufficient.  have a right to expect a pathway to autonomy. Another distinctive right of refugees is that of return, or integration elsewhere, depending upon the duration of the conflict. For conflicts that persist, integration into another society is necessary: people cannot be left in permanent limbo.But integration is not a simple solution. Rich countries are becoming less reliable as places for mass refuge. There has been a polarisation of politics. The right has become more rightwing, the left more leftwing and the centre ground has been decimated. In Europe, . Then there is Donald Trump as US president. Across the entire political spectrum, there has been a lurch towards nativism, and populist nationalism has become the common currency of democratic politics. Isolated terrorist attacks have repeatedly been used to repudiate the right to asylum in Europe.The challenge now is to consider ways to address alienation and fear. Politicians face the dilemma of how to reconcile democracy and refuge in ways that can take majoritarian politics with them. Opinion polls tell us that public concern about asylum is not about numbers; it is about a perceived loss of control.It makes sense to protect most refugees close to home. After all, nearly 90% of the world＊s refugees are in countries that neighbour their homeland 每 nations such as , Jordan, Turkey, , Kenya, Iran and Pakistan. However, countries that border war zones are often in need themselves, and ill-equipped to bear such responsibilities. A new, much more supportive approach to safe havens is urgently needed in order to address this imbalance.In principle, when refugees flee a crisis, they receive initial emergency assistance and are then offered a pathway to reintegration into normal life. In practice, however, the default long-term response to refugees has become to create an indefinite dependency on aid. The imagined needs of refugees have been reduced to two basics 每 food and shelter 每 and it has become assumed that the most viable way to provide such rights is through camps.It was not meant to be this way. Refugee-intake strategies were originally intended to promote access to autonomy, with particular focus on the right to work and freedom of movement. These rights are in the . But since the global shift towards encampment that began in the 1980s, these rights have not been implemented.With the option to shift long-term responsibility on to the international humanitarian aid system, host states have invariably restricted refugees＊ participation in labour markets. The denial of the right to work has had catastrophic consequences for many refugees, leading to a long-term erosion of skills and aspirations, and often exacerbating a sense of alienation and hopelessness. It has left refugees less able to contribute to their host states or to eventually rebuild their own societies, should they eventually return home. In , for instance, many of the 350,000 Somali refugees have been there since the early 1990s 每 and none have the right to work.If our duty is to restore the lives of displaced people to something as close to normality as possible, reestablishing their autonomy should be high on the agenda. One of the most important components of autonomy is the right to earn a living.Rarely have economists thought about refugees. The dominant assumption has been that they are are a humanitarian matter, and so studies have been led by lawyers and anthropologists. However, the truth is that refugees around the world lead complex and diverse economic lives. They are consumers, producers, buyers, sellers, borrowers, lenders and entrepreneurs. Faced with new markets, regulatory contexts and social networks, they are often highly innovative, coming up with creative ways to support themselves. A recent study commissioned by the Refugee Studies Centre in Oxford and conducted in Uganda 每 one of few nations that allows refugees to work 每 shows that they can make a contribution. In Kampala, the nation＊s capital, 21% of refugees run a business that employs at least one other person; of those they employ, 40% are citizens of the host country.Refugees bring diverse skills and talents; they usually represent a random sample of their home country＊s population. As people, rather than ※victims§, refugees are not economically different from anyone else. The only thing that makes the economic lives of refugees distinct from those of citizens or other migrants is the regulation that affects whether or not they can participate fully in the economy.In restrictive countries, refugees are often denied the right to own certain types of property, their contracts may not be enforced, and there may be restrictions on mobility and the right to work. These kinds of institutional differences create immense challenges for refugees but they do not extinguish economic life. On the contrary, they explain the emergence of particular forms of informal economic activity.Refugees and nationals frequently interact in ad hoc markets at the boundaries of camps and settlements. Illicit markets for goods, services, and labour spring up even when suppressed. SIM cards, handsets and World Food Programme food rations are bought and sold. Almost any item or service can still be procured if the price is right. There may be winners from these distortions, notably brokers and intermediaries. Certain forms of economic activity will thrive, including hawking and vending. Some refugees and even more nationals will accumulate capital in these highly regulated refugee situations.Preventing refugees from participating fully in the economy is inefficient. Even a miniature refugee-only economy, kept separate from the national economy around it, will inflict needless losses on both. This is because the scope for specialisation and exchange is reduced. These economic losses will be exacerbated by the effect heavy regulation has in suppressing normal and productive economic activity. By creating situations in which there are extreme differences in market power between those who control opportunities and desperate individuals who seek them, we are more likely to leave people open to exploitation.It makes economic sense to begin to break down arbitrary boundaries to refugees＊ economic participation. But, as it turns out, many of the barriers to achieving this are political.e need to change how we think about refugees＊ needs. How can we move from a focus on vulnerabilities towards recognising and building their capacities? Rather than seeing refugees as an inevitable burden, how can we find ways in which they can be a benefit? Instead of being viewed as just passive victims of humanitarian disaster, how might they be seen as potential agents of development?This requires a vision. There have been far too few good examples of refugees being given access to autonomy and jobs.  has pioneered de facto ※experiments§ in refugee policy that deviate markedly from the dominant norm of long-term humanitarian aid. has been profoundly affected by the Syrian refugee crisis. Its initial response to refugees was largely typical of host countries around the world; the government of Jordan faced severe policy constraints. But it is also a country whose refugee policies matter a great deal to the rest of the world: bordered by Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Israel, Jordan represents a rare island of stability within an insecure region. It has historically shown immense generosity towards refugees, welcoming and integrating Circassians, Armenians, Palestinians and Iraqis over several decades. The UNHCR estimates that Jordan currently hosts more than 600,000 Syrian refugees, although the government contests this figure and suggests it may be more than 1 million 每 this in a country whose own population is just 6.5 million.A minority of the refugees are in camps such as Zaatari, Azraq and Zarqa, within which they are effectively ※warehoused§, with limited economic autonomy and high levels of dependency on international assistance. By contrast, 83% of Jordan＊s refugees are in urban areas, with the highest number in the capital, Amman, and others in Irbid and Mafraq. They have voted with their feet: while urban refugees have access to higher levels of autonomy, they relinquish access to most forms of international assistance. Furthermore, while most subsist via the informal economy, few are able to access formal work permits, either because they are prohibitively expensive or because of the restrictive bureaucratic process.The international response is premised upon the same default logic that characterises the entire refugee regime. Donors write cheques to support humanitarian relief and host countries of first asylum are expected to provide the territory on which the refugees are hosted. Less than 3% of the total Syrian refugee population has received resettlement to countries outside the region. As with other neighbouring countries, this places a considerable strain on Jordan. When pushed to offer greater economic participation to refugees, Jordan has generally responded with two big concerns, relating to development and security.One concern relates to competition for economic resources. In particular, Jordanians are worried about competition for jobs, downward pressure on wages, upward pressure on house prices, and the depletion of natural resources such as water. Although recent studies show that Syrian refugees have had a negligible effect on Jordanian labour markets, there is still concern.The key concern, though, is national security. The large concentration of Syrians in cities creates a variety of anxieties, not least the problems that could arise with large numbers of young men with limited long-term economic opportunity. The perceived risk has increased as Syrian refugees deplete the savings and capital they brought with them. The timing of Jordan＊s decision  in September 2014, for example, coincided directly with a spike in Islamic State-related displacement from July 2014 onwards; ultimately, the fear of radicalisation and terrorist infiltration concerns the Jordanian government more than the labour-market implications do.The result is a policy characterised by stasis. Most Syrian refugees are in urban areas, but are forced to subsist in the informal economy while their children remain out of school. A minority are in camps and dependent on international aid. Tens of thousands more are trapped on the other side of the Jordan-Syria border in . Meanwhile, the international community is effectively stuck in a holding pattern, delivering aid while hoping the war in Syria will come to an end. It is hardly surprising that many young Syrians in the country see their only remaining routes to change as travelling onward to Europe or returning to Syria to fight.The policy challenge in Jordan, and around the world, is to address the development and security concerns of the host country while empowering refugees. There are no easy answers. But there may be a solution that can simultaneously benefit Jordan, enable refugees and enhance security in the region. It lies in a particular approach to job creation.ne finds pockets of extraordinary resilience and innovation among the Syrian refugee community in Jordan. In the Zaatari refugee camp, home to around 80,000 Syrians, there is no right to work and all economic activity is supposed to be highly regulated by the government. But creativity abounds. The bustling main market street known as the Shams-?lys谷es 每 a play on words that references the Paris shopping district and the historic name for  每 is lined with shops and small businesses. Despite strict access controls at the entrance to the camp, seemingly every product imaginable 每 from cosmetics to textiles to pharmaceuticals to pets 每 can be purchased here.Innovation is on display in other ways. All refugee households are given a caravan, usually made from an old shipping container, to live in. Yet many of these caravans are reconverted: they might be moved across the camp, become shops along the Shams-?lys谷es or converted into furniture. A black-market construction trade smuggles bricks and cement into the camp, enabling further upgrades and extensions. Across the camp, one finds endless illustrations of inventiveness and entrepreneurship: urban gardening, striking murals and community-led journalism, to name just a few.While some of this informal activity is tolerated, most is formally prohibited and selectively dismantled. The Jordanian police make occasional raids to shut down some forms of business, either because they have become too large, or for more vindictive reasons. Meanwhile, irrational contradictions pervade camp life: hundreds of Jordanian teachers are employed at great expense to teach Syrian children according to the Jordanian national curriculum, while hundreds of qualified Syrian teachers are left idle. The suppression and neglect of skills, talents and aspirations benefits nobody. What if instead refugees were allowed to join the labour market?Just a 15-minute drive from the Zaatari camp in Jordan, there is a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) 每 an area in which business and trade laws differ from the rest of the country, in order to attract trade, investment and job creation. It is called the King Hussein bin Talal Development Area (KHBTDA). The government has invested ?100m into connecting it to the national road network and economic grid. However, despite having a few factories, in 2015 it was operating well below capacity. It lacked two key things: workers and business investment. What might be the potential if refugees were allowed to work alongside Jordanian nationals in the economic zone? This might offer a way to simultaneously benefit refugees, contribute to Jordan＊s own national-development strategy, and incubate the post-conflict recovery in Syria.For a country such as Jordan, refugees arguably represent an opportunity for a transition to manufacturing. They are a potential source of labour. Syrians, for example, are often skilled and well educated, and share a language with Jordanians. Crucially, international recognition of a regional refugee crisis creates a potential opportunity for the government of Jordan to appeal for the relocation of a number of multinational corporations to Jordan, for reasons that partly connect to corporate social responsibility and partly to core business interests. The crisis also offers a basis on which the government could appeal to other governments 每 in, say, Europe or North America 每 to provide trade concessions that improve access to their markets.A range of external actors might support the creation of such economic zones for refugees. For example, EU trade concessions, which are conditional on providing refugees with the right to work, might be available to businesses operating within the designated areas. Syrian businesses no longer able to operate in Syria could be encouraged to relocate to such zones, assuming they were eventually able to return. Among these businesses are multinational corporations such as American Express, Sony Corporation and Caterpillar, as well as many Syrian companies.SEZs often have a bad reputation, being associated with exploitative, low-wage labour. But there is no reason why the model could not be adapted to ensure respect for human rights and ethical practice. The core of the idea would be to allow economic zoning that creates geographical spaces within which refugees receive access to a set of entitlements and capabilities. Crucially, the model should not function on the basis of any kind of coercion, but offer opportunities sufficiently concrete to attract refugees to work within and live close to these spaces. They should be premised upon possibilities that enhance refugee choice and autonomy.A key part of this model is that it would contribute to post-conflict reconstruction. Ideally, many of the businesses developed within such spaces would be footloose, enabling them to follow refugees back to Syria when the security situation allows, and thereby play a key role in political and economic transition. The model would not depend upon the end of insecurity within Syria, but could be based on the idea of working towards an eventual post-conflict reconstruction, rather than feeding into a narrative of ※local integration§. In that sense, it would be a model that works directly to enhance refugees＊ autonomy, to meet Jordan＊s concerns about national development and regional security, and to support rebuilding in the new Syria.hese initial ideas have since gained political traction, and have begun to be implemented. The trigger for international interest came during  in September 2015. His visit immediately followed an outpouring of public support for refugees after the image of a drowned three-year-old boy, , went viral after appearing on the front page of newspapers across Europe. It prompted the UK government to initiate a resettlement scheme for Syrian refugees, providing official transport direct from the haven countries so that they need not take their chances with the people-smugglers. While in Amman, Cameron had met King Abdullah, who suggested the idea to him.In January 2016 at Davos, the forum for global business, Queen Rania of Jordan acclimatised CEOs to the idea that corporate social responsibility to refugees did not mean diverting some profits into sending blankets; rather, it meant putting their core skills to use by integrating them into global supply chains. In the context of emerging business interest in solutions to the refugee crisis, a range of manufacturing company CEOs began to take notice. The formal launch of the pilot project came as part of the London conference on Syrian refugees on 4 February 2016. The basic deal on the table 每 called the Jordan Compact 每 was that Jordan would receive around $2bn (?1.6bn) in assistance and investment. In exchange, it would offer up to 200,000 work permits to Syrians. One of the main vehicles for this would be through a series of five new SEZs, in which refugees would be employed alongside Jordanian nationals, partly building upon existing development areas.Over the next few months, the governments of Jordan and the UK, together with the World Bank, led the negotiation of a partnership to flesh out the details of the Jordan Compact and to carry the pilot forward. The UK has provided convening power and funding. The World Bank has offered concessional loan-based finance. But the most crucial component has been the unprecedented commitment of the European Union to providing trade concessions for particular products exported from the SEZs. In particular, it agreed that concessions would be initially offered in the garment sector, an industry in which many Syrians specialised in places that have come under relentless bombardment, such as Homs.The deal represents a new kind of partnership: one that involves governments and businesses working together; one that cuts across old silos and situates solutions for refugees at the intersection between development, trade and security. Crucially, it is built upon a recognition that if areas of mutual gain can be identified, hosting refugees can become an opportunity rather than just an inevitable cost. European governments want to address a migration crisis; Jordan wants to make the leap to manufacturing and manage a security nightmare; business is seeking a new investment opportunity, while also trying to restore respect for modern capitalism; refugees want to work; and just about everyone has a stake in the long-term future of Syria. By linking these concerns, the approach offers scope for everyone to benefit, and so provides a more realistic possibility of moving the needle for refugees than the past model of pious exhortation ever did.lobalisation can be a menacing and disruptive force, but it can also be a powerful one for good. At its best, it brings earning opportunities to people in places where previously they were largely absent. Refugees, separated from their prior livelihoods and often clinging to the lowest rung of the economic ladder in their host societies, need this power of globalisation more than any other group.But how feasible in practice is it to bring global opportunities to Syrian refugees? In the context of Angela Merkel＊s famous ※wir schaffen das§ speech, Germany received far more Syrian refugees than any other country in Europe. Superficially, the half a million Syrians who have moved to Germany would appear to be in the best position. But to date this has not been so, according to the German Federal Employment Agency, which reports a less than 10% employment rate for the new arrivals. It is hoped that this will change over time, but the employment record for Syrian refugees in Germany so far is undoubtedly unimpressive. This outcome is not surprising, given that Germany＊s distinctive place in global production is entirely ill-suited to refugees from a poor country.Production for global markets in Germany has specialised in highly skilled tasks that require years of training. The German system of training, envied around the world, integrates the last years of schooling with the early years of employment. Refugees cannot readily be parachuted into this system. Further, reflecting the high average level of skill, Germany＊s minimum wage is far, far higher than wages in Syria, which reflected average levels of productivity of Syrian workers: per capita incomes in Germany are around 20 times higher than those in pre-conflict Syria. Consequently, inserting Syrian refugees based in Germany into the global economy is going to be difficult. They are more likely to end up in domestic-service positions created for them in the public sector, such as the post office. Even here they face difficulties: a refugee who applied for a job cleaning toilets was ultimately rejected by the local Bureau of Employment on the grounds that ※a native-born German could do the same job§. By that criterion, many of the refugees invited to Germany will continue to languish in unemployment.Connecting the refugees in the regional haven countries is likely to be easier. Paradoxically, German firms may find it easier to generate jobs for refugees in the regional havens than to integrate them into their German-based activity. This is because German firms have pioneered modern globalisation. The world＊s top authority on this recent form of globalisation is economist Richard Baldwin. As he explains, since the 1990s globalisation has not been about shifting production to China; it has been about relocating some tasks that are still done within the same firm to cheaper sites. These sites cannot be thousands of miles from the main factory, because production on both sites must be controlled as an integrated process. For example, managers must be able to fly between them in a day. It is not only distance that matters: if the ※foetus§ factory is to be linked by an umbilical cord to the parent factory, there must be no regulatory impediments.Trade barriers between the country of the parent and the country of the foetus would be a killer. In the 1990s, the preferred sites for German manufacturing firms were in Poland: very close and much cheaper than Germany, and a member of the EU and so barrier-free. German firms are not alone in this 每 the same model has been developed by US and Japanese firms 每 but they are Europe＊s leading practitioners. US firms have some tasks undertaken in Mexico, while Japanese firms offshore some work to China.But, as in China itself, as German production shifted to Poland, wages rose and so firms started to look a little further afield. During the past decade, the preferred location has been Turkey. Turkey is further away than Poland, but still the ※near offshore§: if refugees can walk it, German managers can certainly fly it. And although Turkey is not in the EU, it has privileged status for trade purposes. The EU lets goods produced in Turkey enter duty-free. Turkey has indeed been growing explosively as a result of breaking into global markets for manufacturing. To give an example, within the last decade a nowhere town in central Turkey, not even on the coast, has developed into the dominant global centre of production for synthetic carpets.If German firms can offshore to Turkey, in principle they can do so in all three haven countries. Turkey＊s big advantage was its privileged market access to Europe. Both Turkey and Jordan have many industrial zones in which refugees could potentially work alongside nationals. This, of course, requires that the governments of the haven countries permit refugees to work in the zones. The international deal to which the government of Jordan agreed at the London conference in February 2016 included a commitment by the Jordanian government to provide work permits for refugees in return for new jobs being created in the zones: hence the vital role that international business can play in bringing dignity to refugees＊ lives. The government of Jordan committed to 50,000 work permits in the following 12 months. It is on track to achieve this target, with more than 30,000 permits so far allocated, but the critical question is whether international business will generate enough jobs.It might seem as though setting up production in a haven country industrial zone would require years of preparation. But global business does not work to such a glacial timescale. In Mexico, one US firm succeeded in going from zero to production in six weeks. Even the relocation of footwear production from China to Ethiopia took only a few months. A lot can happen in a year if CEOs take the issue seriously.Nor does the generation of jobs for refugees depend entirely, or even primarily, on manufacturing firms opening new factories in the havens. All the main haven countries for Syrians are already middle-income economies, with many firms, international and domestic, producing goods that can be supplied to global marketing chains. The key companies might not be those engaged in global production, but in global retailing. For example, Asda investigated the scope for routing some of its orders to the zones in the havens, in return for commitments by suppliers to hire refugees. It found that this was feasible: now some of the products that British consumers are buying in their local Asda stores have been made by refugees.Globalisation can work for Syrian refugees, but can it work at the required scale? The jobs created by foreign firms 每 both those that establish new production units and those that buy from firms already in the havens 每 generate other jobs: there is a multiplier. The incomes earned by these new workers get spent on services and food produced domestically.International business can make a real difference to the life chances of refugees, but governments can make a decisive difference by catalysing the process. Following the London conference, David Cameron brought a whole-government approach to making it happen. He appointed a special envoy, Patricia Morris, to bring in the private sector, and Britain＊s business secretary, Sajid Javid, flew with a group of CEOs to Jordan. That is how the Asda commitment came about. Other European leaders were too preoccupied with either trying to offload thousands of invited refugees to their neighbours, or resisting European Commission directives ordering them to do so, to focus on generating jobs for the millions of refugees remaining in the havens.Every approach should involve promoting empowerment through the right to work, the role of public-private partnership, and the recognition that refugees need to be understood as much in terms of development and trade as humanitarianism, and that deals should be based on the principle of mutual gain.While the Jordanian SEZ pilot focuses on a middle-income country aspiring to increase its manufacturing base, the basic logic of ※development areas§ 每 whether based on integration or incubation 每 could also be applied to countries that are seeking to build different economic sectors. Depending on whether one is seeking to promote economic participation in manufacturing, agricultural or information economies, the model and partnerships required for success will vary.Refugee protection is not the same as immigration. Its purpose is to provide people with their full set of rights until they are able to go home or be integrated elsewhere. Nevertheless, with creativity this can be done in ways that promote human flourishing and simultaneously benefit host countries by supporting their development strategies, particularly within underdeveloped border areas. But the potential of this new approach extends beyond refuge. It can be made to serve another purpose, too: helping to restore stability to countries such as Syria once the conflicts are over.

"Brexiters in the cabinet and other Conservative frontbenchers have privately told colleagues they are relaxed about the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU on to World Trade Organisation rules, the Guardian understands.Senior figures within the party have been persuaded by the argument that members of the WTO are less likely to try to punish the UK, while the  is looking to exact a political price for Brexit.They now want to convince others that they should embrace the idea. ※People are being told that  rules would be the end of the world. We need to explain to them why it isn＊t,§ said a senior government source. The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has also suggested the outcome would be ※perfectly OK§.But with opponents within the Conservative party who previously supported remaining in the EU branding the stance as ※ideological baloney§, and even cabinet ministers expressing concerns, the issue looks set to be one of the most divisive facing Theresa May during the EU negotiations.The tensions over the future trading relationship come as it was revealed that the EU would not hold its first  summit until 29 April, a month after Theresa May triggers article 50 next week.Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, announced that he would call a summit on the last Saturday in April to allow the EU＊s 27 remaining members to agree on Brexit guidelines, a broad-brush outline of the political principles that will guide them through the next two years of negotiations.May told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the triggering of article 50 would be a ※historic event and will precipitate a shift in our role in the world and see Britain begin a bold new chapter as a prosperous, open and global nation§.The issue of the future trading relationship is causing tensions behind the scenes, with some ministers said to be almost banging the drum for no deal.A briefing by a senior WTO official in Westminster stressed that the Geneva-based organisation offered a different tone to Brussels, with ※no undercurrent of tension [and it is] more pragmatic and commercial§. They claimed WTO rules would only pose challenges at the margins, and there need not be a ※cliff edge [or] drama§.The former cabinet member and Brexit supporter, Theresa Villiers, told the Guardian that it was in the best interests of the EU and the UK to secure a trade deal before the end of negotiations, but admitted it was not guaranteed. ※If it isn＊t possible, WTO rules would still allow us to do billions of pounds of business in goods and services with the EU,§ she said, arguing the option was ※by no means disastrous§.But a source close to a cabinet minister disagreed, saying a number of senior figures were still warning of the impact of not having a deal. Others revealed that senior civil servants were still trying to persuade their political masters to keep open the prospect of a transitional deal, with some suggesting it could take five years after the 2019 Brexit date for a final trade deal to be hammered out.Some Tory MPs believe that now the Brexit bill has become law, they face a major battle in preventing the government from caving into Eurosceptic backbenchers＊ demands to walk away from the negotiating table without a deal.They are alarmed that the idea of diverting to WTO trading terms is becoming widely talked about, and fear it is the preferred option for hardened Eurosceptics.Bath MP Ben Howlett said: ※Anyone that suggests that WTO would be a good thing is bonkers. This ideological baloney has to stop before we face an absolute disaster.§Anna Soubry added: ※There is nothing to be blase or relaxed about choosing for Britain to trade with our biggest economic partner under WTO rules. Every credible assessment done says this would be the worst trading arrangement possible for jobs, investment and growth.§In the run-up to the referendum, Treasury research suggested reverting to WTO rules would knock between 5.4% and 9.5% off GDP after 15 years, and blow a ?45bn hole in the public finances 〞 though the basis of those forecasts was fiercely contested.※Relying solely on the WTO rules would result in a significant reduction in the openness of the UK economy to the outside world,§ it said. ※It would be the alternative with the most negative long-term impact.§But the campaign group Economists for Free Trade, which was known as Economists for Brexit during the referendum campaign, has been making the intellectual case for leaving the EU without a trade deal in place.Labour＊s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said the issue was likely to define the ※ideological split§ between the most ardent Brexiters and others. He said that the most vociferous out campaigners wanted a deregulated economy, without the EU＊s social protections or rights.※Under this view, not having a full collaborative and co-operative relationship with social  is a positive, not a risk,§ he said.The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, argued that WTO rules would be like ※Britain falling into the abyss. But ministers, frankly, don＊t seem to care.§It comes as David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is due to appear before a Lords EU committee. Its chair, Lord Boswell, said that most people believed a reversion to WTO rules would have a significant impact. He said his committee would push Davis on the process after article 50 is triggered. ※We are interested in the nuts and bolts of the process, indications of the timescale, any indications of how that might work and interest in flow of information,§ he said, insisting that parliament wanted to play a ※constructive part rather than requiring a running commentary or micromanaging§.

"Rising food and fuel prices pushed Britain＊s inflation rate to 2.3% last month, the highest rate for more than three years. was well above the 2.1% expected in a Reuters poll of economists, as grocery bills started rising after years of food getting cheaper.The bigger-than-expected rise will intensify fears over people＊s living standards being squeezed this year by higher living costs. While inflation has been going up, , leaving households worse off.The TUC said working people were facing the double blow of rising prices and slower wage growth. ※If the government doesn＊t wake up, we risk sleepwalking into another living standards crisis,§ said the  general secretary, Frances O＊Grady.※We urgently need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better-paid jobs. And it＊s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting hardworking teachers, nurses and other public servants.§The jump from 1.8% inflation in January to 2.3% in February took inflation above the Bank of England＊s 2% target and immediately raised expectations on financial markets that the Bank could raise interest rates sooner than previously thought to keep price rises in check.The pound strengthened against the dollar to hit a three-week high of $1.2462 after the  were released.Investors highlighted the significant pick-up in so-called core inflation, which excludes volatile prices such as food and fuel. That measure jumped to 2% in February from 1.6% in January and was well above forecasts of 1.8%. The  said the main upward effect on inflation came from motor fuels as prices rose by 1.2% between January and February, reflecting recent increases in global oil prices as well as the pound＊s weakness since last June＊s referendum. The weaker pound makes imports to the UK, including oil, more expensive.The currency effect on inflation, combined with a rise in global oil prices, has brought a rude awakening for UK consumers, who had enjoyed near-zero inflation throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016. A number of companies, including food firms and the tech giant Apple, have announced price rises on the back of the weaker pound, which tumbled to three-decade lows after the  vote.Reflecting those moves, the ONS said another factor in February＊s stronger inflation 每 the highest rate since September 2013 每 was pricier laptops and tablets. They increased by 2.3% between January and February, having fallen by 5.1% a year ago. Food prices rose in annual terms for the first time in more than two-and-a-half years with a wide range of items contributing to the pick-up. There were particularly large price rises for certain vegetables, consistent with reports of poor growing conditions in southern Europe, the ONS said. For example, the price of an iceberg lettuce increased by 67.2% between January and February.The Treasury said the government understood the financial pressures on households.※The government appreciates that families are concerned about the cost of living, and that is why we are cutting tax for millions of working people, increasing the national living wage to ?7.50 per hour from next month, and freezing fuel duty for the seventh year in a row,§ a spokeswoman said.Economists expect inflation to rise further over coming months as the effects of the weak pound and  continue to be felt. Some see inflation rising to 3% by the summer.The Bank＊s monetary policy committee (MPC), under the governor Mark Carney, has said it is happy to let inflation rise some way above its target as it balances the need to support growth and jobs with keeping price rises in check. But the minutes of its meeting last week suggested  from their current record low of 0.25%.Kallum Pickering, an economist at the bank Berenberg, said the MPC＊s tolerance for rising inflation could be tested soon.※As our base case, we look for a 25 basis point first rate hike in the second quarter of 2018, with a 30% chance the BoE raises the bank rate earlier. After today＊s data release, risks to that call are skewed towards the BoE hiking sooner rather than later,§ he said.But James Smith, economist at the bank ING, said the squeeze on real incomes and the likely slowdown in consumer spending would deter the Bank from raising rates. ※Whilst this surge in inflation may raise a few eyebrows on the MPC, it＊s what this means for consumers that really counts,§ he said. ※We suspect that concerns about surging inflation will be gradually outweighed by the slower growth backdrop. We don＊t expect any change in Bank rate before the end of 2018.§The ONS also published  on Tuesday, showing chancellor Philip Hammond remained on track to cut the deficit this financial year. Strong tax receipts helped cut public sector net borrowing to ?1.8bn in February 2017, down by ?2.8bn from February 2016. It was the lowest February borrowing since 2007. With one month left to go, borrowing for the financial year so far was ?47.8bn. The fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecasts a?51.7bn deficit for the whole financial year compared with the previous year＊s ?72bn."															
"Robust consumer spending and a brighter outlook for trade and investment will mean the UK＊s economic slowdown this year is less severe than previously feared, the British Chambers of Commerce has predicted.But in its latest set of economic forecasts, published as the UK prepares to embark on Brexit negotiations, the business group cut its outlook for 2018 and warned higher inflation would take a chunk out of household budgets.The BCC joined other bodies in raising its outlook for the UK＊s GDP growth this year after a stronger-than-expected close to 2016 and signs of resilience to the Brexit vote among businesses and consumers. But it remains more pessimistic than other forecasters such as the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund.The BCC is now forecasting that after expanding 1.8% in 2016, the UK economy will grow 1.4% in 2017. That is faster than its forecast made in December for 1.1% growth this year. It said the upgrade reflected a strong finish to 2016 for UK growth, higher than expected levels of consumer spending and a slight improvement in the outlook for investment and trade.But the group nudged down its expectations for 2018 from 1.4% to 1.3%, and published its first forecast for 2019 for 1.5% growth. It noted that if growth panned out as forecast it would be well below the long-term average.※Thanks to the hard work of businesses and the continued resilience of the redoubtable British consumer, the UK economy is likely to grow somewhat more strongly than we＊d previously expected during 2017,§ said BCC director general Adam Marshall.※Yet with several years of unspectacular growth ahead, coupled with inflationary pressures and the uncertain outcome of Brexit negotiations, it has never been more important to tackle the longstanding constraints that limit business confidence and growth here at home.§He described  as a ※missed opportunity§ for the government to do more on infrastructure improvements, on support for international trade, and to lower upfront taxes and costs on businesses.※More thoughtful and radical moves to improve the business environment would give businesses 每 and GDP forecasts 每 a boost during a critical and complex time,§ said Marshall.A number of forecasters have raised their outlook UK growth for this year, notably:The BCC＊s outlook chimed with warnings from thinktanks and anti-poverty campaigners that  as it makes imports to the UK more expensive.The BCC expects inflation will rise from  to above the Bank of England＊s 2% target early this year. It predicts inflation over 2017 will be 2.4%, rising to 2.7% in 2018. That is higher than the previous forecast of 2.1% and 2.4%, respectively.Suren Thiru, the BCC＊s head of economics said those price pressures, coupled with lacklustre pay growth, would weigh on the UK＊s economic growth.※The resilience in consumer spending, a key driver of UK growth, will slowly dissipate over the coming months as higher inflation and muted wage growth combine to erode consumer spending power,§ said Thiru.The upside to the weak pound for the economy would be some support for exports, he added. Sterling＊s sharp depreciation since the referendum has helped make UK goods cheaper in overseas markets and there has been some evidence that exports have picked up as a result.But trade was a smaller contributor to the UK economy than consumer spending, Thiru noted, and so the pound effect on exports would have a limited impact on headline growth.A separate report into the UK＊s jobs market was similarly cautious about the economic outlook. Recruitment agency ManpowerGroup said business hiring had dropped to its weakest level for three years.Its survey, based on responses from 2,119 UK employers, found hiring confidence had fallen sharply in London and Scotland, the two strongest remain-supporting regions of the UK. Manpower＊s overall net employment outlook, covering the private and public sectors, dropped to +5% from +7% three months ago, showing there were still slightly more employers who planned to hire staff than cut them.Mark Cahill, ManpowerGroup UK managing director, said: ※The impending trigger of article 50 is clearly affecting confidence in the job market.※The employment rate is at its highest level since records began in 1971, but if you lift the bonnet to look at the engine of the economy, job creation has slowed and employers are becoming more cautious. The companies which have powered Britain＊s economy through the immediate post-referendum period are easing off the gas.§"															
															
"n recent decades the world economy and society have been changing at an unprecedented rate. According to Unesco, the total number of qualified scientists and engineers undertaking research has soared to about 10 million, of which a fifth are in China. Technical inventions have emerged ever faster, providing us with new gadgets and machines, along with new ways of engaging with one another and organising the institutions within which we live.This has brought us great benefits, but it has also brought dangers and damage: weapons of mass destruction, global warming, the economic bubble and collapse caused by new financial tricks, global tax evasion and tax avoidance, high-tech monopolies, and the diffusion of powers of information and misinformation resulting from new means of communication.To navigate these new conditions we need to be on the watch for innovations, technological and non-technological, and to analyse their probable consequences. We need to adopt a Darwinian vision of a restless, evolving economy and society that is shaped by competitive selection of successful innovations from the many that fail.We need to put aside the long-established Newtonian vision of a harmonious economy with negligible innovations in which demand and supply tend to maintain equilibrium in markets and the whole economy. That vision of the capitalist system was plausible when it was expounded, in words, not algebra, by Alfred Marshall more than a hundred years ago. But it does not bear scrutiny today.Since the crash of 2008, economists have tended tacitly to abandon the Newtonian model and turn to empirical studies. But these have concentrated on economic phenomena that can be measured in statistics among which links may be sought. The many unmeasurable aspects of social and economic phenomena have been largely ignored; and it has been assumed that if an association is discovered it will continue into the future.The adoption of the Darwinian approach would liberate economists from this myopia. It would mean that the subject of study was social evolution and all its causes, measurable and unmeasurable. Political economy would be revived as a rounded subject of inquiry, informed by understanding of the world and history, as it was for its founder, Adam Smith. It would not promise a distant Utopia, as Newtonian economics and Marxism have done in their different ways. Instead it would invite study of what is happening and the possible responses to it, as a prelude to politico-moral debate by all-comers.Here are three disparate examples of actual or potential benefits of the approach: In my book, Public Corruption: The Dark Side of Social Evolution, I asked, ※Why was corruption cleaned up in northern Europe in the late 18th and 19th centuries?§If rulers gained and held power by corrupt means, for them to abolish corruption would have been political suicide. I found an evolutionary explanation in military-cum-economic competition: when the development of firearms gave advantage to costly, trained, standing armies, states that could raise tax and spend it on their army with least corruption (for example, the highly militarised Prussia as it expanded to become Germany), were at an advantage and expanded 每 or induced their neighbours to clean up in competition with them 每 a process that no longer operates since arms have become cheap relative to national income. Before the financial crisis of 2008, economic forecasters, using models that projected past statistical relationships into the future, kept predicting that the boom would continue. They failed to see that it was being fed by a growing mountain of lending based on new financial tricks that were unsustainable. Had they been Darwinians, looking out for dangerous innovations and working closely with the bank regulators, the crisis and subsequent depression might never have occurred. Economists are so steeped in the assumption that human beings are ※rational§ 每 meaning they make choices only by pleasure-pain calculus 每 that when confronted by evidence that that is not so, they commonly speak of ※deviations from rationality§. They have ignored that our behaviour is governed by primal instincts as well as reason, and that denial of instincts has blinkered their understanding of incentives to work and other aspects of economic behaviour. A Darwinian would look at behaviour in the round as the product of past genetic and social evolution and current innovations.In short, the adoption of Darwinism would be a return to reality, and morality."															
"A plague on both your houses. That, put simply, is the considered view of the on the tax and spending pledges made by the Conservative and Labour parties in their election manifestos.There was, the IFS noted, a real choice for voters on 8 June, marking quite a change from recent elections. But it was a choice between the undeliverable on the part of the Tories and the unworkable from Labour. Even by the IFS＊s exacting standards, it was a .Theresa May＊s pitch to the public is more of the same. More austerity, more welfare cuts and a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade 每 10 years later than originally planned.If the idea behind providing few costed pledges in the was designed to provide the IFS with less to attack, the strategy didn＊t work. The thinktank says May＊s spending plans will put real pressure on public services, and in particular extend to 12 years what is comfortably the most severe squeeze on the NHS since it was founded in 1948.At a time when demographic and technological change is pushing up the cost of providing healthcare, the IFS says the average increase in the NHS budget between 2010 每 when David Cameron became prime minister 每 and 2022-23 will be 1.4% a year on average, and just 1.2% a year from 2016-17 onwards. Hence the IFS＊s concern that the Conservative plans are not deliverable.  is planning to be more generous, but not by much. Over the past 60 years, the NHS budget has increased in real (inflation-adjusted) terms by 4.1% a year. Labour＊s proposed increase would be half that.The IFS gives the prime minister half a cheer for making an attempt to get to grip with the cost of an ageing population. But it notes that the scrapping of the triple lock on the state pension and the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance would make a trivial difference to spending. As for social care, the IFS＊s deputy director, Carl Emmerson, said that they seemed to be in ※a state of flux§ following this week＊s U-turn on capping costs. A state of flux is IFS-speak for complete shambles.Labour lost its hard-won economic credibility by virtue of being in power during the global financial crisis and has struggled to get it back.  Infrastructure spending would rise by ?250bn over the next 10 years funded by higher borrowing.The IFS doesn＊t have that much of a problem with borrowing for public investment when interest rates are historically low, noting that it could boost growth in the short- and the long-term if used wisely.The same, though, can＊t be said of the plans for day-to-day spending, where the thinktank is clear that the plan for paying for an expansion in state activity ※would not work§.Labour＊s tax proposals would raise at most ?40bn a year, the IFS said, and probably less than that. The thinktank says the party＊s ?49bn tax calculation involves factual mistakes, optimistic assumptions and unspecified tax increases.The plans would see the size of the state increase to a level not seen in 30 years, the IFS said. This, in itself, would not be an issue, since it would bring Britain into line with many other advanced economies. The issue is how to pay for it. ※If [Labour] want the advantages of a bigger state they should be willing to candidly set out the consequences 每 higher taxation affecting broad segments of the population.§Indeed, this is the gripe the IFS has with both parties. The Tories would shrink the state; Labour would expand it. If the opinion polls are to be believed, Labour＊s ※soak the rich§ approach has gone down rather better than ※more of the same§ from the . But neither, according to the IFS, is being entirely straight with the public about how their quite different visions would be realised. "															
"The  turned in the weakest performance in three years in the January-March quarter as consumers sharply slowed their spending. The result repeats a pattern that has characterized the recovery: lacklustre beginnings to the year.The Commerce Department says the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services, grew by just 0.7% in the first quarter following a gain of 2.1% in the fourth quarter.The slowdown primarily reflected slower consumer spending, which grew by just 0.3% after a 3.5% gain in the fourth quarter. It was the poorest showing in more than seven years. Analysts blame in part the unusually warm winter, which meant less spending on utility bills.Economists believe the slowdown will be temporary. They forecast GDP growth will rebound to 3% or better in the current quarter.Averaging the two quarters, they forecast growth of around 2% for the first half of this year. That would be in line with the mediocre performance of the eight-year economic expansion, when growth has averaged just 2.1%, the poorest showing for any recovery in the post-war period.Donald Trump repeatedly attacked the weak GDP rates during the campaign as an example of the Obama administration＊s failed economic policies. He said his program of tax cuts for individuals and businesses, deregulation and tougher enforcement of trade agreements would double growth to 4% or better.※There are a lot of tailwinds behind consumers going into the spring, including low unemployment, better wage growth, high consumer confidence and record stock prices,§ said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody＊s Analytics."															
"onald Trump＊s administration says it is sticking with its campaign promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Indeed, Trump has now reiterated his intention to invoke the procedures for renegotiating Nafta soon (within ※the next two weeks§), triggering a 90-day consultation period with Congress, before talks with  and Canada commence. Assuming that happens 每 a very big if 每 it is worth asking how renegotiation could be done right.Of course, the US president could simply decide to abandon his , which may be unpopular with many Americans, but is considered by  to have been beneficial. After all, he has dropped many other campaign pledges, including () his oft-repeated vow to label China a currency manipulator ※on day one§ of his administration.Another possibility would be for Trump to attempt to bully Mexico 每 the main target of his renegotiation plans 每 by, say, raising tariffs, in violation of Nafta and World Trade Organisation rules. In that case, it would be up to Mexico to respond. And Mexico does have some options. For example, it could raise tariffs to its old high ※bound rates§, buying more corn from Brazil and Argentina and less from US farmers.Moreover, trade is not the only area where Mexico could retaliate. It could permit Central American migrants to pass through Mexican territory to the US border, rather than impeding them, as it currently does. It could curtail cooperation with US law-enforcement authorities in areas such as drug crime. Most worrying, the Mexican people could respond to US provocation by electing their own nationalist president, Andr谷s Manuel L車pez Obrador, in 2018.But let us take at face value, if only for the sake of argument, that the  wants to renegotiate Nafta in good faith. In that case, Mexico＊s leaders say, ※OK, let＊s get on with it.§ In fact, the 23-year-old agreement could be improved in various ways.For starters, Nafta could be expanded to cover issues that did not exist when it was originally negotiated, such as e-commerce and data localisation. Protections for labour could be improved as well, by guaranteeing workers＊ right to form independent unions, banning child labour, and strengthening enforcement against human traffickers.Likewise, negotiators could boost environmental protections, such as measures to safeguard the oceans and provisions for enforcing bans on illegal logging and trade in endangered species. These additional protections could be backed up by a dispute-settlement process and threats of trade penalties that are as credible as those underpinning the resolution of ordinary mercantile disputes.There is also room for increased protection against corporate abuse of the investor-state dispute-settlement procedure. For example, negotiators could add provisions for the summary dismissal of frivolous suits, such as challenges by multinational corporations to a new regulation on the grounds that it will diminish their ability to earn profits.Finally, Nafta could be expanded to include more countries. The addition of some in South America, such as Peru and Chile, and others in Asia and the Pacific, would constitute a broader multilateral approach that could bring significant benefits. Though the Trump administration has expressed a preference for bilateral trade deals, it is easier to conclude mutually beneficial deals when more countries are involved.For example, US dairy producers want Canada to reduce import barriers for their products, but Canada wants Japan to remove barriers to its pork, beef, and wood products more than it wants anything from the US. So the best way for the US to get what it wants from Canada could be to bring Japan into the mix. Including Japan and other Asian and Latin American countries is more likely to satisfy the main requirement of an effective trade agreement: that each member clearly sees the export opportunities to be gained.Bringing more countries into Nafta could be beneficial in another way, by making it easier for firms to deal with the  that govern various US trade agreements. Rules of origin are meant to prevent products that are assembled in a signatory country but that derive much of their value added elsewhere from receiving duty-free treatment.The rules are currently so onerous that some US importers reportedly choose simply to dispense with the benefits of Nafta 每 and the accompanying paperwork 每 and instead to pay the low normal tariff imposed on non-Nafta products. Yet the White House adviser, Peter Navarro, wants to make the rules of origin even more demanding, by raising the share of local content required for a product to qualify for zero tariffs. He believes that this would raise the local value-added in North American trade. But a likely result is that more importing firms would dispense with Nafta＊s benefits and simply default to the normal US tariff rate, which  just 3.5%.Is renegotiating Nafta to cover new issues, strengthen labour and environmental protections, improve dispute-settlement mechanisms, and include more countries all pie in the sky? Would it be impossibly difficult to negotiate a new agreement that had every one of these desirable properties? Well, trade  already hammered out precisely such an . It was called the , which . In truth, the best way to improve Nafta would be to return to what was agreed to in the TPP."															
"There are two big themes which stand out from this month＊s data, and they show the UK being pulled in opposite directions by the global economy and consumer spending.On the global front, there has continued to be good news. The three main engines of the world economy 每 North America, Europe and Asia 每 continue to be supportive of growth. The IMF is forecasting  in 2017-18 since 2011-12. This is backed up by one of my favourite economic indicators 每 international air travel. , followed by 8.6% in February 每 once account is taken of the leap year in 2016. These are strong figures by historical standards 每 compared with trend growth of 5-6%.This positive picture from the global economy is backed up by the , which shows a very strong picture for exports. The UK is a very international economy and so these positive global trends will be supportive of growth.However, on the consumer side of the economy, the indicators point in the opposite direction.  (compared to the previous quarter). That is the second biggest quarterly fall reported since the mid-1990s. The underlying drivers of consumer spending also look soft.  as both labour demand and supply weakened. There has been a significant drop in the number of EU workers in the UK and the number of over-65s at work has also fallen. Meanwhile, . Inflation has caught up with wage growth and will probably overtake it in the months ahead. So both of the main components which add to rising consumer purchasing power in the UK 每 employment and real wages 每 are slowing sharply.The  backs up this picture of a slowing consumer economy. VAT receipts in the first quarter of this year were 1% down in money terms on a year ago. UK consumers contribute twice as much to the demand for goods and services in our economy than exports. So we should expect the consumer slowdown to dominate the growth picture over the course of this year. But strong export performance will be a significant offsetting factor, as long as the world economy remains resilient.The GDP growth figures for the first quarter released at the end of this week are likely to confirm that the UK economy is already slowing. After a quarterly rise of 0.7% in the final three months of last year, I would expect growth of 0.3-0.4% in the first quarter. Not a disaster, but a very marked slowdown.The first stage vote in the French presidential election gave us a sense of the size of the impact on the markets of a Brexit vote in reverse. Markets had largely expected the globalist Emmanuel Macron and the far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen would be , but the results were not fully priced in. In response to the news, the French stock market, the CAC index,  with the banks Soci谷t谷 G谷n谷rale, Cr谷dit Agricole and BNP Paribas among the biggest risers. Peugeot the car maker was also up sharply. The FTSE 100 was up and so was the German Dax. The markets would inevitably have been down a lot if the next round had been Le Pen and the far-left candidate Jean-Luc M谷lenchon. This is an indicator of the scale of what could happen in UK markets if there is a disorderly Brexit disaster. It would likely result in a cataclysmic global fall in markets. Be warned if Le Pen wins the second round, which looks unlikely.Support for Brexit is likely to be driven by how the economy performs and whether living standards hold up and they aren＊t. Last week,  (pdf) indicated that wage growth had slowed, and inflation had risen to a three year high of 2.3%. But consumer demand was holding up, driven by higher borrowing and dissaving, but this couldn＊t last for long.  and the only way is up. In uncertain times people should be saving as a precaution not going on a spending spree. Two days later, the Office for National Statistics released the latest retail sales numbers which missed expectations in March.There isn＊t much other good news.  for men and women.  versus November 2016 -January 2017 by 13,000. The latest trade figures showed  as exports fell and imports rose.I am hoping for some good economic news next month. I didn＊t see much of any this month."															
"hen Mohammed Choudhury was studying for A-levels, one of his teachers mentioned apprenticeships as an alternative to university. Now the 19-year old is learning computer coding and fixing software bugs for the Gloucestershire precision manufacturing firm . Many of his friends went to university, but Choudhury has no regrets about picking a software apprenticeship.※Your work is being put to use rather than just in the back of a cabinet,§ he says of the kind of learning and earning scheme that is set to become more widespread as the government shakes up the apprenticeship system this week.Choudhury＊s feelings about his apprenticeship will be music to the ears of ministers as they introduce a new levy on big employers from Thursday under plans to reach 3m new apprenticeship starts in 2020.※The biggest selling factor for me was the experience because I have got aunts and uncles who have a degree but were struggling to find a job and they told me how important the experience was,§ says Choudhury.The new levy and tougher rules on what qualifies as an apprenticeship have been billed by the government as a way to plug Britain＊s skills gaps, boost social mobility and raise productivity.However, not all employers share ministers＊ enthusiasm. Some feel the levy is  on top of business rates bills, auto-enrolment pensions and rising minimum wage rates. The levy must be paid by employers in England with a payroll of more than ?3m and is charged at a rate of 0.5% of their annual wage bill.Others feel the levy and a new watchdog on apprenticeship standards were a long time coming. Now that Brexit brings the prospect of tighter immigration controls, many employers see a pressing need for all sectors to tackle skills gaps.The idea of the levy is to force employers to take training more seriously in return for government help with funding. Employers put money into their levy pot and . Alongside the levy, the new Institute for Apprenticeships is to act as a watchdog that approves apprenticeship standards and assessments.The apprenticeships and skills minister Robert Halfon says the government is giving employers more power to design schemes to meet their needs.※For too long there has been underinvestment in British skills for the benefit of all. Through the apprenticeships levy, we will now have a system which helps and encourages businesses to invest in the skills they need, while helping people to climb the ladder of opportunity,§ says Halfon.The government says it is already making progress with more employers offering apprenticeships and more young people signing up. But there are , not least from a committee of MPs that was . The cross-party subcommittee on education, skills and the economy criticised both the levy and target as ※blunt instruments that risk being unduly focused on simply raising participation levels§.Employers have also expressed concern at how quickly the levy is being brought in.But James Selka, chief executive of the Manufacturing Technologies Association (MTA), says the government deserves credit for putting alternatives to university on the map. He feels the push from Whitehall is complementing work by business to present apprenticeships as an attractive route into a career. His sector has been working to improve its standing among families with schemes such as school visits and design competitions for teenagers.Parents＊ and schools＊ views will be a key challenge for the government as it targets the 3m apprenticeships mark in a society that has long held university degrees in higher esteem.There has been progress on that front already, says Linsey Temple, who runs Gloucestershire Engineering Training (GET), providing apprenticeship programmes and other bespoke courses for companies.※I think the government supporting apprenticeships and really promoting it has driven people,§ she says. ※I also think from a young person＊s point of view with all the publicity around going to university and racking up debt, it＊s giving the youngsters more information to make decisions.§One of the companies working with GET is Renishaw. The engineering firm needs a steady supply of skilled workers for its very specialised work in making products for dentistry, brain surgery and advanced manufacturing.※If there was no levy and there were no government subsidies for apprenticeships, we would be doing them anyway. Because it＊s a business need for us,§ says Brian Marsh, who looks after training at the company from apprentices through to researchers on PhD courses.Renishaw has been taking apprentices every year since 1979 and retains 90% of them. This academic year the number of new apprentices matches the number of graduate trainees, at 45 in each group.※We have almost reached the stage where a manager would rather have a third-year apprentice than a new grad. The apprentice can do quite a lot of stuff a new grad can＊t. So they might be able to sit down and tell you the square root of a cube, but they can＊t actually make the cube for you,§ says Marsh.One of Renishaw＊s new apprentices, Peter Underwood, 19, feels that schools must do more to help boost apprenticeships. He did maths, physics and computing at A-level in Essex and moved to Gloucestershire for a Renishaw apprenticeship.※It was kind of a hard choice at first. All my friends were going off to uni and all the schools push university and they don＊t really advertise apprenticeships much. So it was all off my own back having to look for apprenticeships,§ he said.While engineering has long relied on apprenticeships there is hope the levy will also encourage other sectors to open themselves up to employing more people through paid training schemes.The accountancy firm  says even before the levy, white collar apprenticeships were becoming more important as its sector realised the business benefits of casting a wider recruitment net.Deloitte launched a scheme in 2011 for school leavers and in September 2016 it took on 200 new apprentices. That was twice as many as 2015, albeit a small portion of the total 1,200 student recruits hired each year, with the bulk being graduate trainees.One of the people on the apprenticeship scheme is 20-year-old Deniz Gunes. He had offers from universities but found out about professional apprenticeships while on a gap year and changed plans.※It＊s the fact I can get to where I want to be in a shorter period of time,§ says Gunes. ※I＊m still getting the education and also getting the benefits of working.§"															
"The head of the International Monetary Fund has issued a stark warning that living standards will fall around the world unless governments take urgent action to increase productivity by investing in education, cutting red tape and incentivising research and development. used a speech in Washington to tell policymakers they could not simply wait for innovation to drive up productivity growth and help living standards recover from the legacy of the global financial crisis.She highlighted a poor global record on productivity growth in recent years and said IMF analysis suggested GDP in advanced economies would be about 5% higher today if the pre-crisis trend had continued for total factor productivity growth 每 a broad measure of what goes into production, such as research spending.※That would be the equivalent of adding another Japan 每 and more 每 to the global economy,§ the IMF managing director in .Legarde warned the world could not afford to leave productivity growth in the doldrums.※Another decade of weak productivity growth would seriously undermine the rise in global living standards. Slower growth could also jeopardise the financial and social stability of some countries by making it more difficult to reduce excessive inequality and sustain private debt and public obligations.※Leaning back and waiting for artificial intelligence or other technologies to trigger a productivity revival is simply not an option.§Lagarde was speaking as the IMF published  into the slowdown in productivity, a gauge of economic efficiency that is often measured by the output per hour worked in an economy. That paper highlighted three ※headwinds§ holding back productivity growth: ageing populations; a slowdown in global trade; and the※unresolved legacy§of the global financial crisis in some big economies.In the UK,  and is behind most other big economies, prompting the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to pledge more investment in infrastructure and other areas with a ?23bn national productivity investment fund.Calling on all governments to do more, Lagarde sought to emphasise productivity as the most important source of higher income and rising living standards. ※For example, the average American worker today works only about 17 weeks to live at the annual real income level of the average worker in 1915,§ she said.That kind of progress had been seen in many countries, she added. ※But this engine of prosperity has slowed down in recent years, with negative consequences for growth and incomes that look very hard to unwind.§Lagarde said governments must use investment, education, regulation and incentives for business to ramp up productivity and ※ensure that the next generation will be better off§.She continued: ※One thing is clear: we need more innovation, not less. Market forces alone will not be able to deliver that boost, because innovation and invention are to some degree public goods.※We at the IMF therefore believe that all governments should do more to unleash entrepreneurial energy. They can achieve this by removing unnecessary barriers to competition, cutting red tape, investing more in education, and providing tax incentives for research and development.§Lagarde did not mention the US president, Donald Trump, by name but she had a clear warning for him and other politicians who have pursued , seemingly to the approval of many voters who feel they have been left behind by globalisation.Trade had ※served all economies, not just some to the detriment of others§, Lagarde said. ※I firmly believe that reinforcing trade as an engine of broadly shared growth will reduce uncertainty and boost productivity.§The IMF chief urged countries that had received large numbers of refugees to integrate immigrant workers and help create a ※younger and more dynamic workforce, with growth and productivity dividends§.She also echoed concerns over how rapid changes in technology had cost jobs in some sectors, hitting lower skilled workers hardest. Governments must help such workers through targeted education programmes, Lagarde said. That in turn would help solve productivity problems and create more inclusive and sustainable growth.※Above all, we need more and better education,§ she said. ※Education and training are the key policy actions to raise both productivity growth and reduce inequality.§"															
"inancial markets seem convinced that the recent surge in business and consumer confidence in the  will soon be reflected in ※hard§ data, such as GDP growth, business investment, consumption, and wages. But economists and policymakers are not so sure. Whether their doubts are vindicated will matter for both the US and the world economy.Donald Trump＊s election as US president has triggered a surge in positive economic sentiment, because he pledged that his administration would aggressively pursue the policy trifecta of deregulation, tax cuts and reform, and infrastructure construction. Republican majorities in both houses of Congress reinforced the positive sentiment, as they signalled Trump would not face the kind of paralysing gridlock that Barack Obama confronted for most of his presidency.The surge in business and consumer sentiment reflects an assumption that is deeply rooted in the American psyche: that deregulation and tax cuts always unleash transformative pro-growth entrepreneurship. (To some outside the US, it is an assumption that sometimes looks a lot like blind faith.)Of course, sentiment can go in both directions. Just as a ※pro-business§ stance like Trump＊s can boost confidence, perhaps even excessively, the perception that a leader is ※anti-business§ can cause confidence to fall. Because sentiment can influence actual behaviour, these shifts can have far-reaching impacts.In his groundbreaking , John Maynard Keynes referred to ※animal spirits§ as ※the characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism, rather than mathematical expectations, whether moral or hedonistic or economic.§ Jack Welch, who led General Electric for 20 years, is a case in point: he once stated that many of his own major business decisions had come ※straight from the gut,§ rather than from analytical models or detailed business forecasts.But sentiment is not always an accurate gauge of actual economic developments and prospects. As the Nobel laureate  has shown, optimism can evolve into ※irrational exuberance§, whereby investors take asset valuations to levels that are divorced from economic fundamentals. They may be able to keep those valuations inflated for quite a while, but there is only so far that sentiment can take companies and economies.So far, the exuberant reaction of markets to Trump＊s victory 每 all US stock indices have reached multiple record highs 每 has not been reflected in ※hard data§. Moreover, economic forecasters have made only modest upward revisions to their growth projections.It is not surprising that equity investors have responded to the surge in animal spirits by attempting to run ahead of a possible uptick in economic performance. After all, they are in the business of anticipating developments in the real economy and the corporate sector. In any case, they believe that they can quickly reverse their portfolio positions should their expectations change.That is not the case for companies investing in new plants and equipment, which are less likely to change their behaviour until announcements begin to be translated into real policies. But the longer they wait, the weaker the stimulus to economic activity and income, and the more consumers must rely on dissaving to translate their positive sentiment into actual purchases of goods and services.It is in this context that the economy awaits a solid timeline for policy announcements to evolve into detailed design and durable implementation. While there is often some delay when political negotiations and trade-offs are involved, in this case, the sense of uncertainty may be heightened by policy-sequencing decisions. By deciding to begin with healthcare reform 每 an inherently complicated and highly divisive issue in US politics 每 the Trump administration risks losing some of the political goodwill needed to carry out the kinds of fiscal reform that markets are expecting.Even if a bump in the economic data does arrive, it may not last, unless the Trump administration advances policies that enhance longer-term productivity, through, for example, education reform, apprenticeship programmes, skills training, and labour retooling. The Trump administration would also have to refrain from pursuing protectionist trade measures that would disrupt the ※spaghetti bowl§ of cross-border value chains for both producers and consumers.If improved confidence in the US economy does not translate into stronger hard data, unmet expectations for economic growth and corporate earnings could cause financial-market sentiment to slump, fueling market volatility and driving down asset prices. In such a scenario, the US engine could sputter, causing the entire global economy to suffer, especially if these economic challenges prompt the Trump administration to implement protectionist measures.The US is on relatively strong footing to achieve higher economic growth. Indeed, by animating the economy＊s animal spirits, the Trump administration has laid the groundwork for the private sector to do a lot of the heavy lifting. But there is more to do. Unless the Trump administration can work well with a cooperative Congress to translate market-motivating intentions into well-calibrated actions soon, the lagging hard data risks dragging down confidence, creating headwinds that extend well beyond financial volatility."															
															
"US president Donald Trump＊s fortune has fallen by about $1bn to $3.5bn over the past year, as measured by Forbes magazine in .However, overall it has been a good 12 months for the world＊s wealthiest individuals, with a record 233 moving into the billionaire bracket, taking the global number of people with nine-zero fortunes to 2,043 每 the most in the 31-year history of the list. The billionaires in Forbes＊ list are worth a combined $7.67tn (?6.18tn) 每 more than three times the UK＊s annual gross domestic product (GDP).Kerry Dolan, co-editor of the Forbes billionaires list, published on Monday, said the gains are mostly the result of booming stock markets and the rising price of oil over the past 12 months. Global markets have hit record highs due to the so-called ※Trump bump§ following Trump＊s election, with the Dow Jones soaring above 20,000 points for the first time and the UK＊s FTSE 100 closing at a record 7,415 points last week. The fall in Trump＊s net worth is due to a drop in the value of office space in Midtown Manhattan, where the president owns about 10 buildings. Forbes said Trump had fallen from the world＊s 324th-richest person to 544th.※Forty percent of Donald Trump＊s fortune is tied up in Trump Tower and eight buildings within one mile of it,§ Forbes said. ※Lately, the neighbourhood has been struggling (relatively speaking).§Trump has refused to publish his tax returns to show the true scale of his wealth, but during the campaign he claimed he was worth ※in excess of $10bn§.Dolan said that in previous years . ※We contact everyone we can to give them the opportunity for feedback. Over the last 31 years we have been compiling this list Trump has given us a lot of feedback, believe me, ＆You guys are too low I am worth far more than you say＊,§ she said. ※He didn＊t call back to dispute our estimate. I would hope that running the country is more important to him right now than Forbes＊s value of his net worth.§The richest person in the world remains Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who saw his fortune grow by $11bn to $86bn. He is followed by investor Warren Buffett, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who was this year＊s biggest gainer with a $27.6bn increase in his fortune to $72.8bn. The US accounts for the biggest population of billionaires with 565, up 25 on last year. But China is catching up with 319 billionaires, and a further 68 if Hong Kong and Macau are included. Germany is third with 114 billionaires. The number of UK billionaires increased from 50 to 54, with new entrants including Philip Day, the man behind Edinburgh Woollen Mill, and Simon Nixon, the co-founder of moneysupermarket.com. The richest people in the UK are the Hinduja family, who control a conglomerate of businesses including cars and banks and are worth $15.4bn. Property and internet investors David and Simon Reuben come second with a $15.3bn fortune. The third richest, and among the biggest gainer, is Jim Ratcliffe the founder and chairman of chemicals group Ineos. Among the biggest British losers is Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley whose fortune dropped by 25% to $2.6bn. His wealth, which is largely held in Sports Direct shares, has roughly halved over the past two years as shares collapsed following . Sir Philip Green and his wife, Tina, the owners of Arcadia, which owns Topshop and once owned BHS, also lost just over $1bn, with their fortune slumping to $4.8bn. They fell more than 100 places to 339th.Oxfam said the creation of so many new billionaires in one year was a sign of ※economic sickness rather than health§. ※Our warped economic model leads to more unequal societies that trap millions of people in poverty - it allows an elite group to accrue extreme wealth while one in nine people go to bed hungry every night,§ Max Lawson, Oxfam＊s head of inequality policy, said. ※We need to build a more human economy where the super-rich pay their fair share of tax, workers earn a living wage, and governments invest in decent healthcare and education to give everyone a good start in life.§ The number of women on the list increased to 227, from 202 in 2016. A record 56 of the women are self-made billionaires 每 the highest ever. All but one of the 15 newly self-made female billionaires came from the Asia-Pacfic region, including Vietnam＊s first self-made female billionaire Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao who took her budget airline VietJet Air public last month.Yoshiko Shinohara, who started her temp agency in her one-bedroom Tokyo apartment, became Japan＊s first self-made female billionaire. She enters the list due to a 50% surge in the stock price of her company Temp Holdings, which is designed to get more women into the workforce.The richest woman on the list is France＊s Liliane Bettencourt, who inherited a stake in L＊Oreal from her father. She＊s worth $39.5bn.There are just 10 black people on the list, a drop of two from last year. The richest black person is Nigerian cement tycoon Aliko Dangote with an estimated fortune of $12.2bn. There are only three black women on the list, including Oprah Winfrey who has a $3bn fortune. "															
" want you to meet Colin Burrell because he＊s a walking good-news story. I want you to meet him because he＊s brilliant. But most of all, I want you to meet this 25-year-old because his tale shows?you what can be done to fix?both a life and an economy.Perhaps you already know a little about Colin. I  after we first met last summer. I was visiting , a community centre-cum-foodbank in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and bumped into this shy, skinny man who only occasionally looked other people in the eye. Colin was lodging nearby and bouncing between zero-hours work and?benefits. He＊d had to split up from his girlfriend because ※I couldn＊t make?my pay packet feed two§.Actually, it didn＊t even feed one: Colin?first came to Neo on the hunt for food. Worried they might charge, he brought along the last of his cash: 17?pence. Ema Wilkes and Jen Doherty, the two young activists who run Neo, gave him two bags full of groceries and took no money 每 but they did make him wash down a couple of floors.Colin＊s situation was hardly unusual. One of the features that historians of this decade will remark on is how little people of working age were expected to live on. In one of the richest countries on Earth, it is possible to be in work 每 but to be on such irregular hours or low pay that you are  or starving.Among the hundreds who come to Neo for food are nurses, Tesco staff and?factory workers on temp contracts. The much larger  calculates that almost one in four?of the hundreds of thousands using?its?foodbanks are in work.That was Colin, last summer. Stuck in a tiny room in a noisy hostel. Pouring breakfast cereal into the smallest bowls he could find in order to make it go further. Shuttling between temp agencies who couldn＊t care less and a jobcentre that was just plain useless.He＊d ask advisers for help with training and draw a blank. He＊d tell them about an interview for a part-time job and ask how that would affect his benefits. They＊d offer him an appointment for next week 每 a fat lot of good when the interview＊s tomorrow. Whatever his query, the answer that staff gave would always be the same: ※Not here, not here. This company will do it ＃ that organisation will do it ＃ go?here ＃ go there.§He was trapped in the same no man＊s land as so much of post-crash Britain. On the one hand, the supposed helping hand of the state, now fully re-purposed by Thatcher, Blair and Cameron into an instrument of control and punishment. On the other, private employers who can＊t and won＊t live up to the promises made by ministers and the models confected by mandarins.When David Cameron began his austerity cuts, his pledge was that the private sector would fill in the gaps left by the shrinking public sector. From the start, some of us said . Sadly, we＊ve been proved right. Leave the overheating machine of London, and much of what ministers used to call our ※jobs miracle§ is a patchwork of part-time, low-paid work. This isn＊t only about economics. It concerns a private sector that is not expected to provide good jobs, decent pay, its fair share of tax 每 but which demands public subsidies, infrastructure and ready-made workers. One of the central issues in Britain 每 running through everything from Brexit to last week＊s budget 每 is how to get businesses to earn the licence granted to them by the rest of society.And this is where Colin＊s story comes in. Because at least he could count on Neo to keep giving him food and advice. In turn, Wilkes and Doherty were gradually finding they couldn＊t manage without their latest volunteer. But the trouble is, even the two women who run Neo don＊t take a salary from it 每 they were in no position to offer him a job. Colin＊s?prospects were thin.In desperation, Wilkes and Doherty texted everyone in their contacts book to help Colin 每 councillors, business people, charity groups. Within hours, Dawn Tolcher, an executive from local football team  Rovers, was in touch: she could apply for public funding for an apprenticeship for Colin, then put him on secondment to Neo.When I met Colin again a couple of weeks ago, he＊d just begun the apprenticeship. It paid just above the  and, more importantly, the work was secure: 35 hours a week for 13 months. So no checking for a night-time text to inform him whether a shift was available the next day; no hanging about a jobcentre to sign on for?the next two weeks.Colin gave me a tour of the storage units let out to Neo for free, which he now manages. Here was where he was going to put some shelving, the better to take inventories of stock. That room, already painted fuchsia, was going to be turned into a ※community boutique§ (※a?charity shop with a bit more class, a bit more pride§) to be run by Neo. The shop should be open by Easter and, if you live in Birkenhead, beware: Colin will be coming after you with a flyer. He already has his patter worked out. Quite?a change from the taciturn figure of a few months back.He＊s even back with his girlfriend, Ivett. She＊s now working at a local Wetherspoon＊s, and a couple of months ago they moved into their first proper home together, let out by a local housing association. Where the two once struggled to see past the end of the week, now they＊re looking at staying here for a couple of years. Colin＊s going to apply for a passport so they can visit Ivett＊s folks in Hungary. Once the lack of money meant the couple constantly bickered over the tiniest of things; now there＊s talk of starting a family.I used to worry what the next few weeks had in store for Colin; now I wonder what he＊ll do with the next few years. But I also wonder why there?aren＊t more like him.He was fortunate to meet Wilkes and Doherty, two forceful women who, I＊m sure, could twist the arms of Venus de Milo. And?they all struck it lucky with Tolcher. Tranmere Rovers could have done what so many other companies do with the billions taxpayers spend on apprenticeship training:  and use it as a source of bargain-basement, publicly subsidised labour.I wanted you to hear Colin＊s story because it cheers me up. But also because it gives some idea of what can?be done when businesses don＊t rip?off the public, bilk the tax collectors or exploit the staff 每 and actually pay their way as part of society.It shows what can be done by activists working from the ground up, rather than top-down politics. And it shows that the ※skivers§ ministers like to vilify 每 well, they can put in a more successful day＊s work than an accident-prone chancellor of the exchequer."															
"The Western Australian election result confirms that the Australian polity has totally mastered the art of opposition. It＊s the governing side of things that is proving the difficult part.Whether you are a recently punted administration still licking your wounds or a perennially bench-warming opposition, if you can＊t excite a backlash against the sitting party then your heart really isn＊t in it. Which is not to detract from the victory of Mark McGowan and his team, merely to mark the wild swings inherent in the modern two-party state as the new normal.Much has been written about the rise of the anchorless voter, marching away from the major parties, often carrying pitchforks, feeling let down by a lived experience of job insecurity and falling living standards.With close to one in three of the voting public up for grabs, populist alternatives are on the rise, from maverick independents to more organised movements of dissent challenging from the margins of both left and right. Trump and the Tea Party jostle over who controls the Republicans while the contest for the right across Europe flirts with fascism. Meanwhile, left-of-centre social democratic parties are being subsumed by more radical expressions of their dogma from insurgents such as Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn.But in the reams of analysis the elephants in the room are the actual targets of this populist backlash 每 the corporate community. The one voice that seems to be missing from the current rage about globalisation and deregulation and all that flows is that of the corporations whose interests the current economic system so manifestly promotes.While political parties implode, the captains of industry, fund managers and those in the C-suite seem to be carrying on as if it＊s business as usual, hedging their bets with the new players even as they risk beaching themselves on the shores of the tax havens they have so elegantly constructed.Because if populism is a challenge to the post cold war consensus around the benefits of economic growth, trade liberation and global connection, then it is the custodians of the corporate world who have the most to lose.We know from our Essential research ( see below) that the disconnect between public interest and corporate interest has become a chasm. . When people are asked who benefits from privatisation and free trade, it is corporations and not individuals that are seen as the winners. And, unsurprisingly, the Turnbull government＊s proposal to cut company tax cuts attracts the support of just one quarter of voters.Even among voters who returned a Coalition with this policy at the centre of its economic policy, just 41% garner enthusiasm for the corporate tax cut, while the floating right in ※other§ flat out reject the proposition. Dig deeper and you pick up the scepticism about both the motives and the effects of the cut. These numbers establish two important principles.First, Bill Shorten and Labor are on a winner opposing the tax cuts at every turn, using them as a counterpoint for every spending cut the Coalition government proposes. But even more profoundly, when propositions about why corporate tax cuts are desirable do not even garner support from a majority of Coalition voters, then you have to surmise business has a deeper problem. Now I＊m not arguing corporate tax cuts are a good idea 每 rather that even if the logic were compelling, the failure of Australian business to appear to be anything other than self-serving is why there＊s no bedrock of public support for any of the things they argue for. Now some in the corporate world seem to be sniffing the breeze. Former Treasury chief and now NAB chairman Ken Henry laid it on the line a few weeks ago when he warned that business had to shift its focus if it wanted a sustainable operating environment. ※Australia＊s business leaders have to accept responsibility for ensuring that strong population growth, and the investment opportunities that go with it, lift economic and social opportunity for all, without damaging the quality of the environment we pass to future generations,§ he told the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda). ※If we want better access to skilled domestic workers, then we are going to have to offer those workers the prospect of better lives. ※ This is an agenda for business that goes beyond tic-a-box notions of corporate social responsibility, with a dedicated team embracing worthy environmental, Indigenous and sustainable projects separate from the day-to-day operations of a company. This a more fundamental notion of ※enlightened self-interest§ that recognises the way business operates has a bearing on the very environment in which it will operate in the future. Jim O＊Neil, a former Goldman Sachs executive linked to the UK＊s Conservative party coined that phrase at a business conference organised by the AFR last week.He argues that the growing increase in the profit-to-wage ratio, stagnating wages, and less secure work are all contributing to the populist backlash threatening Britain＊s long-term economic prospects.O＊Neill was joined by others who argued business needed to ※sell its story better§, which actually misses his central point. It is not just about selling the story of business investment and growth, it is recognising the limits to this story. Within the narrow frame of fiduciary duty, suppressing wages, outsourcing and offshoring jobs, shifting workers onto contracts and labour hire and framing every project to generate maximum return all seem rational business decisions.But in this era of revolving-door government driven further to the extremes, business＊s enlightened self-interest may demand a rethink of all these orthodoxies if companies are to be truly sustainable. That＊s important, because if we want our political parties to learn to govern as well as they oppose, then they need new levers to harness business to ensure the economy delivers wealth and prosperity to enough people to justify their mutual prosperity.And one of those levers is the enlightened self-interest of business which sees the yielding of some of its power as an investment in the long-term stability of its operating environment."															
															
"Rising prices in the wake of the Brexit vote have put the tightest squeeze on household incomes for more than five years, according to  on Britons＊ economic wellbeing.In the opening three months of 2017, real household disposable income per head dropped 2% from the previous year. It was the steepest decline since the end of 2011 and driven by increasing prices of goods and services, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.The figures add to evidence of  when the Conservatives failed to win a majority.Households have been hit by a double whammy of slow wage growth and rising inflation. The pound＊s weakness since the EU referendum last summer has made imports to the UK more expensive and firms are passing their higher costs on to consumers.  on the latest measure.That has meant a , which adjusts for the effects of inflation. Workers had already suffered years of declining real wages in the wake of the financial crisis, but then real pay started rising again in 2014. The latest figures confirmed Britain was experiencing a renewed squeeze on living standards, said Dan Tomlinson, researcher at the Resolution Foundation thinktank.※While no one expects it to be as bad as the last one, the fact that the fall in household incomes at the start of 2017 was the biggest in over five years is a huge cause for concern,§ he said.※The government needs to rise to this economic challenge, alongside tackling the political ones associated with ongoing  negotiations.§A spokesman for the Treasury said the government was already helping households, for example with the introduction last year of a  known as the ※national living wage§.※We are taking real action to help families increase their incomes and take home more of what they earn. A basic-rate taxpayer now pays ?1,000 less income tax than in 2010 and, thanks to the national living wage, the poorest households have seen their wages rise more than in any other G7 economy,§ he said.In its latest healthcheck on household finances, the ONS said that despite the hit to real incomes, consumer confidence had brightened in the first quarter of this year. Compared with the previous three months, people＊s perception of the general economic situation improved slightly from a balance of -23.3 to -21.8. But the negative balance was still suggesting that households＊ perception of the general economic situation was ※unfavourable, potentially because of the decline in the UK＊s currency and rising inflation§, the ONS report said.Between the same two quarters, consumers also reported an improvement in their perception of their own financial situation. That balance increased from 0.7 in December 2016 to 1.2 in March 2017, the ONS said, using a survey conducted by researchers GFK on behalf of the European commission.The report will add fuel to the debate over how content households are to dip into savings or to borrow in order to keep spending at the same pace.  has been a key driver of UK growth and so pressures on household finances are widely expected to dent economic momentum this year and next.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the findings suggested UK consumers ※could be sleepwalking into financial difficulties§.※The pressure is ratcheting up on UK households, but consumers don＊t seem to be fully aware of the crunch that is under way,§ he said.※Despite weak wage growth and rising prices, consumers are continuing to spend by racking up more debt. That of course helps keep the wheels of the economy turning, but stores up problems for the future.§The TUC said the figures showed Britons had enjoyed only a brief period of financial respite since the last squeeze on living standards.※Britons are getting poorer,§ said the TUC＊s general secretary, Frances O＊Grady. ※Having just lived through the longest wage squeeze since Victorian times, their living standards are in freefall again. The government cannot sit on its hands and watch the crisis unfold. It needs to help create better-paid jobs in the parts of Britain that need them most. And lift the unfair .§Labour＊s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Peter Dowd, echoed the call for the government to remove the cap on public sector pay rises, which has seen teachers, nurses, police officers and other workers employed by the state .Responding to the ONS figures, Dowd said: ※It＊s clear we need investment to create the high-skill, high-wage economy of the future. The Tories could start to help ease the burden on hardworking people by lifting their public sector pay cap, and end the cuts to in-work benefits.§"															
															
"endell Britt does not know where he will sleep tonight. It might be a park bench, a pavement, a shelter 每 ※You go to a shelter and they take your fucking phone§ 每 or, if he＊s lucky, a friend＊s house. ※Wherever I lay my head,§ he says, wearing a Chicago Bulls cap.The 55-year-old also does not know where his next meal is coming from either 每 but he does have a lifeline. ※Food stamps help me get food in my stomach,§ he said this week. ※They help a lot of people.§This is Congress Heights in Washington DC, a predominantly black neighborhood just five miles southeast of the White House, where last week Donald Trump＊s administration unveiled a  that would slash the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), as food stamps are officially known.Losing food stamps altogether would be devastating to Britt, who spent 17 years in prison for robbery and drug-related offenses and is trying to go back to work as a barber. ※If I＊ve got no food, nothing to eat, I＊m just out here. I might go to the trash can when I need something to eat; I might get sick in my stomach but it＊s a chance I have to take. I might steal something because I＊m going to be hungry.§In February, about 42 million Americans received assistance via the Snap program, which cost $70.9bn in 2016. Most recipients, about 72%, live in households with children, and more than a quarter live in households with seniors or people with disabilities. The federal scheme has been widely applauded by economists and academics as a cost-efficient method of helping the most needy.※In recent memory, in the late 1960s and early 70s, we had a problem of severe malnutrition in this country. Not everywhere, but in poor communities around the country we had problems with severe hunger,§ said Stacy Dean, the vice-president for food assistance policy at the nonpartisan thinktank the . Snap ※largely solved that problem§.Dean said she found the budget cut proposal worrying. Abdicating responsibility for ending hunger as a national issue is ※a proposal to take us back to a dark time in our history§, she said.The District of Columbia in comparison with  has one of the highest proportions of the population to be on food stamps. For instance, 21.97% of residents were on them in 2014, a report from the US Department of Agriculture＊s (USDA＊s) nutrition service reported in 2015.Many residents of Congress Heights, a disadvantaged area that＊s a 20-minute drive from the executive mansion, depend on food stamps and would soon feel the pain of cutbacks.Last week, Kozette Green, a 44-year-old single mother, dropped into a convenience store on Alabama Avenue with her nine-year-old twins Jerzey and John; she also has a daughter, Nija, 18. Green has been on food stamps since Nija＊s birth in 1998 prompted her to leave her job in childcare. ※They made a big difference because I don＊t really make a lot so it helped me bring food for my kids.§Green receives $273 a month for herself and her children. If that was taken away? ※Oh my god, I don＊t know,§ she replied. ※My kids probably wouldn＊t get as much as they do now. I think it＊s horrible. It＊s going to be harder on the people who don＊t have jobs trying to eat and provide for their families.§Walking by the store, Reginald Porter-Bey, 59, who used to work as a printer at the Pentagon, started using food stamps a decade ago when he was homeless and jobless. ※They＊re very important to get through the month. You＊ve got to know how to find bargains.§Porter-Bey, who has five children, added: ※It would have a hell of an impact. That＊s taking food out of my mouth and other people＊s mouths who＊ve got kids. That＊s not fair. People voted for Trump and he slapped them in the face. There are people in West Virginia who are poor just like here. He doesn＊t care because he＊s all right.※We＊ve had people robbing from another just to survive. No man is not going to allow his kids to eat, not if he＊s a man.§His friend Donald Greenfield, 36, a cook, added: ※It＊s gonna hurt a lot of people. A person＊s got to survive. For him to take the Snap and not put something in its place is totally wrong. You＊re taking money out of kids＊ mouths who are hardly making it.§Conservative media outlets such as Fox News have previously referred to food stamp users as ※moochers§, ※parasites§ and ※takers§ instead of ※makers§. Last week Trump＊s budget director Mick Mulvaney said: ※If you＊re on food stamps and you＊re able-bodied, we need you to go to work.§But according to the government＊s own figures, most families on Snap 每 55% of them 每 do have a family member working. The issue is that they do not make enough money to feed their families. ※This budget is not an evidence-based exercise in policy-making. It＊s oriented at cutting government spending in order to lavish tax cuts on the wealthy,§ said Dean.Daimond and Georgia Gibson have a six-year-old son and receive food stamps worth $350 a month. Daimond, 44, suffered a slipped disc in his back and lost his job as a manager about 18 months ago. He said: ※I voted for Trump: what a mistake. He＊s a businessman, and I thought he＊s going to run the country like a business. I can＊t see it.§If the family lost food stamps, he said, ※it would be a major blow. We＊d have to come down from three meals a day to maybe one or one-and-a-half. We＊re in the nation＊s capital and prices are high. We feed the third world countries; why not feed us?§Georgia, 25, who could not vote because of a past felony, described the proposal to slash food stamps as ※ridiculous§. She said: ※If he doesn＊t look after poor people now, he＊s going to see a lot more poverty.§She said of Trump: ※He＊s tearing our country apart. There＊s so much hate. He＊s dividing our people. There has always been racism and we knew it was a problem but we clearly see it now.§Others in the neighborhood 每 which includes fast-food outlets, convenience stores with bulletproof glass, police cars on regular patrol and Martin Luther King Jr Elementary School 每 warned that they might turn to desperate measures without food stamps.Rodney Crowder, 51, is diabetic, has mental health problems, spent three years in prison for robbery and is homeless, forcing him to sleep in a car. ※Trump is a good guy, but he＊d better not take any food stamps. He can＊t do that shit. People need help. It would make me want to rob again. What the hell do you think? I ain＊t got no food stamps, I＊m gonna steal. I gotta eat.§Ralik Turner, 52, a community developer and social worker, offered a different perspective on the proposal. ※It will just be the direction the country has been going for years. Bill Clinton started the cuts and I like Clinton. Like any underground network, people are going to find a way because they have no choice.※Food stamps is a subsidy. It＊s not making the bread of any household in this country. In no way does it take the credit for the situation of freedom in the black community. Most of the elderly get $6 to $14 a month on food stamps; no one can live on them; it means nothing.

"ity types have often debated whether Bob Diamond＊s impressively dark locks would retain their hue should he be caught in a heavy rain shower. But, as a City figure, Bob the Banker has been remarkably enduring.He is back in action this week with the annual general meeting of  he founded after being ousted from Barclays in 2012 over the Libor rate-rigging scandal 每 which has proved a total disaster.Its shares have steadily fallen from more than $12 to around $2.50 now, and Diamond had to step in as chairman after the departure of Arnold Ekpe. John Vitalo, who worked for Diamond when he ran , also abruptly left Atlas Mara in February and has yet to be replaced.Anyway, that makes Diamond the main draw at Wednesday＊s meeting 每 to be held in New York 每 when investors will obviously want to know when the company plans to sort this mess out, as well as (possibly) asking: ※What is that thing Bob the Banker has brought with him?§Diamond has been spotted around the Square Mile of late sporting a Paul Hollywood-style grey goatee beard which, apart from failing to quite match his coiffure, keeps distracting those in meetings from a) maintaining eye contact and b) important matters at hand. Maybe that＊s the point.There won＊t be much going on in the corporate world this week, and the Financial Conduct Authority＊s diary for the next seven days looks a tad sparse, too.

There＊s also the GfK consumer confidence survey for May, providing the latest look at how perky the British punter is feeling 每 what with inflation starting to outpace wage rises.Obviously, all that has an inevitable Brexit angle, but that may also be true for the big US economic data announcement of the week. The non-farm payrolls (a measure of the number of people in employment, excluding a few sectors such as agriculture) are out just after supposed comments from President Trump about Brexit costing US jobs. That would seemingly be a U-turn, you＊ll be astonished to learn.As the political parties concentrate on the final full week of campaigning, currency traders will be punting on what the election means for the pound.One explanation given for dips in sterling＊s value against the dollar last week was traders getting spooked by a Labour boost in the polls. As a rule, City traders tend not to view a potential Labour government with much enthusiasm.Still, to be fair to them, traders＊ lives tend to work out slightly less disastrously if they can view everything as a binary choice (lager chaser or another sambuca?), which is why there may be some concern for how they＊ll play the currency markets this week, following Friday＊s assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.The thinktank reckons neither of the two main parties ※has set out an honest set of choices§, with the Tory focus on cutting immigration risking a ?6bn hit to the exchequer, while continued austerity could prove impossible to deliver without causing serious damage to services.Meanwhile, the IFS said that Labour＊s proposals would raise taxes to record levels for peacetime, while the party＊s plans for taxing the rich may ※not raise anything like§ the expected ?48.6bn and could be ※economically damaging§.

"The number of individuals applying for insolvency jumped to the highest level in almost three years in the first three months of 2017, in a further sign of the mounting financial pressure facing UK households.Personal insolvencies in England and Wales totalled 24,531 between January and March, up 6.7% on the previous quarter and 15.7% higher than the same period a year earlier. It was the highest number of individual cases since the second quarter of 2014, according to the , which published the figures.The rise comes at a challenging time for UK households, as . The annual inflation rate is 2.3% and expected to rise to 3% in the coming months, as the impact of the weaker pound since the Brexit vote increasingly feeds through to higher shop prices. Meanwhile regular pay growth was just 1.9% in February compared with a year earlier.Joanna Elson, the chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said the insolvency figures were concerning.※Growing levels of household debt and extra pressure on budgets from inflation are a worry, and we expect this to translate into greater demand for free debt advice over the rest of 2017,§ she said.※We would urge anyone who is already struggling with their finances, or is concerned that they are only one bill away from falling behind, to seek free advice as early as possible.§At 59%, individual voluntary arrangements accounted for the majority of personal insolvencies in the first quarter, while debt relief orders made up a further 25% and bankruptcies accounted for 16%.IVAs are arrangements where money owed is shared out between creditors, while DROs are available to people with less than ?20,000 of debt who do not own their own home.Adrian Hyde, the president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3, said: ※Although borrowing rates remain at record lows, rising inflation and slowing real wage growth will be limiting people＊s financial room for manoeuvre. ※Compared with where insolvency numbers were a few years ago, personal insolvency rates are still low and the recent bankruptcy rises have been very small. However, a continued gradual upwards shift may be a sign that the post-recession return of high levels of consumer borrowing and spending is starting to reach its limits.§He cautioned that the statutory numbers did not give the full picture of personal insolvency in England and Wales, with potentially hundreds of thousands of people on debt management plans who are not covered in the official statistics.The Insolvency service also reported that the underlying number of corporate insolvencies rose by 4.5% in the first three months of the year, compared with the previous quarter, and 5.3% compared with the same period a year earlier."															
"The UK economy suffered a sharp slowdown in the opening months of this year, as  took its toll on British households and hit consumer spending.GDP growth fell more than expected to 0.3% in the first quarter from 0.7% in the previous quarter, the Office for National Statistics said.The  add to signs that the UK economy＊s resilience in the wake of the Brexit vote is now waning and will come as a blow to Theresa May＊s government as it banks on a solid victory in . Many economists expect the slowdown to continue as higher inflation dents consumer spending, a key driver for the UK economy. But the deterioration is still far off the Brexit-related slump some commentators had predicted.※The first quarter＊s slowdown was led by consumers, whose incomes are under pressure from slowing employment and wage growth as well as rising inflation,§ said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics.※One quarter of slow growth is not definitive proof that the economy is on the ropes. But the pressure on consumers＊ incomes looks set to build this year as retailers pass on higher import prices.§The figures suggested consumer-facing sectors such as shops and hotels have been hurt in recent months by the squeeze on Britons＊ spending power from the pound＊s plunge since the Brexit vote. Sterling＊s weakness makes imports to the UK such as food and fuel more expensive. That factor combined with higher crude oil prices has lifted inflation to its highest level for more than three years. Economists had predicted a more modest slowdown to 0.4% growth, according to a Reuters poll.The 0.3% growth rate was the slowest for a year. There was also a sharp slowdown in GDP per head, which adjusts for the size of the population and is generally seen as a better guide to prosperity than mere GDP. It edged up just 0.1% in the first quarter after rising 0.5% in the previous quarter.Statisticians said the biggest drag on growth was the retail sector, echoing other signs shoppers are cutting back. Growth in the services sector, which makes up more than three quarters of the UK economy, slowed markedly to a two-year low of 0.3% from 0.8% in the final quarter of 2016.A leading thinktank underscored the pressures on household budgets as it noted the weakness in wage growth started long before the Brexit vote. After adjusting for inflation, employees＊ average earnings were still substantially below pre-recession levels, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said in . On current forecasts, earnings would still not have fully recovered by the end of the next parliament.※A period of this length over which earnings have fallen is unprecedented in modern times. They had started to recover a little between 2014 and 2016, but rising inflation linked to the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum has put a stop to that modest recovery,§ said IFS senior research economist Jonathan Cribb.The ONS figures showed industrial production and construction output also slowed in the first quarter. But economists noted that their fortunes could yet improve over coming months. There have been signs that the weak pound has already helped exporters by making their goods and services more competitive overseas. ※The long-awaited slowdown is finally coming but I＊d be wary of over-interpreting today＊s numbers,§ said Ian Stewart, the chief economist at Deloitte.※Quarterly GDP growth is choppy and prone to revision. Inflation will continue to squeeze the consumer but the outlook for manufacturing and exports has brightened. Growth is slowing, but this looks like a cooling, not collapse, in UK activity.§ Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, was also cautiously optimistic about the UK＊s longer-term prospects.※The fears leading up to Brexit were that growth would stall due to a dive in confidence, hiring and investment. That hasn＊t happened. What did happen is the pound dived, pushing inflation sharply higher and that is causing consumer spending and hence overall growth to slow,§ he said.※The good news is that the surge in inflation is probably temporary and the squeeze on growth should pass. However, it is probably going to take another year before growth is back on an upwards trajectory.§But others are more downbeat about the potential consequences of leaving the EU. The credit ratings agency Standard & Poor＊s reiterated its view on Fridaythat the decision to leave ※continues to present a significant risk to the UK＊s track record of strong economic performance, and to its large financial services sector in particular§. It added that the Brexit vote had also increased instability in the UK as ※highlighted by the snap election called for June 2017§.Economists at Barclays said GDP growth had come in weaker than the Bank of England had expected and strengthened the case for keeping interest rates at their record low of 0.25% this year and next."

"The  squeeze on household budgets has intensified over the past month, but companies and investors remain cautiously optimistic about the economic outlook in the run-up to the election, a Guardian analysis shows.With a fortnight to go until the general election, the Guardian＊s monthly tracker of economic news paints a mixed picture. Living standards are again falling, but while the economy has slowed markedly, as the latest GDP update showed, it continues to defy the  made by some commentators this time last year.In the latest figures, unemployment is at the lowest level since 1975 and retail sales rebounded as shoppers apparently shrugged off any worries about rising prices to keep spending in April, although many retailers and economists take issue with the accuracy of the official data. Despite uncertainty over the impending Brexit negotiations , closely watched business surveys point to a buoyant mood across a broad range of companies and the .But in a worrying pattern for an economy so reliant on consumer spending, other indicators show household incomes are being eroded as pay growth fails to keep pace with rising prices. Official figures show GDP growth  of 2017 to 0.2%, from 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016, as consumer spending was hurt by higher prices.The blow to the pound from last summer＊s referendum result is  to the UK and inflation is at its highest level . Pay growth has stalled, despite low unemployment and reports that companies are struggling to fill vacancies.The news that Britain＊s trade deficit widened more than expected in March has dampened hopes that stronger exports can make up for softer domestic demand. The latest GDP figures show net trade was a drag on overall economic growth in the first quarter.In a further blow to consumer confidence, the housing market . That will leave homeowners feeling less flush, but the prospect of prices falling to more affordable levels will be welcomed by those trying to get on to the property ladder.To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100.The dashboard for May shows , unemployment has dropped further and business activity continues to expand. But inflation is at its highest level for more than three years,  and . House prices continue to edge up, but estate agents say the market is slowing. The deficit was wider than forecast in April as lower VAT receipts took their toll on the public finances.Compared with economists＊ forecasts, there was a better than expected performance in four of the eight categories. Two were worse than expected and one was as forecast.  was higher than commentators had been expecting.Writing in the Guardian, the former Bank of England policymaker David Blanchflower said the big economic story this month was ※all about declining real wage growth§. said Blanchflower, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US.He noted that regular weekly pay once adjusted for price rises was ?465 a week in March 2017. ※This contrasts with ?472 a week in March 2007, before the start of the ＆great recession＊. So pay packets buy less than they did a decade ago,§ he said.While pressures on domestic consumers are rising, the more internationally focused FTSE 100 share index has set record highs in the past month. On currency exchanges, the pound has recovered some ground against a US dollar weakened by doubts around the political future of Donald Trump. But sterling has dipped against the euro. It is still down by more than 10% against the dollar and euro when compared with the day of the referendum last June.※The pound＊s sharp drop makes imports to the UK such as food ingredients and fuel more expensive,§ said Blanchflower, highlighting the rise in inflation to 2.7%, well above the Bank of England＊s 2% target.With prices rising, it remains to be seen if retailers can continue to enjoy the strong sales growth they clocked up in April, when sunshine and Easter holidays drew in shoppers. Economists warn that it was most likely a one-off and that whichever party forms the next government after the 8 June general election will be faced with a tough economic outlook as the UK＊s main engine of growth, consumer spending, comes under pressure.Andrew Sentance, another former member of the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee, warned against reading too much into the latest retail sales data. He said the overall pattern from recent indicators was one of an economy losing steam.※Taking all this data together, it is generally consistent with the slowdown in economic growth expected by most economic forecasters this year and next,§ said Sentance, a senior economic adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers.※Despite this, optimism about global prospects plus a decline in the value of the pound against the euro has helped to push up the UK stock market, with the FTSE 100 hitting a new record high in the middle of last week.§ The Bank of England＊s latest outlook was for household budgets to be hit by a cocktail of  this year. But it predicted living standards could start to recover in 2018.The Bank also forecast that the economy would continue to grow this year by 1.9%, more than double the 0.8% pace of growth it was predicting for 2017 in forecasts made last August following the Brexit vote."															
"Rising inflation is taking its toll on British households, knocking consumer confidence to its lowest level since the aftermath of last summer＊s Brexit vote.Pollsters YouGov said worries about job security and living costs pushed its monthly measure of consumer mood down a further 1.5 points to 108 in April, the weakest reading since last July. The score above 100 still shows that more people are confident than not, bringing some solace for Theresa May＊s government as it banks on a solid victory in .But the consumer confidence measure is well below the levels seen before June＊s vote to leave the EU. The poll also underscored . It found Britons were at their gloomiest in more than three years about their own financial outlook.※Many analysts have said for a while that inflation would bite and these figures show that it has started to 每 and is likely to get worse over the coming year,§ said Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov reports.The downbeat tone of the poll chimes with signs the economy has lost momentum in recent months as the post-referendum resilience in consumer spending wanes. Official figures on Friday morning are  in the first quarter of this year.Much of the pressure on households stems from higher inflation, which has picked up to its  on the back of higher oil prices and because of the pound＊s weakness since the Brexit vote. A weaker currency makes imports to the UK such as food and fuel more expensive., leaving people worse off in real terms and denting consumer spending, a key driver of the UK economy.YouGov bases its consumer confidence survey on 6,000 interviews a month, asking about household finances, property prices, job security and business activity, over the past 30 days and looking ahead to the next 12 months. Six of its eight measures fell in April.There was a small increase in homeowners＊ expectations for property prices over the coming year and people were more upbeat about the level of business activity in their workplace over the past month.However, confidence about job security over the last month dropped to the lowest level since April 2013.Nina Skero at the Centre for  and Business Research, which co-compiles the consumer confidence report, said the gloom around personal finances did not bode well for the UK economy.※Consumer confidence has been on the cusp of a decline for a while and it has now tipped over and fallen,§ said Skero, head of macroeconomics at the consultancy.※Particularly worrying is the fall in both the forward and backward-looking household finances as it is clear that people are starting to feel the pinch and expect things to get worse. If they start to really rein in spending, the knock-on effect on the economy could be notable.§A separate measure of consumer confidence from the market research firm GfK also slipped in April, dropping one point to -7, the lowest since December. That report suggested people were more gloomy about their own finances and the UK economy, but more confident that now was a good time to make big purchases such as furniture.GfK spokesman Joe Staton said that while there was a dip compared with March, confidence was still ※surprisingly stable§ and had not suffered the sharp drop some commentators had suggested could follow the triggering of article 50.※Consumers continue to remain positive about the state of their personal finances and even report that now is a good time to buy,§ Staton said. ※But is this too good to be true? Is this simply the calm before the storm? Is pre-Brexit economic turbulence yet to really batter households? That threat cannot be ruled out.§"															
"Rising food and clothing prices kept Britain＊s inflation rate at its highest level for more than three years last month, putting household budgets under pressure as the  effect on the pound worked its way through the economy. put inflation on the consumer prices index (CPI) at 2.3% for the second month running in March, , as food prices rose at the fastest pace for three years, increasing 1.2% on the year.Economists said inflation was likely to push higher in April and they warned the rising costs of essentials such as groceries were already eating into household budgets and leaving people with less cash to spend on other items. .※Today＊s release confirms our expectations that 2017 will see the end of the consumer spending boom which has driven economic growth in recent years,§ said Nina Skero at the consultancy the Centre for  and Business Research.※With the prices of essentials such as housing costs, food and transport on the rise, less money will be left over for discretionary spending. This is especially true given that wage growth is unlikely to keep up with the elevated inflation levels.§Much of the pressure on inflation has come from the pound＊s sharp fall against other currencies after last June＊s vote to leave the EU. That makes imports to the UK more expensive, with firms now passing on those higher costs to shoppers. There has also been a marked effect on inflation in the UK and other countries from higher global oil prices.Inflation has risen above the Bank of England＊s 2% target from just , bringing an abrupt end to a brief period when Britons enjoyed incomes rising in real terms, or faster than inflation. ※Rising prices and sluggish pay increases mean that real earnings growth has now ground to a halt,§ said the TUC general secretary, Frances O＊Grady. ※Without government action, another living standards crisis is on the cards.※We urgently need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better-paid jobs. And it＊s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting midwives, teachers and other public servants.§The Treasury said it was also taking action.※We are building an economy that works for everyone and helping families with the cost of living by cutting income taxes for 31 million people, freezing fuel duty and increasing the national living wage to ?7.50 per hour,§ said a Treasury spokesman.The Resolution Foundation said the latest inflation figure meant real average earnings look set to have fallen during the first three months of 2017.※With further price rises expected later this year, and no sign yet of wage settlements responding, this pay squeeze looks set to be deeper and longer than expected,§ said Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the thinktank.The Office for National Statistics said price changes for a range of goods and services in March put upward pressure on inflation. However, some of that was offset by downward pressure on overall inflation from air fares. The cost of a flight rose sharply between February and March 2016 because of the early Easter holidays but this year Easter is later and there has been no rise in air fares.A dip in petrol and diesel prices last month also tempered the pressure on inflation. However, compared with a year ago, fuel costs were up 17% in March.There was upward pressure from a variety of foods with only fruit having a small downward effect. The largest upward effects came from margarine, low-fat spread and crisps. Whisky and beer prices rose and cigarettes also played a role in keeping inflation high last month. Clothing and footwear prices were another factor, rising 2% between February and March.Some economists predict inflation reaching 3% this year although few feel the cost pressures will push the Bank of England into raising interest rates from their record low of 0.25%. One of the nine members on the Bank＊s monetary policy committee (MPC), outgoing policymaker Kristin Forbes, . But the Bank＊s governor, Mark Carney, and other policymakers have indicated they are happy to tolerate inflation being above their government-set target in return for supporting growth and safeguarding jobs with low borrowing costs.※All told, we think that CPI inflation will peak at just over 3% before the end of 2017,§ said Ruth Gregory at the consultancy Capital Economics.※But we don＊t think that that will panic the MPC into raising rates imminently. Given the uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations and the fact that there has been little sign of building domestic cost pressures, we think that the MPC will hold off until mid-2018 before raising rates.§The next figures on wage growth and unemployment are published on Wednesday. Economists expect average pay growth was 2.2% in the three months to February compared with a year earlier, according to a Reuters poll."															
"Britain must Brexit-proof its economy by ramping up spending on research and development or risk being left behind in the global race to deliver game-changing innovations in areas such as space tourism and robotics, the country＊s leading business group has said.The CBI lobby group will launch a campaign on Monday to urge the government to adopt an ambitious new target for R&D spending of 3% of GDP, compared with the current level of 1.7%.Adopting a target for R&D spending would send an important signal to foreign investors and academics that the UK can remain a hub for innovation and scientific collaboration in a post-Brexit world, the CBI will say.It will say that despite  and , the UK＊s position as ※world leaders in science and innovation§ is at risk.※Much of what we need to deliver a world-class innovation ecosystem is already in place. The UK has first-rate universities, cutting-edge businesses and attracts talent from across the globe.※But our spending on R&D has stagnated at just 1.7% of GDP, with both public and private sectors under-investing,§ the report says.It speaks of a growing challenge from Asian economies and notably China, which increased its share of global R&D spending from 2.5% in 1996 to 19.6% in 2013. China also outranked the UK when measuring its R&D spending as a percentage of GDP, which stood at 2.0% in 2014.The CBI has not set a date for its 3% target to be reached, but believes it is achievable by 2025.※Now is the moment for the UK to up its game and try and move the needle in terms of where we are on innovation,§ said Felicity Burch, the CBI＊s head of digital and innovation.※We had the  vote last year and article 50 fast approaching, we actually need to think quite seriously about what our economy looks like and how we compete globally now.※Then on the other side, we actually have a real opportunity in terms of the new industrial strategy ... It＊s really clear the government is taking innovation seriously but what we need is a real vision about the outcomes we want to achieve with that strategy.§Having a measurable target will help focus government and business attention on the need to increase spending, the CBI says, citing evidence from other bodies, including the House of Commons science and technology committee, arguing for 3% as a level proven to boost growth and jobs.The  agenda also include a target of 3% of the EU＊s gross domestic product (GDP) to be invested in R&D.※It＊s not arbitrary. It＊s challenging,§ said Burch. ※Against UK progress it would be years and years away, but if you look at how much other EU countries have raised their R&D expenditure over the last year as a percentage of GDP, if the UK could step up and replicate what is happening on the EU average we would hit it before 2025.§The UK＊s spending on R&D has stagnated for years, fluctuating between 1.53% and 1.68% of GDP since 1998. On the , published last week, R&D spending was ?31.6bn in 2015, a rise of ?1.2bn on 2014, largely driven by an increase in private sector investment. Given the economy also grew in that time, there was barely any rise in spending as a percentage of GDP. It was 1.68% of GDP in 2015, compared with 1.66% in 2014. The EU-wide level was estimated at 2.03% for 2015 while Sweden, Austria and Denmark all surpassed 3% with Finland and Germany not far behind.The CBI said the onus was on both government and industry to put more money into developing new products.Its report says: ※Gene editing, space tourism, self-driving vehicles, robotic limbs, floating farms, London to Sydney in four hours. Game-changing innovations like these will shape the course of the next decade.※The current pace of change in technology is unrivalled and individuals, companies, and governments are under pressure to keep up.§"															
"It has been a difficult decade for savers. For 10 years they have suffered falling or ultra-low interest rates, leaving them in the red on their deposit accounts when they might reasonably have expected a modest gain.The last time the Bank of England put up interest rates was on 5 July 2007. But the financial crash put paid to further rises. In the next 20 months it tumbled to 0.5% and then further in the wake of last year＊s Brexit vote to 0.25%.Ten years ago only ?23bn was saved in deposit accounts with no annual interest. The vast majority of savers were earning an average 3.3% on cash in instant access accounts and 5% on accounts where some notice must be given, according to research by the financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown. Today almost ?180bn of cash savings sits in non-interest-bearing accounts and the few people who shop around earn just 0.4% on money in instant access accounts and 0.9% on notice accounts. This collapse in interest rates and 26% inflation over the 10-year period has turned ?1,000 cash in a savings account in 2007 into ?878 in real terms, according to Hargreaves Lansdown.This compares with the gains made possible by ?1,000 invested in the stock market, which is now worth ?1,323 adjusted for inflation and with the 50% drop in share prices that followed the financial crash taken into account.An even better rate of return has gone to those who have borrowed money and have relatively little interest to pay. About 7m households have a mortgage and for them the average interest bill has declined from 5.8% to 2.6%.Laith Khalaf, the firm＊s senior analyst, said: ※While cash savers have undoubtedly felt the pinch from lower interest rates, there have been benefits for borrowers which have helped support the economy.§He said unsecured consumer borrowing rates have fallen too. The result was much lower levels of consumer loan defaults. ※UK lenders have written off ?2.5bn of bad consumer loans over the last year. This compares to ?6.8bn in 2007,§ he said.One consequence of cheap borrowing is that Britons are doing more of it than ever. In absolute terms, UK consumer debt stands at ?199bn, compared with ?191bn in July 2007.※The good news is household income has also risen over this period, which along with low interest rates make this debt more affordable,§ he said.However, the household debt to disposable income ratio, which peaked at 159.7% in 2008, has started to rise again, up from 139.9% in 2015 to 142.6% in 2016."															
" Rising inflation and weak wage growth will leave Britain rooted to the bottom of the league table for living standards among the west＊s richest countries in 2018, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned.In the last piece of economic news before the general election, the Paris-based thinktank said the next government would spend the first 18 months of the next parliamentary term presiding over a severe squeeze on real incomes.The  said inflation at 2.7% during 2018 would dwarf wage growth of 1.5% and result in the UK have the weakest real income performance, alongside Finland, of any of its 34 rich member states.The TUC general secretary, Frances O＊Grady, said it was alarming that UK workers would face the biggest real wage fall of any advanced economy in 2018, while other OECD members, with the exception of Italy and Mexico, would experience real wage increases in 2018.She said: ※Boosting wages has to be a top priority for whoever gets the keys to Downing Street. British workers still haven＊t recovered from the last financial crisis. The last thing they can afford is another hit on their finances.§The west＊s leading economic thinktank has predicted a tentative recovery for the global economy this year and next but warned of risks from fragile trust in government, weak wage growth and persistent inequality.In its latest health check on growth prospects, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development described the outlook for the global economy almost a decade on from the financial crash as ※better, but not good enough§. The Paris-based organisation nudged up its forecasts for global growth this year. But it trimmed its outlook for the US, to show growth accelerating a little more gently than in its previous . The OECD made no changes to previous predictions that the UK will suffer a Brexit-related slowdown, with growth easing from 1.8% in 2016 to 1.6% this year and just 1% in 2018.But after being a strong supporter of austerity measures to curb Britain＊s budget deficit after the end of the 2008-09 recession, the thinktank said it was time for a different approach.※The budget deficit is projected to remain broadly unchanged this year, but fiscal consolidation is planned for 2018 despite a weaker growth outlook. Instead, further fiscal initiatives to increase public investment should be considered to support demand in the near term and boost supply in the longer term,§ it said.Labour seized on the report as evidence of OECD backing for its proposal to bolster public borrowing for investment by ?250bn over the next decade. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the thinktank＊s conclusion was ※a hammer blow for the Tories＊ economic credibility§. He added: ※The OECD＊s call for increased investment in our economy is a ringing endorsement of Labour＊s economic policy in this election, and shows the clear choice voters have on Thursday.§Referring to the UK＊s decline in GDP growth in the past six months, Catherine Mann, the OECD＊s chief economist, said recent data had been poor and the benefit of the lower pound for exporters was offset by inflationary pressures from higher import prices hitting disposable incomes.※We are concerned about the purchasing power for consumers in an environment where the pass through [from higher import prices] seems pretty robust,§ she said.After 3% growth in 2016, the global economy is expected to expand by 3.5% this year and 3.6% in 2018. That compares with previous forecasts of 3.3% and 3.6% respectively.※After many years of weak recovery, with global growth in 2016 at the lowest rate since 2009, some signs of improvement have begun to appear,§ Mann wrote in the OECD＊s latest . After June＊s EU referendum result, the OECD was, like many forecasters, forced to  from the Brexit vote. Its latest outlook noted there was support for UK growth from low interest rates and from planned spending cuts being pushed back. But echoing , the group said the pound＊s sharp drop since the Brexit vote had pushed up inflation, denting household income growth and household spending. It also warned business investment would decline sharply, amid continuing uncertainty about the future relationship between the UK and the EU. "															
															
"Shares in Britain＊s biggest companies reached record levels on Friday as a slump in the pound boosted the value of firms with overseas earnings.The FTSE 100 jumped 63 points to close the day at 7,547, closely followed by the  250, seen as a better barometer of the health of UK business, which also reached an all-time closing high, rising 57 points to 20,024.The strong performance of the stock market followed a fall in the pound, which racked up its worst falls since early February less than two weeks before the election.  sank against the euro and by a full percentage point against the dollar to below ?1.28, its lowest in a month and more than two cents below last week＊s six-month highs. Many of the UK＊s biggest companies earn the majority of their earnings in dollars and have enjoyed a strong surge in earnings since the  vote, which triggered a near 25% fall in the pound before settling at around 15% in recent months.Rolls-Royce was among many firms with the majority of their earnings from overseas to gain from the higher value of the dollar. GlaxoSmithKline was also boosted by an upgrade of the pharmaceuticals group by analysts from ※hold§ to ※buy§, rising 25.5p to ?16.43.The pound also suffered after an upgrade in US GDP growth, which increased to 1.2% against an earlier estimate of just 0.7%, strengthened the dollar. Strong signals that the eurozone continues to gain momentum added to the euro＊s strength. A survey of German business leaders found they expect exports to grow further despite reaching record highs.Surveys of British businesses have added to optimistic forecasts after the UK＊s GDP growth in the first quarter was downgraded to 0.2% from 0.3%. A survey by the CBI of services firms earlier this week found that optimism increased markedly on the previous month and investment intentions were upbeat.But analysts said the catalyst for sterling＊s fall was a YouGov poll in The Times giving Labour 38% of the vote, three points up on last week, and the Conservatives down one point at 43%, possibly handing May only a slim majority in parliament.It was conducted on Wednesday and Thursday and marks Labour＊s best standing in the polls since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in September 2015.The assumption that the Tories would win handsomely, apparently strengthening May＊s hand in talks on leaving the European Union, has driven the pound higher since she called an election for 8 June. The running logic of financial markets was that a big victory would let May face down hardline Brexiters in her party to make compromises needed for a smoother departure. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: ※With the pound already under pressure due to weaker than expected economic data, this surprise poll has acted as an additional catalyst in pushing the pound to a two-month low against the euro and its lowest level this month against the US dollar. ※Having started the campaign on a ＆strong and stable＊ footing, recent policy mis-steps by Mrs May have seen the election campaign take on the look of an ＆ugly contest＊ of mediocre candidates, and that appears to be being reflected in the recent performance of the pound.§ Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester, said: ※Sterling is likely to continue to be under pressure now until the election is out of the way, if polling continues to indicate its a tighter race.※For the market the worst outcome is if we have further uncertainty with the chances of a hung parliament.§ Adam Cole, head of G10 strategy with RBC in London, said: ※YouGov says the swing in the latest poll is probably due to Conservative manifesto commitments, some of which have changed subsequently. ※There will likely be a large number of opinion polls over the weekend, so this picture could change either way in the next few days.§ YouGov said May＊s personal rating improved from -8 on Monday, the night of her U-turn on the controversial social care ※dementia tax§ proposal, to +1 in the following days, while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn＊s personal rating slipped from -11 每 his best position in the campaign 每 to -16.

"t was at Bradford University on Tuesday that Jeremy Corbyn . In the grand hall, Corbyn spoke to an enthusiastic gathering of students and party faithful about the concrete plans Labour has to transform Britain into a country where the many will prosper instead of the few. Corbyn spoke about the need to properly fund the NHS, provide free tuition to students, end the blight of zero-hours contracts, and raise the living wage to ?10 an hour.For me, a man who was born and bred in the harsh poverty of Britain after the first world war, it was inspiring. But what moved me most was the venue he chose to announce this manifesto of equality and fairness 每 because Bradford University is built on ground that, in my youth, was a site of great suffering and death.You see, within the boundaries of what is now the university campus, my boyhood dreams and idealism were crushed under the cruel weight of austerity during the Great Depression. When I was young, this was not a place where one＊s future was made but where it was condemned. The grounds that now hold this university contained a slum, and hope never penetrated its dark, enveloping canopy of destitution.My family arrived in the neighbourhood that once covered this well-maintained university as penniless and jobless economic migrants from Barnsley in 1929. Then, it was an endless, warren-like landscape of dilapidated houses that nestled in cul-de-sacs where no one expected to enjoy either a decent or a long life because there was no welfare state or . If hard luck struck, all that was available was poor relief, which paid a mean weekly stipend that guaranteed either starvation or homelessness.My family couldn＊t survive on poor relief, so we ended up living cheek by jowl in a doss house with a multitude of other desperate characters. Like us, all of them had been washed up on its doorstep like the flotsam that crashes on to a desolate beach after a terrible tempest. Soldiers from the first world war who had been promised a land fit for heroes by lying politicians resided in the doss where my family kipped. During the day, they still tried to hold themselves up bravely.Like my dad, these Tommies looked for work in a city whose factories had been hushed by the collapse of the world＊s economies. But at night when they tried to sleep, weary from unemployment and PTSD, I＊d hear their cries of terror because their dreams had sent them back into battle at Ypres or the Somme.As for me, my childhood was a nightmare of indentured servitude and malnutrition. At bedtime, my sister and I would huddle together for warmth on a piss-stained flock mattress on an unlit garret floor. We would try to quell the gnawing in our stomachs by wondering what our king had eaten for his tea that evening.Even while playing, my boyhood was never blissful. In this part of Bradford I was always reminded that death for the poor is miserable, brutal and lonely: from open windows, I heard the inhuman howls of cancer sufferers dying in agony because poverty denied them the dignity of morphine.But all of that  when, at the end of the second world war, the Labour party fought a general election on a manifesto that promised the creation of the NHS, affordable education, an end to that era＊s housing crisis and fair conditions for all workers. The Labour party＊s 2017 election manifesto echoes the sentiments found in Labour＊s 1945 manifesto that inspired my generation to build a just society.When I remember all the pain and sadness that once populated the part of Bradford that now houses its university, I can＊t think of a better tribute to all those whose lives were blighted by the Great Depression than for  to have unfurled its manifesto here for the nation to see.But I fear that the 2017 manifesto, no matter how just and how right for our times, may not catch the wind it needs to help this country sail forward to hope and prosperity because we have forgotten the hardships, tragedies and triumphs of my generation. It＊s sad for me to ponder how on Remembrance Sunday people speak solemnly about their commitment to never forgetting those who fell in war, while those uncountable lives that were cut short because of economic injustice throughout the early part of the 20th century  forgotten.I can tell you, as a very old man, that I am afraid for the future of ordinary people in Britain. Because by the time the next general election is scheduled, in 2022, most of those from my generation, who have survived for so long, will be dead or incapacitated. No one then may be left alive to remember the profound suffering, the hardship, the sorrow and the eventual victory all those nameless, ordinary people achieved in 1945 with election of a Labour government.Forgetting them, and the lessons your parents or grandparents taught you from their lives about how to overcome austerity and build a proper and just society, will condemn you to something far worse than I experienced growing up."															
"Labour and the unions accused the government of ignoring the plight of ordinary workers after UK pay growth fell below inflation in early 2017 for the first time in two-and-a-half years.Official figures showed that workers＊ average earnings rose by 2.1% year on year in the three months to March, the weakest increase since July of last year.With inflation running at 2.3% in the same period, that meant real-terms pay lagged by 0.2% in the first three months of the year, the first fall since the third quarter of 2014. The Labour party has made weak wage growth one of its main themes in the run-up to the general election on 8 June, which opinion polls suggest Theresa May is on course to win.Analysis by the Resolution Foundation showed that wages were still ?16 a week below their 2008 peak, leaving many families forced to borrow to make ends meet.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the figures revealed ※the Tories＊ total failure to improve the living standards of working families§.He said: ※Real wages are lower than they were in 2010 and, after seven years of the Tories, they are now falling again.§McDonnell has promised a Labour government would introduce a higher minimum wage and end to a cap on public sector pay rises.Analysts said Britain was breaking all the rules of the postwar era as record levels of employment and unemployment at a 42-year low failed to spur consistently strong wage increases.The unemployment rate in the period between January and March fell unexpectedly to 4.6%. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the rate to remain at 4.7%. The number of people in work rose by 122,000, taking the employment rate to a record 74.8%, the  said.John Philpott, the director of the JobsEconomist, said: ※This is a jobs market that looks better on paper than it feels in the pocket, reflecting a structural shift in the types of work people do and the relative bargaining power between workers and bosses. ※No wonder workers＊ rights, productivity and pay rather than the availability of jobs per se, is a key battleground in the UK general election campaign.§The TUC general secretary, Frances O＊Grady, said: ※Today＊s fall in real wages risks tipping working people into another living standards crisis. And that poses a major challenge for whoever forms the next government.※The big question for every party is 每 what＊s your plan to get Britain＊s wages rising again?§Liberal Democrat spokesman Vince Cable said:※This squeeze on living standards is almost certainly caused by the falling pound since the Brexit vote.※If Theresa May is allowed to pursue her extreme Brexit agenda, we can expect further weakening of the economy and erosion of people＊s living standards.§May, who has denied that the Brexit vote lies behind the broader economic slowdown, has said she is aware of the squeeze on household spending and that she will cap energy prices, a move that appears to break with the Conservative party＊s usual pro-market stance. But inflation has already moved up to 2.7% and is heading above 3%, according to many forecasters, adding to the pressure on politicians to act.The Bank of England is watching for signs of a pickup in wages that could add to inflation. So far it has judged that most of the pressure on shop prices has come from higher import costs that follow a sharp fall in the value of the pound.Sterling fell by almost a quarter against the dollar after the UK voted to leave the EU before a recovery in recent weeks that has limited to the drop to nearer 13%.  So far the Bank of England believes there is little pressure on most employers to raise pay sharply, which could feed a more permanent inflation problem.This week, a survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found that most large employers were preparing to raise wages by 1% this year.Other surveys have shown wage rises softening amid growing numbers of job cuts as Brexit uncertainty affects the labour market.  The Bank of England has softened its previous forecasts for a rise in unemployment, which it expects to stand at 4.7% this year, still above the level it considers inflationary. The ONS said workers＊ total earnings including bonuses rose by an annual 2.4% in the first quarter of 2017, edging up from growth of 2.3% in the three months to February. The Bank expects wages to rise by 2% this year before picking up in 2018 and 2019, though it has forecast a stronger outlook in all of the last seven years only to be proved overly optimistic. The ONS said the number of unemployment benefit claimants rose by 19,400 to just under 793,000 in April, slower than an increase of 33,500 in March."															
"The unemployment rate hit a 16-year low in May but the pace of hiring slowed as the economy added 138,000 jobs 每 well below expectations.The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Friday that the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.3%, the lowest level since 2001, all but guaranteeing that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next meeting this month.While the number of new jobs created in May was below the 180,000 that economists had been expecting, the US has now added jobs for 80 consecutive months. Wage growth, however, has remained weak and the number of people in part-time work has remained high.Expectations for a bumper jobs report had mounted after ADP, the US＊s largest private payroll processor, announced employers had added 253,000 jobs in May 每 well above the 180,000 economists had been expecting. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody＊s Analytics, said: ※Job growth is rip-roaring. The current pace of job growth is nearly three times the rate necessary to absorb growth in the labor force. Increasingly, businesses＊ number one challenge will be a shortage of labor.§But the Bureau of Labor Statistics report for May fell well short of expectations and the office cut its tally of employment gains in March and April by a combined 66,000 less than previously reported. With unemployment low and jobs growth continuing, the Fed has clearly signaled that it wants to raise rates twice more this year since raising rates in March. Officials then want to begin the process of selling off the $4.5tn portfolio of bonds and other assets the Fed built up as it fought to keep rates low and kick-start the economy after the recession.But the fractious political landscape may derail the Fed＊s plan. The White House is preparing for a fight over raising the federal debt limit and approving government funding that, if not resolved, could rock the  and global stock markets and cause the Fed to put its plans on hold.The latest report once again highlighted the uneven nature of the economic recovery since the recession. The unemployment rate for whites was 3.7% in May, while the rate was 7.5% for African Americans and 5.2% for Hispanics.Mark Hamrick, Bankrate.com＊s senior economic analyst, said: ※While the Federal Reserve might not be dissuaded from raising interest rates at this month＊s meeting, the jobs numbers might make the debate at least more vigorous. The lack of more substantial inflation also argues against a future trajectory of aggressive rate hikes.§"															
															
"or the first few months after his election, Donald Trump was cast by many in the financial markets as the reincarnation of . His plans for deep and widespread tax cuts and a bonfire of regulations would, they said, spark a business renaissance akin to that credited to the stetson-wearing president who dominated the 1980s.Stock market investors lapped up Trump＊s speeches and tweets, and sent?the main New York share indices to fresh highs. Last October, before the US election, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was chugging sideways below 18,000. By the first week of March, its value had topped 21,000, a rise of almost 17%.Now the market is moving sideways again 每 and for the simple reason that, after watching and listening to Trump since his inauguration, it has priced in most of the gains investors believe he can make for them, which over the next few years will still be bountiful, but decidedly more modest than first?predicted.That＊s why America＊s central banker, Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve, made it clear last week that US interest rates would rise to at most 1.5% this year. The  increased its base rate range to between 0.75% and 1% at its March meeting, and Yellen said there would probably be just two more quarter-point rises this year.She was under pressure from Republicans to signal a more rapid increase, but was clear in her view that a Trump boom is still just a twinkle in the former property developer＊s eye.A study by consultancy Oxford  illustrates why the markets have joined the Fed in adopting a more cautious stance. It argues that Reagan entered office in a deeper hole and therefore had more room to expand. To boost growth, Reagan could also pull levers that are beyond Trump＊s grasp.In 1981, the global economy was adjusting to the two oil price shocks of the 1970s. The US was in recession and unemployment and inflation were high. Reagan＊s cabinet spent much of its time talking about tax cuts and a radical overhaul of corporate and labour laws to set business free, but, as Oxford Economics point out, they mostly switched on the public spending taps.It was a Keynesian boost that put money in people＊s pockets and invited them to spend it. ※From 1982 to 1986,§ says the report, ※the budget deficit rose from 1.8% of GDP to around 4.5% of GDP 每 an overall stimulus approaching 3% of GDP, which was sustained over four years. Government investment growth hit double digits in 1984-85, including a major rise in defence spending.§Jobs were created and imports rocketed. The budget deficit and the balance of trade worsened. The dollar soared. Paul Volker, Reagan＊s Fed chief, increased interest rates to quell domestic inflation.To emphasise how different things are now, the Fed raised rates last week, aware that, like the stock markets, the dollar had already run out of steam. It hit a 14-year high against a basket of currencies in November, but has since tracked downwards.※The prospects for dollar gains on a similar scale to the 1980s look thin,§ the report goes on. ※The dollar was weak in 1980 but has seen strong gains since 2014 and may be moderately overvalued. And while we think the dollar is more sensitive to small rises in rate [differences with other economies] than previously, that sensitivity cuts both ways and quite a lot is arguably already priced into markets in terms of Fed rate hikes. So we expect dollar gains from here to be modest.§Oxford Economics argues that a cap on the dollar is not only a boon for US consumers, who will see imported inflation peak at a lower level, but will also help economies such as Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia, which must borrow in dollars at rates set by the Fed. Much of the pain created by Reagan＊s policies was exported to countries that relied on selling commodities to the west. Turkey will still suffer from higher borrowing costs, but its finance ministry will be relieved to find that the extremes of the Reagan era can be avoided.The lesson for the UK is that Tory claims for deregulation as a route to riches have no precedent, not even from the Reagan era. Tax cuts can help, but both this government and the last have found themselves imposing more taxes than they cut, to a point where the ratio of tax income to GDP is at its highest in 30 years.Reagan borrowed to spend, much to the disappointment of his free market friends, adding 3% of GDP to the US budget deficit. Such generosity with borrowed money is not an option for Philip Hammond, at least not on the scale used in 1980s America.All Hammond can hope for is that the assessment of recent weeks that Trump is a benign force, who will neither emulate Reagan nor be a disaster, turns out to be true. Given the parlous state of the UK＊s public finances after eight years of austerity, he needs all the help he can get."															
"William Keegan reminds us that austerity was, and is, a policy choice (※§, Business, last week). It is based on ※the Conservative party＊s obsession with shrinking the size of the state and minimising the so-called ＆tax burden＊?§, a ※burden§ that Keegan also wisely reminds us ※helps to ensure we have decent hospitals, schools and infrastructure generally§.This is a deadly obsession that has long passed its sell-by date. Ask a Conservative to defend it and they will reply by asking you if you want to end up like Greece, ※a failing state§. The answer to that can be found in Raoul Martinez＊s superb new book, . He retells the story of Iceland, whose banking collapse was worse than any, but whose people refused to allow its government to accede to the IMF＊s austerity demands.As a result, ※by 2015, even the IMF had to admit ＃ [Iceland] had achieved economic recovery ＆without compromising its welfare model＊. In fact, it became the first crisis-struck European nation to top its pre-crisis peak of economic output and is close to repaying many of the debts it owed to other nations.§ The Icelanders rioted to achieve this. We could do it by electing a party that opposes austerity.LiverpoolWill Hutton is probably right in his overall assessment of Rutger Bregman＊s  (※§, The New Review, last week). However, his reasoning against a universal basic income 每 that it would be impossible to ※reconfigure our core hard wiring so we don＊t object to anyone anywhere getting a guaranteed income for no better reason than they are alive§ 每 hardly holds water. Has he never heard of royalty?Haywards HeathTom Kibasi is wrong (※§, Comment, last week) to blame free movement for Britain＊s ※low skill, low wage, low productivity economic model§. This is the result of the long arc of neoliberal politics, from Thatcher, Blair and Osborne to Hammond: deregulation, austerity, pay freezes, extreme labour flexibility, poor minimum wage, zero-hours contracts, shackled trade unions, uninhibited corporate greed and lack of state investment in industry and skills.These are not the necessary consequence of free movement: Germany invests in skills and industry, France regulates its labour market. EU workers account for only a small portion of UK wage-cutting and fill a vital range of skills in health, social care, academia, high tech, agriculture, food processing, transport and hospitality.Kibasi＊s analysis confirms the scapegoating of immigration that led to the Brexit vote, with Labour now sadly joining the Conservatives in opposing free movement. Yet a robust defence of the economic and social benefits of immigration is the only way to stop the looming hard Brexit.University of LiverpoolThe proposal to house people living on the streets (※§, News, last week) is commendable. However, prominence is given to Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, who introduced universal credit 每 with a punitive sanctioning policy that withholds benefits, even for minor infringements, plus the scrapping of the direct payment of housing benefits. Is he not aware that his policies have created an ongoing, and increasing, problem of homelessness among those who find themselves unable to pay their rent? LiverpoolThe Church of England and the mayor of London have given boroughs the go-ahead to cut down woods and trees for inner-city burial. Our cemeteries contain hundreds of hectares of trees. Many are nature reserves. Camberwell Old Cemetery, in East Dulwich, has been dubbed ※London＊s forgotten Valhallah§ and is a Grade I site of borough importance for nature conservation 每 home to bats, owls and other wildlife.

Let＊s settle it once and for all, by holding a referendum to see if Scots want another independence referendum.Edinburgh"															
"One of the more striking things about economic debate in this country is that there is a broad call for ※more reform§ and yet an equally narrow view of what such reform should constitute.Economic reform is often synonymous with reducing labour costs and increasing after-tax profit, because much of the debate is generated by those whose view of the world and position in life is benefitted by such outcomes. But many of these styles of reform are most suited to an economy that might be passing us by 每 one where output is greatly disconnected from employment. While watching the latest X-Men movie, Logan, one scene that particularly stood out for me was when the characters drove along a highway featuring driverless trucksThe trucks have no cabins and are essentially just containers on wheels. It was a particularly soulless vision of the future, in which there was not only automation but where the suggestion that humans had any control of say steering wheels or windscreen wipers, was absent too. The path of automation is of course not sci-fi, but with us right now. And while there is the hope that, as with the industrial revolution, new technology will create many new jobs, the current path appears to be to making jobs redundant and creating new work that is also able to be automated. This new economy should be a more productive one 每 after all, there is no need to automate if humans are able to produce the same level of output in the same time for the same cost. But as manufacturing workers around the world have discovered, greater productivity does not mean greater hours of work. So automation might be a future with more output but fewer jobs. So what to do? And what good is cutting penalty rates to lower costs for people working in takeaway shops when a robot is able to cook and wrap a burger (along with any other job that was once considered safe from automation because it was seen as a service)? One response put forward by the Greens leader Richard di Natale this week was to reduce the amount of work that people did and shift to a . Sometimes an idea is worth considering because the initial reaction is to shake your head and assume that couldn＊t work. So it is with the four-day week. Di Natale＊s proposal (and even he admits it is more about starting a discussion than anything concrete) would see people either go from an eight-hour day, five days a week to a 10-hour a day, four day a week job, or to reduce hours across the five days. The shift to a 10-four working week is not actually all that radical. It was pursued  for state employees from 2008 to 2011. Generally satisfaction among workers was high and, while offices were closed on Fridays, they were open longer on other days. The  每 not much difference in productivity, some were marginally better, some the same, some services saw improved wait times, but it was less successful for those agencies that had to deal with federal authorities who expected them to be open on Fridays. That such a change in hours however did not result in massive disruption and enabled government services to continue to operate successfully says a bit about how such ideas might seem on first blush to be impossible, but actually are quite doable. But the more radical switch is to actually reduce the hours in the working week 每 either a five days week with six hours or a four days week of eight hours. While there is evidence of  going down that route and being successful, it＊s a great deal different to shift to it being standard for all workers. But then the 40-hour week is not some pre-ordained amount of time that we must work. The idea is that if we work fewer hours then there is greater opportunity for more people to work. But you can see the difficulties 每 people might wish their unemployed neighbour to have a job, but how many would give up hours to ensure they can? John Maynard Keynes was suggesting working fewer hours  每 because of increases in technology his grandchildren would only need to work 15 hours a week. He argued that ※the course of affairs will simply be that there will be ever larger and larger classes and groups of people from whom problems of economic necessity have been practically removed§.We don＊t of course work 15 hours a week, even though many of us could and enjoy a standard of living as good as the average person in 1930. When given the option of working fewer hours with more leisure time and keeping the same standard of living, or working the same hours and improving our standard of living, we have mostly chosen the later. And that in itself is not bad, but it works only if there is the option of working those hours. But what if automation reduces national employment by 20%? What happens to those people who are left out? On the current welfare system we would see massive gaps in inequality and a pretty horrific change in the look of our society. Economist  argues if we all worked 20% fewer hours (that is a four-day week), combined with a universal basic income, the massive cut in employment need not occur, and neither would the huge increase in inequality.That sure is radical, and of course comes with the question of cost. But I always get a bit bemused when I hear talk of the productivity wonders of automation combined with talk that we need to reduce the taxation of the profits derived from that process. We know an automated world is coming. The problem with much of the economic debate in this country is that it is conducted by those who are currently free of pressures of that process. No one is really arguing the shift to a four-day week needs to happen right now. But as we have seen with energy policy and with climate change, there is not much good knowing things are coming and not only doing nothing, but not even considering doing anything. "															
"ising food and fuel costs are expected to have pushed inflation to its highest level in more than three years when official figures are released on Tuesday, underscoring the impact of the Brexit-battered pound on prices in the shops.Economists predict that the data will show inflation, on the consumer prices index (CPI) measure, hitting 2.1% for February, up from .If proven correct, this forecast, from a Reuters poll of economists, would see inflation at its highest level since November 2013, and above the Bank of England＊s government-set target of 2%.The sharp fall in the pound since the Brexit vote last summer has raised the price of imported goods such as fuels, metals and food ingredients. The pressure on import costs has sparked some high-profile price tussles between suppliers and retailers, . Earlier this year,  to reflect sterling＊s sharp depreciation. That currency effect has combined with a rise in global oil prices to push inflation higher in recent months, causing a rude awakening for consumers, who had enjoyed near-zero inflation throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016.Howard Archer of consultancy IHS Markit predicts that Tuesday＊s figures will confirm the rising trend for inflation: ※Inflation is expected to have been lifted in February by significantly increased food prices. We expect consumer price inflation to trend markedly higher over the coming months, as sterling weakness increasingly feeds through, and overall higher oil and commodity prices impact. Additionally, several utility companies have announced electricity and/or gas price hikes in March and April.§Philip Shaw of Investec is also expecting evidence of upward pressure on inflation from food as well as fuel. He sees a chance that fashion stores also got in on the price hikes in February, after cutting prices in January. ※Clothing prices fell unexpectedly sharply last month, which may well herald a strong rebound this time,§ he says.Shaw and other economists are predicting that inflation will continue rising and go above 3% this year. Wage growth, meanwhile, has been slowing, so households are seeing their real 每 or inflation-adjusted 每 incomes deteriorate.That pattern prompted a leading thinktank to warn recently that workers are on course to suffer . The  (IFS) said average earnings would be no higher in 2022 than they were in 2007, and predicted that welfare cuts would compound the financial pain for many.Such forecasts bode ill for hopes that the UK economy can continue to show resilience in the face of Brexit-related uncertainty. , the main driver of growth, is expected to flag as incomes are squeezed.The rise in inflation will intensify the debate at the  over the right time to increase interest rates from their current record low of 0.25%.The Bank＊s monetary policy committee (MPC), under governor Mark Carney, has maintained that it is happy to let inflation rise some way above its target as it trades off the need to support growth and jobs with keeping price rises in check. But the minutes of its meeting last week suggested .One of the nine MPC policymakers, Kristin Forbes, voted for a rate rise at that meeting, while others indicated that it would not take much for them to join her. But economists are doubtful whether enough supporters would emerge for a rate hike any time soon.※The risks to the MPC＊s near-term forecast for output are probably skewed slightly to the downside, and there is a risk that uncertainty will build as article 50 is triggered and the EU negotiations get under way,§ say Paul Hollingsworth and Scott Bowman at consultancy Capital . ※As a result, we continue to think that the MPC will hold off until around the end of next year before raising interest rates.§This week＊s inflation data will mark the first time the Office for National Statistics will have used a , which is ※consumer prices index including owner-occupiers＊ housing costs§.Some economists say CPIH is lacking as a measure because by using figures based on ※rent equivalence§, it does not truthfully capture people＊s experience of the housing market. CPIH  and has yet to regain it. Capital Economics thinks that CPIH rose to 2.2% in February, from 1.9% in January."															
															
"Worries about the economic outlook and a squeeze on household budgets dented consumer confidence this month, according to a closely watched survey.The monthly barometer of consumer mood from the market research firm GfK dropped to its lowest level since the aftermath of last summer＊s EU referendum.Based on polling of 2,000 people before and after the , the index hit -10 for June. That was down markedly from -5 in May and worse than forecasts for a -7 reading in a Reuters poll of economists.All measures in the survey deteriorated in June: people＊s view of their personal financial situation over the past year and over the coming year; their view of the general economic situation; and their appetite for making big purchases such as furniture.The report follows  thanks to a combination of lacklustre wage growth and rising inflation. Inflation has been rising on the back of a weak pound since the Brexit vote, which has made imports to the UK more expensive.Joe Staton at GfK noted that the overall index was just two points above the -12 reading in July last year when confidence tumbled after the referendum.※The scores on the general economic situation looking forward and back 12 months are now particularly weak,§ Staton added.※Strong consumer spending has propped up the economy since last June but now the twin pressures of higher prices and sluggish wage growth are squeezing household finances and adding to widespread fears of a Brexit-induced economic slowdown.§The UK economy confounded gloomy forecasts for a sharp slowdown after the Brexit vote but . Economic forecasters widely expect that growth this year will be significantly lower than in 2016 as Brexit talks weigh on business confidence and .There were further signs of consumer worries in separate polling by Lloyds Bank published on Friday. It found the proportion of people feeling good about their personal finances fell last month as rising prices and slow wage growth took their toll.The proportion of consumers reporting a positive assessment of their personal financial situation dipped to 63% in May from 65% in April.The survey also showed a rise in the proportion of people feeling pessimistic about inflation after it . The proportion of people who said they had money left over after they had covered all monthly outgoings fell to 80% in May from 84% in April.※Inflation continues to be front of mind when people consider the health of their personal finances. With consumers now reporting a significant impact on their disposable income, there＊s simply less money left over each month for buying the occasional treat,§ said Robin Bulloch, managing director at Lloyds.※And while recent falls in forecourt petrol prices may provide some relief, it＊s the rising cost of food and drink which continues to really stretch the purse strings. With little change in these broad trends likely in the short term, households should prepare for a further squeeze on their spending power in the months ahead.§"															
															
"or the past two years, the global economy has been growing, but it has swung between periods of rapid expansion and deceleration. During this period, two episodes, in particular, caused US and global equity prices to fall by about 10%. Is a pattern emerging, or is a fitful global recovery set to stabilise?The first episode came in August-September 2015, when many observers feared China＊s economy was heading for a hard landing. The second episode, in January-February 2016, also stemmed from concerns about China. But investors were also increasingly worried about stalling US growth, collapsing oil and commodity prices, rapid interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, and unconventional negative-rate monetary policies in Europe and Japan.Each deceleration episode lasted for about two months, at which point the correction in equity prices began to reverse. Investors＊ fears were not borne out, and central banks began to ease their monetary policies; or, in the case of the Fed, put rate hikes on hold.As a third example, one could cite the period after the UK＊s EU referendum in June 2016. But that episode was more short-lived. It did not cause a global slowdown, owing to the small size of the UK economy and monetary easing at the time. In fact, in the months before the US election last November, the global economy entered a new period of expansion 每 albeit one in which advanced and emerging-market economies＊ potential growth remained low.We may still be living in what the International Monetary Fund calls the  每 or what the Chinese call the  每 of low potential growth. And yet economic activity has started to increase in the US, Europe and the eurozone, Japan, and key emerging markets.Owing to new stimulus measures, China＊s growth rate has stabilised, and emerging markets such as India, other Asian countries, and even Russia and Brazil 每 which experienced recessions between 2014 and 2016 每 are all doing better. So, even before the US presidential election had inspired ※Trump trades,§ a ※reflation trade§ had signalled a new phase of modest global expansion.Recent economic data from around the world suggests growth could now accelerate. And yet one cannot rule out the possibility that the current expansion will turn into another global slowdown 每 if not an outright stall 每 if some downside risks materialise.For example, markets have clearly been too bullish on Donald Trump. The US president will not be able to pass any of the radical growth policies he has proposed; and any policy changes that he does make will have a limited impact. Contrary to what the administration＊s budget projections claim, annual economic growth in the US has almost no chance of accelerating from 2% to 3%.At the same time, markets have underestimated the risks of Trump＊s policy proposals. For example, the administration could still pursue protectionist measures that would precipitate a trade war, and it has imposed migration restrictions that will probably reduce growth by eroding the labour supply.Moreover, Trump might continue to engage in corporatist micromanagement, which would disrupt the private sector＊s investment, employment, production, and pricing decisions. And his fiscal policy proposals would provide excessive stimulus to an economy that is close to full employment. This would force the Fed to raise interest rates even faster, which would derail the US＊s recovery by increasing long-term borrowing costs and strengthening the dollar.Indeed, Trump has introduced such profound fiscal uncertainty that the Fed could make a mistake in its own policymaking. If it does not increase rates fast enough, inflation might balloon out of control. The Fed would then have to hike rates rapidly to catch up at the risk of triggering a recession. A related risk is that increasing rates too slowly could lead to an asset-price bubble and all the dangers 每 frozen credit markets, soaring unemployment, plummeting consumption, and more 每 implied by its inevitable deflation.The Fed chair, Janet Yellen, is unlikely to make a mistake. But over the course of the next year, Trump will have the option of appointing five, and possibly six, new members to the Fed＊s seven-member board of governors. If he chooses poorly, the risk of serious policy errors will increase substantially.Markets are also underestimating the , many of which stem from Trump＊s confused and risky foreign policies. Indeed, the global economy could be destabilised by any number of scenarios involving the US. A military confrontation between the US and North Korea now seems plausible. So, too, does a diplomatic or military conflict between the US and Iran that results in an oil supply shock; or a trade war between the US and China that escalates into a larger geopolitical conflict.But Trump is not the only global risk. China has resorted to a fresh round of credit-fuelled fixed investment to stabilise its growth rate. That means it will have to deal with more toxic assets, debt, leverage, and overcapacity in the medium term. And because growth and economic stability will top the agenda at the Chinese Communist party＊s national congress this year, discussions about how to rebalance growth and implement structural changes will take a back seat. But if China does not jumpstart a structural overhaul and contain its debt explosion by next year, the risk of a hard landing will return.Elsewhere, the recent Dutch and French election results, and favourable expectations for the German election in September, have reduced the risk that populists will come to power in Europe. But the EU and eurozone are still in an economic slough. Market fears of a disintegrating eurozone will return if the anti-euro Five Star Movement comes to power in Italy＊s next election, which could be held early this autumn.In the next year, a more robust and persistent global recovery will depend largely on whether policymakers avoid mistakes that could derail it. At least we know where those mistakes are most likely to be made."															
"As your article highlights (, 26 May), the demographic shift that we are currently facing may put financial strains on the economy unless changes to both employment and recruitment practices towards older workers are addressed. However, our increasing longevity needs to be seen as an opportunity, not a financial burden.The fact we are living longer means we can enjoy longer careers, and it is estimated that extending the average working life by just one year could increase GDP by 1%, or ?20bn by 2023. Our research has shown that people derive benefits from working in later life, as long as that work is fulfilling.We need employers to actively retain, retrain and recruit older workers, and give them the same opportunities that younger employees enjoy when it comes to training, development and career progression.By 2020, one in three workers will be over 50 in the UK. If more of us are needing to work for longer, we will need to change our attitudes and ways of working. How we work and retire will be very different from our parents and grandparents. Employers need to consider more flexible ways of working to support older workers."															
"Over the last half-century, the story of America＊s cities is a tale of booms and busts. New York and tech hubs like San Francisco 每 once cities in financial distress 每 have transformed into economic powerhouses. At the other extreme, one-time prosperous manufacturing cities like Detroit now find themselves in economic turmoil. Viewed in isolation, the economic fates of these cities would seem to bear little resemblance to each other. However, they all share a common thread: since 1970 these cities, like nearly every other major American city, have experienced a ※hollowing out§ of the middle class.The graphic above shows the change in income distribution in 20 major US cities between 1970 and 2015. In 1970, each of these cities exhibits a near-symmetrical, bell-shaped income distribution 每 a high concentration of households in the middle, with narrow tails of low and high-income households on either end. By 2015, the distributions have grown more polarised 每 fewer middle-income households, and more households in the low-income and/or high-income extremes.The growing polarisation of wealth in US cities is quite stark when viewed geographically. The maps below show the changing distribution of wealth in four US cities between 1970 and 2015. All dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation.New York in the 1970s was a city in full-on economic distress. Unemployment topped 10%, a ballooning public debt brought the city to the brink of bankruptcy, and residents were fleeing from the city centre to its suburban outskirts.Fast forward to 2015 and the pattern has reversed. New York is among the wealthiest cities in the country, with the heaviest concentration of wealth in central Manhattan. Residents living in the purple areas in the map have median household incomes of greater than $120,000. In Manhattan＊s wealthiest areas, the tallest purple spikes, median household incomes exceed $250,000.Despite New York＊s good economic fortunes, low income areas (those coloured white-yellow) remain as numerous today as they were in 1970. Today they comprise 42% of New York＊s Census tracts v 43% in 1970.In 1970, San Francisco＊s income distribution is notable for the absence of high-income neighbourhoods. Of the 196 areas shown in the map, none had a median income high enough to reach the top two income tiers (those coloured dark red or purple). The city itself resembles a sloped plane, with incomes gradually declining from their highest point in the south-west to their lowest point in the north-east.Since then, San Francisco＊s economic geography has undergone a complete reversal. Today, it is predominantly a city of upper-middle to high-income households. The once low-income neighbourhoods in the city＊s north-east, near its urban core, are today its wealthiest. In 1970, Detroit was one of the wealthiest cities in the US. By 2015, the wealth appears to have radiated outward from its sunken, white centre to its fringes. Even in Detroit, a city that is now synonymous with economic distress, the number of high income areas (dark red-purple) has remained largely unchanged since 1970.Like its Rust Belt neighbour Detroit, Chicago boasted a thriving manufacturing sector in 1970. Incomes were lowest in the city centre, growing higher radially outward toward the city＊s borders.Chicago was largely successful transitioning away from manufacturing to a service-based economy. This shift is evident in the bifurcated pattern present in 2015 每 a heavy concentration of wealth in the business/financial district and marked decline in the surrounding area."															
"ritain looks like a full employment economy. . The unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1975. There are hundreds of thousands of job vacancies.But Britain doesn＊t feel like a full employment economy. When the jobless rate was this low in previous economic cycles, wages were rising because employers were competing for scarce labour. Firms were investing in new capital equipment because workers were becoming more expensive. Productivity was increasing.Today none of that is happening. Wage growth is not picking up. Instead, it is stuck at the new normal of 2%. There are skill shortages but this is not translating into higher average earnings. Investment is weak and productivity is falling because the growth in the employed population is running ahead of the increase in national output.John Philpott, an economist who specialises in employment, is right when he says the UK labour market looks better on paper than it feels in the pocket. It is unprecedented for record levels of employment to coincide with the workforce getting poorer.One reason for the weakness of earnings growth is the ferocious squeeze on public sector pay, which 每 stripped of bonus payments 每 is rising at just 1.3% a year.A second factor is that employers are able to buy in cheap labour from overseas. Migration from other EU countries has not fallen off a cliff despite the result of last summer＊s referendum: according to the Office for National Statistics, the number of non-UK nationals from the EU working in the UK rose by 171,000 to 2.32 million between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. This continues a trend, which has seen the number of workers from the other 27 EU countries double since the recession of 2008-09.Finally, the nature of work seems to have changed.  has shown that earnings growth for the self-employed 每 who account for 15% of the workforce 每 has been particularly weak in recent years. People are working flat out in the gig economy but still struggling to make ends meet. The labour market has, for want of a better word, been Uberised."															
"The government has sold its remaining shares in  in a landmark moment for the banking sector almost a decade after the ?20.3bn bailout of the high street lender.It will be confirmed on Wednesday that the Treasury has finally extricated itself from its shareholding in the bank 每 owner of Halifax, Bank of Scotland and Scottish Widows 每which it rescued during at the depths of the financial crisis.At its peak, the government owned 43% of Lloyds but through a series of share sales this has now fallen to zero. This is in stark contrast to , which was rescued at the same time and in which taxpayers still own a stake of more than 70%.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has already said the government has  in Lloyds, which rescued HBOS at the depths of the financial crisis.While Hammond＊s figures do not include the ?3.6bn cost of borrowing the bailout funds, the bank＊s chief executive, , told last week＊s annual general meeting that the government would make at least ?500m from its investment in Lloyds.The chief executive will now face questions about whether he intends to stay on at the bank, which he joined in 2011 which has cost Lloyds more than ?17bn.He has received about ?40m through salary, pensions, benefits and share bonuses since taking the helm and the removal of the taxpayer stake means he will have met the conditions attached to some of those bonuses, which will be released next year.The turnaround of the bank has in part been fuelled by ＊s cost-cutting programme, which has taken a toll on jobs. Some 57,000 job cuts have been announced since 2008, although some of these were the result of merging Lloyds and HBOS before he arrived.Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said ※significant progress has been made over the past eight years§ since the bailout. Then, he said, the bank had an ※unsustainable§ loan to deposit ratio of 177% 每 which made it reliant on borrowing on the markets to fund its growth. This has now fallen to 107% 每 almost a balance between its savers and depositors and requiring less funding on the financial markets.Nearly ?200bn of problem loans and businesses have been sold off and the bank has given up its international ambitions. Once operating in 30 countries, it now remains in just six 每 leaving it open to concern that it is vulnerable to any economic slowdown in the UK caused by Brexit. Lloyds has a 25% share of UK current accounts, 22% of retail deposits and 21% of mortgages, and as a result of the takeover of credit card company MBNA it will have a 26% share of credit card lending.However, Gordon said the bank＊s outlook was ※set fair§ and that it could produce stable earnings in the future. Neil Woodford, one of the City＊s most respected fund managers, admitted last week he had bought shares in Lloyds after shunning the banking sector for many years.  because of concern about the fines it faced. Lloyds shares closed on Tuesday at 70p 每 below the 73.6p average price that taxpayers paid them in three stages during the crisis 每 and, Gordon pointed out, similar to the 69p level they were trading at when Horta-Os車rio was appointed to the role.While the last chunk of shares have been sold at a loss, below that breakeven price, the bulk were sold at a profit. The fall in the share price meant that the government＊sto the public had to be abandoned.Lloyds is also battling with the legal issues. As well as the ongoing PPI scandal, it is currently facing criticism of its handling of compensation to the victims of the fraud in the HBOS Reading branch. Among those complaining is .

" finance ministers have failed to agree a debt relief plan for Greece, raising the prospect of a summer crisis for the single currency bloc if Athens misses a loan repayment.A meeting of the eurozone＊s 19 finance ministers broke up late on Monday night, amid a row with the International Monetary Fund about Greece＊s debt burden.The standoff came just hours after France and Germany pledged to deepen co-operation in the single currency and seize Brexit opportunities for their banking industries.After more than eight hours of talks in Brussels, Greece＊s creditors 每 the eurozone members states and the IMF 每 were unable to bridge their differences on Greece＊s ability to repay its debts in the long run. ※We were very close and we were just unable to manage it tonight,§ said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who chaired the meeting. He said he hoped for a deal at the next eurozone meeting on 15 June.The eurozone-IMF standoff is the final obstacle to  unlocking a tranche of bailout funds that will let it repay 7.3bn (?6.3bn) of loans due to be paid in July.The EU , an unprecedented third bailout that stopped the country from crashing out of the eurozone.Although the headline figure has been approved, Greece needs to carry out scores of detailed reforms before receiving the cash, which is paid in instalments.  but the latest payment has been held up for months.It appeared the way was clear earlier in May when the Greek government agreed to  demanded by creditors. However, a dispute between creditors has become a major stumbling block.Northern European countries do not want to sign off cheques for Greece unless the IMF agrees to be part of the third bailout. Countries such as Germany and the Netherlands think the IMF will add rigour to the programme and fear the EU institutions will be too soft on Athens.But the IMF has so far refused to get involved in Greece＊s third bailout because officials think the country＊s debts cannot be managed in the long-run. The Washington-based fund has repeatedly said it is looking for ※a credible strategy to restore debt sustainability§.At the heart of the dispute is a demand that Greece run a budget surplus equivalent to 3.5% of GDP. The European side thinks Greece can hit this target, but the IMF has long argued that any country with high unemployment, (currently 23% in Greece) would struggle to meet such demanding fiscal targetsover decadesIn a sign of a possible concession, Dijsselbloem said there had been ※full agreement that the 3.5% primary surplus should remain for five years§ and eventually fall, although he did not specify a figure.The IMF continues to insist anything higher than a 1.5% surplus is not credible: its officials are urging the eurozone to be realistic about Greece＊s ability to keep a tight cap on public spending over decades.Speaking about Greece＊s debt sustainability, Dijsselbloem said there was a gap in expectations between the eurozone and the IMF. He said: ※We need to close that [gap] by looking at additional options or adjusting our expectations. Both are possible and both should be done.§ Poul Thomsen, the head of the IMF＊s European department, said Greece had adopted ※a much more growth friendly-programme§, but made clear the other creditors would have to give way on debt relief before the fund got on board. ※I am happy to say that we think we have a staff level-agreement on policy,§ he told journalists on Tuesday. ※This needs to be supplemented with a credible package on debt relief. Here we are making progress, there is no doubt about that, but we are not quite there yet.§ He wants to see ※more realism§ in the EU＊s growth forecasts for Greece and ※a bit more specificity§ on how the eurozone will ease the country＊s debt burden in the long-run.The IMF does not want to write off Greece＊s debts, but is arguing for longer grace and repayment periods so they do not weigh so heavily on its economy.Earlier on Monday the French finance minister and his German counterpart pledged to work towards deeper integration of the single currency union. Bruno Le Maire and Wolfgang Sch?uble flew to Brussels in the same plane, after a press conference in Berlin where they announced a working group on eurozone reform.Le Maire, appointed by Emmanuel Macron after the French president＊s election victory, said failure to deliver results on reforming the eurozone would bring political extremists of the left and right to power. Referring to Britain＊s looming exit from the EU, Le Maire stressed France and Germany intended to seize any opportunities for their financial industries. ※We see in Brexit the possibility for our financial sectors to be more attractive than they were in the past. This means jobs, work, and wealth for our countries.§"															
"oll the clock back a year and Britain was in the middle of the EU referendum battle. The remain side was warning about the economic consequences of Brexit; the leave side was extolling the benefits of taking back control. Leave won decisively but narrowly enough to give the remainers hope that the public would rethink its decision.The general election campaign has exposed that hope as a fantasy.  is accepted as a political given by both the Conservatives and Labour. The Liberal Democrats have struggled despite promising to hold a second referendum. Britain will indeed ※take back control§ in early 2019. And then what?Much of the focus since the referendum has been on what sort of trade arrangements a Brexit Britain will have. The real focus should be on sorting out the long-term weaknesses of the economy. Countries with successful economies find markets for their exports no matter whether they are part of a single market or customs union. The real challenge is different. Britain, in the aggregate at least, cannot produce the wealth it is going to need to meet the challenges of an ageing population. This would be the case in or out of the EU. Leaving simply means that the challenge cannot be ducked as it has been in the past. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has  and what they mean for the public finances. Over the next five years, the population of the UK is expected to rise by 3%, but there will be a 9% increase in the number of people over 65 and a 15% increase in those over 85.More old people means higher pension costs despite the increase in the official retirement age and higher health costs, because the average 90-year-old costs eight times as much to treat each year as the average 30-year-old. The share of national income accounted for by pensions has just about doubled since the second world war to 12% of GDP, and is expected to increase by a further seven percentage points over the next half a century. In the post-1945 period, the rise in pension and health spending was matched by a decline in outlays on defence and debt interest. Today, there is no low hanging fruit to be picked, leaving the IFS to conclude that the choice is between increasing the size of the state, reducing spending on pensions and health, or cutting back elsewhere. The slower the economy grows the tougher these choices become.Getting the big picture right is part of the story, and the mix of ultra-low interest rates and austerity used since 2010 has not worked.But to a large extent, raising Britain＊s game is a local rather than a national issue. Research by the Centre for Cities thinktank shows that productivity in the greater south-east (which includes London) is higher than it is Germany. The problem is that it takes a worker in the north and the Midlands five days to produce what a worker in the greater south-east can produce in three-and-a-half days.The disparity is particularly marked in urban areas. Cities in the greater south-east are 50% more productive than those in the north. Were the gap to be closed, the north＊s economy would be ?154bn bigger. That＊s the equivalent of adding three more cities the size of Manchester to the northern economy, and potentially a lot of extra resources available for health and pensions.This is a long-standing problem.  at Sheffield Hallam University has shown how the UK＊s old manufacturing heartlands have never really recovered from the deindustrialisation of the 1980s and, to make matters worse, have been at the sharp end of the welfare cuts introduced since 2010. The unemployment rate has come down but the jobs that have been created have tended to be in low-wage sectors such as distribution and call centres. Unsurprisingly, there has been an exodus of the young and talented to the more prosperous parts of the country. Those left behind voted in their droves for Brexit because they felt, rightly, that the economy was not working for them. for the past three decades has been membership of the EU, which has ensured access both to the single market and to labour, which has flowed to the parts of the country that have needed it. This has resulted in faster growth and stronger support for remain in the greater south-east but has brought its own regional problem: a housing shortage. The Brexit-voting parts of the country, by contrast, have not reaped the same benefits. Indeed, they have probably suffered as a result of the concentration of growth in London and the south-east. Why? Because the flow of global capital into the City has pushed up the value of the pound, making life harder for exporters in regions that still rely heavily on manufacturing. Because London＊s success has meant it has had first claim on money for infrastructure. And because the brain drain has left cities in the north such as Liverpool and Stoke with large numbers of poorly skilled adults trying to find jobs where opportunities are limited. The problems have been confounded by the unwillingness, at least until recently, to cede any control over the purse strings. Local government has been at the sharp end of austerity. So what might a new northern-focused industrial strategy look like? It should start by seeking to to do no more harm. That means reversing the welfare cuts that are sucking spending power out of communities already suffering from a lack of effective demand. It also means welcoming 每 and trying to lock in 每 a more competitive exchange rate.If the government is serious about reducing net migration to the tens of thousands, Britain cannot afford to have 5 million adults 每 around one sixth of the employed labour force 每 lacking basic literacy and numeracy skills. The West Midlands, for example, has been doing well in the past few years but is being held back by a shortage of skills.But boosting skills doesn＊t help the less productive regions if all the newly qualified people head south looking for jobs because there are none available where they live. In parts of the north, higher spending on local infrastructure projects would help by linking smaller towns and cities to the big urban centres. The recognition in the  that the government should both identify the growth industries of the future and seek to locate them across the whole country was welcome.Welcome but belated. The Conservatives effectively left large chunks of Britain to rot in the 1980s. Whichever party forms the next government now has a massive catch-up jobs on its hands. And precious little time."															
"Australia is leading the charge to save the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal thrown into doubt by Donald Trump＊s decision to pull America out of the pact.As fears rumble of a new global era of protectionism,  trade ministers gathered in Vietnam on Sunday with Australia, Japan and New Zealand at the forefront of efforts to save the deal.The 12-nation TPP covered 40% of the global economy before Trump abruptly abandoned it in January as part of a campaign pledge to save American jobs he said had been sucked up overseas.But some remaining members of the pact 每 the so-called TPP 11 每 are desperate to keep the deal alive, believing the pact will lock-in free trade as well as boost labour rights and environmental protections.After the Sunday morning meeting, the Australian minister for trade, tourism and investment, Steve Ciobo, said: ※It＊s important to leave the door open to the United States. It may not suit US interests at this point in time to be part of the TPP, but circumstances might change in the future.§New Zealand＊s trade minister, Todd McClay, told reporters that the TPP 11 ※are committed to finding a way forward to deliver§ the pact.Trade representatives in Hanoi have said they are ready to tweak the deal to leave room for a US return, pinning hopes on a U-turn in American policy.Spearheaded by former US president Barack Obama, the far-reaching TPP 每 which notably excludes China 每 would have rewritten the rules of 21st century trade and was seen as a way to counter Beijing＊s regional economic dominance.Reviving the TPP, even without the heft of the world＊s biggest economy, would still provide ballast against China, analyst Alex Capri told AFP.※The Chinese would not be particularly pleased to see the TPP go ahead even without the United States,§ said Capri, a senior fellow and professor at the National University of Singapore.He did not rule out the eventual return of the United States to the TPP, noting that Trump has ※flip-flopped§ on other campaign positions in a headline-grabbing first few months in office.The TPP ministers are meeting on the sidelines of a gathering of trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).The newly-appointed US trade chief, Robert Lighthizer, attended the two-day gathering, where he was scheduled to meet one-on-one with several ministers, including from China, Canada and Mexico.The Reagan-era trade veteran has been tasked with renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement 每 another deal Trump promised to pull out of, though he later backpedalled after speaking to the leaders of Canada and Mexico.The Trump administration has said it is seeking bilateral agreements over sweeping free trade pacts, and is pushing for fair trade with partners, not just free trade."															
"t seems crazy to argue that the election will be  when events have focused the electorate＊s attention on national security and the judgment of the main political leaders.Last year＊s Brexit vote illustrated many things, among them the propensity of voters to disregard short-term effects on their personal finances in favour of high ideals for a better world, whatever they felt that to be.Yet the economy looms large in the background of this election and could still play a major role in determining the outcome. And fortunately for Theresa May, the trends of the last few months play into her party＊s hands. For , jitters over Britain＊s economic outlook only makes the mountain harder to climb.In the postwar era, Labour has tended to gain power in times of hope and confidence, especially the votes in 1966 and 1997.It might be pointed out that Harold Wilson＊s two victories in 1974 were narrow and came against a backdrop of steeply rising inflation, strikes and bank collapses, which ostensibly disproves the trend. That would be true if it weren＊t for the broader factors that meant the 1970s were Britain＊s happiest decade, characterised by low levels of inequality and technological advancements that only seemed to enhance living standards.Fast forward to 2017 and voters appear to be in a more downbeat mood. The latest surveys of household attitudes show that their finances are in a state not seen since the summer of?2014.Three years ago, oil prices were still high and the jobs boom of 2015 and 2016 had yet to arrive. The then chancellor, George Osborne, had already relaxed his tough post-crash austerity measures, but a slowdown in the pace of cuts had yet to take effect. Workers were gloomy.Figures covering the month of May show a return to this state of mind. On balance, more people believe that sluggish wage rises and soaring inflation mean their own personal finances will be worse in a year than those who think they will be better.There will be other factors playing on people＊s minds. The prospect of higher interest rates (which won＊t happen, despite the Bank of England governor Mark Carney threatening them) will suggest a further squeeze on incomes, as will five more years of austerity under a Tory government. Then there are the long-term threats to many people＊s jobs, such as the much-discussed rise of the robots.Looking back over the last seven years, it is easy to see that the feelgood days that came after the summer of 2014 were generated by a sugar rush of low oil prices, low-cost imports and plentiful cheap labour.The gloomy outlook from the high street contrasts with the view from corporate Britain and the City. Business leaders are full of trepidation about the outcome of Brexit talks and the potential impact on friendly relations with trading partners, it＊s true. But the main surveys of business opinion show they are optimistic about their prospects in the meantime, by which they mean the next 18 months.The recent downgrade of UK GDP growth would appear to say the opposite. The Office for National Statistics said growth in the first quarter was only 0.2% and not the 0.3% previously estimated after a fall in net trade.A deeper look into the figures shows that much of the deterioration in the UK＊s net trade position was down to higher import costs, mostly in response to the declining value of sterling 每 not a fall in exports. Also, business investment rose on an annual basis for the first time in over a year, and the second quarter began with a bit more momentum than previously believed.But the conclusion remains that consumers are less confident about the future even if their bosses are chipper. The anxiety that gripped voters after the 2008 crash is reasserting itself.In this atmosphere it will be even more difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to convince floating voters that now is the time to increase the size of the state and do it with a calculated gamble on future tax receipts.Consumers need to feel in expansive mood and believe that things can only get better to vote Labour. Or at least they need to be convinced that a competent Labour leadership, armed with a coherent set of policies, can make their lives better.The Institute for Fiscal Studies was not kind to Labour following its assessment of the main political party manifestos. It said many of its numbers failed to add up. There was also criticism of the Tory plan, but Labour came in for the most criticism.Across the Atlantic in another time, WH Auden summed up a growing mood of popular disquiet in 1948 when he wrote:His poem, , won the Pulitzer prize and was a telling insight into the anxieties of the postwar world. Back in Britain, Labour went on to lose the 1951 election partly because it failed to overcome a sense of gloom about the nation＊s prospects.Today we face another age of anxiety and it＊s difficult to see how Labour overcomes this hurdle."

That bodes ill for an economy reliant on household spending and the latest indicators from Britain＊s retail and leisure industries suggest they are feeling the effects of a tightening consumer squeeze. The export sector has failed to offset that domestic drag and GDP figures due this week are .Still, lending support to those who say May was right to call a vote sooner rather than later, unemployment remains low, the housing market is steady, stock markets are near record highs and business activity continues to rise 每 albeit at a slower pace.The economy appears to have lost momentum but has comfortably avoided the recession some had predicted in the wake of the Brexit vote. Last week, the International Monetary Fund was forced to admit yet again that it had been too gloomy on the consequences of the Brexit vote as it ., Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee, said support for the UK from a strong global economy was being offset by domestic pressures.※There are two big themes which stand out from this month＊s data, and they show the UK being pulled in opposite directions by the global economy and consumer spending,§ said Sentance, a senior economic adviser at the consultancy PwC.※We should expect the consumer slowdown to dominate the growth picture over the course of this year ... GDP growth figures for the first quarter released at the end of this week are likely to confirm that the UK economy is already slowing.§To gauge the impact of the Brexit vote on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE.The  shows , inflation is at its , wages are  and Britain＊s . But unemployment remains low,  and .  and the government hit its borrowing target. But the public finances were worse than market expectations for the latest month.Compared with economists＊ forecasts, there was a worse-than-expected performance in three of the eight categories. Two were better than expected, with three as forecast.Stock markets remain near record highs and , with investors predicting the result will strengthen May＊s position in Brexit negotiations with her EU counterparts. But, compared with the day of last June＊s referendum, the pound is still down 14% against the US dollar and 10% against the euro. That weakness is now making itself felt in the real economy as imports become more expensive and shoppers are paying higher prices for a whole range of goods and services, from food to fuel.The pound effect has combined with higher global oil prices to lift inflation to a rate of 2.3% in February and March, above the Bank of England＊s 2% target. But while inflation is expected to climb higher, wage growth looks set to slow. Employers are grappling with higher costs that give them less leeway for pay rises and the government continues to implement a public sector pay freeze. The latest official figures show workers were already worse off in real terms in February as pay rose 1.9% on the year but inflation stood at 2.3%. That pay weakness was despite Britain＊s unemployment rate remaining at 4.7% 每 its joint lowest since 1975 每 and continued reports of skills shortages.Reflecting tighter household budgets, retail sales volumes suffered their biggest drop in seven years over the opening months of 2017, dragging on the overall economy rather than acting as a driver of growth as they usually do. In other signs of the strains on consumers, there has been  while .David Blanchflower, another former Bank of England policymaker, said consumer spending was being supported by people borrowing more and running down their savings but that could not last.※Support for Brexit is likely to be driven by how the economy performs and whether living standards hold up and they aren＊t,§ said Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US.※I am hoping for some good economic news next month. I didn＊t see much of any this month.§There have been upsides from a weaker pound, including an  splashing out in British shops, restaurants and hotels to take advantage of the relative strength in their own currencies. Exporters also report that  but the latest official trade figures were weaker than expected.That overseas boost was clear in a set of business surveys that are closely watched by investors and policymakers for early clues to GDP growth. But while activity has continued to expand according to those Markit/CIPS purchasing managers＊ indices (PMIs), their compilers say there has been a change of pace since last year and that GDP growth likely slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2017 from 0.7% in the final three months of 2016. The first official snapshot of GDP growth in the opening months in the year is due on Friday and economists polled by Reuters also expect growth to slow to 0.4%."															
"s entrances go, Misao Sato＊s is as inconspicuous as they come. After he walks unannounced on to the shop floor at his company＊s headquarters near Tokyo Bay, there is no standing on ceremony, no greetings yelled above the din of the machinery. Employees in blue overalls simply acknowledge the arrival of the president of the  with a nod and a smile, and return to work. Founded a year after the end of the second world war, Kikanshi has grown from producing political pamphlets to a multi-million pound business, with newspapers that reach a readership of more than a million. At lunchtime, however, Sato quietly takes a seat alongside his employees in the staff canteen; this evening, he will squeeze on to a packed train for the journey back to the modest home he shares with his wife in the commuter belt north of Tokyo.Sato wouldn＊t have it any other way. Having joined Kikanshi straight from high school at the age of 18, he epitomises Japan＊s ※modest§ business executives. ※My door is literally open all of the time,§ the 60-year-old says. ※The management and staff work very closely together. We decide what to do as a group; we don＊t like doing things in a top-down style. We＊re not that kind of company.§Sato＊s pay packet suggests the company＊s evenhanded approach runs deeper than mere gestures. Despite his decades of service, he earns just over twice the average monthly salary of his 150 full-time staff, and only 1.2 times that of his highest-earning employees. ※In fact,§ he says with a smile, ※if you factor in overtime, there are people here who take home more than I do.§Sato may be an extreme example, but studies show the same egalitarian ethic runs deep in Japanese corporate culture. According to a  by Credit Suisse, Japan is the most equal major economy in the world in terms of wealth distribution 每 with Russia the most unequal.※Together with Japan＊s high average wealth, this relative equality means few adults have assets below US $10,000 [?7,800],§ the report stated. ※The proportion of the population with wealth above US $100,000 is seven times the global average.§In addition, the median salary of chief executives at Japanese firms with revenues of more than 1 trillion yen (?7.1bn) is one-tenth that of American CEOs, and less than one-fifth that of their counterparts in Britain, according to . Most CEOs of firms listed on Japan＊s Nikkei 225 stock average earn less than 100 million yen (?715,000) a year.Japan＊s performance in wealth distribution is more remarkable given the size of its population. While Scandinavian countries are regularly held up as , they have far fewer people to worry about. Japan＊s population of 127 million, though predicted to shrink dramatically in the coming decades, dwarfs that of Sweden＊s 9.6 million and Norway＊s 5.08 million.The postwar rise in living standards brought other benefits: universal health insurance and health outcomes that are among the best in the world, and an enviable life expectancy of 87 years for women and 80 for men. Infant mortality is among the . And while the country fares poorly in international comparisons of English-language ability, Japanese children .And yet, at a time when leading  and  alike are hailing the importance of tackling inequality across the world, the edifice of Japanese-style egalitarianism is beginning to crumble.Rapid depopulation, coupled with a rise in the number of people aged 65 or over, have presented recent governments with a policy conundrum they have yet to solve: how a shrinking workforce can meet a national bill for social security and healthcare that is expected to balloon in the coming decades. Meanwhile, large sections of Japan＊s young are rejecting the traditional ※safe but stifling§ corporate path their parents and grandparents accepted without a murmur, in favour of gig economy jobs that offer more freedom 每 but much less security. Have they decided that Japan＊s vision of an equal society is not all it＊s cracked up to be?The roots of Japan＊s record on wealth distribution lie in national humiliation. To turn a crushing wartime defeat into economic success, postwar governments struck a deal with a war-weary population that would serve both parties well for the best part of half a century: hard work and self-sacrifice would be rewarded with a job for life, incremental salary rises, bonuses and seniority-based promotions.The quid pro quo worked seamlessly until Japan＊s asset-inflated bubble burst in the early 1990s, ushering in a  that, a quarter of a century on, continues to haunt the world＊s third-biggest economy. Having powered Japan through its period of breakneck economic development, the dutiful ※§ suddenly became dispensable.Under the guise of corporate restructuring 每  每 middle-aged employees considered surplus to requirements were superannuated in an unprecedented breach of the postwar employment deal. Joblessness rose to almost 6% and the suicide rate topped 30,000 a year 每 one of the highest in the world.Yet even Japan＊s worst downturns have been free of the social unrest, mass unemployment and knee-jerk austerity that created deep social fissures in countries like Britain. In 2009, at the height of the country＊s worst economic performance since the war,  compared the low crime rates and high level of social cohesion in Japan with the glaring inequalities in the west, and wondered if it was appropriate to talk about a Japanese recession at all.Violent crime is a rarity on the streets of major cities here, and on any given Friday evening, restaurants and bars are crammed with well-dressed office workers. Even during the post-bubble era of restructuring layoffs, unemployment stayed comparatively low: in February this year, it was at its lowest level for more than two decades, at 2.8%.But the concept of lifetime corporate employment is fading fast. In shunning 每 or having being denied 每 the same opportunity to step on to the career escalator, millennials and women (who accounted for 68% of non-regular workers in 2015) are now filling part-time or temporary jobs across a host of sectors that have one thing in common: pay levels far below those of full-time employees.According to the  of Japan＊s economy, after adjusting for type of job and educational attainment, the wage gap between full- and part-time workers is 45% for men and 31% for women. Single-income households are seven times more likely to be in poverty if the breadwinner 每 usually the husband - is a non-regular employee. Yet while the low pay and poor conditions offered by the non-regular job market are hardly attractive options for anyone, more and more salaried workers are still seeking ways to break free of Japan＊s corporate shackles.Arguably the most important domestic news story of the past year was a labour standards office ruling that the suicide of , a 24-year-old employee of the advertising giant Dentsu, was due to , or death from overwork. In the period leading up to her death, Takahashi had been working 105 hours＊ overtime a month.Dentsu was not alone in wringing every last drop from its employees. In the wake of the labour office＊s ruling, Japanese media ran  for placing profits above the health and wellbeing of their employees.In its first white paper on  published last year, the government confirmed the growing human toll exacted by the prevailing work culture of devotion and self-sacrifice, warning that one in five Japanese workers was now at risk of death from overwork. The report added that approximately 21.3% of Japanese employees work an average of 49 or more hours each week, well above the 16.4% reported in the US, 12.5 % in Britain and 10.4% in France.Compelled to take action by the public outcry that followed Takahashi＊s death, the government is now poised to introduce a cap on overtime at 100 hours a month 每 a limit some critics believe will do little to address the problem. In the postwar era, union members rising through the ranks to take management jobs helped ensure wealth was more evenly distributed throughout . But in return, employees became the properties of their companies 每 to be moved, given pay cuts during lean times and, as the  problem proves, made to work punishingly long hours. These days, the expectation of a gently upwards career trajectory and a decent standard of living in retirement is often not enough reward for such sacrifices.Like many salarymen in their 40s, Hiroyuki Ito was destined to see out his working days at the company he joined as a graduate when, two years ago, he suddenly walked away from his job as a sales rep for a major food manufacturer.※I had reached the point where I knew I didn＊t want to spend my entire career there, but I was so busy that I could never find the time to think about what else I could do,§ says Ito. ※So I took a gamble and quit before I had found another job.§The 47-year-old took a six-month break to travel and spend more time at home with his wife and three children before working, for no pay, for a consultancy startup where he is now a full-time sales employee. ※I had to make a decision: would I give myself completely to my old company and let them decide my future, or take a chance and decide for myself?※In Japan, if you go to a good university and land a job at a prestigious company, you tend to think that you＊ve made a success of your life. But I had this nagging thought that for all the stability, I wasn＊t doing something I genuinely enjoyed. I have far less money now, but at the same time my life is completely free of stress.§Ito completed his transformation after attending a retraining course at the , where about 150 discontented employees 每 two-thirds of them men 每 come to pursue the professional dreams denied to them in their former jobs.※By the time a staff employee is their late 50s they have become experts at one thing but don＊t know much about anything else, and then suddenly they are 60, on a reduced salary and staring retirement in the face,§ says Matsuhiko Ozawa, who opened the institute four years ago after quitting his job as an advertising executive in his 40s. ※It can be incredibly stressful.§The school adopts an unorthodox approach to reprogramming men and women more attuned to the hierarchy-based conventions of company life. In one exercise, small groups of students eat lunch together while blindfolded 每 a handicap Ozawa says encourages them to communicate using their four remaining senses. Business cards are banned, and students are given nicknames in an attempt to wean them off corporate rituals they once used to quickly establish the professional pecking order.Given Japan＊s extraordinary longevity statistics, Ozawa believes employees approaching the twilight of their careers should instead be preparing for a second career. ※Our task is to stop them before they reach the point where they have lost the will to do something new, and help them work out what they＊re going to do with the rest of their lives,§ he says.※If you retire from a company at 60, you could easily have 30 years of life left. People are beginning to ask: what can I do to make those years enjoyable and productive? The cost of living is high, particularly in Tokyo. Most of the people I meet here can＊t afford to sit around doing nothing.§Teruko Watanabe sips from a glass of iced tea at a western Tokyo diner and laughs at the idea that, at 57, she is ready for a career change.As one of the growing number of workers on temporary contracts hired to fill openings at everything from convenience stores and restaurants to auto plants and offices, she represents the new 每 and troubled 每 face of Japan＊s labour market demographic.※The reason I＊ve never been offered a staff job is that I and other temporary workers are dispensable,§ says Watanabe, who has worked, one three-month contract at a time, for the same energy company for 18 years. ※We are the buffer between companies and tough economic times.§Her two adult children have left home but she must now juggle work with looking after her 87-year-old mother, who suffers from dementia. Their home in western Tokyo is paid for, but food and utility bills, commuting expenses and the costs associated with caring for her mother mean Watanabe has little left over from her monthly salary of just over 200,000 yen (?1,430) a month. ※I just about get by,§ she says, ※But in a way I am lucky. There are lots of other temporary workers who are far worse off than me.§Regarded as a source of cheap labour during the economic slump of the early 2000s, contract and other non-regular workers now comprise about 40% of Japan＊s workforce. Their wages, particularly among younger people, are well below those of full-time staff 每 creating a two-tiered labour market that experts say is contributing to rising levels of poverty in one of the world＊s wealthiest countries. An estimated 3.5 million Japanese children 每 one in six of those aged up to 17 每 are from households classed as experiencing ※relative poverty§ ( as those with incomes at or below half the median national disposable income). Japan＊s relative rate of poverty has risen over the past three decades to 16.3%, while the rate in the US, though still higher at 17.3%, has fallen.※Perhaps some people envy me for being a free agent,§ Watanabe says. ※But while temp workers like me have fewer responsibilities, we have absolutely no security.§Japan＊s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has  to narrow the gap in pay and benefits between regular and contract employees, in an attempt to raise productivity and consumer spending. But companies have so far failed to heed his calls for significant pay rises.As she contemplates retirement on a basic state pension, and with next to no savings, Watanabe bristles at the suggestion that Japan has anything to teach the rest of the world about equality.※I feel like I＊m walking a tightrope,§ she says. ※If become ill or lose my job for some other reason, I＊ll fall off straight away. And there will be no safety net to catch me.§"															
"he  of who in Britain is housing and educating the refugees and asylum seekers who should be shared across the country shows that the responsibility falls on fewer than a third of councils. That is not only a shaming example of how many prosperous local authorities have found ways to avoid the appeal to help, which is bleakly revealed in the raw numbers showing that Labour-led authorities have taken 11.6?asylum seekers per 10,000 population, compared with just 0.7 in Conservative-led ones (and only four refugees live in the prime minister＊s Maidenhead constituency). Nor is it simply more evidence of  from city to city, and from inner city to leafy suburb. Nor merely a badly designed plan that urgently needs revising. It is a vivid illustration of how those councils that have rather than those that have not .Local government finance may be a strong contender for the most boring and complex subject in politics, but what it lacks in thrills it gains in its sheer impact on ordinary lives. That is why the current re-engineering of the way it is funded, trailed two years ago when  that councils would be allowed to keep all their business rate income by 2020, is both among the most important and the least discussed questions in a Whitehall dominated by Brexit.The former chancellor wanted a powerful incentive for councils to do all they can to grow their economies and thus their income from business rates. But this is a perilous way of funding the spending that covers not only social care and education but all the activities that act as social glue in civic society 每 parks and libraries, swimming pools and Sure Start centres. It is also a philosophical departure from a system primarily based on ensuring that needs are met, regardless of income. It?is the culmination of Margaret Thatcher＊s mission to take apart the postwar settlement.The element of council funding determined by local need is now frozen. A system to replace the old mechanism of transfers from rich councils to poorer ones is work in progress. Councils, which nominally have a four-year funding deal, are still ignorant of what they will get in the process of redistribution after 2019-20. They also face the uncertain impact of legal challenges to the business rate revaluation, which came into force at the start of April. The Tories already have a disturbing reputation for partisan decision-making in areas that ought to be considered more broadly. The poorer an area, the less a council can raise in taxes. To pretend otherwise is to condemn the voters who most rely on good services to bad ones. It will entrench division, and no one has yet shown how it will boost the local economy."															
"resident Donald Trump＊s first major legislative goal 每 to ※repeal and replace§ the 2010 Affordable Care Act (※Obamacare§) 每 has already imploded, owing to Trump and congressional Republicans＊ naivety about the complexities of healthcare reform. Their attempt to replace an imperfect but popular law with a pseudo-reform that would deprive more than 24 million Americans of basic healthcare was bound to fail 每 or sink Republican members of Congress in the 2018 midterm elections if it had passed.Now Trump and congressional Republicans are pursuing tax reform, starting with corporate taxes and then moving on to personal income taxes, as if this will be any easier. It won＊t be, not least because the Republicans＊ initial proposals would  to budget deficits, and funnel more than 99% of the benefits to the top 1% of the income distribution.A plan offered by Republicans in the House of Representatives to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%, and to make up for the lost revenues with a  (BAT), is dead on arrival. The BAT does not have enough support even among Republicans, and it would violate World Trade Organisation rules. The Republicans＊ proposed tax cuts would create a $2tn revenue shortfall over the next decade, and they cannot plug that hole with revenue savings from their healthcare reform plan or with the $1.2tn that could have been expected from a BAT.The Republicans must now choose between passing their tax cuts (and adding $2tn to the public debt) and pursuing a much more modest reform. The first scenario is unlikely for three reasons. First, fiscally conservative congressional Republicans will object to a reckless increase in the public debt. Second, congressional budget rules require any tax cut that is not fully financed by other revenues or spending cuts to expire within 10 years, so the Republicans＊ plan would have only a limited positive impact on the economy.And, third, if tax cuts and increased military and infrastructure spending push up deficits and the public debt, interest rates will have to rise. This would hinder interest-sensitive spending, such as on housing, and lead to a surge in the US dollar, which could destroy millions of jobs, hitting Trump＊s key constituency 每 white working-class voters 每 the hardest.Moreover, if Republicans blow up the debt, markets＊ response could crash the US economy. Owing to this risk, Republicans will have to finance any tax cuts with new revenues, rather than with debt. As a result, their roaring tax-reform lion will most likely be reduced to a squeaking mouse.Even cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 30% would be difficult. Republicans would have to broaden the tax base by forcing entire sectors 每 such as pharmaceuticals and technology 每 that currently pay little in taxes to start paying more. And to get the corporate tax rate below 30%, Republicans would have to impose a large minimum tax on these firms＊ foreign profits. This would mark a departure from the current system, in which trillions of dollars in foreign profits remain untaxed unless they are repatriated.During the presidential campaign, Trump proposed a one-time 10% repatriation-tax ※holiday§ to encourage American companies to bring their foreign profits back to the United States. But this would deliver only $150bn to $200bn in new revenues 每 less than 10% of the $2tn fiscal shortfall implied by the Republicans＊ plan. In any case, revenues from a repatriation tax should be used to finance infrastructure spending or the creation of an infrastructure bank.Some congressional Republicans who already know that the BAT is a non-starter are now proposing that the corporate income tax be replaced with a value-added tax that is legal under WTO rules. But this option isn＊t likely to go anywhere, either. Republicans themselves have always strongly opposed a VAT, and there is even an anti-VAT Republican caucus in Congress.The traditional Republican view holds that such an ※efficient§ tax would be too easy to increase over time, making it harder to ※starve the beast§ of ※wasteful§ government spending. Republicans point to Europe and other parts of the world where a VAT rate started low and gradually increased to double-digit levels, exceeding 20% in many countries.Democrats, too, have historically opposed a VAT, because it is a highly regressive form of taxation. And while it could be made less regressive by excluding or discounting food and other basic goods, that would only make it less appealing to Republicans. Given this bipartisan opposition, the VAT 每 like the BAT 每 is already dead in the water.It will be even harder to reform personal income taxes. Initial proposals by Trump and the Republican leadership would have cost $5tn to $9tn over the next decade, and 75% of the benefits would have gone to the top 1% 每 a politically suicidal idea. Now, after abandoning their initial plan, Republicans claim they want a revenue-neutral tax cut that includes no reductions for the top 1% of earners. But that, too, looks like mission impossible. Implementing revenue-neutral tax cuts for almost all income brackets means that Republicans would have to phase out many exemptions and broaden the tax base in ways that are politically untenable. For example, if Republicans eliminated the mortgage-interest deduction for homeowners, the US housing market would crash.Ultimately, the only sensible way to provide tax relief to middle and lower-income workers is to raise taxes on the rich. This is a socially progressive populist idea that a pseudo-populist plutocrat like Trump will never accept. So, it looks like Republicans will continue to delude themselves that supply-side, trickle-down tax policies work, in spite of the overwhelming weight of evidence to the contrary."															
"he country may still be reeling from the triggering of  but it＊s this week that Britain will truly define itself 每 and in the most shameful of ways. In the coming days, Theresa May＊s Conservative government will bring in a range of widespread benefit cuts 每 cuts that target disabled people, young people, and parents on low wages.The official line may be that austerity is over, but the onslaught orchestrated by George Osborne  has been simply waiting in the wings. Go through the list of cuts coming into force this week and it＊s a blueprint for the callous: from taking ?30 a week from people too severely disabled to work, and housing benefit from young people at risk of homelessness, to withholding child tax credits from the poorest parents, and cuts for bereaved families.In December, 51-year-old Alan 每 a dad of two 每 was told that his cancer of the tonsil had spread to his lung and chest, and that he had between one and five months to live. As Alan desperately tried to plan how his wife, Kate, and their 10-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son would get by after his death, he realised that the new bereavement policy 每 a cut to the  每 meant his family could lose ?50,000 in support over the next decade. He＊s now faced with the situation of knowing that if he survives beyond this Wednesday 5 April, it 每 in his words 每 ※changes my family＊s wellbeing §.This is simply barbaric, but that＊s the level this country has now stooped to.

And the prime minister can make  about whether Britain＊s going to war with Spain over Gibraltar, while disabled people, bereaved parents and children have the money they need for a home, food, and clothes taken from them.Inhumane cuts to vital government support are far from new in this country 每 the benefit sanction regime, ※fit for work§ tests and food banks are proof of that. Yet this latest round of measures still makes me feel sick. Not only at the members of society who are being targeted 每 and the damage it will cause them 每 but just how little this government cares.It is a matter of national identity. And this week, Britain＊s is becoming that much more cruel."															
"oday, a quarter-century after the cold war＊s end, the west and  are again at odds. This time, at least on one side, the dispute is more transparently about geopolitical power, not ideology.The west has supported in a variety of ways democratic movements in the post-Soviet region, hardly hiding its enthusiasm for the various ※colour§ revolutions that have replaced longstanding dictators with more responsive leaders 每 though not all have turned out to be the committed democrats they pretended to be.Too many countries of the former Soviet bloc remain under the control of authoritarian leaders, including some, like the Russian president, , who have learned how to maintain a more convincing facade of elections than their communist predecessors.They sell their system of ※illiberal democracy§ on the basis of pragmatism, not some universal theory of history. These leaders claim they are simply more effective at getting things done.That is certainly true when it comes to stirring nationalist sentiment and stifling dissent. They have been less effective, however, in nurturing long-term economic growth. Once one of the world＊s two superpowers, Russia＊s GDP is now about 40% of Germany＊s and just over 50% of France＊s. Life expectancy at birth ranks , just behind Honduras and Kazakhstan.In terms of per capita income, Russia ranks 73rd (in terms of purchasing power parity) 每 well below the Soviet Union＊s former satellites in central and eastern . The country has deindustrialised: the vast majority of its exports now come from natural resources. It has not evolved into a ※normal§ market economy, but rather into a peculiar form of crony-state capitalism.Yes, Russia still punches above its weight in some areas, such as nuclear weapons. And it retains veto power at the United Nations. As the recent hacking of the Democratic Party in the United States shows, it has cyber capacities that enable it to be enormously meddlesome in western elections.There is every reason to believe such intrusions will continue. Given Donald Trump＊s deep ties with unsavoury Russian characters (themselves closely linked to Putin), Americans are deeply concerned about potential Russian influences in the US 每 matters that may be clarified by ongoing investigations.Many had much higher hopes for Russia, and the former Soviet Union more broadly, when the iron curtain fell. After seven decades of communism, the transition to a democratic market economy would not be easy. But, given the obvious advantages of democratic market capitalism to the system that had just fallen apart, it was assumed the economy would flourish and citizens would demand a greater voice.What went wrong? Who, if anyone, is to blame? Could Russia＊s post-communist transition have been managed better?We can never answer such questions definitively: history cannot be re-run. But I believe what we are confronting is partly the legacy of the flawed Washington consensus that shaped Russia＊s transition. This framework＊s influences were reflected in the tremendous emphasis that reformers placed on privatisation, no matter how it was done, with speed taking precedence over everything else, including creating the institutional infrastructure needed to make a market economy work.Fifteen years ago, when I wrote I argued that this ※shock therapy§ approach to economic reform was a dismal failure. But defenders of that doctrine cautioned patience: one could make such judgments only with a longer-run perspective.Today, more than 25 years since the onset of transition, those earlier results have been confirmed, and those who argued that private property rights, once created, would give rise to broader demands for the rule of law have been proven wrong. Russia and many of the other transition countries are lagging further behind the advanced economies than ever. GDP in some transition countries is below its level at the beginning of the transition.Many in Russia believe the US Treasury pushed Washington consensus policies to weaken their country. The deep corruption of the Harvard University team chosen to ※help§ Russia in its transition, described in a  published in 2006 by Institutional Investor, reinforced these beliefs.I believe the explanation was less sinister: flawed ideas, even with the best of intentions, can have serious consequences. And the opportunities for self-interested greed offered by Russia were simply too great for some to resist. Clearly, democratisation in Russia required efforts aimed at ensuring shared prosperity, not policies that led to the creation of an oligarchy.The west＊s failures then should not undermine its resolve to work to create democratic states respecting human rights and international law. The US is struggling to prevent the Trump administration＊s extremism 每 whether it＊s a travel ban aimed at Muslims, science-denying environmental policies, or threats to ignore international trade commitments 每 from being normalised. But other countries＊ violations of international law, such as Russia＊s actions in Ukraine, cannot be normalised either. "															
															
"Governments must push through more fundamental reforms to boost growth, cut inequality and protect workers from rapid changes in technology if they are to win back the trust of voters, the west＊s leading economics thinktank has warned.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development says stagnating living standards in many countries have left people disenchanted and unwilling to support more changes by their governments in areas such as jobs markets.In its annual check on the pace of such reforms, the  says progress has slowed over the past five years and it warns governments to change tack or risk another protracted period of sluggish economic growth and damaging inequalityFor the UK, the OECD recommends greater spending on education and training to raise skills and boost productivity, which would in turn help raise wages. Better housing supply would improve labour mobility and reduce skill mismatches, resulting in additional income gains, it added.※Governments cannot afford to let up on reform if they want to escape the low-growth trap many of them are facing and to ensure that the gains of economic growth benefit the vast majority of citizens,§ the Going for Growth report says.It draws a strong link between that  and lack of progress on reforms, noting that over the past two years, global growth has remained flat at about 3%, below the average growth rate of nearly 4% over the previous 10 years.The report, presented by OECD secretary general Angel Gurria at a  calls on governments to take a long-term view of jobs and skills, infrastructure spending and innovation. It also calls for more focus on tackling inequality to win back public support for reforms. The group, which covers 35 mainly rich countries including the UK, notes that on average only 40% of OECD citizens trust their governments.※Achieving greater inclusiveness and reducing inequalities of income and opportunities as well as poverty are important objectives for the well-being of citizens and winning back their trust. They are necessary for safeguarding social cohesion and sustaining growth in the longer run,§ said the report.The OECD＊s chief economist Catherine Mann said there had been some progress in recent years and governments had listened to her organisation＊s recommendations, notably with reforms that give young people and women more access to decent jobs.※The less good news is that progress on reforms related to longer term productivity growth, reforms in that area have slowed down,§ she continued.※That＊s bad news because ultimately productivity growth is the wherewithal by which we have higher living standards in the longer term.§Mann said one factor slowing the pace of reform was slow economic growth itself.※There has been a bit of a hunkering down by labour, you can understand that. ＆I don＊t want to change my job because I don＊t see any other ones out there.＊ You＊ve got businesses saying ＆Why should I change what I am doing, I don＊t see a lot of sales happening＊.§The OECD＊s flgaship annual report is designed to help policymakers come up with effective reform packages to boost economic growth. This year, for the first time, it has added ※inclusive growth§ as a goal. Mann said that decision preceded the votes for Brexit in the UK and Donald Trump in the US presidential race, interpreted by many commentators as electorates voicing their frustration at inequality.※It was January and February 2016 when we committed to broadening the scope of growth to productivity, employment and inclusivity,§ she said.※So we were in advance of Brexit, we were in advance of the Trump vote. But we understood at the time that there were these growing concerns about the distribution of growth and that we had to take that on full force.§The report＊s recommendations on cutting inequality include telling governments to ensure people get the training they need and are able to move into jobs that match their skills. Amid fears that many jobs are at risk of being replaced by computers and robots, the OECD also said that workers, business managers and governments needed better skills and knowledge to keep pace with innovation.

"magine, if you will, a city the size of Birmingham with a population of a million or so. Now imagine that a disaster has befallen that metropolis, a brutal war that has caused its citizens to flee with little more than the clothes on their backs. Picture the lines of refugees heading west to find a place of safety, which they eventually find across the border in Wales. There, despite severe financial constraints, the million displaced people are met with warmth and generosity.This is not a science-fiction story. Substitute  for Birmingham and Wales for Uganda and you get an inkling of what is happening in one of the poorest parts of the world＊s poorest continent.The number of refugees globally has not been higher since the end of the second world war and a million of them have crossed from South Sudan into Uganda, mostly into the West Nile district. In all, an estimated two million people have been displaced by the civil war and ethnic cleansing that has been raging in the  for the past four years. Approximately three quarters of South Sudan＊s children are out of school 每 the highest number in the world.Unlike many western countries,  has not demonised the new arrivals. The government has given the refugees land and seeds in the belief that they will be better off making a new life for themselves than doing nothing in a camp.Around half a million of the refugees that have crossed the border into Uganda from  are children. They have been fleeing at the rate of one a minute for the past year, putting additional strain on an already stretched Ugandan education system. They are being educated in classes of up to 150, without text books and by teachers who speak a different language.Western countries, including Britain, talk persuasively about how the only real way to reduce the flow of economic migrants out of  is to provide them with an incentive to stay where they are. That means providing them with hope, which in turn means giving them a decent start in life through a decently funded education.Likewise, the president of the World Bank,  that there were now two billion people living in parts of the world affected by fragility, conflict and violence. Kim predicted there would be serious consequences if the internet-fuelled aspirations of people living in developing countries were not met.The South Sudan-Uganda refugee crisis is going to show whether these fine words mean anything. It is a test for donor governments, for the , for the United Nations and for the Global Partnership for Education, the international body that has the job of providing quality schooling for poor countries. Thus far, they have not exactly covered themselves in glory.According to Save the Children, donor governments have funded just 17% of the UN appeal for the South Sudan refugee response in Uganda this year. The UN appealed for $61.6m (?46.8m) for the education emergency, of which only a small fraction has been provided. As the charity notes, there has been quite a contrast between the response of the Ugandan government and that of the rest of the world. Uganda＊s response has been extraordinarily generous. The response of the international community has ※bordered on the derisory§.To make matters worse, . ※This has made it impossible for the government of Uganda, UN agencies and national and international NGOs to plan for what has all the hallmarks of a protracted and systemic crisis requiring a long-term, predictable finance to underpin a credible programme. In effect, the international community has turned its back on some of the world＊s most vulnerable children, leaving Uganda and host communities living in endemic poverty, to shoulder the responsibility alone.§Fixing the problem would be relatively cheap: Save the Children estimates it would cost $132m a year for three and a half years to provide pre-primary, primary and secondary education for all the South Sudanese children living in Uganda. Given the numbers, this amounts to $152 per child annually 每 or less than $3 a week. Such a scheme would have the added benefits of employing refugee teachers from South Sudan and of strengthening the Uganda education system. At a time when aid spending is (rightly) filtered through the lens of whether it offers value for money, investing $500m in the education of South Sudanese refugee children is a colossal bargain.Long-term funding sources are available. The World Bank has a special fund, , that provides grants and soft loans for the least developed countries. The IDA is replenished by donors on a three-yearly basis, 47 of whom agreed to provide $25bn for the current round of funding. A further $25bn is coming from the bank＊s own resources, with a third $25bn being raised from the global financial market.A welcome innovation in the new IDA round was the creation of a window for financing refugees and helping host country programmes. Some $2.5bn was set aside for precisely the sort of emergency that is happening in Uganda. It is time the bank pulled its finger out.Likewise, the Global Partnership for Education has money allocated for South Sudan that is not being spent. This is hardly surprising given that half a million South Sudanese children are in Uganda and perhaps a further half a million are in other neighbouring countries. The Global Partnership for Education does not normally do cross-border funding, but these are not normal circumstances. "															
"ne thing sure to upset  officials is any suggestion that the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has gone soft on the banking industry and turns a blind eye to reckless lending. It brings back disturbing memories of the 2008 credit crunch, the chaos it brought to the economy and the damage it caused the institution＊s reputation.Last week, the Bank of England, which has become the overarching regulator of the banking system, made a point of being tough on the banks .It slapped a demand for more than ?11bn of extra reserves on the major lenders 每 just in case the current economic slowdown should trigger a rise in defaults.Governor Mark Carney also warned the lending industry that it should expect tougher rules on how it sells mortgages, car loans and credit cards should the current rise in borrowing rocket any further.But one question remains: can Carney and his troops tame the British consumer＊s dependence on debt? The most recent figures would say the answer is no., the biggest increase since last November, and higher than the six-month average of ?1.5bn.The annual rate at which UK consumers are loading up on their already heaving debt pile remained at 10.3% in the year to May.A look at the total stock of UK consumer credit shows that it reached ?198bn in April. That might seem small compared with the total amount of outstanding mortgage debt, which is around seven times larger, at ?1.3trillion, but for banks, consumer credit accounts for a much higher proportion of losses.※Since 2007, UK banks＊ total write-offs on UK consumer credit have been 10 times higher than on mortgages,§ the BoE says.And all this rising debt comes at a time of extraordinary falls in the savings rate. The most recent GDP figures showed that households were putting aside rainy day money at the lowest rate on record.It is a situation that worries experts of all stripes 每 from Jane Tully, a senior director at the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, to former Bank of England official Kate Barker, who was a member of the Bank＊s interest rate-setting committee during the last crash.Tully said: ※We have already seen an 8% rise in the number of people helped by National Debtline by telephone this year, and all the signs are that demand for debt advice will continue to increase. The higher borrowing levels rise, the more households will be exposed to the risk of financial difficulty in the event of a downturn.§Barker is concerned that eight years of ultra-low interest rates are fuelling a dependence on cheap borrowing, without any end in sight. She says that the growth of car finance plans appears to be a side-effect of the clampdown in other areas of credit, in particular the tighter regulation of mortgages.※There is obviously an incentive to borrow, so as one area is clamped down on, the problem pops up in another,§ she says.Barker also worries that regulators are examining discrete areas of credit risk rather than taking an overview of the long-term effects of almost zero interest rates on household and corporate behaviour.Issues tend to be tackled in silos 每 with the Bank＊s financial policy committee (FPC) looking at credit risk, and the monetary policy committee (MPC) examining broader economic risks, despite several officials sitting on both.At least, she says, the bank cannot be accused of groupthink. This is a reference to the MPC＊s recent split vote over holding the base rate at 0.25%. Three dissenters called for a rise. A fourth member, the Bank＊s chief economist, , subsequently added his voice, saying the Bank was storing up problems should rates remain low for another eight years.From the property industry＊s point of view, low rates may not be causing the kind of risky behaviour seen in 2006/7, when Northern Rock led the pack with its 125% mortgage offer, but most recognise the problem of persistently low rates persuading people on modest incomes to load up.Ray Boulger of mortgage adviser John Charcol says: ※The longer you have low rates, the more people get used to them and the harder it is to change policy.§So far Threadneedle Street has not given serious consideration to the long-term effects of cheap credit 每 probably because officials keep promising that interest rates will begin to rise soon in response to a general improvement in the economy., when he said that only a bad outcome in the Brexit talks could delay a return to normality, which would bring with it rising household incomes and higher interest rates.But he has delivered the same message for the past three years, only to backtrack later on. Wage rises have consistently failed to take off, and business investment, the spur for improvements in productivity, has flatlined.In the meantime, as the Bank notes, consumer credit growth has outstripped the rise in household incomes for several years. Car finance has seen the fastest expansion, putting it in the vanguard of concerns along with rising credit card debts.Defaults can be contained by the rise in bank reserves, says the BoE, while the big numbers are in the mortgage business. The car finance market is propped up by the finance arms of the car companies as much as it is the banks, leaving the motor industry to pick up much of the debt overhang. And anyway, said Carney last week, interest rates make up very little of the cost of a car finance package. Suffice it to say, the car industry＊s fate lies outside the bank＊s remit.One answer to the debt problem could be the current fall in consumer confidence and GDP growth. The dissenting members of the MPC could get what they＊re hoping for from the knock-on effects of uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks.A fall in consumer confidence might discourage credit card purchases. There has already been a drop-off over the past two months in spending on cars and other big items in favour of the weekly food shop.Yet a slowdown in growth and consumption is likely to be used as another reason for MPC members to delay increasing rates for an even longer period. Barker fears the longer rates remain low, the greater the likelihood that the UK will see another crash. Her concerns are shared by some members of the MPC, though not a majority.As the main source of financial instability in 2008, the mortgage market has come under closer scrutiny in recent years than ever before. The Prudential Regulatory Authority, an arm of the Bank of England that overseas the financial sector, has put in place tough rules that force banks to hold huge reserves in case unemployment increases and borrowers can no longer afford their monthly payments.Meanwhile, the Financial Conduct Authority has clamped down on mortgage products that allow borrowers to treat their accounts like cash machines.This doesn＊t mean lenders have to act in the way they did in the early 1990s, when to put a new roof on a house meant the mortgage company paying the roofer directly, but those people with high loan-to-value mortgages who want to borrow more must show where the money is going.Still, there are concerns that a huge divide between the young and the old is making the mortgage market more vulnerable to a crash than it might appear. While the over-55s pay down their mortgages at an accelerated rate, to afford high property prices first- and second-time buyers have to commit to dramatically high levels of debt.Most lenders consider a mortgage worth less than ?200,000 to be small. Second mortgages, which are bought at sky-high rates by those who have already maxed out on their main mortgage, were one of the canaries signalling a crash in 2007/8. Levels of borrowing on second mortgages have now hit the heights last seen just before the crash.Mortgage deposits, which this month reached an average ?33,000, give the banks a cushion they lacked 10 years ago, when the 100% mortgage was commonplace. But with so many people stretching to get on the property ladder and price/income multiples in property hotspots hitting fresh highs, some City analysts are expecting at least ※a correction§ in prices. A lack of housing supply means a property crash is unlikely, but a rise in unemployment levels following a hard Brexit could panic buyers and leave millions of people in negative equity.Britain and the rest of Europe have become hooked on cheap finance for buying or leasing cars. Last year, car registrations in the UK hit a record high of 2.7m, while car production, which benefits from export sales and the credit boom across the continent, reached the highest level seen this?century.The consumer market is dominated by the use of personal contract purchases (PCPs). This is an American model for car purchase under which vehicle ownership stays with the leasing firm and the customer pays the deprecation cost, usually over three years, plus a small interest fee. It has made expensive 4x4s affordable for people with modest disposable incomes, and has transformed the streets of most European towns and cities.The Bank of England wants banks, which account for around half of car finance deals, to increase their reserves just in case the glut of new cars on the roads triggers a collapse in secondhand car prices. Bank officials have calculated the losses that would result from a 20% fall in the secondhand market and deemed the industry to be safe. But 20% is the standard variation in car prices going back 20 or 30 years. The sheer volume of cars now on the market could cause a bigger fall once the current crop of three-year leases has run its course.US investors have been selling car company shares for this reason. Analysts at investment bank Schroders said this week that a rise in arrears and defaults on car loans was spooking investors. At 4% a year, this is not back to 2008 levels (5%), but it is rising.Data in the UK is more opaque. There are no industry figures for arrears or defaults, and lenders cannot agree on what constitutes sub-prime. The Finance & Leasing Association, which lobbies for the car leasing firms, says sub-prime lending is below 3% 每 even though it is unable to provide an industry definition of the term. The banks have probably protected themselves, but a surplus of secondhand cars could leave other lenders and the car companies nursing huge losses.The Bank of England is worried about the sale of credit cards after two years in which interest-free periods have widened, allowing customers to roll up large amounts of debt. New entrants to the market have grabbed customers＊ attention with eye-catching deals 每 allowing large balance transfers and two or three years of interest-free shopping.The maximum balance transfer offer has jumped from around 16 months in 2011 to 44 months in the spring of this year, according to Bank of England calculations.Stepchange, another debt charity, says more than 8 million people borrow to pay for basic goods each month, and 3.3 million people are in persistent credit card debt.There was a slowdown in the level of credit card debt in May, after borrowing dropped to ?400m from ?600m the previous month, but that still leaves millions of people paying anything between 17% and 30% interest on some or all of their credit bills. A steep fall in household spending power this year could push default rates through the roof and dent the banks＊ reserves.Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, took the job last year just as the watchdog was celebrating a clampdown on payday lenders with a strict interest rate cap. The industry was widely considered to be reckless in who it lent to, and the cap had put a stop to their activities.Last week, Bailey wondered whether the long-term effect of this had been to push people on low incomes into using loan sharks, who charge five or 10 times more. He told the British Bankers＊ Association that the regulator was keen to avoid pushing borrowers towards more expensive forms of credit.※There are sections of the public who have a justifiable need for credit but whose credit records are not necessarily straightforward,§ Bailey said. ※An example of this is where you have people with increasingly erratic incomes.§The more mainsteam loan market is also a concern following a steep fall in interest rates. From 12% in 2013, the average rate has fallen to 7% and can those who shop around can find rates as low as the standard variable mortgage rate. A loan secured against an asset like a house should in general cost much less than a loan without any security. The last time the gap between these closed was in the years before the 2008 crash.The Bank of England said intense competition was driving down loan costs. More worringly, it added: ※The fall in pricing may also reflect lenders＊ incorporating a relatively benign macroeconomic environment in their assessment of risk.§ Lenders are supposed to prepare for the worst. Lending patterns are based on a Goldilocks outlook for the economy, so a recession will hit lenders hard."															
															
"Neither of the two main parties ※has set out an honest set of choices§ to the public over their tax and spending plans, the Institute of Fiscal Studies has said.In a critical assessment of the Conservative and  party manifestos, the thinktank said both parties presented a misleading picture of the impact their polices would have over the course of the next parliament. It warned that neither addressed the long-term challenges facing the UK.The Tory focus on cutting immigration risked a ?6bn hit to the exchequer and the plans for continued austerity could prove impossible to deliver without causing serious damage to services, the IFS said.Labour＊s proposals would raise spending to its highest level since the mid-1980s and tax levels to record levels in peacetime, the thinktank said. But the party＊s plans for tax hikes aimed at top earners and businesses may ※not raise anything like§ the ?48.6bn claimed and its proposals could turn out to be economically damaging, it added. The warning came as all the main parties resumed campaigning following a pause after the Manchester attack. Labour has closed the gap in opinion polls since its manifesto launch, which included a boost in spending on the NHS, schools and the abolition of university tuition fees. Theresa May promised to increase spending on long-term care, though her plan to make those who suffer long-term illnesses pay the most proved to be unpopular and was quickly dropped in favour of an unspecified spending cap.The thinktank＊s deputy director, Carl Emmerson, accused Labour of ※pretending that everything can be paid for§ under plans to raise taxes on the richest, many of whom will avoid paying higher rates of tax.※The shame of the two big parties＊ manifestos is that neither sets out an honest set of choices. Neither addresses the long-term challenges we face. For Labour, we can have pretty much everything 每 free higher education, free childcare, more spending on pay, health, infrastructure,§ he said.※And the pretence is that can all be funded by faceless corporations and ＆the rich＊. The case [for higher taxes] needs to be made with honesty about what it would mean for tax payments, not pretending that everything can be paid for by ＆someone else＊.§Turning to the Tory plans, he criticised the Tories for proposing five more years of austerity that were unlikely to be ※deliverable§. Emmerson said a Tory government would be forced to either pull back on spending cuts or increase taxes to prevent further cuts in the NHS and schools from hitting services.※The  simply offer the cuts already promised. Additional funding pledges for the NHS and schools are just confirming that spending would rise in a way broadly consistent with the March budget,§ he said.※Compared with Labour, they are offering a relatively smaller state and consequently lower taxes. With that offer come unacknowledged risks to the quality of public services.§ Emmerson dismissed Theresa May＊s plans to reduce benefits to the elderly by means testing the winter fuel payment and scrapping the pensions triple-lock as offering ※wholly trivial§ savings. And he said the manifesto U-turn over a cap on care costs would result in ※presumably increasing public spending overall§.The Tory commitment to get net migration down to the tens of thousands risked harming the economy, particularly when coupled with the ageing British population, Emmerson said. ※Their continued focus on reducing immigration would, if effective, cause considerable economic damage as well as creating an additional problem for the public finances§.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Labour＊s manifesto already took into account attempts by the richest individuals and corporations to avoid new higher rates of tax. ※We believe the IFS has underestimated the revenue raising effectiveness of some of the tax changes we would make, but we recognise the potential for uncertainty which is why we have allowed headroom in our plans,§ he said.McDonnell said the IFS agreed that Labour would achieve a budget surplus in the last year of the parliament of around ?20bn. And while this sum was smaller than the Tory target, he said it was more likely to be achieved.※The IFS confirms that Labour are on target to meet our manifesto commitments in regards to our fiscal credibility rule, to balance the budget on day to day spending in the coming parliament and have debt falling as a share of GDP as we have committed,§ McDonnell said.※The IFS assessment of the Conservatives is clear: their plans would damage our economy and public services with five more years of damaging austerity.§"															
"Growth in zero-hours contracts has stalled in the UK, according to the latest official figures, but campaigners have warned that insecure work is still a problem in Britain.There were 1.7m zero-hours contracts in the UK in November 2016, representing 6% of all employment contracts 每 unchanged from a year earlier. The Office for National Statistics said the number of firms using zero-hours contracts had fallen.Employees on  are not guaranteed a minimum number of hours in any given week. The contracts have been widely used by retailers, restaurants, leisure companies and hotels, including  and , and tend to be most commonly used at larger firms.The Resolution Foundation thinktank said there could be a number of reasons why the use of such contracts had stalled, including the bad press received by firms using them and the , which could mean companies were struggling to attract workers if they did not guarantee hours of work.※Today＊s figures provide more evidence that the rapid rise in zero-hours contract use looks to have come to an end. It＊s likely that this reflects a combination of workers seeking alternatives in a healthier jobs market and firms recognising that they don＊t always represent an appropriate option,§ said Conor D＊Arcy, policy analyst at the foundation.He said the figures were not necessarily an indication that insecure work was becoming less of a problem in Britain. ※Agency work, short-hours contracts and self-employment have all grown substantially in recent years, increasing the number of people in ＆atypical＊ work,§ he added.A record 905,000 people were employed on zero-hours contracts in the final three months of 2016 每 about 100,000 or 13% more than a year earlier. Some people have more than one job., general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), said the latest figures were no cause for celebration and that firms were finding other ways to employ people on insecure terms. ※While it＊s good that some companies are moving away from using them, there are a staggering 1.7m zero-hours contracts still in use.※Let＊s not pretend that life at the sharp end of the labour market is getting easier. There is growing evidence of firms employing staff on short-hours contracts to avoid the bad PR associated with zero-hours jobs. These contracts guarantee as little as one hour a week and, like zero-hours contracts, leave workers at the beck and call of their bosses.§O＊Grady said every  in the run-up to the  should include a commitment to crack down on zero-hours contracts and other forms of insecure work.People on zero-hours contracts are more likely to be young, part-time, women or in full-time education. Around a third would like to work more hours than they are offered, compared with 9% of people in employment who are not on zero-hours contracts."															
"hat do you do when you are a Liberal party and delivering Liberal party budgets makes you as popular as poison? Deliver one that with a bit of slight rebranding could almost look like a Labor one. This budget does not quite bring home the bacon as Paul Keating once said, but . While the budget on the surface does look quite fair, we should remember the context. The budget still includes cuts to company taxes, which will in time offset the bank levy. It still includes the end of the 2% deficit levy for those earning over $180,000. , but so will most other taxpayers, and no one else is getting an income tax cut to more than offset the impact. Let＊s just say there is a reason this budget still does not include the traditional table breaking down the impact on households by incomes.  The budget has us returning to surplus by 2020-21. So how do we get there? After nearly a decade of saying the problem was all on the spending side, the 2017-18 budget is where the Liberal party has finally admitted that there is a revenue problem. The 2017-18 budget estimates that by 2020-21 the budget will be firmly back in surplus, and it does it mostly off the back of government revenue returning to the level it was during the surplus years of the Howard government. In the 11 years prior to the GFC, when the budget was either in surplus or balance, government revenue averaged 25.1% of GDP. In the nine years since the GFC, the highest it has been is 23.4%, and this year it was just 23.1%. To give some context 2% of GDP is around $34bn, so it＊s a fair gap. But that gap is about to be reduced.  The budget predicts that by 2019-20 government revenue will reach 25.1% of GDP and in the following year a very healthy 25.4%. The last time we saw revenue at that level was in 2005-06: To get there the budget anticipates revenue growing over the next 4 years by around 4.4% in real terms. That growth was not uncommon during the mining boom years, but has been reached only once in the past nine years:  And what it is the revenue that is growing? Income tax.  The budget predicts that personal income tax in 2019-20 will grow by 8.5% and then 7.5% the following year. That is a pretty big increase:  It will see personal income tax account for 51.4% of all taxation, while company tax, which is expected to grow by smaller amounts each year will account for just 18%. Back in 2007-08 at the height of the mining boom, income tax accounted for 44.7% of all tax and company tax was 20.7%.  We are in effect shifting the burden from companies to individuals.  And it also means there is no room for any further tax cuts unless Morrison wants to hit the revenue that is the biggest reason for reaching a surplus.  While there are some cuts 每 such as the cut of $3.7bn over 4 years to higher education and $1.9bn to those on family tax benefit 每 overwhelmingly this is a budget that gets to surplus by increasing revenue.  Government spending drops to 25% of GDP in 2019-20, but that is still higher than all but the two stimulus years of the Rudd/Gillard governments. Oh for the days when conservative railed against strong wages growth; now we have a conservative treasurer desperate for wages to grow fast. The overall economic picture is little changed from that expected last December in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook. Real GDP in 2017-18 is expected to grow at 2.75%, and nominal GDP is up a touch from 3.75% to 4% and wages growth is expected to be just 2.5%:  And it is for that reason that there is little change in the predictions for the budget balance next year. In last year＊s Myefo, the deficit in 2017-18 was expected to be 1.6% of GDP 每 and that is where it remains:  The big changes occur in the ※out years§ of the budget 每 the final two years from 2019-20 onwards.Whereas in December the government was hoping the deficit 2019-20 would be around 0.5% of GDP, now it expects it to be just 0.1%. That will see the deficit shrink in that year by 0.9% of GDP 每$19bn. It is a very big jump in a time when the economy is still expected to be growing by just 3% in real terms and 4.5% in nominal terms. So where is the growth in revenue coming from? Yes it is coming from the increase in the Medicare levy, but that alone is not enough to see income tax grow by 8%, for that we need wages to grow. The problem as we all know is wages are growing at record lows. But never fear, the budget predicts after growth of just 2% this year, wages will grow by 2.5% next year, then 3% the year after that, then 3.5%, then 3.75% in 2020-21: And yet at the same time employment is expected to grow by a steady 1.5% and the unemployment rate is expected to fall only to 5.25%. It is the most hopeful prediction in the budget, and if that wages boom doesn＊t occur, then neither will the surplus. This was the budget to put the end to the evil of debt. It doesn＊t quite do that, but it does at least differentiate between debt incurred to fund recurrent expenses and that for capital expenditure. The suspicion was that reclassifying debt into the good and bad pile would see a big increase in infrastructure spending that would get explained away as ※good debt§. That didn＊t happen.  The big infrastructure item of $5.3bn for the second Sydney airport is an equity investment and does not add to government spending in the budget as it is ※off budget§. It appears the measure was mostly included to give credit ratings agencies a reason to keep the AAA credit rating. The budget reveals that the net operating balance will be in surplus a year earlier than the traditional ※underlying cash balance§: But the story Morrison really wants highlighted is that from 2018-19 onward the government will not be borrowing money for recurrent spending, but only for capital investments. The new measures also show that if you take out capital spending from within the net operating balance the picture looks even more rosy 每 with an ※adjusted net operating balance§ in 2020-21 of $24.6bn:  I suspect that figure won＊t be given much attention 每 it does smack a little of combining figures just to come up with a story the government wants to tell. And the reality is debt needs to be paid off whether it is for capital spending or recurrent, and net debt is set to peak at 19.8% of GDP in 2018-19:  At $375.1bn it will hit a level $214bn greater than that inherited by the Abbott government in 2013.  But whether or not we＊ll talk about good or bad debt at the very least, this budget will put to bed the argument that the only way to return to surplus is by cutting spending. 每 a hole which, had revenue stayed at the pre-boom average, is the equivalent of around $377bn less revenue over the past nine years.

"ust as he reaches the end of his inspection, the environmental health officer spots the meat pies. A stack of them have tumbled on to a shelf on the floor of the storeroom, not in the chiller. A flicker of alarm crosses the transport cafe owner＊s face. Pies are big on his menu. He sighs. ※Well, it＊s complicated,§ and the story unfolds. The pies used to be made by so-and-so but the company owners split acrimoniously and it＊s all a bit chaotic now.※Ah, yes,§ says the inspector. ※I know this one.§ He has the local background and, as he probes and prods, the cafe proprietor admits sheepishly that the pies arrive with a scrappy piece of paper, no official invoice, dubiously labelled ※organic§ with no list of contents, paid for in cash to an old chap called Gramps off the back of a lorry.Here in Huntingdonshire, the number of environmental health officers has been cut by a third over the past five years. ※But the number of food outlets grows, 1,300 on our patch, with a high churn in ownership,§ says the chief officer.These public servants are a quiet lot, meticulous, precise; just another workaday arm of the state that goes unnoticed. It＊s the taken-for-granted state. If a waiter swears the chicken tikka masala contains no peanuts, we expect someone to have checked, as the wellbeing of those with severe allergies depends on it.But austerity is sweeping all this away. Local knowledge and expertise dissipate. Who remembers, before new building starts, the location of contaminated land, industrial waste, disused gas works? Pest control is on the wane. There is no out-of-hours anti-noise service.The fast-disappearing environmental health officer 每 in England, their numbers down by 25% over five years 每 is just one example of how the state is shrinking, its capacities dwindling and its fabric stretching thin. This is not just a regrettable deficit-reducing necessity, but a long-term political project to return us to a pre-second world war dominance of the private realm. And so far, that seems to have worked, with relatively little complaint from a public that has widely accepted the story of the exchequer＊s . Opinion polls suggest a sense of resignation that has allowed the functions of the state to be dismembered, fragmented and degraded as deliberate policy.Diminished trust in the public realm is part of the explanation for the Brexit vote. ※Take back control§ was a perverse slogan that cleverly captured a feeling of things falling apart. That is because the idea of the state has been systematically disrespected and derided as a concept to be regarded with suspicion. People may rely in their daily lives on myriad unseen state services, yet they are encouraged to despise the bureaucrats who keep everything running.The shrinkage was no emergency operation to balance the books: it was the realisation of a 40-year rightwing project to downgrade, downsize and disparage the public realm.  and  committed to push the state down to 36% of GDP or less, for ever, and Philip Hammond repeated that target . Current spending is now just under 38%, with the target of 36% to be reached in 2020. Getting there means a volume of public services greatly smaller than in equivalent European countries. People ask why German roads, health services and civic environments are so superior: the answer is that their state is larger than ours, at 44% of GDP. Why is Danish wellbeing so much higher than ours? Their state provides more comfort, being in receipt of 50% of GDP.In the general election, Brexit occludes the question, which ultimately every election has to be about: are we willing to pay for a state that secures wellbeing? The Tories won＊t admit that Brexit demands more not less government.  has talked of the good that government does, but has declined to face the fiscal consequences. For its part, Labour (and the Scottish Nationalists) won＊t acknowledge that soaking ※the rich§ and raking in more from uncollected taxes won＊t provide enough revenue: median earners and all of us have to pay more.Meanwhile, the  is now squeezed more harshly than ever in its history. Schools are losing staff in the latest cuts.  will cause inequality to take off as steeply as it did in the 1980s, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, with a 50% rise in child poverty by 2020.What is less reported is how the thinning of public services weakens bonds of community as the emblems of orderliness disappear 每 the vanishing park keepers, estate caretakers, station masters, guards, crown post office counters, district nurses, health visitors, local police on the beat and community support officers.When she was home secretary May cut police numbers by a fifth. , but the work of the police is increasingly about reassurance and social order. The thinning blue line fills the gaps left as other services stretch and snap: it is the last resort. On a typical night shift in Bedford and Luton, police hear the cries of distress, the suicide attempts, the terrified, the psychotic and the shrieking family rows that remind us that people will always need help; the police are often the only ones left to respond.What is the social glue that binds us to Britishness if not the things we share collectively? Government underpins pride in who we are. When fine old town halls from Sheffield to Hornsey, north London, are sold off as boutique hotels, when councils sell slices of parks, when libraries and local museums close, we lose what defines us.  with Capita, Virgin, Sodexo and the rest are written on water. The sale of everything from power stations, property and basic transport systems to foreign powers is a form of treason other countries resist.Marketisers, outsourcers, asset-strippers and state-shrinkers are not patriots: they surf the world on seas of money, undermining community and nationality. The NHS and the , but under constant assault from anti-statists affronted by their very success.Part of the dismembering has been the deliberate complexification of services and blurred lines of responsibility. Successive governments＊ attitude to services has been to cut bits off, chop them up and, bizarrely, force their limbs to compete with one another, trying to portray them as commercial. Schools must be academies in chains with reassuringly market-oriented names 每 Enterprise, Oasis, Reach or Harris (named after the carpets magnate). The  must be broken into trusts vying with each other for business. The frail must hold individual budgets to purchase their own care privately. Some of these services may be good 每 but this approach indicates a flight from the idea that the state itself does good.Outsourcing, offloading and privatising leaves less of the state and less that is ostensibly ours, even though it is still paid for by our taxes. Gigantic, mainly overseas companies and often foreign governments own slabs of utilities, land, property and infrastructure that were once ours.Not even our sewage belongs to us. The government created a company called Tideway, comfortably underpinned by Treasury guarantees, to work on behalf of privately owned Thames Water to construct a  alongside the river. Thames Water is owned by shifting international investors, whose sealed, ambiguous contracts include Chinese corporations supervised by the Communist party, although cheaper finance could be raised by the British state. The National Audit Office is rightly anxious about the taxpayer＊s huge liabilities, but Tideway managed to frighten ministers with warnings of raw sewage spilling into the Thames. So who gains?Sir Ian Byatt, a former Treasury official who was the first head of Ofwat, the water regulator, gives a forthright answer: neither the fish in the Thames nor households will benefit. ※Thames Water is an incredibly complicated company. There will be an array of extra dividends sliced and diced into the pockets of all these different interests along the way.§ The state could do simpler, smaller schemes more cheaply. Paying needlessly high interest rates, the cost of the super sewer will be added to all Thames Water customers＊ bills, who have no choice but to pay. Digging has just begun.Since the , the UK has been subject to a giant experiment in the ability of markets to sustain the common interest, with light-touch regulation. Over time, the failures have multiplied. The government itself now inveighs against the cartel grip of the . Markets dashed for gas, regardless of security of supply; they ditched nuclear and only turned to wind and solar with hefty state incentives, then stopped as soon as those were axed. However faltering, only the state can confront climate change 每 which is why the right clings to .Localism has often been another assault on the state, breaking up central government to cast chunks down to impoverished councils, handing over the axe. Cuts of a fifth in English council budgets between 2010 and 2015 have been grossly unfair, poor Liverpool cut hardest, rich Dorset least. Soon councils will keep their own business rates, worsening regional inequalities: Westminster makes so much it could pay its denizens a dividend, while Middlesbrough is left penniless.Our ageing population needs more, not less state support. Take podiatry, an unglamorous backwater of the NHS, cut back by commissioners struggling to finance A&E or maternity. But feet matter, too, never more than with the rocketing cases of type 2 diabetes. Southampton is typical, where we found  have serious consequences for mobility: every week in England, 135 diabetics have gangrenous limbs amputated that could have been saved if foot ulcers had been caught sooner. Across the NHS, cuts in prevention lead to higher spending later.In Shropshire, the sudden axing of the Link bus service connecting 5,000 people across a string of villages has wrecked many lives: those without cars who used to travel daily to Bridgnorth for work, shopping or doctor＊s appointments are now left isolated with just one weekly bus, driven by a volunteer. Compare that with the borough of Reading, a rare council that clung to running its own buses when John Major privatised most: it makes ?1m a year so efficiently that 93% of journeys are taken by its popular buses, not cars. That＊s just one challenge to the prevailing politics that claims the state always does everything worse.What confronts Britain in the 21st century is a class of problem that only collective action can solve. How to stop inequality being amplified generation after generation? The country＊s 3,500 children＊s centres were one of Labour＊s best achievements, founded on all the evidence that helping children in their early years makes most difference. But many centres have shut, had vital services ripped out, leaving others no more than shells for skimpy private nurseries. But on a recent visit to Springfield children＊s centre in the West Midlands district of Sandwell, we saw parents on the edge of despair rescued; listening to their stories should weaken the hardest anti-state heart.Only the state can deal with looming problems in productivity, regional imbalance, energy, climate change, automation, reskilling. Take research and development. The Sheffield engineering startup  is developing a magnetic gearbox for hybrid cars that was invented at Sheffield University in 2000 and cuts fuel consumption by 35%. Such projects take patience and funding, both in scarce qualities among short-termist venture capitalists; only state support with adequate research funds could see the gearbox through to use in cars for 2022. But Britain has a lot less R&D for these ※catapult§ schemes than competitor countries. Take another case of creative state funding: the Royal Shakespeare Company took seven years to develop the worldwide hit , ※the most difficult and expensive show§, according to the executive director and ※nothing short of a miracle§ according to reviewers. No commercial producer could invest that much for so long: now it yields great dividends for the RSC and the exchequer. But though the cultural sector, broadly, brings in ?77bn a year, funding for Arts Council England has been reduced and the next generation of creators are being stymied by a Gradgrind curriculum with few schools able to afford art, design, drama, music and dance teaching.The old anti-state canard pretends private enterprise creates national wealth, while governments spend and squander it. After 2010, the  claimed public employment ※crowded out§ private initiative, so they cut more than a million public sector jobs. Yet wealth creation depends on a strong state, not only for protection of property by the law, but for decent roads and railways, regulators ensuring fair markets, for the health and education of private enterprise staff, and for the same clean air we all breathe. The business world has a mistaken cultural reflex that pleads for low tax and less government, yet everything that makes commerce flourish relies on a strong state.Public servants soldier on with swelling caseloads but less pay, keeping going, often heroically dedicated. , according to the Resolution Foundation. Of course, not all are heroes: vigilant management has to ensure the public face of the state is kind, effective and innovative. Polls show great popular affection for public servants whom people know 每 their child＊s teacher, their doctor, their local police. Yet they have imbibed the political poison that thinks the state is probably bad value, inefficient and extravagant. A few fat-cat chief executive stories die hard. Is that where their taxes go? This is a hymn of praise to what should be blindingly obvious 每 the triumph of our collective endeavours. Years of chiselling away at the foundations of trust in good government mean it needs saying again and again: what we do together through paying our taxes and concerning ourselves with our common good is worth more than any private gain through market transactions. Margaret Thatcher said you will always spend the pound in your pocket better than the state will; her political heirs believe it still. But they are profoundly wrong in fact and in principle. What we buy together is worth infinitely more than anything we can buy in a shop. In a renewed state lies strength and identity 每 and a reclaimed sense of lost nationhood."															
"Poverty reduction in the world＊s poorest countries risks being diluted by the government＊s increasing tendency to devote a bigger slice of Britain＊s aid budget to pursuing the national interest, the  has warned.The thinktank estimated that overseas development assistance would rise by ?1bn during the course of the next parliament as a result of .But it said that in recent years less of ODA spending was being channeled through the Department for International Development, with a growing emphasis on ensuring UK firms benefited.In a pre-election analysis, the IFS said Britain＊s spending on aid had almost doubled since Tony Blair promised to meet the UN target at the . Spending had risen in inflation-adjusted terms from ?7.4bn to ?13.6bn in 2016 and was on course to reach almost ?15bn by 2021.Cross-party adherence to the 2005 promise meant that DfID was spared the austerity that affected most government departments after the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition came to power in 2010, the IFS said.DfID＊s budget had risen by 24% between 2010-11 and 2015-16, while the average cuts for departments outside of the NHS, education and defence were 28%.But the IFS said there had been a change of emphasis since 2015, with more than a quarter of the aid budget now being spent outside DFID in 2016 up from 14% two years earlier.※So far Theresa May has made it clear that if she wins the election she will uphold the UK＊s commitment to spending 0.7% of GNI [gross national income]on ODA§, the IFS report said. ※However, across the main parties, there has been little indication of how this money will be spent and what balance they will aim to strike between national interest and global poverty alleviation goals in UK aid spending going forward.§May has been under pressure from some of her own MPs and from Conservative-supporting newspapers to cut aid spending, but announced last month that she would be renewing the 0.7% pledge. Diverting some of the money to other departments 每 such business, energy and industrial strategy 每 is seen as a way of blunting the attacks.The IFS said that despite criticism of aid being squandered, overseas assistance was the most heavily scrutinised part of government spending, with oversight from the International Development Committee, the National Audit Office and the Independent Commission for  Impact.Sonya Krutikova, an author of the IFS report, said: ※The UK is now recognised internationally as leading on shaping the global development agenda and the Department for International Development scores highly on the international Aid Transparency Index.※A change of strategy since 2015 means that more emphasis is now put on using ODA spending for the UK＊s national interest. There is clearly a trade-off between this, spending outside of ODA altogether, and ensuring the money is used most effectively for global poverty alleviation.§"															
															
"Instead of new bank holidays for each of the nations of the UK , why not make national elections a public holiday as in many other countries? This would help to make it as easy for many people in employment to vote, as it is for people who are retired or not in work. Alternatively, voting should take place at weekends, thereby avoiding disruption to schools. Improving turnout and making the voting process just as convenient for everyone would be a?step towards a healthier democracy. I hope the article on how the prime minister came to her decision to call an election while walking above Dolgellau (, 22?April) isn＊t an indication of the treatment Wales can expect from the political parties and the media during this campaign and the subsequent parliament: it was written by your North of England correspondent. So, ※§ (15?April). At what point in this progress towards robots taking over everyone＊s job and leaving them without employment or, more crucially, income is someone going to notice that demand is falling off so precipitously for the goods and services that the robots have been producing (because not enough people can afford them any more) that the robots themselves are becoming redundant? And what then? I write regarding the Jacobite toast mentioned in Claire Stares＊  (14 April). In her wonderful book A Country Scrapbook, Lilias Rider Haggard wrote: ※In 1702 [William III＊s] sorrel pony stumbled over a molehill and threw him when riding at Hampton Court ＃ and there he died, thus giving the Jacobites their famous toast ＆To the Little Gentleman in Black Velvet.＊§ Since a sorrel pony is chestnut, the Jacobites must be toasting the mole (, 21 April). Jogging?along the tracks in a cemetery is one thing, but please do not encourage hide-and-seek among the gravestones (Notes and queries, 20 April). In 2000 a young boy was killed by a falling stone when playing in a Harrogate cemetery. This led to safety checks by the council throughout the borough and the subsequent lowering of thousands of memorials."															
"he rise of anti-globalisation political movements and the threat of trade protectionism have led some people to wonder whether a stronger multilateral core for the world economy would reduce the risk of damaging fragmentation. After all, lest we forget, the current arrangements 每 as pressured as they are 每 reflected our post-world war two forebears＊ strong desire to minimise the risk of ※beggar-thy-neighbour§ national policies, which had crippled growth, prosperity and global stability in the 1930s.Similar considerations fuelled the launch, nearly 50 years ago, of the International Monetary Fund＊s special drawing right as the precursor to a global currency. And with renewed interest in the stability of the international monetary system, some are asking 每 including within the IMF 每 whether revamping the SDR could be part of an effective effort to re-energise multilateralism.The original impetus for the SDR included concerns about a national currency＊s ability to reconcile the need for global liquidity provision with confidence in its role as the world＊s reserve currency 每 what economists call the ※Triffin dilemma§. By creating an international currency that would be managed by the IMF, member countries sought to underpin and enhance the international monetary system with a non-national official reserve asset.Legal and practical factors, as well as some countries＊ political resistance to delegating economic governance to multilateral institutions, have prevented the SDR from meeting its creators＊ modest expectations, let alone the grand role of a truly global reserve currency that anchors the cooperative functioning of a growth-oriented global economy. Information and other market failures have added to the challenges, as have weak institutional infrastructure and inadequate branding. The result is a substantial gap between the SDR＊s potential and its performance.That gap has meant missed opportunities for the global economy 每 particularly in terms of asset liability management, responsive liquidity, adjustment between deficit and surplus countries 每 and thus a gap between actual and potential growth. With the SDR providing a stronger glue at the international monetary system＊s core, prudential currency diversification could have been made easier, the need for costly and inefficient self-insurance could have been reduced and the provision of liquidity could have been made less pro-cyclical.So, do today＊s anti-globalisation winds 每 caused in part by poor global policy coordination in the context of too many years of low and insufficiently inclusive growth 每 create scope for enhancing the SDR＊s role and potential contributions?Addressing this question, were it to gain traction, would involve a focus on an ecosystem of SDR use, with the composite currency 每 which last year added the Chinese renminbi to the British pound, euro, Japanese yen and US dollar 每 potentially benefiting from a virtuous cycle. Specifically, the SDR＊s three roles 每 an official reserve asset, a currency used more broadly in financial activity and a numeraire 每 could ensure greater official liquidity, expand the range of new assets used around the world in public and private transactions, and boost its use as a unit of account.Of course, given the advanced economies＊ embrace of more inward-looking, populist and nationalist politics, a ※big bang§ approach to reinvigorating the SDR is highly unlikely. Even an incremental approach, starting with practical low-hanging fruit that does not require amendments to the IMF＊s articles of agreement, would face political challenges. But it would be worth considering.Areas of focus would include using the SDR for some bond issuance and trade transactions, developing market infrastructure (including payments and settlement mechanisms), improving valuation methodologies and gradually developing a yield curve for SDR-denominated loans and bonds. This would also help to leverage the inter-connectedness of the SDR＊s roles, in order to reach critical mass quickly and have a foundation for further incremental gains.For the effort to succeed, the IMF＊s approach would need to evolve 每 just like it did on country-specific issues.When I joined the IMF in the early 1980s, discussions with non-government counterparts, whether on country or policy work, were discouraged. The situation today is very different. Broader national engagement 每 with NGOs, local media and a broad set of politicians 每 is now viewed as an integral part of effective country advice and program implementation, as well as being essential for the fund＊s ※surveillance§ function under its article of agreements.A similar pivot is needed if the IMF is to deliver better on the supranational issues that are now migrating up its policy agenda. Specifically, the fund would need to complement its traditional core constituency of governments and other multilateral institutions (particularly the World Bank) with systemically influential sub-national and private counterparts. The resulting public-private partnerships would enhance issuance, the development of market infrastructure, and liquidity provision for the SDR.While it is not easy to combine developmental and commercial activities, the implications for global growth and stability of  doing so suggest that it is an effort that should be explored. Moreover, the IMF could start small, focusing on interactions with other official multilateral and regional institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and multinational financial companies 每 all anchored by an active coalition of the willing among the G20.In an ideal world, the SDR would have evolved into more of a reserve currency during the era of accelerated trade and financial globalisation. In the world as it is today, the international monetary system faces two options: fragmentation, with all the risks and opportunity costs that this implies, or an incremental approach to bolstering the global economy＊s resilience and potential growth, based on bottom-up partnerships that facilitate systemic progress."															
"unday 23 April was a historic day for . Neither the main rightwing party (Les R谷publicains) nor the leftwing Parti Socialiste are through to the second round of the presidential election, which takes place on 7 May. It is also historic because the lead candidate going into the second round is the young head of a groundbreaking new political movement, En Marche! (Onwards!), which was launched only a year ago. and En Marche! have made it to the second round because over the past year they have been bold enough to take risks on many issues. Macron has dared to challenge the established French party-political system in order to find ways of meeting citizens＊ expectations in a globalised 21st century.Furthermore, Macron is proudly pro-European. He has taken the ※risk§ of a founding EU country of not just standing by its commitments to the EU, but proposing to strengthen them 每 at a time when most other candidates are making dangerous promises about withdrawing from the EU, reneging on important treaty commitments or toying with leaving the eurozone.Reform of the EU is needed. Macron is proposing to work with his European partners to strengthen and develop it. He puts an end to years of ambiguity from the right, the left and the centre during which the political class, as in many other European countries, was effectively attending the European church without having any faith, nor courage, to defend what they had agreed in Brussels. If he is elected, these days will be over.In particular, Macron understands the importance of the euro. He knows that it is a bold political project, going beyond monetary issues, and an important global reserve currency. While many candidates were focusing on the euro as the scapegoat for all of France＊s (not insignificant) woes, and flirted with the idea of leaving the eurozone or blackmailing Germany and other partners, Macron had the courage to present a different vision for France, one that underlines the fact that the euro, is a shared currency, which brings with it both advantages and responsibilities.Macron is convinced that sound public finances and bold structural reforms, if introduced in a socially fair way, are in France＊s interest. These responsibilities are stated in the treaties, which have been jointly negotiated and then democratically ratified by all countries, including France. They must be respected. Far from simply being an ideological project this is a question of ensuring France＊s and the EU＊s global positioning.Since the EU was founded, the Franco-German relationship has been its motor and Macron took a clear stance on this too: he wants to reinforce and strengthen this crucial relationship. Macron was brave enough to praise Angela Merkel＊s refugee policy, a legal commitment of all EU countries, to underline the need for humanity and finding common solutions to difficult but urgent and tragic problems.The vision Macron has of the world in 2017 is a realistic one: he refuses to exploit nostalgia or make empty promises. He believes France has great potential, and wants the country to fulfil it on both the European and the global stages. To share sovereignty at the European level is our best chance of actually remaining sovereign: not on paper but in reality. Macron took the time to explain that the challenges faced in the 21st century, such as terrorism and climate change, do not respect international borders. In order to be able to respond to these challenges, France needs to work with its European partners at the supranational level and to promote a cooperative world order.The first round results show that many of France＊s citizens are aware of these challenges and welcome a candidate who candidly faces up to them. The challenge now is to ensure that it is this open, future-oriented vision that triumphs in two weeks, rather than a closed nationalist one which would lead to turmoil and suffering, not just in France but throughout the EU. Macron is not the candidate of the establishment. By telling the truth, he respects the people more than his challenger. Marine Le Pen presents herself as a patriot but France, proud of its universal openness, does not belong to her tribe."															
"The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, needs only to cast his mind back to the March budget to judge the public＊s reaction to higher taxes.  paid by the better off among the self-employed was widely condemned, not least by McDonnell himself. on those earning more than ?80,000 overcomes the objections of all but an elite, who have fared well enough since the 2008 crash while ordinary working women and men have seen their incomes barely recover.It is understandable that McDonnell should focus on figures from official statistics that show the average wage is only ?26,500 and that 40% of the workforce earn so little that they do not pay any tax at all when judging who should pay more towards squeezed public services.To earn more than ?80,000 is to put yourself in the top 5% of earners who must, by virtue of their income, have a greater capacity to contribute at a higher rate than those further down the pay league.Families across most of the income scale suffered years of shrinking real pay packets after the financial crisis and rising inflation is eating into earnings again this year. How,  asks, can the low paid be asked to make a bigger contribution when they remain among the worst hit by the financial crisis in the developed world?But McDonnell is caught in the same trap as his Tory counterpart when he says that targeting a relatively small group 每 the top 5% in his case, the self-employed in Hammond＊s 每 can overcome the still significant deficits in the public finances.Official figures covering the existing tax bands show that . A 1% increase for the ?150,000-plus band would only bring in just ?165m. It is a reasonable guess to say the revenue generated by an extra tax on a new ?80,000 band would be nearer the latter and not the former, even should Labour push the ?150,000 back towards the old 50p rate.Only a 1% rise on the basic 20p rate would bring in the sums needed to move the dial on the public deficit. It would add an annual ?4.5bn to the exchequer＊s bank balance.This electioneering, when the political parties argue that someone other than the mainstream voter can fund public services, has been called ※the candour deficit§ by the Resolution Foundation.McDonnell says his sums will add up once plans to raid capital gains and corporate profits are taken into account, but experience shows that, like it or not, these are avoidable taxes. Not just because HMRC lacks the resources to catch the avoiders, but because profits can be delayed or disguised if it is worthwhile doing so. Ironically, given the level of pay involved, people earning about ?80,000 have seen their incomes stagnate. It is the top 1% (those earning over ?162,000) who have run away with the gains made since the financial crash, but there are not enough of them to raise the funds needed. Taxing their wealth would make a difference, but governments need to cast the net wider to haul the public finances out of the current mire."															
															
"Fears that Donald Trump＊s arrival in the White House is threatening a new era of protectionism have prompted a joint defence of trade from the International Monetary Fund, the  and the World Trade Organisation.Warning that the role of trade in the global economy was at a critical juncture, the three multilateral bodies said the opening up of markets had been good for growth but admitted that action was needed to help ※left behind§ individuals and communities. but accepted that the surge in protectionist sentiment in hard-hit communities was justified.It noted that ※adjustment to trade can bring a human and economic downside that is frequently concentrated, sometimes harsh, and has too often become prolonged.

However, a prolonged period of disappointing economic growth and inadequate attention to those left behind by forces such as trade, globalisation and technology has spurred increased scepticism over open trade in some quarters. ※Countering this by better communicating the benefits of trade, and better sharing these benefits with those affected by trade-related dislocations, are critical to restoring strong, inclusive global growth.§The IMF and the World Bank will hold their spring meetings in Washington next week, when both organisations are expected to stress the importance of combating protectionism and of ensuring the benefits of growth are more evenly distributed.The WTO has been struggling since 2001 to complete the , a complex multilateral negotiation involving more than 160 countries. The three organisations said they wanted to stress the ※role of supporting domestic policies and prompt attention to those individuals and communities at risk of being left behind. Key policy initiatives such as training, temporary income support, job search assistance and targeted trade adjustment assistance are important. Approaches beyond labour market policies 每 such as education, housing and regional policy 每 are also needed.§ While acknowledging that bilateral and regional trade deals had a role to play, the report said a strong global trading system based on the WTO was critical. The IMF said in a separate report that workers were receiving a substantially smaller share of national income than in the 1980s, blaming technological change and globalisation for 75% of the decline. In a chapter from its forthcoming World Economic Outlook, .It added that technology was twice as important as globalisation in reducing labour＊s share of income but said the ability of firms to outsource production to lower-cost countries had eroded workers＊ bargaining power.The IMF said rising inequality had accompanied the shift in national income away from labour and towards capital. Middle-income jobs had been hollowed out and the benefits of growth had gone increasingly to the owners of capital.※As the global economy continues to struggle with subpar growth, an increasing recognition that the gains from growth often have not been broadly shared has strengthened a backlash against economic integration and bolstered support for inward-looking policies,§ the IMF said, adding that rising inequality created social tension and led to slower growth."

That gulf reflects the fact part-time workers 每 both men and women 每 earn less on average per hour than their full-time counterparts and a much higher proportion of women work part-time.Yet ask big employers about where the gap has come from and they will inundate you with information about their firm＊s diversity schemes, mentoring programmes and parental support. Everyone says they are doing something, and yet here we are. Women still earn significantly less than men on average and progress is laughably slow. One analysis, by consultants Deloitte, estimated that at this pace  每 or 99 years after the Equal Pay Act.The government knows this is bad for productivity and bad for society. So this week, possibly tired of waiting for change, it is shaking things up.From Thursday, employers with more than 250 staff will be  so they can publish their gender pay gap, gender bonus gap and a breakdown of how many women and men get a bonus. They must also reveal the proportion of men and women in each of four pay segments, or quartiles, from lowest to highest pay. There are no rules about what bosses should do once they uncover pay gaps but the government＊s push to get the figures out into the cold light of day has to be welcome. The results must be published within 12 months on the employer＊s website and a government site. If customers do not like what they see, they can go elsewhere. The same goes for potential recruits. Existing employees could use the findings to challenge their managers.At its simplest, this is naming and shaming. No one will want to be top of the gender pay inequality rankings. But there is also an element of helping companies to help themselves. Unless they recognise the awkward truth that they have a pay gap, they won＊t do anything to get rid of it.It＊s worth being slightly cynical and recognising that not everyone will be upfront about their pay differences. Employment lawyer Josephine Van Lierop at Slater and Gordon notes employers are not required to provide any narrative with their pay data and so they may fail to shine any light on why they have a gap. She goes further:But let＊s hope the majority recognises the benefits of taking the new rules seriously and using them as a chance to boost both morale and productivity. To do that, employers will need to get to the bottom of what has caused any gaps.That is harder than it sounds. The reasons for the gender pay gap are many and complex. Given there are laws against men earning more than women for doing exactly the same work, gaps are rarely down to outright discrimination.One factor often flagged for women＊s lower earnings is the time they take out to have children and the nature of work they return to 每 the so-called .The Office for National Statistics (ONS) notes the gender gap is relatively small up to age 39 for full-time employees. From 40 upwards, the gap is much wider. So it goes from just 1.5% for 30-39 year-olds to 13.4% for the 40-49 age bracket and 16.2% for the 50-59 bracket.Employers must also ask themselves how they are treating people who choose to go part-time. From the age group 22-29 upwards, the pay gap for full-time and part-time employees together is wider than for full-time employees alone. The ONS says this shows that, in those age groups, more women are working part-time in jobs that tend to be lower paid.But it is worth noting that for just part-time workers, the gender pay gap was minus 6% in 2016 每 meaning female part-time employees earned 6.0% more than male part-time employees.Those who really want to close their pay gaps will look at their findings by age group and will consider whether parental and other caring duties are responsible. Then they will consider what sort of parental leave they are providing for men and women and what flexibility they could offer, whether that is working from home or job shares.Employers should also look at how many women they are promoting into the top, high-earning positions and whether they are considering a wide range of candidates when jobs come up.A more radical reaction to their findings would be simply to close the gap by giving women a pay rise. One firm that did that, London marketing start-up Brainlabs, was . After it found an 8.6% pay gap, it raised female employees＊ pay by an average of 8.6%. The idea 每 agreed by a company-wide vote 每 was that rather than waiting for good intentions to level up men and women＊s pay over time, the employer levels the pay and then works backwards to ensure individuals＊ pay represents value for money for the firm.About a year on from introducing what it dubbed the ※pay gap tax§, Brainlabs director Sophie Newton says the gap is now a ※negligible§ 1.8%. The company has been looking at how to entrench gender equality through its recruitment, management, pay, environment and giving people ways to speak up.Newton, a mathematician, has built technology that tracks and shows the gender balance and pay gap for the company, each team and department. ※I can see on a daily basis what the stats are and am aware of small shifts over the course of a year,§ she says. ※More importantly, the measures introduced last year have contributed to a much more gender-balanced company at all levels,§ she adds. Half of its 90 employees are now female and three of the eight senior managers are women.It would be naive to think many others will take such radical action when the inconvenient truths about their pay gaps start appearing on company websites over the coming year. But the new rules will shed a fresh light on gender pay discrepancies and surely recognising the scale of the pay gap problem is better than carrying on as if it will close itself."															
"Rising house prices now stand at an average 7.6 times the average annual salary, more than double the figure for 20 years ago, according to official figures.However, the new headline figure disguises dramatic regional variations. In the affluent London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, house prices are typically 38.5 times greater than annual earnings, but, 330 miles to the north-west, prices in Copeland, Cumbria, which includes the port of Whitehaven, are typically 2.8 times the average salary.The  in England and Wales between 1997 and 2016 have been issued by the Office for National Statistics. They said the median price paid for a home leapt by 259% over this period, while median individual annual earnings could only manage a 68% rise.The ONS said housing affordability ※has worsened in all local authority districts§. In 1997, house prices were on average about 3.6 times workers＊ annual gross full-time earnings.In 2016, Kensington and Chelsea was the least affordable area to buy a property in England and Wales. The ratio of house prices to annual income stood at 38.5 times average annual salary 每 more than three times the figure in 1997, when it was 11.8 times earnings. In January this year a detached house in the borough sold for ?24.2m, .Copeland, meanwhile, has been officially named ※the most affordable§ local authority area in England and Wales. A two-bed terraced property in Whitehaven can be picked up for ?45,000 or so, .Of the 10 least affordable local authorities, seven were in London. For example, in 1999, an employee in the borough of Camden could expect to pay 7.7 times their annual salary on buying a property, whereas in 2016 this had leapt to an average 19.6 times their annual earnings.Other areas saw much smaller increases over the same period. In Hyndburn in Lancashire, the equivalent figure has risen from 2.6 times to 4.1 times earnings."															
"nleash the power of markets and the private sector will deliver returns that raise everyone＊s living standards: that＊s the market liberalism argument. However, for a decade now we have been living in a world where the opposite is true. . The financial crisis was 10 years ago but austerity looks set to continue into the middle of the next decade, as we endlessly wait for the recovery that＊s always round the corner.The chancellor, , berated Labour during his budget speech for wanting to ※saddle our children and burden our future§, but young people who entered the jobs market in 2010 will be in their mid-to-late 30s before austerity is projected to end. It＊s not ※protecting our children＊s future§ to keep them in low-waged, precarious work from 18 to 38. The UK government is issuing 40-year bonds at 1.87% and, in a fit of perversity, we＊re ※protecting§ our children from those interest payments by forcing them to take payday loans at 1,500%.The extremists demand more and more ※flexibility§, which is code for lower wages and more insecurity. Just keep beating people until they realise the real economic growth was inside them all along. But if we want a flexible, entrepreneurial economy, the last thing you want is for everyone to be desperately scrambling from low-paid job to low-paid job, weighed down with crippling debts.GK Chesterton coined a metaphor about the importance of security in his book Orthodoxy. He described a children＊s playground on top of a hill, surrounded by steep cliffs. ※So long as there was a wall round the cliff＊s edge they could fling themselves into every frantic game.§ But, he continued, if the wall were removed, the children would be ※huddled in terror in the centre of the island§.Capitalistic markets can be playgrounds where creativity can flourish. But entrepreneurial endeavour is by definition risky. The future is unpredictable. There is no such thing as a sure thing. If we put up safety nets and walls around the playground, people can take more risks. If we surround it with spiked pits of penury and illness we stifle that creativity and leave people unable to flourish properly.We worry about robots taking our jobs, but part of the issue in the last decade has been that they haven＊t. Far from delivering productivity increases, firms haven＊t invested in capital and have banked on low-waged workers. The big ※disruption§ technology of the past couple of years has been freelance workers picking up piecework via mobile apps. Take the phone out of the equation and so-called disrupters are no different from Victorian factories paying home workers per matchbox.State spending, although decried by market fundamentalists as a drag on the economy, is actually a boon to employers. The NHS saves British business thousands on health insurance, compared with their counterparts in the supposedly more flexible US, as well as being cheaper and having the benefit of not condemning millions of people to bankruptcy and death. Public transportation enables their employees to get to work. Every pound the state spends on infrastructure is a pound firms do not have to.If what we want is a flexible economy where capitalist creative destruction produces real innovation and productivity growth, we need to insulate workers from downsides of that destruction. Calls for increased flexibility are also admissions that unemployment isn＊t the fault of individual workers being lazy but of firms responding to macroeconomic conditions. It＊s perverse and counterproductive for cleaners and office workers to shoulder the brunt of conditions they had absolutely no hand in creating.Strengthening the welfare state and government acting as what economists call an ※§ would reinstate the safety net, the wall around the cliff edge that acts as a lower bound on income. The truth is that vested interests don＊t want this because the more precarious their workforce, the greater the amount of risk they can pass on to their employees, the less they can pay and the less they have to innovate. While firms may headline their requests for spending cuts and tax breaks as demands for a ※flexible and innovative economy§, what their behaviour tells us they really want is a low-wage workforce and less competition. A lower bound on income would mean they actually have to bid for workers by offering decent wages, not be gifted a workforce that will take any scraps as an alternative to the humiliations of a vindictive welfare system. should also lead us to ask, why do we even have that regressive system in the first place? We shouldn＊t just be challenging the government to not raise NICs, but to abolish them altogether. The Tories called it a ※tax on jobs§ and they＊re not wrong 每 the tax burden occurs when people are employed, not when profits are made, which is backwards. Taking NICs out of the equation would give firms the financial room to raise wages, and enforcing minimum income standards would give them the incentive to pass the tax break back on to workers, rather than simply banking it offshore.If all our late capitalist system has to offer is a race to the bottom on wages and the privatisation of state services, isn＊t it time to ask what the point of it is? Why are we cutting living standards to the bone and  to preserve a system that delivers payday loans instead of pay rises? If the wealthy want us to believe that their desired flexible market economies deliver growth for all, they need to start delivering."															
"e entered the quarter with deflation and exited the quarter with inflation,§ declared Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury＊s, . Once upon a time, this would have been taken as excellent news for shareholders, as opposed to customers. Inflationary breezes, allowing prices to be raised faster than overheads, used to be a supermarket＊s best friend and surest way to protect profit margins. Not now.Coupe didn＊t give a figure for price inflation at Sainsbury＊s, but it is unlikely to be as high as he 每 and his competitors 每 would wish. Industry consultant Kantar . That was double the rate in the previous month, but we＊re not talking about the 5% within six months that his predecessor, Justin King, forecast four months ago for the entire industry.King＊s argument was that, since 40% to 50% of food in supermarkets is imported, a 5% increase in prices would be required to compensate for the 10% fall in the pound since the referendum. King＊s figure will almost certainly arrive in time, one suspects, but not within his six-month horizon. Instead, supermarkets are having to take much of the inflationary hit on the chin.As Coupe said: ※The market remains very competitive and the impact of cost price pressures remains uncertain.§ Put another way, discounters Aldi and Lidl 每 who weren＊t forces in the land during previous sterling devaluations 每 lie in wait for any supermarket that thinks it can help itself to a currency-inspired price rise. Supermarkets＊ share prices, becalmed as the overall stock market marches upwards, tell the story.  was great for supermarkets only when competition was weaker. Life has changed.In Sainsbury＊s case, the acquisition of Argos, where like-for-like sales rose 4.3%, looks smarter by the month. The timing was sound. But the supermarkets, where sales were flat, are on a tough treadmill.Those MPs who spent Thursday beating up the  in parliament may also note the supermarkets＊ experience. In the electricity and gas market, price increases are being blamed on different factors 每 rising wholesale prices and the cost of programmes to upgrade infrastructure 每 but the seemingly mechanical nature of the hikes is striking.Even if one concedes (many wouldn＊t) that the energy market is competitive, it would be hard to argue that it＊s as competitive as food retailing. It is a point the government, preparing a green paper on protecting the interests of consumers, may care to make when the Big Six next protest that their price rises were forced by factors beyond their control. It is not against the rules to counter those forces and take a bit of short-term pain yourself.In 2014,  was deemed in some quarters to be such a mess that a takeover by rival  would be an act of mercy. Balfour had issued umpteen profit warnings and Carillion, lobbying for an all-share deal, was regarded as the sector＊s slickest operator. Three years on, Balfour＊s shareholders should give thanks the takeover didn＊t happen. Their company＊s recovery continues while Carillion＊s share price has sunk by a third.It would be exaggeration to say Leo Quinn, the outsider recruited to cure Balfour＊s many ailments, has completed the task. Even in a low-margin business like construction, making an operating profit of ?67m on revenues of ?8.5bn does not count as success. But it is true that a dose of common sense, after Balfour＊s grim chapter of over-bidding for contracts, has made a difference. Quinn pledged to improve the cash position by ?200m in the first two years while removing ?100m of costs. In the event, he reported ?439m and ?123m respectively.The way he tells it, the trick was to make 45 businesses, accumulated during Balfour＊s old acquisition spree, into one. ※A federated culture had resulted in layers of unnecessary cost and a tendency for elements of the business to compete with one another,§ he says. Balfour now has one IT director instead of 14.True success will arrive only when Balfour delivers the ※industry standard§ profit margins Quinn talks about. The target is by the end of next year. If standard means 2.5%, profits would pass ?200m on current revenues, which would be a proper improvement. The morale of the 2014 episode seems simple. In a business such as construction, where contracts rarely run for longer than two or three years and the poison can flushed out of the system quite quickly, it is usually better to fix a troubled business than to sell it in a weak moment."															
"Britain＊s manufacturers increased production last month at the fastest rate since the mid-1990s, according to the latest CBI industrial trends survey.The business lobby group said the fall in sterling over the last year 每 a 12% decline against the dollar 每 continued to bolster export orders while domestic demand for manufactured goods remained strong. Firms were optimistic about the prospects for future orders and planned to increase employment after .The report found 43% of firms said the volume of output increased in the three months to July, compared with 12% that said it was down, giving a balance of +31%, the highest since January 1995.Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI＊s chief economist, said: ※Output growth among UK manufacturers is the highest we＊ve seen since the mid-90s, prompting the strongest hiring spree we＊ve seen in the last three years. Cost pressures are easing and firms are upbeat about the outlook for export orders.※It＊s great to see the benefits from the decline in sterling for UK exporters feeding through. But the flipside is the broader hit to consumer spending power across the economy from stronger inflation, which is likely to have fuelled the slowdown in the economy in the first quarter and is expected to pull down growth in the second quarter.§Manufacturers were also busy amassing raw materials at the strongest rate since April 1977, while expectations for output growth stood at the highest since April 2014.Some analysts said the effects of  were already being felt in the manufacturing sector and the CBI survey failed to capture this trend.Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the survey had been far too upbeat over the last six months. Official figures have shown manufacturing output down 1.1% in the three months to May compared with the previous three months.Tombs said: ※Markit＊s manufacturing survey 每 which has been more closely aligned with the official data than the CBI＊s survey in the past 每 also has weakened significantly recently. Indeed, manufacturers in June were the least optimistic about future production since November 2016, according to Markit. ※The CBI＊s survey has a small sample size and it is not seasonally adjusted, despite showing a strong seasonal pattern. Its measure of orders also reflects the number of manufacturers reporting them to be above or below ＆normal＊, which is a moving target. For now, then, we＊re inclined to place less weight than usual on the CBI＊s survey.§Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, was also sceptical about the rosy picture painted by the CBI survey.※Despite the largely upbeat July CBI survey, the outlook for manufacturing appears mixed. On the domestic front, increased prices for capital goods and big-ticket consumer durable goods, diminished consumer purchasing power, and economic and political uncertainty look likely to hamper manufacturers.§Dennis de Jong, the managing director at trading platform UFX.com, said the CBI survey offered ※some light relief§ after a run of GDP growth downgrades by the International Monetary Fund and Bank of England. But the headwinds of high inflation and the uncertainty created by the  negotiations would take its toll over the coming months, he said.※All aspects of the UK＊s economy, particularly manufacturing, will rely heavily on the success of Brexit negotiations. Until we have any clarity on how the UK may fit in, if at all, to the single market, it is difficult to be overly bullish on the country＊s economic future,§ De Jong said."															
"Athens has outlined plans to return to the financial markets for the first time since 2014, with a plan to sell new five-year bonds to investors.Existing Greek five-year bonds were trading at 3.6% on Monday morning compared with 63% at the height of the Greek financial crisis in 2012 when the finance ministry was unable to pay public sector wages and there were riots in the streets. Following the announcement that Athens would be returning to the market, the yield fell to 3.4%.The Greek finance ministry has set a goal of a 4.2% interest rate on the new bond. But banking sources believe that level will be hard to achieve and say an interest rate of between 4.3% to 4.5% is much more likely.Government sources say valuation will take place on Tuesday 25 July. The market test is crucial to  for not only judging sentiment of the market, from which it has been essentially exiled since the start of its economic crisis, but also for weaning itself off borrowed bailout funds.Speaking after the bond issue was announced, the EU＊s economy commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, described the public spending cuts imposed on Greece since it almost went bust as ※too tough§ but ※necessary§, adding there was now.Reuters reported that Greece had employed six banks 每 BNP Paribas, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and HSBC 每 to act as joint lead managers for a five-year euro bond ※subject to market conditions§.Greek ministers  about how much it hopes to borrow, and on what terms.If the issue is successful, it could help Greece, which is still coping with a debt to GDP ratio of 180%, to exit its .Late on Friday, S&P upgraded its outlook on Greek government debt from stable to ※positive§, thanks partly to renewed hopes that the country＊s creditors could finally grant it debt relief. The interest rates on Greek bonds have fallen away from their sky-high levels at the height of the crisis following a broad recovery across the 19-member eurozone and Athens＊ bigger than expected public sector surplus, fuelling hopes that the country could fund itself without the help of bailouts.Statements by the  boss, Mario Draghi, have also appeared more supportive of southern European states, which remain highly indebted and are emerging only gradually from the after-effects of the financial crisis.※Sentiment is still very positive after the ECB sounded dovish at last week＊s meeting,§ said Benjamin Schroeder, a rates strategist at ING. Moscovici told France Inter radio before a visit to Athens for talks with Alexis Tsipras on debt relief that ※Greece was caught up in an incredible economic and financial storm§.He said: ※Today, things are much, much better. We had to create the conditions for [investor] confidence, which was done. Was it too tough? Probably. Was it also necessary? Likewise,§ Moscovici said.The debt-ridden country went to the brink of collapse in 2010. It had to be repeatedly bailed out by its eurozone partners to prevent it bringing down the single currency bloc.In a sign that the country is turning a corner the economy is projected to grow by 2.1% this year 每 after no growth at all in 2016. Unemployment has fallen 1.9 percentage points in a year but was still stuck at 21.7% in April.The International Monetary Fund last week approved a one-year, $1.8bn loan programme for Greece.However, the IMF said it would not release any funds until the eurozone agreed on a deal to cut Greece＊s 314bn debt burden.Moscovici said the ※140 extremely courageous reforms§ undertaken by Athens meant there was now hope of ※finally finding a solution to the debt problem§."															
"The rising cost of electricity contributed to inflation＊s rise to 2.7% in April, its highest level in three and a half years.Increases in the cost of clothing, car tax and air fares were also blamed by the Office for National Statistics for the rise in consumer price inflation (CPI) that exceeded City forecasts of 2.6%, and soared above .With wages increasing by just 1.9%, opposition parties and the TUC said the new inflation figure highlighted the growing pressure on living standards and consumer spending. The economy has grown over the last two years in response to a surge in consumer spending, .But the fall in the value of sterling following the Brexit vote has pushed up the prices of imports, especially of food and clothing. The Bank of England  in the summer. However, this forecast looks like it will need to be revised, especially after the ONS said producer output price inflation was above 3%, indicating that further rises in inflation could be expected. Liberal Democrat shadow business secretary Susan Kramer said※These worrying levels of inflation show the Brexit squeeze is hitting shopping baskets across the country.§The TUC general secretary, Frances O＊Grady, said the government needed to . ※Working people are still ?20 a week worse off, on average, than they were before the crash. That＊s why living standards must be a key battleground at this election,§ she said.※All the parties need to explain how they＊ll create better-paid jobs, especially in the parts of the UK that need them most.§City economists were divided over the path of inflation over the next year, with some expecting a modest and brief rise above 3% while others said it would be more sustained.Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said he expected further electricity and gas price rises and that an acceleration in food price rises would push CPI inflation to 3.25% in the autumn.※We remain convinced that the market is underestimating the further upside for inflation from here,§ he said.Clarke argued that the retail prices index (RPI), which includes some housing costs, was already at 3.5% and would rise to 4.25% before the end of the year, putting extreme pressure on consumers to cut back spending on non-essential items.The National Institute for Economic & Social Research (NIESR) forecast last week that  this year as a result of rising inflation that will peak at 3.4%, while average wage rises are capped at only 2.7%.Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said rising inflation would put a further squeeze on real incomes and force Threadneedle Street to delay any move to raise interest rates.※The  will most likely sit tight on interest rates through 2017 and 2018 每 and very possibly well beyond.※We suspect it will end up remaining tolerant on the inflation overshoot given likely limited UK growth and the prolonged, highly uncertain outlook that the UK economy will face as the government negotiates the exit from the EU,§ he said.But Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital , was more optimistic that inflation would be held in check. He said many of the elements pushing up inflation were one-off factors and their effect would wane over the coming months.※The sharp rise was mainly due to factors that, while they won＊t be reversed, shouldn＊t be repeated. Indeed, a large part of the rise in inflation reflected air fares reversing the previous month＊s fall as a result of Easter shifting from March last year to April this year.※What＊s more, vehicle excise duty rates rose this April and tobacco and alcohol duty increased by more this year than they did last year,§ he said."															
"The European court of justice has raised a ray of hope for British trade negotiators with a surprise ruling that will make it harder for national parliaments to block key components of any future post-Brexit deal between the EU and the UK.In a long-awaited test case that had been expected to complicate the  process, the court instead ruled that EU officials had exclusive powers to negotiate international trade deals without ratification by national and regional parliaments.Ratification is still required in specific areas, such as inward investment and dispute resolution, but the definition of the EU ※competences§ is much broader than had been expected.The ECJ ruling stems from a request by the European commission to rule on its authority over a trade deal between the EU and Singapore, but the case took on much wider importance after the  vote.Getting a deal approved in national parliaments could add five years to the process, leaving the risk that one single national or regional body could block full agreement 每 a difficulty hinted at last year when the that had been seven years in the making.The ECJ ruling concerning the EU deal with Singapore was in part a victory for EU institutions and is likely to help the British government. This is because the court also decided the power to negotiate the core of a trade agreement 每 goods, services and public procurement 每 is allowed without individual national consultation. This means the most important parts of a post-Brexit free-trade deal could enter into force without the approval of national parliaments.Britain＊s Institute of Directors welcomed the decision, which goes further than a previously non-binding opinion from the ECJ advocate general had suggested was likely.※While the court confirmed that member states do have a role over aspects of investment, it parted with the earlier advocate general＊s opinion on a raft of important policy areas such as transport, labour and environmental standards, which it said are reserved for the EU executive when negotiating free trade agreements,§ said Allie Renison, the head of EU and trade policy at the Institute of Directors. ※This may mean a separation between trade and investment in future agreements. How this affects Brexit negotiations will depend on whether the final trade agreement includes investment provisions or not, although neither the UK or EU has expressed much interest in this to date.§Certain investments and a special court for resolving trade disputes were not allowed beyond national consultation, therefore requiring final approval from both the EU and member states.The European commission, which negotiates trade agreements on behalf of the bloc＊s 510 million people, had asked for the ruling, after a dispute with EU member states on how far national parliaments needed to be involved.Traditionally, the commission is given a mandate for trade talks by EU members states, but the final agreement has to be approved by EU ministers and the European parliament before it comes into force.As trade deals have become more complex, national parliaments have become increasingly concerned the EU has been encroaching into areas of national law. Trade has also become highly politicised, with thousands taking to the streets in Berlin and Brussels in recent years to protest against the  with the US.A statement from the ECJ described the EU-Singapore deal, which the two sides agreed in 2013, as ※one of the first ＆new generation＊ bilateral free trade agreements§, because in addition to classic provisions on cutting duties and non-tariff barriers, the deal touched on intellectual property protection, investment and public procurement.The EU deal with Canada, agreed last year after seven years and touted as a future model for a post-Brexit free-trade agreement, has also been hailed as one of the EU＊s most wide-ranging trade deals, covering mutual recognition of environmental standards and labour law.The EU-Canada deal has now entered into force, despite the fact it has yet to be ratified by national parliaments. The Wallonian drama resulted from the fact the Belgian government  before it can give its consent.The EU has negotiated 34 trade agreements covering 60 countries. Its trade negotiators have embarked on 19 separate trade negotiations covering 52 countries, including Japan and Mexico, which has risen up the priority list,  put TTIP into the deep freeze.

"Global stock markets are hitting new peaks, with the  100, Germany＊s Dax, the S&P 500 in the US and MSCI＊s World Index, which tracks equities across the globe, all at record highs.Investors are shrugging off worries about flashpoints such as North Korea, the uncertainty over the global political situation and latterly the  to snap up shares.So what is driving the rise, and can it continue?Over the weekend, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, unveiled , a global construction plan covering 65 countries, from Asia to the Americas via Africa and Europe.Beijing＊s commitment to spend billions of dollars on new roads, ports and other infrastructure is likely to drive up consumption of commodities such as iron ore, copper and nickel.In turn this has given a boost to shares in mining companies that dig the key commodities out of the ground. And the FTSE 100 is particularly dominated by mining businesses, meaning it gains a particular benefit when the sector is in demand.Among political risks worrying investors was the prospect of renewed calls for a break-up of the eurozone, with unpredictable consequences for the rest of the global economy. The prospect of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, with her anti-EU stance, winning the French presidential election had been hovering over markets for weeks. So when , markets rallied in relief.The forthcoming German federal election has also been in focus. Concerns that Angela Merkel, the chancellor seen as a safe pair of hands by markets, could struggle brought new uncertainty. But over the weekend,, suggesting Merkel has little to worry about in September＊s poll.As for the UK election, Theresa May＊s  that a shock result looks unlikely and investors are hoping a strong Tory majority will head off the threat of a chaotic Brexit.Rising production and weak demand had seen oil prices slide to new lows last year, but in November . But in recent weeks there had been doubts about the effectiveness of the move, given US shale producers were increasing output and taking up the slack and concerns that the end of the agreement was in sight.But ahead of an Opec meeting on 25 May, two of the world＊s biggest producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia, said they would support a nine-month extension of the output cap until March 2018. They said they would do ※whatever it takes§ to tackle the global supply glut, and the news sent oil prices soaring.That, in turn, lifted energy and commodity companies and helped give the markets another lift.Recent strength in the US economy means the  has been happy to start edging up interest rates, and most economists now expect another increase in June. But with some signs of weakness in the first quarter, that may well be the last rise from the US central bank for a while. These small hikes have done little to halt a Wall Street rally and a pause is likely to be welcomed by investors.Meanwhile, the  shows little sign of raising interest rates or halting its bond-buying programme anytime soon. Even if it does begin to ease its stimulus measures in the late summer, investors are likely to welcome the fact that the eurozone economy would be strong enough to absorb such a move.In the UK, the Bank of England last week , but economists believe there will be no move until 2019. And with low interest rates and bond yields, investors searching for growth have little option but to continue buying equities.Even a stronger pound in recent weeks has failed to dent the current rally in the FTSE 100, which has reached 7,500 for the first time. Taken as a whole, FTSE companies make the majority of their earnings overseas, so a weak pound boosts their bottom line and thus their stock prices. Jasper Lawler, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, a spreadbetting firm, said: ※Since the snap election was announced, the negative correlation between the British pound and the FTSE 100 has broken down. If the last two weeks are any guide, investors in UK stocks seem to be looking beyond foreign exchange.※After consolidating in a 350-point range for most of the year, the FTSE 100 could be setting the stage for another surge higher.§Following the election of  as US president in November, global stock markets surged on his promises of increased infrastructure spending and tax reforms to boost demand for goods from the world＊s largest economy.And despite his initial failure to pass the healthcare bill, the lack of detail on his economic stimulus plans and the continuing controversies surrounding the president, investors continue to bet that the  will keep growing.The latest set of corporate results on Wall Street were generally positive, with earnings growing at their best quarterly pace in more than five years, according to Thomson Reuters.Technology stocks continue to lead the way, with  Meanwhile, the VIX volatility gauge, , has fallen to a 24-year low.

"Dramatic increases in the minimum wage planned by Labour and the  after the general election will put the jobs of low income workers in danger, a leading tax and spending thinktank has warned.The Institute for Fiscal Studies said accelerating the pace of rises in § (NLW) for the rest of the decade could price workers out of a job, with young people the worst affected.The thinktank was most scathing about  to push the minimum wage for those aged 18 and over up to ?10 an hour by 2020.It said forcing employers to pay at least ?10 an hour would mean 60% of young workers would be on the minimum wage and many would be likely to lose their jobs.Middle income earners would also be the biggest winners as many of the lowest income households have no one in work at all and low-income households that do gain ※are likely to see significant reductions in means-tested benefits as a result of higher earnings§.Jonathan Cribb, an economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: ※At some point, higher minimum wages will reduce the employment of lower skilled workers. Since we do not know where that point is, sudden large increases are risky. ※Labour＊s proposal to rapidly extend a ?10-per-hour minimum wage to 18-24-year-olds, regardless of the state of the economy in 2020, is a particular gamble. Given how harmful periods of unemployment can be for young people, the long term costs could be considerable.§HMRC finds hundreds of firms each year paying below the minimum wage. This year was the first that HMRC revealed the names in a move to ※name and shame§ employers.Retailers Debenhams and Peacocks were named, while Argos was forced to pay ?2.4m in wages to more than 37,000 current and former shopworkers, and was fined nearly ?1.5m after an HMRC investigation.Earlier this week John Lewis  after it found a payroll error that breached minimum wage rules.The IFS report argued modest increases in the minimum wage recommended by the low pay commission each year from its inception in 1999 until 2015 succeeded in raising wage levels at the low end of the pay scale without hurting job creation., which applied to people aged 25 and over and paid ?7.20 an hour, compared with the ?6.70 minimum wage for workers aged 21 and over. Osborne said he hoped the NLW would reach ?9 an hour by 2020.The IFS argued that this jump, while more modest than Labour＊s proposals, still breached the understanding between the unions, employers and government under a tri-partite agreement to review the level of minimum pay each year on the low pay commission.It said the outgoing Conservative government increased the proportion of employees aged 25 and over paid the NLW from 4% to 8% and it will rise to 12% under current Tory plans by 2020.The report found that part-time, female and private sector employees and those in the North of England, the Midlands and Wales were most likely to be affected by the proposed increases. For those aged 25 and over, under Labour＊s plans Whitehall would effectively be setting the wages of around quarter of female employees, one quarter of private sector employees and one quarter of employees in the Midlands, North of England and Wales.A ?10-an-hour minimum would also lift the wages of part-time employees so that half of this group were on the minimum wage."															
															
"ay what you want about , and believe me I most certainly will, but the early years of the New Labour government at least had a sense of energy to them. Policies both good and bad were pushed with passion and certainty. You could disagree with them, but there was something to disagree with.Yet over the last decade since the financial crisis the centre ground has been markedly bereft of ideas. The right has assumed its natural mantle as the party of authority and nostalgia, standing athwart history shouting ※Stop, in fact reverse, go back, we don＊t like any of this!§In response, the centre has gravitated to a position of managing expectations down. They may lament the  and the , but their solutions are the bland semolina of the status quo rather than actually doing anything about it.Part of this is down to the elevation of compromise as a virtue in and of itself. While it＊s true that principles without power can be of little practical use, holding that ※the right answer must be somewhere in the middle§ means you have to accommodate people who are utterly wrong. In a debate between people who say the Earth is a sphere and those who say it is flat, it is not sensible or moderate to suggest that it may be a cube.For instance, look at the economist Mariana Mazzucato＊s  on Newsnight. Faced with a Tory MP saying ※we inherited a huge deficit from Labour§, repeating again the  myth of Labour profligacy, Mazzucato shot back that, after the huge financial crash in 2007, governments all over the world ※saved capitalism from itself§ which resulted in rising deficits. Had the Conservatives not inherited a deficit they would have inherited a country wracked with monstrous levels of unemployment and a financial sector set ablaze.Mazzucato＊s position is uncontroversial to economists, but in politics it seems totally accepted that ※economic credibility§ equals ※reducing the deficit§, even though deficit targeting policies produce . Having compromised over an issue which was flat out wrong, centrists are now as tied to the wrong side as the Tories who proposed it.It＊s also possible there＊s a more fundamental factor in play beyond the mere human aversion to admitting you were wrong. Two decades on from 1997, it＊s increasingly clear that the economic system on which Blair rode to power is all but played out. James Galbraith has argued that we are at ※§ as far as strong growth and rising productivity is concerned. The toxic-debt-ridden growth that led to the crash was the financial sector＊s answer to fracking, a last ditch attempt to push a system beyond its natural limits, regardless of the environmental damage.We tend to think of economics as a scientific endeavour, an attempt to get to the real and immutable truths of things. In reality it is better to think of economics as a technological process, with the systems, institutions and laws governing the economy forming an economic machinery.Technologies develop in overlapping ※§. New technology starts off slowly 每 James Watt invents the steam engine. Over the years technology improves, better steam engines are built, which leads to steam engines becoming ubiquitous, which accelerates the improvement. Then the curve begins to flatten out. You can no longer build a better steam engine because steam engines can＊t get any better.To get better results you need to jump from the top of the curve of the mature technology to the bottom of the curve in a new technology, as with steam to diesel. In order to do this, you have to remember that the aim was never a better steam engine, but a faster locomotive. Asking ※how do I build a better steam engine§ might have been the right question before, but now it＊s the wrong one.So, what if the current economic technology is at the top of its S-curve? What if all the low-hanging fruits we can get with our current machinery are gone, and any innovations and improvements we can expect to get out of this system are marginal, scarce, and liable to explode in our faces? Asking how to produce more growth or how to have a larger GDP may have been the right questions before, but now they are the wrong ones.There is no use in backwards-looking conservatism. We can＊t invoke the postwar boom with cargo-cult rituals designed to replicate the social structures of the period, any more than we can rerun the industrial revolution by reinventing the steam engine.We need to remember that the aim of the economic machinery we have in place was to improve human society, not to improve economic indicators for their own sakes. If the prospect of improvement with the current technology is slim, we need to be prepared to start tearing out old systems and putting in something new. Dig up the road, pull out the copper, put in the fibre optics. It＊s messy and disruptive, but necessary.I do not know what form a new economic technology will take, because the future is unknowable. But I have my opinions as to the kinds of things which should go towards forming its foundations. For example, Kate Raworth＊s concept of ※§ as a brand new way of conceptualising economic development without being tied to infinite growth is up there as a useful idea.Just as the shift from an agrarian to an industrialised economy called out for unions to secure rights for the new urban workforce, the current mutation of work needs a response. Whatever the correct response will be 每 a , or a , or a job guarantee, or all of these, or something else 每 pretending it＊s unnecessary is transparently false.To paraphrase Barry Goldwater, stability in the face of decline is no virtue, and disruption in pursuit of a better future is no vice."															
"t is a truth universally acknowledged that a prime minister in possession of a strong economy wins elections. Governments lose when the country has been put through the wringer, as in 2010, and win when everything＊s going well, as it is now.There＊s only one thing wrong with this theory. The economy is not booming 每 it＊s struggling. The problems that the Conservatives inherited as part of a coalition in 2010 have not been eradicated. In many cases, they have got worse. Policy mistakes have gone unpunished. Yet the only logical conclusion from  is that the Conservatives are on course for a thumping victory in the big one next month.This happens sometimes. The Conservatives completely mismanaged the economy between the late 1980s and the early 1990s, but won the 1992 election even though the worst housing bust in living memory and  at too high a rate for the pound had sent unemployment spiralling above 3 million. The Tories handled the economy better after 1992, but lost by a street in 1997.At present, opinion polls show the Conservatives a  when it comes to voter perceptions of economic competence. This, though, does not mean the economy is doing well. It doesn＊t even mean that voters think the economy is doing well. It simply means they would rather have Theresa May running the show than Jeremy Corbyn, just as in 1992 they decided to stick with John Major rather than take a risk with Neil Kinnock.Over the next month, there will be much talk from the  about how they pulled the economy back from the brink of disaster in 2010. This is nonsense. Recovery from a deep recession was already under way by the time the coalition came to power. It was then brought to a halt by tax increases, spending cuts and the blow to confidence caused by absurd claims that Britain was in a comparable state to Greece.One yardstick of how the UK is doing is the growth rate, as measured by movements in gross domestic product. Over the past year, the economy has grown by about 2%, slightly below its long-term trend. But GDP is an extremely crude measure, since it takes no account of increases in population or how any rise in national output is divided up.Wages and salaries provide a better guide to economic welfare. If pay packets are going up faster than inflation, our real incomes are rising. If inflation is rising faster than wage growth, real incomes are falling.Geoff Tily, a senior economist at the TUC, has constructed an international  from 2008 to 2015 using data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It does not make pretty reading: during that period, UK real wages fell by 1% a year on average.According to Tily＊s analysis, Britain ranked 103rd out of 112 countries for which data was available. It＊s fair to say that none of the other G7 countries enjoyed spectacular real wage growth either, but the UK was the only one that saw the value of pay packets decline. Of the 34 developed nations that are members of the OECD, the only one that saw weaker wage growth between 2008 and 2015 was Greece. Still, at least British workers did better than Venezuela (104th in the league table), the West Bank and Gaza (105th) and Iran (109th).The UK＊s real wage performance in 2015 and 2016 was a lot better, not because the level of pay awards accelerated, but because inflation fell sharply as a result of the drop in global oil prices. But since last summer, a rebound in the cost of crude and the post-Brexit vote depreciation of sterling have led to rising inflation. Over the course of 2017, prices will grow more rapidly than pay and as a result, real wages will fall.May and her team would say a different league table 每 for employment growth 每 shows the UK in a much better light. That＊s true, but in a successful economy, wages and employment grow simultaneously. That has been true of every upswing in living memory, apart from the current one.Real wages don＊t quite tell the whole story, because purchasing power is also affected by government decisions on taxes and benefits. Here, the record of the past decade looks better, although only marginally. Real median income is currently 5% higher than it was in 2007-08, according to the but it would have risen by 15% had the pre-recession trend continued. This gap is set to widen over the next five years so that by 2021-22, real incomes will be 15 percentage points below where the IFS would have expected them to be. In real money, that＊s ?5,000 a year per household on average.So how strong is an economy where employment is only going up because workers are pricing themselves into jobs by taking real wage cuts, and employers are taking advantage of an abundance of low-cost labour to skimp on investment? The answer is not very strong at all. Indeed, what you really have is a low-productivity economy where large numbers of people rely on tax credits (now being made less generous) in order to make ends meet.What＊s more, the fragility of the economy is underlined by its performance in the past three years. This, according to the government, is when things started to improve as a result of the ※tough§ measures taken in 2010 to sort out the mess left behind by the last  government.But the period of relatively strong growth since the middle of 2012 has been based on two factors: the fall in oil prices, which has , and the willingness of consumers to , which has limits. Growth this year will depend less on the housing market,  because property is , and more on the ability of  of the depreciated pound. That would be easier had more of Britain＊s industrial base survived the travails of the past four decades.The reality is that beneath the surface glitter, the UK has some deep economic problems, from chronically weak investment to profound regional imbalances and a persistent trade deficit. Ministers know this, although for the time being it suits them to pretend otherwise. The general election would not be taking place without the Brexit vote, and  would not be happening had the economy been as strong as the government claims it to be. May has been stating the blindingly obvious when she says the economy is not working for far too many people. If it were otherwise, she would not be prime minister."															
"Stock markets surged and the euro jumped sharply after  easing fears of a victory by the far-right Front National.France＊s Cac index climbed more than 4% to a nine-year high, its best daily performance since August 2015, as investors bet that Macron would defeat the other runoff candidate, the FN＊s  on 7 May. The first vote put Macron on 23.75% with Le Pen on 21.53%. The result was seen as the most market-friendly outcome, putting the independent former investment banker in pole position to fend off the anti-EU Le Pen.The euphoric mood spilled over into other stock markets, with Germany＊s Dax up 3.3% to a new closing peak and the FTSE 100 recovering 2.1% to 7,264 after last week＊s slump in the wake of the UK general election announcement. . The  250 added more than 1% to hit a record closing high, while in Asia the Nikkei 225 ended up nearly 1.4%.On Wall Street, US markets also rallied, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by about 200 points or nearly 1% by lunchtime and the Nasdaq Composite technology index hitting its best ever level.Banking shares were among the leading gainers across the globe, lifted by the prospect of a more certain economic outlook for the eurozone if the EU-friendly Macron wins the final round of the election.The VIX volatility index 每 the so-called fear index 每 fell by 22%, its biggest daily drop since the day after Donald Trump＊s US election victory last November.Meanwhile, the single currency hit a five-and-a-half month high against the dollar. Although it came off its best levels, it was still up about 1% against the dollar and the pound as European markets closed. Sterling had its worst day against the euro since last October and analysts cautioned the currency was likely to remain volatile before the latest  meeting on Thursday.French government 10-year bond prices rose to three-month highs as concerns about the election eased.Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said: ※For markets, this was always the least bad option, with most expecting Mr Macron to become president in two weeks＊ time as the other candidates endorse him over Marine Le Pen.※But for all his market and EU-friendly rhetoric,  will face the same problems previous French presidents have faced, which means he will have to reach out across the political divide.

"t the start of this year, the civic columns and royal statue of Hull＊s Queen Victoria Square were brutally intruded on by a 75-metre-long white turbine blade on a plinth. This was the ＊s monument to wind power, its new hope for a sustainable future at sea.Hull has never recovered from the near-total ending of its long-distance fishing industry after the . For all its efforts, it is Britain＊s third most deprived local authority, with one large ward, Orchard Park and Greenwood, suffering some of the country＊s deepest poverty. So the decision by the German manufacturer Siemens in November 2014 to establish Hull as the home of  delivered the city＊s most far-reaching economic boost for decades.But artist Nayan Kulkarni＊s giant temporary installation Blade posed equally gigantic questions about the fragility of the city＊s recovery, and the perils of leaving the EU 每 to which Siemens itself, local MPs, councillors and business leaders were outspokenly opposed, but 66% of Hull voters favoured. Before the referendum, alarmed by the threat of Brexit, . The uncertainty of a leave vote, and the threat of increased costs from being outside the EU, could make the UK ※a less attractive place to do business, and might become a factor when Siemens is considering future investment here§, the company said. It concluded: ※Siemens does not see any upsides for our business from a potential Brexit.§Yet, on the Orchard Park housing estate, talking to people shopping in the small row of shops next to a new health centre (two of which are unoccupied), there is little sign of regret at the vote. A spread of crescents built in the 1960s and 70s to replace inner-city slums and provide ordered modern housing, often for those doing atrociously dangerous work on trawlers, the Orchard Park and Greenwood ward is now , with high levels of unemployment and half of its children living in poverty.Nicholas Sawyers, 42, says he grew up on the estate, and is proud of it and its people. Like many, he enjoyed the emotive light show depicting Hull＊s history which opened the City of Culture year, but says he thinks Blade is ※a monstrosity§. A former publican, Sawyers is now unemployed. He applied three times for one of the initial round of 650 jobs at  but without success. He says he voted to leave the EU principally because of all the money Britain pays in. He believes Brexit will be good for the country: ※It＊s so that we can stand on our own feet, like we have done in the past.§One middle-aged woman, who is friendly but does not want to give her name, says everybody she knew had voted to leave because of resentment at a growing number of Polish immigrants on the estate. The last census put the number of people in the ward from eastern-European EU countries as 305, or 2%: ※Around my doors, they thought it would get rid of the foreigners 每 but it hasn＊t, and it won＊t,§ she says.Steven Bayes, who has been a Labour councillor for Orchard Park and Greenwood for 32 years, says poverty has been an entrenched problem on the estate for generations. But he is bemused at people developing ※a strange fear of foreigners§ and believes the vote to leave the EU was like ※turkeys voting for Christmas§. In a port city facing Europe, connecting to the much more substantial trading hub of Rotterdam, and with ferries leaving for Zeebrugge in Belgium twice a day,  has always relied on trade.※It＊s very foolish,§ Bayes says. ※We are European, and this will make it much harder to export to Denmark and Germany. Immigration has done a power of good in Hull; people have come and occupied properties which were vacant, and have done difficult jobs other people wouldn＊t do.§The impact of the Brexit vote was felt immediately in the reaction from Siemens, which, with Associated British Ports, had committed a combined ?310m to convert the derelict Green Port site on the Humber and build its new factory. In 2015,  it had expanded its plans, so that the Hull operation would also manufacture wind-turbine blades for export from the UK. The huge blades, three to each turbine in the North Sea, are shaped by hand from fibreglass, balsa wood and resin, and Siemens ultimately aims to recruit 1,000 workers, almost all local. The hunger for the opportunity was so profound that there were 23,000 applications for that first round of 650 jobs. Candidates applied online, and the process involved a three-part interview, including a group exercise and dexterity test.Speaking at the vast factory, one of the chosen recruits, Lewis Stones, 26, describes a patchy working life before Siemens. He began his career as an apprentice plumber before he was laid off in 2008 during the financial crash. He then spent eight years assembling caravans, a significant industry in Hull. That was insecure, too, with periods of being laid off, and Stones says he was ※delighted and quite shocked§ to be awarded the job at Siemens, for which many of his friends applied too.Like all the new recruits, he had two weeks of training at Siemens＊ offshore wind-training base at Aalborg in Denmark, and the experience transformed his outlook. ※I was going to vote leave,§ he says. ※People were getting in my head, talking about immigrants taking jobs, not paying taxes and getting houses. I didn＊t really read into it or know much about it. It was hard to get the right information. In those three months, the anti-immigrant feeling was really ramped up tenfold; you didn＊t hear about the trade aspect of it at all.※Then I came here; I had an opportunity, and security, which takes a lot of stress out 每 it opens your mind. I thought: this wouldn＊t work if we left. It＊s a German company, and it could be isolated. All my mates voted to leave, and they were giving me stick for voting to stay.§Hull city council＊s Labour administration 每 which bid for City of Culture status in 2013 and is investing ?100m of its capital reserves in civic improvements to overhaul Hull＊s image 每 strongly cautioned against a vote to leave, as did local MPs, including Alan Johnson, a leader of the remain campaign. But two-thirds of voters in Hull nevertheless placed their cross for a course to be charted outside the EU.A month after the referendum, the chief executive of Siemens UK, Juergen Maier (who came to Britain as a 10-year-old with his family from Germany in 1984, and  said in a statement that plans for export from Hull . ※Those plans were only beginning to happen,§ said Maier, ※and I expect that they will stall until we can work out exactly what the plan is for how we can participate in EU research programmes, and until all the issues around tariffs and trade have been sorted out.§Since then, Maier and Siemens as a whole have pursued a diplomatic line with the UK government. Joe Kaeser, the company＊s global CEO, made a reassuring speech in parliament last July, saying that Britain is still ※a great place to invest§. That was hailed by some champions of Brexit as a U-turn, but . Siemens can still make plenty of money for itself in the UK, where the lucrative market for wind power is also being exploited by other European giants including Dong Energy, which is . Their income in this country is, for all practical purposes, guaranteed; the price of electricity is fixed for the first 15 years and their initial investment recouped from a surcharge on the bills paid by British households and consumers. Kaeser and Maier have not reversed their position on possible exports into the EU from Hull. Those plans have been on hold since the Brexit vote.Last November, in its 2015-16 annual report, which revealed income from worldwide operations of 79bn (?69bn) from a global workforce of 351,000, Siemens delivered a stark warning to its shareholders about the consequences of Britain leaving the EU. ※The UK exit process could heighten business and consumer uncertainty, reduce investment in the UK, pose risks to financial markets and may increase the uncertainties about the future of the EU in the course of the UK exit negotiations,§ it said. ※A further and massive loss of economic confidence, and a prolonged period of reluctance in investment decisions and awarding of new orders would hit our businesses.§Maier  before the referendum, explaining the single market＊s benefits, setting out facts, but complaining that the debate had been ※annoying§, insufficiently based on reality, and stirred up ※ignorance, intolerance§ and ※negative and often inflammatory rhetoric against our neighbours§.Last week, after Theresa May triggered Britain＊s article 50 withdrawal from the EU, Kaeser was the first businessman to meet the prime minister, when he again drew a distinction between the profits Siemens is confident it will continue to make domestically in the UK, and the uncertainties for exporting, arguing that free movement of people remains crucial to a successful future relationship with Europe.Maier declined to talk to the Guardian about  but Siemens did show the me around the plant and let us talk to some of the employees. There are motivational messages on the walls, gently encouraging staff to ※exceed expectations,§ and ※be amazing every day§.Josh Cowling, 22, another of the 650 recruits, says he, like Stones, was glad to have a proper, secure job, having done a geography degree but been unable to find a career related to it. He spent time working at the Scunthorpe steelworks where his father worked all his life; it was the period of financial difficulties last year just before , contractors were being laid off, and it was ※very insecure§, Cowling says. In the referendum, he voted to remain: ※It was difficult to pick out the right information from the campaigns, but overall I felt it would create far too much uncertainty to leave the EU.§Following a consultation with businesses in the region, the Humber local enterprise partnership (LEP) chaired by Lord Chris Haskins, former chairman of Hull-based Northern Foods, outlined a series of concerns about Brexit＊s impact on the economy in a letter sent to several government ministers. They included David Davis, the minister for exiting the EU, whose constituency is nearby Haltemprice and Howden.Haskins acknowledged that there could be opportunities from leaving the EU: the depreciated pound might help exports, and importers could be encouraged to produce more equipment locally. Overall, though, the letter reported that local businesses believed exporting would be hit because new trade deals were unlikely to be as good as existing conditions, that local industries, particularly food processing and agriculture, which are big employers, ※are heavily reliant on eastern-European labour§ to do often difficult work. Haskins also voiced a worry that EU structural funds, for which Hull has consistently qualified as a deprived area, would not be replaced by equivalent British government funding. He further warned that reduced access to the single market would damage the Humber ports.※Overall,§ the LEP letter concluded, ※businesses believe that Brexit will create more problems than opportunities. The short and medium term impact of Brexit on the Humber economy seems likely to be negative.§Haskins tells the Guardian he has not received replies from ministers, including Davis, to address these concerns. Asked by the Guardian for his view, Davis did not respond to the detail, but a spokesman for his department issued a reply: ※We are committed to making Brexit a success for every part of the UK, including Hull and the Humber. We start negotiations to leave the EU from a position of strength 每 the UK was the fastest growing advanced economy in 2016, and latest figures show there are 92,000 more people in work in Yorkshire and Humber than a year ago.§Stephen Brady, the leader of Hull council, is not convinced. Speaking in a room off an ornate corridor in the Guildhall, the civic centre built during the city＊s flourishing maritime past, he says the council has been determined not to accept ※managed decline§ and has striven to attract investment. It has maintained services as far as possible despite government cuts of ?104m, 42%, from the annual budget in the last five years.Of the Brexit prospect, Brady says: ※It has come as a blow, and created uncertainty when we were trying to build certainty. Theresa May shocked many people with her statement that we＊ll be out of the single market and the customs union. If trade barriers come up, it will be very bad news.§He already fears that an increase in inflation and food costs due to the falling pound will be hard for local people, whose income will not rise to compensate. ※I think time will be cruel to this decision,§ he says. ※There will be a huge price to pay, and if it falls on people＊s income, there will be a lot of bitter people.§Blade, in Queen Victoria Square, was removed on 20 March, having starkly confronted locals and visitors with the ingenuity and power of European engineering, in the UK＊s City of Culture, while the government prepared to fire the cannon on article 50."															
"Stock markets across Europe soared as traders reacted to the defeat of an anti-EU candidate in Dutch elections and the latest .The Federal Reserve accompanied its latest rate rise this week with guidance that it would not tighten policy quite as much as financial markets anticipated this year.

The central bank raised borrowing costs in the world＊s biggest economy for the second time in three months on Wednesday, taking the base rate from 0.75% to 1%.

"A letter bomb that was dispatched to the headquarters of the  in Paris and blew up on Thursday, injuring the employee who opened it, was sent from Greece, the Greek public order minister has said.Greek intelligence officials are working on the assumption that the blast in the French capital may have been orchestrated by an urban guerrilla group that claimed responsibility for a parcel bomb sent to the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch?uble, on Wednesday.That suspicion was bolstered on Thursday when Nikos Toskas said he had been told the IMF letter bomb had been contained in an envelope with a Greek return address. ※French authorities just informed us that it was mailed from ,§ Toskas told Ant1 Television.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the  letter bomb, which was reported to have burned the IMF staff-member on her face and arms as she opened it.The explosion was caused by a ※fairly homemade§ device, the French capital＊s police chief, Michel Cadot, told reporters.He said there had been recent telephone threats, but it was not clear whether these were linked to the incident at the IMF＊s offices. Greek anarchist groups have recently ratcheted up criticism of the demands made on Greece by the IMF as discussions continue between Athens and its international creditors on the disbursement of new loans under a bailout programme.On Wednesday, a group, Conspiracy of Fire Cells, said it had sent a letter bomb to Sch?uble＊s office, declaring online: ※We still have the rage ... Nothing is over, everything continues.§ The suspicious parcel was intercepted by German authorities before it reached its intended recipient. France, which is in the middle of a , is still in a state of emergency with army units on patrol in Paris.The president, Fran?ois Hollande, said French authorities would do all they could to find those responsible for the letter bomb. The IMF managing director, , condemned the explosion as ※a cowardly act of violence§. She said: ※I reaffirm the IMF＊s resolve to continue our work in line with our mandate. We are working closely with the French authorities to investigate this incident and ensure the safety of our staff.§"															
"e have been here many times before. In the eight years since the cut interest rates to a then record low of 0.5%, there has been regular speculation in the City that borrowing costs are heading back up.The latest flurry of excitement was caused when Kristin Forbes broke ranks with her monetary policy committee colleagues and said something should be done about rising inflation.The 8-1 vote was a surprise, as was the evidence that Forbes was not alone in her concerns. Minutes of the MPC meeting said that it wouldn＊t take a lot more inflationary pressure for some members to join her in pressing for a tighter stance.That was the cue for a rally in the pound as the financial markets contemplated interest rates being raised sooner than expected. Coming less than 24 hours after the  raised US rates, dealers started to question when the Bank of England would follow suit.The simple answer is not at any time soon. To start with the obvious, it takes at least five MPC members to secure a rate rise. The closest the committee has got to an increase was in 2011, when three members voted for a rise. Piecing together a five-strong caucus of rate hawks will be made more difficult when Forbes leaves the MPC at the end of June.Nor is there much evidence that Britain is in the early stages of an upward inflationary spiral. Far from it. The cost of living is going up as a result of higher oil prices and the fall in the value of the pound, but . The MPC will only be justified in raising rates if dearer imports trigger higher wage deals to compensate workers for the erosion of their living standards. This is simply not happening.The Bank has raised its estimate for growth in the first three months of 2017 to 0.6%, but this is as good as its gets for a while. Welfare cuts and rising prices will squeeze real incomes and choke off consumer spending in the months ahead. Competitive pressures will force companies to absorb higher import costs into their profit margins.With wage growth nugatory and  talks about to begin, the City＊s much-anticipated rate rise is still a way off. It certainly won＊t happen this year."															
"The  has held interest rates at their record low amid signs of an internal split emerging about how to tackle rising inflation.The Bank＊s monetary policy committee was divided on the rates decision, with Kristin Forbes voting to raise borrowing costs immediately. Other members also indicated that they could join her at future meetings if they felt inflation was rising too quickly.But for now,  showed eight members of the MPC felt that the current 0.25% base rate and electronic money-printing programme were appropriate to support the post-referendum economy amid signs that slower pay growth and rising inflation were damping consumer spending.The decision to hold rates in the UK comes a day after the US central bank, the Federal Reserve,  and indicated that further increases this year were likely to keep rising inflation in check.Forbes, who leaves the committee at the end of June, felt that inflation ※was rising quickly§ and was likely to remain above the Bank＊s 2.0% target for at least three years. Minutes from this week＊s policy meeting showed Forbes also felt that ※the weakness in activity expected since the referendum had not materialised§ and that unemployment ※showed no signs of increasing§.As such, she voted against the rest of the committee and advocated an increase in the base rate to 0.5%. It is the first split on the MPC since the aftermath of the Brexit vote in July 2016, when Jan Vlieghe voted for a cut in rates from 0.5% to 0.25%. The rest of the MPC opposed him but then voted for a cut in August 2016.The MPC, under the leadership of the Bank＊s governor, Mark Carney, has maintained that it is happy to let inflation rise some way above its target as it trades-off the need to support growth and jobs with keeping price rises in check.But it has repeatedly said there are limits to how much overshoot in inflation it will tolerate. There were hints in the latest set of minutes that other policymakers could join Forbes this year in voting for a rate rise.The minutes said: ※With inflation rising sharply, and only mixed evidence on slowing activity domestically, some members noted that it would take relatively little further upside news on the prospects for activity or inflation for them to consider that a more immediate reduction in policy support might be warranted.§The pound strengthened after news of the split decision as traders took it as a sign that interest rates could be raised sooner than previously thought.  hit a two-week high of $1.235 immediately after the announcement.Inflation has been rising in recent months,  on the back of higher oil prices and as the pound＊s weakness since the Brexit vote raises the cost of imports to the UK.The MPC expects inflation to rise to about the 2% target it has been set by the government ※over the next month or so§, the minutes said. The committee expects inflation to ※exceed the target materially by the summer§.On the other hand, the minutes also noted signs of softness in the economy and justifications to keep ratesdown. The MPC said pay growth, which has been slowing in recent months, had turned out to be ※notably weaker§ on the latest figures than the Bank had been expecting in its latest set of economic forecasts in February.Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Markit, said that despite Forbes＊s vote for a rate rise there was little chance borrowing costs would go up soon.※We maintain the view that the Bank of England is highly likely to sit tight on interest rates through 2017 and 2018 每 and very possibly beyond,§ he said. ※While we believe the next move in interest rates will be up, we do not see this happening before 2019 and it could well be delayed further by prolonged economic and political uncertainties. ※However, given major uncertainties over the UK economic outlook, nothing can be ruled out on the interest rate front.§Economists at Barclays also see rates staying on hold for the foreseeable future and said the committee appeared broadly united. ※Apart from Kristin Forbes, who will be leaving the Bank at the end of June, we believe clear diverging views still need to be articulated and expressed by individual members to upset the status quo,§ Barclays said in a research note.The vote was the first, and will be one of the last, for the Bank＊s deputy governor Charlotte Hogg, who , which is regulated by the Bank of England. Her departure was announced after MPs concluded that she was not up to the role she was promoted into barely two weeks ago.A departure date has not been agreed for Hogg but she is likely to stay on for up to three months."															
"here are some things that money can＊t buy; there are others that it can but shouldn＊t. The boundary between these two categories isn＊t fixed and is in any case constantly disputed. Some things can＊t be bought because they seem impossible, like a return ticket to the moons of Jupiter, or a live woolly mammoth. But it＊s perfectly possible that technology will advance to the point where these are possibilities and then people who can afford them will want them too. The one thing that a fortune will never be large enough to buy is the possession of .Those who have money tend to believe it should have the ability to buy anything. But freedom for the rich diminishes the liberties and security of the people without money. If money can buy good health, as the inequality statistics show that it can, the poor may find they have no access to medical care at all, as the horrors of the American health care system illustrate today. So any civilised society has rules about things (among them justice) that money is not allowed to buy.There are also things that money can＊t measure. The Great Barrier Reef has  at A$56bn (?33bn/$43bn) by an accountancy firm and this is almost as obviously absurd as trying to work out how many Lego bricks, beef cattle, or Olympic stadiums it might be worth. All of these things have a monetary price which suggests their relative values can be compared. If you take the A$56bn figure seriously, you will decide that the Great Barrier Reef is worth rather less than Jeff Bezos, whose net worth is around $70bn, and very much less than Amazon.com, at $450bn.The report also claims that it is possible to value the experience of visiting the Barrier Reef for Australians who have not yet done so (A$27bn). This reduces the calculation to the absurdity of putting a monetary value on something that hasn＊t happened and very probably never will. Yet it started from an apparently reasonable position: that there ought to be some way for the state government of Queensland to rank the values of exploiting the mineral resources of the outback, where a coal mine is proposed that will contribute to global warning and so to the bleaching and destruction of the reef, and the preservation of the reef itself. Pricing it all up appears to put an objective worth on both of them. Actually it just shows that their value even to human beings is incommensurable.The particular value of the Great Barrier Reef, or of any sublime or spectacular piece of nature 每 a mountain range, a desert, or an untamed forest 每 lies in an important sense in its absolute uselessness. The spiritual refreshment that we get from it lies in the sense that it has a value unaffected by our existence. Its significance is a consequence of our insignificance. To put a monetary value on it suggests that it is useful and exploitable, but it is truly valuable only when it is neither. Putting a price on beauty is not the same as the moral wrong of slavery but it is related to it, because both cases reduce worth to utility. Even when slavery involves little or no physical suffering it is wrong because it values the slave only for their usefulness to others 每 which is measured in their market price 每 and not for their intrinsic human dignity. This is a point on which both Marxists and Christians can agree. Those capitalists who can＊t are killing and  as well as the Great Barrier Reef."															
"World leaders have been warned to guard against another financial crash after a steep rise in risky bank lending over the past year that could threaten the stability of the global financial system.The international body that represents central banks said a recovery in global trade this year and improving levels of GDP in most countries could create complacency and convince policymakers to ignore warning signs of excessive lending coming from the financial sector.With only two weeks until the  summit of world leaders in Hamburg, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) said politicians and central banks needed to keep financial markets in check to prevent another crash., which have become detached from underlying values, were another sign that unjustified exuberance had replaced last year＊s overly pessimistic reaction to political events such as the US election and the UK＊s Brexit vote,.The warning comes as Donald Trump, the US president, is expected to resist attempts by G20 members and his German hosts for closer co-operation in tackling reckless lending at a meeting on 7 July.Angela Merkel, bruised from , is understood to be keen to get the US to sign up to tough regulations on banks put forward by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an arm of the G20.Mark Carney, the  governor and boss of the FSB, wrote to Berlin in March demanding greater efforts to tackle the riskier parts of the financial system.Carney, who will attend the Hamburg summit, said politicians needed to adopt tougher rules to bring shadow banking into the mainstream financial system and make derivatives markets safer.He warned that a raft of reforms proposed in the wake of the 2008 crash had yet to be enacted while ※new and emerging vulnerabilities§ were piling up and adding to the number of risks that need to be tackled.Claudio Borio, the chief economist at the BIS, welcomed a turnaround in global growth over the past year that had ※strengthened considerably and [was] forecast to return to long-term averages soon§.He said: ※Economic slack in the major economies has diminished further; in some, unemployment rates have fallen back to levels consistent with full employment. And inflation has moved closer to central bank objectives.§But he warned that financial markets and policymakers were too quick to forget the risks that brought about the 2008 financial crash. The disconnect between the exuberance of stock market investors and bond investors who lend funds to nation states was also a destabilising factor.※There is tension between stock markets, which have soared, and sovereign bond yields [the interest rate on the debt], which have not risen much as economic prospects have brightened. And, unfortunately, the unwelcome long-term developments we termed ※the risky trinity§ in last year＊s report are still with us: unusually low productivity growth, unusually high debt, and unusually narrow room for policy manoeuvre,§ Borio said.※Leading indicators of financial distress point to financial booms that in a number of economies look qualitatively similar to those that preceded the great financial crash.§He said the countries at risk were not those that were at the centre of the previous crisis, such as Britain. Instead he pointed to mature economies such as Canada and Sweden that largely avoided the last crash but have since allowed huge borrowing and property booms that make their economies vulnerable to a crash.The largest emerging economies of China, India and Brazil were also vulnerable after a period of rapid growth, much of it based on cheap credit.※The strong post-crisis growth of foreign currency debt adds to vulnerabilities in some countries. Indeed, given the dominant global role of the US dollar, dollar funding remains a potential pressure point in the international monetary and financial system.§Central bankers largely support moves by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates over the past 18 months, from 0.25% to 1.25%, but have reservations about the knock-on effect to countries that have borrowed excessively in dollars.The rising cost of borrowing in dollars is widely expected to increase bankruptcy rates in countries such as Turkey and Brazil, where private companies have expanded quickly using dollar-denominated debt. But despite these dangers, BIS warned that ※keeping interest rates too low for long could raise financial stability and macroeconomic risks further down the road, as debt continues to pile up and risk-taking in financial markets gathers steam.§"															
"The UK economy slowed even more sharply than first thought in the opening months of this year as rising prices in the wake of the Brexit vote took their toll on consumer spending.The Office for National Statistics said  in the first quarter of 2017, a marked change of pace from the 0.7% growth in the final three months of 2016. Statisticians had  in the first quarter.There was no growth at all in the first quarter in GDP per head, which adjusts for the size of the population and is generally seen as a better guide to prosperity than mere GDP. The figures provide the latest evidence that the early resilience to the EU referendum result last June is now wearing off as higher inflation puts consumers under pressure.  because it sent the pound sharply lower and has raised the cost of imports to the UK. That higher inflation has hit household budgets and dented the key driver of UK growth, consumer spending.The ONS highlighted that pattern in its updated estimate of GDP growth on Thursday.※UK GDP growth slowed to 0.2% in quarter one of 2017 as consumer-facing industries such as retail and accommodation fell and household spending slowed. This was partly due to rising prices,§ it said in the data release.※Construction and manufacturing also showed little growth, while business services and finance continued to grow strongly.§Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, noted that first-quarter growth was below what the Bank of England and most City economists had been expecting.※The outcome was in line with our forecast, but below the consensus expectation for 0.3% quarter-on-quarter and the BoE 每 in the fullness of time 每 expects the growth rate to be 0.4%,§ he said.※So this is disappointing and like driving down the motorway at 20mph instead of 70mph.§The Bank said earlier this month that it expected  as a whole from growth of 1.8% in 2016. But it warned that living standards would fall this year because inflation would be higher than pay growth.Kallum Pickering, economist at the bank Berenberg was among those commentators predicting growth would pick up again after the first-quarter lull.※Should we be concerned? No, the dip is probably temporary,§ he said.※With both soft and hard data improving in the second quarter, the quarterly growth rate is likely to rebound to 0.4%.§Ian Stewart, chief economist at the consultancy Deloitte was also optimistic the economy could continue expanding despite the pressure on household incomes.※High inflation is hitting consumers, but a weak pound and a recovering global economy are helping businesses. UK growth is likely to tilt away from the consumer towards exports, manufacturing and investment this year. This should keep the UK economy growing at a similar rate to last year,§ he said.Ruth Gregory at Capital  said that given the discrepancy between the weak first quarter GDP data and upbeat surveys, there was ※a good chance that the figure is revised back up in time§. She also noted quarterly 0.6% rise in business investment, ※suggesting that Brexit uncertainty has not significantly weighed on firms＊ spending plans§.Gregory added: ※We have not altered our view that the economy will remain fundamentally resilient in the coming quarters.§ Separate figures on housebuilding provided some reassurance on the outlook. The Department for Communities and Local Government said 43,170 new houses were started in England between January and March, up 3% on the previous quarter and up 21% on a year earlier. The number of completed houses rose to 39,520, about 9% higher than the previous quarter and 21% higher than a year ago.Andy Frankish at the Mortgage Advice Bureau said: ※The latest figures do indicate a marginal increase and we can see the signs of recovery starting in 2013, demonstrating the impact of the introduction of help to buy, which could suggest an element of cautious optimism that the industry has perhaps ＆turned the corner＊ following the trough of 2009.※But if we are to reach the 200,000-plus new-build homes needed each year in England, there is still more momentum required.§"															
															
															
" is broke 每 but you wouldn＊t guess it looking at its shining state capitol in Topeka. The imposing limestone monument, crowned by a shiny copper dome and limned with John Steuart Curry＊s luminous murals, has just undergone a $325m facelift. What＊s happening inside the state house is a lot less pretty, and may well foreshadow the far uglier battle looming over the future of taxation in the United States.Last month, Donald Trump＊s two key economic allies, the treasury secretary. Stephen Mnuchin, and Trump＊s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, unveiled the outline of Donald Trump＊s much-trailed tax plan. The  would slash taxes for business, simplify taxes for everyone else, and ※pay for themselves§ by stimulating economic growth, Trump＊s fiscal duo claimed.The plan＊s similarity to the one that has left Kansas in crisis is ※unbelievable§, according to Duane Goossen, the former Kansas secretary of administration.The economic spirit behind Trump＊s plan is Arthur Laffer 每 the go-to guru of ※supply-side economics§ since the Reagan era, and one of the architects of Kansas governor Sam Brownback＊s original tax plan.The former member of Reagan＊s economic policy advisory board is best known for the ※Laffer curve§, an illustration of the theory (not his own) that economic activity is tied to taxation, and that lower taxes, up to a point, mean more revenues.That curve was famously scribbled by Laffer on a napkin over cocktails with Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld in 1974, and helped underpin Reagan＊s so-called trickle-down economics 每 as well as launching Laffer＊s career as one of the most influential economists in Republican circles.The curve is his calling card, but he also collects and publishes a vast trove of economic data on state revenues and taxes that seems to 每 handily 每 point to one conclusion: taxes bad, tax cuts good.Fairly or not, ※Laffernomics§ is being blamed for a plan that has left the state in crisis and Brownback＊s ratings in the Kansas dust. And Kansas, it seems, is about to act as the model for the biggest US tax cuts since the Gipper was in office.Thanks to Kansas＊s budget woes, Brownback regularly polls as the least popular governor in the union. Nor is there much love for Laffer. ※How does he sleep at night?§ one parent asked.※Politics is politics, and I have been the object of political attack and praise. I have gotten both,§ Laffer told the Guardian. ※What can I tell you? If you climb up the pole, your ass sticks out pretty far, and I climb up. I＊m not afraid of taking a position on things.§Sitting in the capitol＊s vaulted lobby, Goossen, now a senior fellow at the Kansas Center for Economic Growth, has little time for Laffer＊s arguments, and says that the Trump administration＊s recent presentation gave him the shivers.When Brownback outlined his plan in 2012, he, too, said the tax cuts would pay for themselves. ※He too said the tax cuts would benefit everybody, [that] they would be be ＆a shot of adrenaline to the heart＊ of the Kansan economy,§ said Goossen.Instead, Goossen claims, the money has gone to a small group of wealthy Kansans while the state＊s budget has been left with a roughly $1bn shortfall. Its school system, once its crown jewel, has suffered year after year of cuts, and its savings are gone. The non-partisan  Trump＊s tax plan would cost $6.2tn over the first decade.※We are a cautionary tale. It sounds great, everybody gets a tax cut and it＊ll balance 每 but it just doesn＊t work,§ said Goossen.Campaigning for re-election in 2014, Brownback pledged his tax plans would add 100,000 new jobs over four years. By  private-sector jobs. Kansas isn＊t even keeping up with its neighbors. Hiring in Kansas increased by 0.3% in the last year; Missouri＊s growth rate over that same period was 1.4%, according to .The prop of the Brownback plan, as with Trump＊s, was a huge cut to taxes paid by limited liability companies (LLCs) 每 and so-called ※pass-through§ businesses 每 which meant independent business owners would pay no state tax on the bulk, if not all, of their income. Those businesses would then go out and invest and create new jobs, or so the argument went.At the time, Kansas had about 190,000 LLCs. Now it has about 300,000, but so far they have not spurred a new hiring drive in the state. ※There is no evidence whatsoever that suggests this plan worked,§ said Goossen.Upstairs, the state senate is arguing over the budget for the 2018 fiscal year. Estimated revenues are $5.7bn for the year; expenses are $6.4bn 每 and that＊s before you add in $500m-$750m the schools are owed. As Charles Dickens : ※Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pound ought and six, result misery.§Goossen said: ※The bigger problem is that now all the energy of the state is focused on how we scrape by and make do when we ought to be focused on the future.§In nearby Lawrence, the business owners Brownback targeted are similarly unimpressed. With his trucker cap and lumberjack beard, Sam Billen is the kind of tech-savvy, knowledge-economy businessman that state governors adore. From a freshly scrubbed warehouse on the edge of downtown, Billen runs , which makes music and soundtracks for films, videos and commercials. The company has a roster of local and international clients including AMC Theaters, Boulevard Brewery and Hitachi, and recently won a local .Over freshly prepared burritos at Bon Bon, made with vegetables from the cafe＊s garden, Billen outlines all the reasons for working in Lawrence: good schools, great food, central location, fantastic people, relatively cheap. The tax? ※I probably get $5,000 to $10,000 a year extra. That＊s great, but if I take a step back, where is it coming from? I＊d rather it went back into the community. When you see the impact it＊s having on education, it＊s scary,§ he said. ※They are making this state worse. For what? I think we＊d all pay a little extra to make it better.§Over at the award-winning Limestone Pizza, the message is the same. ※I didn＊t start this business for a tax break,§ said Rick Martin, the owner and executive chef. ※What I wanted to do is get the maximum amount of local products on a pizza. If we are not profitable because of taxes, we are doing something wrong,§ he said. The tax break ※might be great if you are concentrating on tax avoidance§ but a tax break that worked only for business owners, not employees, was ※harmful§.※We do better when we are all pulling together,§ said Martin.Lawrence is a cute little college town where you can pick up a book at the Raven Book Store, with a bookmark declaring ※Reading is Resistance§, and go read it over a Moscow mule in the Bourgeois Pig. It＊s a small Democratic holdout in Kansas＊s deep-red state. You＊d probably expect the local people to hate Brownback＊s tax plans. But the antipathy is statewide.A few hours south of Topeka is Wichita, home to Kansas＊s most famous business family, the Kochs. The Koch brothers are evangelical about low taxes but not, apparently, at any cost.※We have consistently said Kansas must first fix our spending problem, then and only then address the tax code. There needs to be more equality in how the tax gets applied. You can＊t have half the state exempt and the other half not exempt,§ Steve Feilmeier, the chief financial officer and executive vice-president of Koch Industries, told the  earlier this year.Part of the dislike stems from what the cuts have done to Kansas schools. In March, the Kansas supreme court ruled that state was underfunding schools by hundreds of millions of dollars per year.One of the parents affected is Judith Deedy, who moved from Cleveland to Johnson County, by the Missouri state line, in 2004 每 in large part because of the great reputation of the local schools. ※During the recession I got it that budgets were being cut, but when we came out of recession, it just kept on happening. We are seeing cuts year after year that add up to an entire academic career.§Class sizes are up, teachers are not being replaced, art and music are being slashed. ※I＊m lucky. This is still a relatively good area, [but] small towns are losing schools. In Wichita, they shortened the school year and increased the length of the school day. No one likes it,§ she says. Small towns that lose a school are being devastated by the cuts, and parents are worried schools may not reopen after the summer break unless an agreement can be reached in Topeka.※I chose to live in Kansas. We don＊t have beaches, we don＊t have mountains, but we have great public schools. Well, not any more. There was no shot of adrenaline 每 you didn＊t have to be an economist to see that. The cuts have been so deep we may never get back to where we were,§ said Deedy.Laffer blames politics and timidity rather than economic theory for Kansas＊s woes. So what went wrong with Kansas?※It sucks,§ said Laffer. ※Look at it. This doesn＊t have beaches, it doesn＊t have palm trees. It doesn＊t really have a low tax, what is it now, 4.9%, something like that. Take a look at my state, Tennessee. We have the lowest tax burden of any state in the nation, we have the highest growth in employment as a percentage of population of any state in the nation in the last 12 months, we have a budget surplus of $2bn. Two billion dollars in this little crappy state!§Brownback＊s problems stem from a bill that was originally a fairly modest tax cut but which spiralled out of his control because of politics and hostility toward the governor, said Laffer. His advice would have been to go for a bigger cut.※When you put an atomic bomb on a place, it will materially change the place 每 but a cherry bomb probably won＊t change the buildings or anything else,§ he said.The fact remains, Laffer argued, that ※you can＊t tax a state into prosperity. A poor person can＊t spend themselves into wealth.§ Nor does spending guarantee success and prosperity.If people seem to blame him for the collapse of that state? ※I don＊t mind,§ said Laffer. ※It comes with the territory. I try to do the best I can with regards to economics.§Back in Topeka, Brownback has told the Kansas City Star he＊s ※§ by Trump＊s tax plans, saying they would spur business growth. Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans are seeking to kill off his business tax breaks as the state struggles to balance it books.In the lobby of the Kansas state capitol, there is a poster of Dwight Eisenhower, partially covered by signs. ※The opportunist thinks of me and today. The statesman thinks of us and tomorrow,§ the adopted Kansan is quoted as saying. No doubt both sides would claim he is speaking for them."															
"British workers should brace themselves for rising unemployment and falling real pay in the year ahead as the impact of  is increasingly felt in the jobs market, reports have warned.The era of rapidly increasing employment is over, according to the forecasting group EY Item Club, which on Monday predicted the unemployment rate will rise from 4.7% now to 5.4% in 2018 and 5.8% in 2019. At the same time, UK firms are planning to give workers a pay rise of just 1% over the next 12 months, sharply lower than the rate of inflation, which is 2.3% and expected to rise over coming months. Pay expectations are now at their weakest in three and a half years, according to the survey of more than 1,000 employers by HR specialists the CIPD and Adecco, the recruitment agency.※The good news in this latest survey is that employment confidence remains positive, with sectors like manufacturing and production proving particularly buoyant,§said Gerwyn Davies, a labour market adviser at the CIPD.※The bad news is that there is a real risk a significant proportion of UK workers will see a fall in their living standards as the year progresses, due to a slowdown in basic pay and expectations of inflation increases over the next few months.※This could create higher levels of economic insecurity and could have serious implications for consumer spending, which has helped to support economic growth in recent months.§The warnings came as official figures published on Tuesday are expected to show inflation rose to 2.6% in April , putting further pressure on household budgets. It would be the highest since September 2013, when consumer price inflation was 2.7%. The rise is partly expected to reflect the timing of Easter, which this year fell in April, pushing up air fares in that month as a result.※The key influences this month are likely to be air fares, utility bills, continued foreign exchange pass-through and petrol prices,§ said Alan Clark, an economist at Scotiabank. ※As ever, the joker in the pack is likely to be food and possibly also restaurants and hotels.§ has been steadily rising since the Brexit vote last June, which triggered a sharp fall in the value of the pound, making goods imported from abroad more expensive. Those higher costs are now feeding through to higher shop prices.A report by , a former Bank of England policymaker, and Stephen Machin and Rui Costa, both London School of Economics professors, argued that wages would remain low for several years despite low unemployment and record levels of employment.※The  and other forecasters continue to state that within 18 months wage growth will revert to approximately 4% once again. This is much the same forecast that they made in each of the last 10 forecasts and these simply did not turn out to be true. ※At the very least, the continual inability of the Bank monetary policy committee to learn from their forecast failures in the labour market increasingly brings into question their credibility. The  needs to gain a better understanding of what has been happening in the UK labour market.§Blanchflower, who is now an economics professor at the US Ivy League university Dartmouth College, said the trend for wage rises to average around 2% was unlikely to go away while uncertainty about the  negotiations persisted.The Item Club said that advances in technology and increased automation could also weigh on pay growth over the longer term.※With the potential for technology and machines to displace some workers, the digital revolution is likely to boost the supply of labour competing for other jobs, putting downward pressure on wages in more labour-intensive and low-productivity sectors where machine advances are less applicable,§ Item said."															
"The government is expected to sell off its remaining shares in  in the coming week, marking a watershed moment for the sector after the financial crisis.Eight years after pumping in ?20bn to prevent the bank from collapsing, taxpayers will no longer own any shares in an institution that was created in the depths of the financial crisis .The share sale, in the midst of , will highlight the contrast between the progress of Lloyds and that of Royal Bank of Scotland, which is still 73% owned by the government and has yet to make an annual profit since its bailout.At its peak, the taxpayer holding in Lloyds stood at 43% and first started to be scaled back in September 2013.

"The prospects for pay growth in the UK are among the gloomiest in advanced economies, with only Greece, Italy and Austria forecast to suffer bigger falls in real wages by the end of 2018, according to a  analysis.The trades union group said  每 pay adjusted for the effects of inflation 每 were on course to fall by 0.5% between the start of 2016 and the close of 2018, based on forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In contrast, real wages were predicted to rise in most of the other 31 countries analysed. The average rate of real pay growth for those 31 countries was 2.6% between 2016 and 2018.The forecast for another  will add to worries about household finances in the UK as repercussions of last summer＊s Brexit vote start to be felt in the real economy.Workers suffered years of declining real wages in the wake of the financial crisis. After a two-and-a-half-year period of respite, pay recently started . That drop is the result of sluggish pay growth being , which has risen as the pound＊s weakness since the Brexit vote makes imports more expensive. Higher oil prices have also raised inflation.The TUC said UK real wages will be 6.8% lower in 2018 than they were in 2007 before the financial crisis, according to  predictions. Only Italy and Greece will have suffered bigger falls, of 7.3% and 25.2%, respectively.By contrast, there will have been real wage increases over that period in 24 of the 32 OECD countries it analysed, with Poland, Slovakia, Sweden and Latvia the top performers. Real pay growth for the eurozone over the decade 2008-18 is forecast to be 3.9%. The TUC general secretary, Frances O＊Grady, said politicians must address the poor outlook for UK pay growth as they campaign ahead of June＊s election. ※British workers have endured the longest pay squeeze since Victorian times. And now even more pain is on the horizon,§ she said.O＊Grady also called for an end to public sector pay restrictions after warnings earlier this week from hospital bosses that  staff are  because they are so demoralised by years of getting pay rises of only 1% or nothing. The Royal College of Nursing has  because they cannot survive on their NHS pay.※Britain badly needs a pay rise 每 and all the political parties must explain in their manifestos how they will boost living standards across the UK,§ said O＊Grady.※A good start would be to scrap the unfair pay restrictions on public servants.

"t is 20 years since the Bank of England was by Gordon Brown. In the two decades since, the power wielded by Threadneedle Street has increased as its performance has got worse. It is hard now to remember how serene life was for the Bank in the early days after it was granted operational independence. Stripped of its role as supervisor of the UK＊s banks, the Bank effectively became a monetary policy institute, with the nine members of its monetary policy committee tweaking the cost?of borrowing to hit the government＊s inflation target. With cheap Chinese goods keeping prices low, this was not especially hard to do. Mervyn King, the Bank＊s governor?from 2003 to 2013, called the late 1990s and the early 2000s the  每 as in non-inflationary consistent expansion 每 and it was an apt description.Apt, but incomplete, because while the Bank was congratulating itself on hitting the inflation target, it failed to do anything to prevent the biggest speculative bubble since the 1920s. To be fair, this was not entirely the Bank＊s fault. The crisis  of Labour＊s tripartite system of financial supervision, with responsibility shared between the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority. But the Bank did not realise until it was far too late that crises can erupt even when inflation is low. Like other central banks, it was guilty of groupthink.The moment when the bubble burst, the summer of 2007, exposed the flaw in New Labour＊s political argument for granting the Bank operational independence. Ceding control over the cost of borrowing, it was thought, would give the  government credibility in the City and prevent the runs on the pound that had proved so electorally costly in the past. The events of 2007-09 proved otherwise. When it came to the 2010 election, voters laid the blame for a long, deep recession at the government＊s door. The?Bank, by contrast, was praised for taking?the action needed to prevent a second Great Depression: cutting interest rates to 0.5% and printing hundreds of billions of pounds of electronic money through the process known as quantitative easing.With its pre-crisis failures conveniently forgotten, the Bank＊s sway increased. George Osborne gave it back power to police the City and established a new financial policy committee with wide-reaching powers, including the right to decide how much a citizen could borrow for a mortgage. As?well?as taking on this macro-prudential role, the Bank became more political. Theresa May?used her party conference speech last year to note that . The losers have been savers; the winners have been those who own shares, bonds and real estate, who have seen the value of their assets rise.The Bank＊s counter-argument 每 that aggressive use of monetary stimulus has helped everybody by boosting growth and reducing unemployment 每 has merit. Even so, the recovery from the recession has been feeble. Productivity growth has been woeful and the balance between a loose monetary policy and a tight fiscal policy has been wrong. The risk is that keeping interest rates at 0.25% leads to the same reckless borrowing?as before. Ominously, household debt levels are creeping back towards their previous record highs.The Bank is now in the strange position where it is both stronger and more vulnerable than it has ever been. The criticism aimed at Mark Carney, the Bank＊s governor, for his comments during the  and  referendums are merely a foretaste of what it can expect if another crisis erupts in the next few years. Willem Buiter, one of the original interest-rate setters from 1997, says central banks should  and confine themselves to setting interest rates and acting as a lender of last resort. At?the other end of the spectrum, Adair Turner has argued that in certain circumstances  for public spending or tax cuts. Ed Balls, the original architect of the 1997 blueprint, says chaired by the chancellor that would set a mandate for macro-prudential policy.A simple principle links these approaches: the Bank has become more powerful and more political but not more accountable. This needs to change, either by cutting the Bank down to size or by beefing up political oversight. Otherwise, the current consensus in favour of its independence will not hold."															
															
"The long road to  emerging from its worst financial crisis in modern times reached another milestone on Tuesday as the country concluded a crucial compliance review that will allow it to avert default in July.At the cost of yet more painful austerity 每 in the form of extra pension cuts and tax increases 每 international creditors agreed to disburse 7.5bn (?6.3bn) in emergency loans to enable Athens to honour maturing debt repayments. More importantly, lenders accepted to set talks in motion on making Greece＊s debt mountain more manageable 每 vital if the country is to gain access to the capital markets from which it has been almost completely exiled since 2009. The breakthrough, after marathon 12-hour talks, became apparent only when the Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, announced in the small hours that ※white smoke§ had been achieved. ※There is white smoke ＃ The negotiation is finished with agreement on all the issues,§ he said. ※We now have a decision that the Greek government will be called to enforce with laws and decisions.§The deal ends more than six months of intense wrangling over the fiscal and structural reforms that Athens must implement in exchange for loans from its third, 86bn bailout programme.Although the programme was outlined in 2015 when Greece came closest to crashing out of the eurozone and reverting to the drachma, the conditions attached to the lifeline remained open to negotiation. Discord most recently had focused on labour reforms and pensions 每 two issues that Tsakalotos, a British-trained Marxist economics professor, had felt especially strongly about.Under the agreement, the leftist-led government undertook to further slash pensions by 18% as of 2019.Pension payments have now been reduced 12 times since the start of the crisis, and cut by 40% in the past six years.With poorer out-of-work families often depending on them, news of a further drop was met with fury by union leaders, who immediately announced industrial action. The two-party coalition led by the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, also agreed to broaden the tax-free threshold by effectively dispensing with tax breaks as of 2020. Both measures are expected to produce savings worth 3.6bn or 2% of gross domestic product. ※It will be a very hot spring,§ Odysseus Trivalas, acting president of the union of public sector employees, told the Guardian. ※We have yet to see the details of this agreement but what we know is that it will mean further cuts. There will be a lot of strikes and a general 24-hour lockdown when the measures are brought to parliament for vote.§ Greece＊s main opposition leader, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said with better negotiation the painful cutbacks could have been avoided and were tantamount to a ※fourth memorandum§ or bailout accord. The agreement, which also included opening up the energy market to competitors and liberalising Sunday trade, is likely to be finalised at the next meeting of eurozone finance ministers on 22 May. Legislation is expected no later than 17 May, with the ruling leftist Syriza party anticipating full endorsement from MPs. ※The government believes that this road, despite the difficulties, will lead to the country＊s exits from bailouts,§ interior minister Panos Skourletis told state-run ERT TV. ※What＊s important after closing the bailout review is to have a roadmap for debt relief.§ The International Monetary Fund, which has argued vociferously that Greece＊s debt load is unsustainable and has balked at even joining the latest bailout programme, hinted that it could soon sign up to it. IMF participation is viewed as vital by Berlin, the biggest provider of Greece＊s rescue funds. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, faces general elections in September and a crisis-weary electorate that does not want more Greek drama. In a joint statement with Greece＊s European lenders, the IMF said: ※The Greek authorities have confirmed their intention to swiftly implement this policy package. This preliminary agreement will now be complemented by further discussions in the coming weeks on a credible strategy for ensuring Greece＊s debt is sustainable.§Debt relief would come in the form of extended maturities and less punishing interest payments than a one-off write-down. At 180% of GDP, Greece＊s debt burden is not only staggering but by far the highest in the 27-member EU. The country＊s economy has shrunk by about 27% since the start of the crisis 每 far greater than the contraction experienced by the US during the Great Depression.Once debt relief was in place, Greece would aim to re-enter markets again, the government said. The European Central Bank has signalled it will include the country in its bond-buying programme if its debt becomes more manageable.※The Greek government is aiming at tapping the markets as soon as possible after wrapping up the second [bailout] review and a comprehensive deal on the medium-term [measures] for the debt,§ the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters after the agreement was announced.

"f you＊ve ever made the mistake of trying to debate generational inequality with a baby boomer 每 by pointing out, say, that they benefited from cheap housing, generous welfare and free university places, before voting consistently for governments that have denied those things to their children, all the while calling millennials lazy and entitled in an infuriatingly faux-indulgent way, as if their kids＊ requests that their salaries bear some sort of relation to their actual living costs makes them the sort of spoiled divas who＊d call a gold-plated Uber to take them to the lavatory ...Anyway. If you＊ve ever had this annoying row with an ageing relative, then you＊ll know that they have one last trump card, one last line of defence for their privileges. Interest rates, they＊ll say. None of this  in our day. We had proper interest rates. You don＊t know you＊re born.And it＊s not an entirely unreasonable point. Between autumn 1977 and Christmas 1979, interest rates rose from 5% to . If you were a young boomer whose biggest cost was a variable rate mortgage, that would have hurt. In 2009, by contrast, , and stayed there for the better part of a decade. When eventually they did move again, it was down. You don＊t know you＊re born.Except, of course, you do 每 because, if you＊re reading this and you＊re under 40, there＊s a pretty good chance you＊re still stuck paying rent. Yes, interest rates are low; no, this is not particularly helpful. Even if you do have a mortgage, it＊s probably a fixed rate one because, let＊s be honest, those rates are going up again one day.But not, it seems, today. The Yorkshire Building Society has just launched a new mortgage that charges an . ※We are very pleased to offer borrowers the lowest mortgage rate ever available,§ said a spokesman. ※The cost of funding has fallen in recent weeks and, as a financially strong building society with no external shareholders to satisfy, we have the ability to pass this on to borrowers.§ (※We used to dream of mortgages at under 1%,§ say the boomers.)So does that means that owning a home is now cheaper than it＊s ever been? Well, no, of course not. For one thing, this isn＊t a fixed rate deal. It＊s actually a (bear with me on this) two-year-long discount of 3.85% to the standard variable rate (SVR) of 4.74%. That means it＊s very, very unfixed indeed: a normal tracker mortgage moves in response to Bank of England rates; an SVR one moves in response to the lender＊s whims. Accepting this mortgage means placing a bet that the Yorkshire Building Society will be nice to you.It also comes with an unusually high arrangement fee of ?1,495, but this shouldn＊t bother you, because you probably can＊t get that rate anyway. To even be considered, you need a deposit worth 35% of the value of your home.All of which makes me think that YBS＊s main motivation for offering the lowest-ever mortgage rate was as a marketing stunt. Fewer people are buying homes. That, in turn means that lenders have to fight harder to get the attention of those still in the market. We all have our targets to hit.But there＊s another, more sinister, reading of the recent rash of ultra-low mortgage rates: it suggests we may be in the latter stages of a bubble. As prices rise further and further out of reach, lenders need to find more and more ingenious tricks to keep rich people pumping their cash into an overheated market. The punch bowl has to keep going round, or the party stops.But bubbles tend to burst. Prices can＊t rise forever: one day, interest rates must surely rise. When the inevitable happens, there is a danger that those who took advantage of this deal may find their equity wiped out 每 and the rate they＊re paying will shoot through the roof.That would obviously be very sad for those who are affected; for those shut out of home ownership, though, it may be no bad thing. That＊s because nine years of record-low interest rates have probably contributed to the fact that house prices have soared out of reach; and higher prices have meant increasingly unattainable deposits. A rise in interest rates could, paradoxically, make housing more affordable.In other words, interest rates and house prices are two sides of the same coin. Boomers may have faced higher interest rates, but in return they got to buy a house. I＊m not saying this was ideal, but ... well, they don＊t know they＊re born, do they?"															
"The International Monetary Fund has revised up its UK growth forecast for the second time in three months after admitting that the performance of the economy since the vote last year had been stronger than expected.In its half-yearly World Economic Outlook, the IMF said it now envisaged the British economy expanding by 2% in 2017 每 making it the second fastest-growing advanced economy after the US..It noted that growth had ※remained solid in the United Kingdom, where spending proved resilient in the aftermath of the June 2016 referendum in favour of leaving the European Union [Brexit]§. The IMF said it was becoming more optimistic about the prospects for the global economy 每 expected to expand by 3.5% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018 每 but issued a renewed attack on the protectionist policies championed by Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen.※The global economy seems to be gaining momentum 每 we could be at a turning point,§ said Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF＊s economic counsellor. ※But even as things look up, the post每world war two system of international economic relations is under severe strain despite the aggregate benefits it has delivered 每 and precisely because growth and the resulting economic adjustments have too often entailed unequal rewards and costs within countries.§The IMF penciled in 2017 growth of 1.1% for the UK in its but subsequently revised up that this year. Growth is expected to slow to 1.5% in 2018 每 slightly weaker than the IMF＊s previous prediction.※The 0.9 percentage point upward revision to the 2017 forecast and the 0.2 percentage point downward revision to the 2018 forecast reflect the stronger-than-expected performance of the UK economy since the June  vote, which points to a more gradual materialisation than previously anticipated of the negative effects of the United Kingdom＊s decision to leave the European Union,§ the IMF said.The IMF was also more cautious about the longer-term impact on the economy from Brexit than .※Though highly uncertain, medium-term growth prospects have also diminished in the aftermath of the Brexit vote because of the expected increase in barriers to trade and migration, as well as a potential downsizing of the financial services sector amid possible barriers to cross-border financial activity.§ The IMF added that the challenge for the UK was to ※successfully navigate the exit from the European Union and negotiate the new arrangements for economic relations with the European Union and other trading partners§. The adverse medium-term impact on growth would be lower if the two years of negotiations avoided putting up new economic barriers.The IMF said record low interest rates of 0.25% were appropriate given that growth was expected to slow and inflation was likely to peak at 2.5% this year. It signaled, however, that the end of the Bank of England＊s ultra-low monetary policy was coming to an end, predicting a ※less gradual normalisation§ of interest rates than six months ago. Responding to the UK＊s upgraded forecast, chancellor Philip Hammond said: ※The fundamentals of our economy are strong and we continue to invest in the skills needed for a stronger and fairer Britain ... In Washington this week ?I will be talking to our international partners about how we can carry on increasing global economic growth, with Britain again playing an active and engaged role in the global economy.§ The IMF＊s Obstfeld tempered his more upbeat assessment for the global economy with a warning that the recent improvement might not last.※Consistently good economic news since summer 2016 is starting to add up to a brightening global outlook,§ he said. ※At the same time, however, the upgrade to our 2017 forecast is modest, and longer-term potential growth rates remain subdued across the globe compared with past decades, especially in advanced economies. Moreover, while there is a chance growth will exceed expectations in the near term, significant downside risks continue to cloud the medium-term outlook, and indeed may have intensified since our last forecast.§The Fund listed six downside risks including: protectionism; faster than expected interest rate increases in the UK leading to financial market disruption; an aggressive rolling-back of financial regulation leading to excessive risk taking; and the vulnerability of China＊s financial system after a period of rapid credit growth.Obstfeld said: ※One salient threat is a turn toward protectionism, leading to trade warfare. Mainly in advanced economies, several factors 每 lower growth since the 2010每11 recovery from the global financial crisis, even slower growth of median incomes, and structural labour-market disruptions 每 have generated political support for zero-sum policy approaches that could undermine international trading relationships, along with multi-lateral cooperation more generally.§. Both organisations have been alarmed at the growth in protectionist pressures in the past few years.※Capitulating to those pressures would result in a self-inflicted wound, leading to higher prices for consumers and businesses, lower productivity, and therefore, lower overall real income for households,§ Obstfeld said.Speaking at a press conference following the publication of the report, Obstfeld said the snap general election could create short-term uncertainty but the outlook could stabilise after polling day."															
"eady to go house hunting? Tradition has it that no sooner have the hot cross buns been buttered on Good Friday than potential buyers start the search for a new home. Estate agents look forward to Easter the way retailers relish Christmas, but perhaps with less exuberance this year than is customary.As things stand, 2017 looks set to be the weakest year for housing transactions since 2013. The latest  and  show house prices are no longer rising.In a sense, the lack of oomph in the property market is curious. Home ownership is still much sought after in Britain, where there is a strong feeling that bricks and mortar are a more reliable long-term investment than any other asset. What＊s more, it has never been cheaper to borrow.Even before the Bank of England  to a record low of 0.25%, lenders were vying with each other to offer the most attractive home loan packages. Competition has driven down mortgage rates to ultra-low levels. Home ownership has fallen sharply, since peaking in the early 2000s, and is now at its lowest level in 30 years, yet there is no surge of prospective buyers seeking to take advantage of attractive deals.One explanation is that Brexit has made people wary about taking on financial commitments. Another is that rising inflation has made individuals feel worse off and is having a dampening effect on the housing market.Neither argument looks entirely convincing.  suggest consumers are happy to buy big-ticket items, while the recent rise in the  has been modest by historic standards. Inflation stands at just over 2%; within the past half decade, it has been above 5%.The likeliest explanation for the muted state of the property market is that houses are simply too expensive for first-time buyers, even with mortgage rates as low as they are. According to the Office for National Statistics, the  is 7.6 times the average annual salary, more than double the figure two decades ago. The Bank wants to prevent the sort of excessive lending that took place before the financial crisis of a decade ago and has told lenders not to offer loans that are more than 4.5 times a borrower＊s income.In those circumstances, only one of three things can happen. Earnings growth can pick up while house prices remain steady. Earnings growth can remain modest while house prices fall. Or prices remain high and income growth remains low, in which case stasis ensues.There seems little prospect of an acceleration in wage growth, currently running at little more than 2%. Equally, the conditions that would normally prompt a sharp fall in house prices 每 high and rising interest rates and increasing unemployment 每 are not present. The market will go sideways until such time as demand drops, the supply of homes increases or the Bank relaxes its lending conditions.While the economy has certainly slowed since the turn of the year, it is not about to plummet into recession. Sharply higher interest rates from the Bank would certainly kill off demand for property, but that doesn＊t look likely either. Meanwhile, a good chunk of the homes that are being built appear to be  who have found their money goes further as a result of the .In short, the economy has reverted to the state it was in before George Osborne gave the housing market a boost halfway through the last parliament. Two policies,  and , got mortgage lending going again and led to stronger growth.But this was a sugar rush. There was a limit to how far house prices could rise and that limit has been reached. Many of those who are ostensibly gaining from rising house prices are opening branches of the bank of mum and dad so their offspring can buy their first home.The prospect now is a period in which house price inflation hovers around zero, but this is to be welcomed rather than feared. All the major recessions in the economy over the past four decades have come after unsustainable housing booms; the periods when the economy has rebalanced towards manufacturing and investment, such as the mid 1990s, have been when house price inflation has been weak. Growth in 2017 will rely less on the strength of the housing market and more on the ability of UK exporters to take advantage of a more competitive currency and pickup in global demand.Britain could learn something from other countries, namely that you don＊t need rising house prices or even high levels of owner occupation to be rich and successful. Germany has done just fine, even though it has a far bigger rented sector than Britain and has had much lower levels of house price inflation. shows rising home ownership leads to a subsequent increase in unemployment, because owner occupation affects labour mobility, increases congestion costs and encourages Nimby-style behaviour that means fewer new businesses. The correlation holds true across the developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and in individual US states.There is no evidence that buying a house means you personallly lose your job a couple of years down the line, which suggests Britons will not easily be turned on by the idea of becoming a nation of renters. But the idea that high levels of renting can be associated with a dynamic local economy is supported by the evidence of London, which is thriving even though buying a home is a distant dream for most young people. It may also explain why unemployment was so low in the 1950s and 60s, when councils were building homes to rent.Sooner or later, a politician is going to be brave enough to say Britain has got housing policy completely wrong. They will say, quite correctly, that there is no future in an economy so heavily reliant on a housing market that lurches from boom to bust. They will demand that the shackles be taken off local authorities so they can tackle a homelessness crisis. They will accept that Britain＊s taxation system encourages demand for housing, while the planning system discourages supply, and act accordingly.That would mean reform of a property tax system that manages to stimulate demand, encourage land hoarding and be regressive all at the same time. It would also mean taking on the biggest vested interest in Britain: owner occupiers who, through luck rather than skill, have amassed considerable wealth as a result of soaring housing prices. Which is why it is not going to happen any time soon. "

"ight years into Greece＊s ordeal to escape bankruptcy, thousands of Communist party sympathisers packed into Syntagma Square in Athens on Friday to protest at the latest concessions made by Alexis Tsipras＊s leftist government to keep the country afloat.Massed before parliament in the fading light of day, they did what they had come to do: rail against the cuts that loom in return for further disbursement of the emergency aid now needed to avert economic collapse. The serial drama of Greece＊s debt repayments will reach a climax again when loans of 7.5bn mature in July.That communist-aligned unionists can still muster such protests is testament to the party＊s zealous determination to make itself heard. Most Greeks gave up demonstrating long ago.Two years short of a decade in freefall, and with little prospect of recovery, the nation has succumbed to protest fatigue. With the exception of pensioners 每 the great losers in Greece＊s assault by austerity 每 anger has been replaced by malaise, the lassitude that strikes when loss becomes commonplace.Friday＊s protest, one of more than 60 nationwide, came within hours of  escaping another dose of Greek drama after eurozone finance ministers announced that bailout talks 每 stalled as Athens bickered over the terms of its latest compliance review with lenders 每 could finally resume. International auditors representing the bodies behind the three bailout packages the country has received since May 2010 are expected to return to Greece on Monday. Once technical issues are addressed, the delayed bailout payment will be disbursed, ensuring default is averted in July.In exchange, the once fiercely anti-austerity Tsipras has signed up to further reforms worth 3.6bn, the equivalent of 2% of GDP, to be put into effect once the current programme ends next year. ※It is in the nature of every agreement for there to be compromises,§ said Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who faces the thankless task of having to sell the prospect of more pension cuts and tax rises to sceptical leftists in the ruling Syriza party when it convenes on Sunday. ※There are things that will upset ＃ the Greek people.§After more than a year of hard talk and bluster 每 the review was meant to have been concluded in February 2016 每 the government once again conceded on its own red lines, reflecting Athens＊s overarching policy of keeping  in the heart of the eurozone. Tsipras, who fought hard to ensure countermeasures can also be taken to offset losses if economic indicators are better than expected, was quick to sound optimistic. ※The Greek economy,§ he announced, ※is ready to leave the crisis behind it.§But the breakthrough falls far short of the all-inclusive package the government was hoping for. Once again, promises of reducing the country＊s staggering debt pile 每 at 180% of GDP, the biggest impediment to real economic recovery 每 will have to wait. The International Monetary Fund, which has steadfastly refused to finance the latest bailout until meaningful debt forgiveness is assured, repeated that without ※a credible strategy§ it would be unable to even present the programme to its own board.Without the IMF formally signed up, many are reluctant to get into a party mood. ※In the circumstances it was the best the government could get, but in essence it only prolongs the crisis, it doesn＊t solve it,§ said Syriza MEP Stelios Kouloglou. ※Personally I neither trust the IMF nor [German finance minister Wolfgang] Sch?uble. The IMF is still waiting for Trump to clarify his policy on Europe, and Germany is in the midst of an election campaign.§In the standoff, the Greek economy has shown grave signs of slippage. This year was meant to be a year of recovery 每 instead, the uncertainty has prompted the central bank to revise its growth projection downwards following the economy＊s contraction in the fourth quarter last year. Unemployment has increased from 23.2% to 23.5%, with investors 每 the only guarantee of soaking up such an oversupply of labour 每 staying away. In a repeat of the chaos that beset the country＊s financial system at the height of the crisis in 2015, an estimated 2.5bn of deposits left Greek banks in January and February.Consumption is also down. ※The 37% of Greeks at risk of poverty and social exclusion really cannot make ends meet,§ said Aliki Mouriki, a leading Greek sociologist. ※They no longer have the means to meet basic needs, with consumption of milk and bread right down and payment of electricity bills at an all-time low.§The situation on the ground contrasts greatly with the expressions of optimism leading EU officials are prone to offer. But seasoned observers say the language used about Greece ceased to have any real meaning long ago.The nation long at the centre of the eurozone＊s economic crisis still remains its weakest link. The latest d谷tente buys Athens more time 每 and Tsipras further time in office 每 but it is far from being a lifeline. By the summer of 2018, when Greece＊s current 86bn adjustment programme ends, few believe that Athens will be able to get access to international markets or avoid a fourth bailout.※In the interval Tsipras will rot and Greece will rot with him,§ said Dimitris Keridis, a political science professor at Panteion University and a prominent commentator.Keridis is among those who believe that ※Grexit§ is still a possibility. ※There is growing Euroscepticism among Greeks. The country is no longer the systemic threat to the rest of Europe that it was at the beginning of the crisis, and that means there is less incentive to keep it in. If the economy doesn＊t pick up, Grexit will be back on the table.§It is a view held by many in the large-windowed, carpeted offices of MEPs in Brussels. Until now Europe has muddled through on Greece, rallying with professions of euro unity when the shockwave of Brexit hit last summer. With the bloc potentially facing other existential crises 每 in France, where victory in May＊s presidential election for the far-right Marine Le Pen has not been ruled out, and in Italy, where the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement has a real chance of winning elections next year 每 the risk of its geography changing cannot be ruled out.As the union＊s soft underbelly, Greece is unlikely to be spared. Entirely reliant on the European Central Bank for funding, its banks would automatically become the biggest transmission mechanism for a spreading crisis.※The EU is buying time, governments are buying time, the Greek political system is buying time,§ said Giorgos Kyrtsos, a Greek MEP with the conservative New Democracy party, looking out at the grey skies above Brussels.※There are two Grexit scenarios. One made in Greece, the result of the inability to restart the economy. And one made in the eurozone because of political developments in France or Italy. In my view, the big danger is the permanent political and economic crisis in Italy. You can＊t have Greece trapped in the eurozone if Italy leaves.§The alternative is more muddling through: but how long Greece can continue bumping along the bottom, without the risk of implosion or political tumult, is far from certain."															
"hat ※austerity is a feminist issue§ is now a  does not mean it＊s any less true. Look at the latest gender breakdown of cuts released this month and what＊s striking is that nothing＊s changing. According to Sarah Champion, the shadow equalities minister, 86% of the burden of austerity  每 a figure that remains entirely static from last year. Inequality is business as usual: by 2020, a decade on from when austerity first began, men will still have borne just 14% of the total burden of ※welfare§ cuts.This unequal impact isn＊t just contained within the benefit system, but rather spreads to many of the choices the Conservatives are making. NHS and local government cuts of course affect men as well, but as women are a vast chunk of the public sector workforce, they are hurt most when . Similarly, although it＊s rarely talked about in such terms, the crisis in social care is in many ways gendered: it＊s largely women who make up home care and agency staff 每 insecure, low-paid work 每 while it＊s also women who are the bulk of family carers for disabled children and elderly parents. When a council cuts a care package, it＊s largely wives, mothers, and daughters doing the unpaid labour to plug the gap.It isn＊t irrelevant to talk about this, or feminist point-scoring in a ※worst-hit§ race that no one wants to win. Recognising and understanding what＊s happening is the only way to tackle it, which is why calls for the government to run an impact assessment of its budget are vital. Last weekend thousands marched through central London campaigning for an  (※Women pay for cuts with their lives§, as the ), while  met to dissect the obstacles affecting women and girls. And they did it knowing that any fightback begins by naming the problems.Crucially, in the push to acknowledge what＊s being done to women in an era of cuts, we have to highlight how race, class, and disability fit into this. By 2020 Asian women in some of the poorest families will be ?2,247 worse off. That goes up to ?3,996 for black single mothers. White men in some of the richest households, by contrast, are set to . Disabled and chronically ill women 每 many of whom are carers themselves 每 face , from fit-for-work tests to the .By definition, vast cuts to the social security system are going to hurt not the middle classes, but low-income families already struggling. Yet next month＊s new round of benefit measures take this even further, in essence targeting poor mothers and their children. The  coming into force in April 每 part of a crackdown on child tax credit claims for more than two children 每 is reflective of how low the government has sunk, yet it is part of a string of upcoming policies that  will cost families thousands. The charity Gingerbread says universal credit changes alone will see  (90% of single parents are women). As a new wave of , it＊s working class mums 每 scraping by on zero-hours contracts, agency work and benefits 每 who will be queuing in food banks and opening eviction notices., a charity that has worked with vulnerable families in the north-east for nearly 50 years, told me this week that the impact of ※welfare§ changes is now so severe that the charity＊s sex work outreach teams are coming across women who 每 having had their benefits cut or sanctioned 每 have ※taken to the streets in desperation§. This isn＊t some sort of dystopia, but the reality of the state abandoning the people who need it. As the next stage of austerity begins, the Conservatives are not simply watching the burden of their cuts hit women hardest. They are watching it fall on the women least able to take it."															
"After years of unregulated growth, it looks like the good times may be over for those in the UK who make their living from people going out at night-time.Young people are  and the number of nightclubs across the UK has nearly , from . In those 10 years, London has lost  (pdf) and . However, what is bad news for the alcohol industry is an opportunity to expand businesses and activities that can thrive in the evenings and during the night. Through creative investment and collaboration, it ought to be possible to open up the country＊s evening and night-time economy to a far greater number of people, delivering a ?43bn boost to London alone by 2030, .There are many examples of thriving events that do not depend on alcohol. There are the  (white night) festivals in major cities, which might include light shows, illumination of cultural landmarks, contemporary art exhibitions and firework displays. And night markets, such as the one in the , which had more than 1 million visitors in 2016, also move the focus away from alcohol. Plans are under way to develop London＊s nightlife to help it join the ranks of global, 24-hour cities. The capital earns about  from its night-time economy and provides about 1.3m jobs. Against a backdrop of rising land values and gentrification of large swaths of the capital, the recent appointment of a  and the setting up of a  for the city of London follow a recent trend in the appointment of night mayors. From the 24-hour entertainment zones of  to the museum nights of , public-private partnerships are being held up as a vital constituent in the creation of vibrant 24-hour cities. Licensing lawyer Philip Kolvin, appointed by  mayor Sadiq Khan to chair his night-time commission, is a strong advocate of public-private partnerships and light-touch regulation.We have been here before 每 and we need to learn from what happened previously. In the 1990s and 2000s, large property developers, landowners and corporate operators dominated the night-time economy. Residents were not represented and political influence and lobbying power was given to businesses. The result was the emergence of too many high streets dominated by alcohol consumption, to the detriment of more diverse alternatives.Kolvin and night tsar Amy Lam谷 will need to create a more inclusive and safer night-time economy, and not rely on initiatives such as the kitemark schemes  and . These schemes contribute little to cultural change; instead, they confirm the power and influence of the alcohol industry.Legislators need to be bold and consistent in their use of  and powers to reduce ※high volume vertical drinking§, where people down their drinks and move on. There has been success in some parts of London with the development of Business Improvement Districts, where local businesses invest to improve their trading environment. This might include funding police officers and street marshals to reduce anti-social behaviour, or combating the litter and damage left after people go out drinking. Some have criticised these moves for attempting to mask the worst excesses of nights out but they could be a valuable tool in encouraging a wider range of businesses to open later, from  to spas.Developing new entertainment zones in the spirit of cities such as , , or , could allow London councils to work with planners, property developers and creative entrepreneurs to write noise abatement, litter plans and a wider cultural mix into plans. There are plenty of interesting examples. A range of creative enterprises, like  and  sensory theatre, use abandoned buildings, car parks and warehouses for events, pop-up restaurants, galleries and cinemas, often working closely with the local council. In Peckham, south-east London, Frank＊s cafe is an open-air restaurant located at the top of a multi-storey car park. The challenge is ensuring such schemes are both inclusive and sustainable.Regulation and legislation is going to be increasingly important in halting the decline in nightclubs and music venues, and it is here that Kolvin is likely to be a valuable asset by pushing the costs of soundproofing back on to property developers, and preventing new residents complaining about existing noise levels. Partnership, planning and investment will be vital for re-energising our night-time public spaces. With a bit of imagination city leaders can ensure that 24-hour cities are inclusive, clean, and safe. The first step? Robust and consistently implemented enforcement of existing laws on alcohol.

"he news that  is a reminder of just how tough life is on the high street. The 160-year-old shoe retailer may yet be rescued, but about 1,000 workers are unsure about their future employment.Profits for bricks-and-mortar shops are being squeezed by the rise of online shopping, an increase in staff costs brought on by the introduction of the national living wage, and fierce discounting of the price of their products, which is designed to attract shoppers but hurts profit margins. On top of this is  每 a tax that takes no account of falling profit and is now more costly than corporation tax for many shops.However, there is hope for the high street shop. Look at Inditex, the owner of Zara. It has just published  It has done this by taking full advantage of the benefits of a physical shop 每 store managers are given the power to order the clothing for their shop so it is tailored to the local population, the clothing range is changed frequently, and many items are produced in Europe to ensure that shops can get new stock quickly and sell the latest fashion trends.Any new owner of Jones Bootmaker should make a call to Amancio Ortega, the founder of Inditex and Europe＊s richest man.The last time Britain＊s unemployment rate was  was in the summer of 1975. For those whose memories don＊t stretch that far back it was the time of the UK＊s first referendum on EU membership, Harold Wilson was prime minister and inflation was at at postwar peak of more than 25%.The contrast with today＊s labour market is stark. Joblessness stands at 4.7%, a level that many economists would consider close to full employment, yet there is not the glimmer of the upward pressure on wages that was so evident in the mid-70s.Back then, increases in the cost of living were matched by demands for higher pay, which in turn led to higher inflation. Eventually, governments of both left and right resorted to statutory incomes policies as they sought to bring inflation down.The latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests that the UK now has a non-statutory incomes policy, enforced by employers rather than by Whitehall. Unemployment in the three months to January 2017 was 105,000 lower than in the previous quarter and employment was up by 92,000.Yet, wage pressure over the same period abated. Average earnings in the three months to January were 2.3% higher than a year earlier: in the three months to December 2016 they rose at an annual rate of 2.6%.These figures speak volumes about the modern labour market and in particular how the balance of power has shifted in the past four decades. Even when jobs are relatively plentiful and inflation is picking up, workers are unwilling or unable to press for higher pay.The reasons for this transformation is obvious: de-industrialisation and the growth of employment in the non-unionised service sector; curbs on the power of trade unions; an increase in labour supply. In addition, the one area where trade union density remains high 每  每 is subject to a 1% pay cap. Here at least, statutory incomes policy lives on.While record levels of employment are welcome, the weakness of pay means that consumer spending is going to be squeezed hard over the coming months. Inflation is running at 1.8% and will soon overtake earnings growth. Most people will keep their jobs and they will still be able to afford their mortgages because the lack of any wage pressure means the Bank of England will keep interest rates ultra-low. But the feelgood factor will be noticeable by its absence.The finishing line is in sight for the government in its efforts to sell off its stake in . The announcement that another one percentage point stake has been sold off reduces the taxpayer holding to 2.95%. At this rate, by early May, the government will have got shot of the entire holding, which once stood at 43%. It will not be the finale that the government had hoped for, without the flourish of a discounted offering for retail investors and with the admission a chunk of the shares were sold below the 73.6p break-even point.Still, it will be one item struck off the chancellor＊s to do list, in contrast to Royal Bank of Scotland, where the government stake still stands at 73% and a return to private ownership is nowhere in sight.

"The long-term effects of the  vote on the economy will become clear next year when profit growth at some of the UK＊s largest companies is expected to drop considerably, according to a new study.An analysis of forecasts for 2018 gives a grim view on the future for some of the UK＊s biggest companies, with expectations that there will be a marked slowdown.The  (?) shows the uncertainty of a post-Brexit future has resulted in some companies putting plans on hold or shifting operations to other parts of the EU.It comes as WPP, the world＊s largest advertising group,  amid cuts in ad budgets.Analysts expect profit growth at Britain＊s largest companies to rise by 7.2% in 2018, according to the FT analysis, compared with an anticipated 19% this year. Meanwhile, gains by companies listed in London as a result of currency fluctuation have been eclipsed by longer term worries.※The currency is a kneejerk reaction that mathematically comes through,§ Nick Nelson, head of European equity strategy at UBS, told the FT. ※Years two, three and beyond there＊s more uncertainty.§Among the illustrations of the slowdown are Burberry＊s  being put on hold and a 75% drop in investment in the car industry in the first half of this year.  after receiving a promise of no tariffs or extra bureaucratic burdens on the sector.

"The government was forced to borrow more than expected in June after a jump in the UK＊s budget deficit to ?6.9bn 每 almost 50% higher than the same month last year.The sharp rise followed a spike in the cost of financing the UK＊s debt, a drop in corporation tax receipts and a larger than forecast contribution to the EU in June.There is growing pressure on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to loosen the public purse strings but some analysts said the figures are likely to toughen his stance on pleas from ministers for extra funds.There was good news for the chancellor after data indicated that the dramatic slowdown in the economy during the first quarter had so far failed to reduce tax receipts. Corporation tax fell by more than 4% compared with June last year but all the main sources of tax receipts 每 income tax, national insurance and VAT 每 were up more than that predicted by the Treasury＊s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).The Treasury said the persistent shortfall in the government＊s income compared with spending illustrated the need for a ※credible fiscal plan§ that allowed ministers to support ※sound public finances§ while ※promoting a stronger economy§.Opposition parties were quick to say that the higher deficit showed that austerity had failed and was delivering weaker public services without strengthening the public finances or the economy. from full-year borrowing of ?46bn last year to ?58bn this year.With a queue of government departments clamouring for inflation-busting rises in their funding before the autumn budget, the early signs are that Hammond will be reluctant to put extra cash on the table.The chancellor is under pressure to relax a pay cap on public sector workers and find extra resources to boost police and healthcare budgets.Some analysts said the bigger-than-expected deficit in June meant the final figure could exceed ?60bn before any extra money has been allocated for public services.Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotia Bank, said it was worrying that the deficit was wider than expected in the early part of the financial year when the last third was already scheduled to see a large deterioration in tax receipts.Phil Shaw, an economist at Investec, said: ※Today＊s figures illustrate the challenges confronting the chancellor to manage the public finances, as he is faced with a double whammy of slowing growth and rising inflation on one side and calls for greater expenditure on the other.※It is now looking likely that the deficit will rise this year for the first time since 2012-13. There are some idiosyncratic factors here and the OBR＊s forecasts already envisage extra borrowing. But there are medium-term challenges as well, not least from the ageing population, as the OBR＊s recent Fiscal Risk Report highlighted. ※Unless there is a sensible public debate over the UK＊s fiscal challenges, the government will face an uphill task in providing a coherent response to deliver sustainable public finances,§ he said.But John Hawksworth, PricewaterhouseCoopers＊ chief economist, said the chancellor would still have room for increases in public spending in the budget. ※Looking beyond the current financial year, we would expect the decline in the budget deficit to resume if current tax and spending plans are maintained. This should give the chancellor some room for manoeuvre in his autumn budget to ease up on austerity in priority areas like health, social care, policing and housing investment,§ he said.※But he will wish to do this in a measured way given the uncertainties around the economic environment as the Brexit process continues and the high initial level of the public debt to GDP ratio.§In the first three months of the financial year, the budget deficit widened by 8.9% compared with the same period in 2016 to ?22.8bn, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).Spending on debt interest jumped an annual 33% in June to ?4.9bn, the highest for any month of June since 2011, reflecting a sharp rise in inflation that has pushed up the cost of index-linked bonds for the government.The deficit was also widened by higher payments to the EU budget, which have shifted from the usual pattern of contributions to skew annual comparisons, and bigger purchases of goods and services by the government. The EU contribution was ?700m higher than in June 2016.The ONS said income tax and capital gains tax revenues increased by an annual 7.1% to ?12.7bn but corporation tax revenues fell by 3.2% on the year to ?4.8bn."															
"The British cabinet has accepted that free movement of people for up to four years after Britain leaves the EU will be part of a  transition deal, according to a senior source.As the EU chief negotiator, , underlined the need for clarity on the British side at the end of the latest round of exit negotiations, soft Brexiters in the cabinet are now confident they have achieved a consensus about an ※off the shelf§ transition deal.The claim that a collective view has been reached comes after weeks of a brutal briefing war over competing visions of Brexit since the general election wiped out Theresa May＊s majority, culminating in the prime minister＊s admonition this week that there is ※§, and sowing confusion in Brussels about the reliability of the British negotiating position.But as  concluded Brexit talks in Brussels on Thursday, the senior cabinet source told the Guardian that the mood has shifted significantly and that ministers now hoped to agree a deal as soon as possible to give certainty to British business.※If you ask business when they want to see it agreed, they＊d say tomorrow,§ the source said, adding that such a deal could last between two and four years and could be expected to involve continued free movement of people. The source felt the most likely scenario was a deal lasting three years.The scale of the challenge that remains in the Brexit negotiations was the focus for Barnier in a Brussels press conference alongside Davis.He said , including on the exit bill. ※As I said very clearly to David, a clarification of the UK＊s position is indispensable for us to negotiate and for us to make sufficient progress on this financial dossier, which is inseparable from the other withdrawal dossiers.§Echoing complaints from officials on the British side about a lack of flexibility from the Europeans in the early exchanges, Davis responded: ※We have had robust but constructive talks this week. Clearly there is lots left to talk about and further work to do before we can resolve this. Ultimately getting a solution will require flexibility on both sides.§The high stakes of the talks were emphasised by the news that British people living in the EU  after Brexit unless Britain made a reciprocal offer. A UK source close to the negotiations said that there was agreement on about 50% of citizens＊ rights issues but said there were still ※significant gaps§ in the EU＊s offer.While Davis was in Brussels, May was hosting business leaders in Downing Street to hear their concerns about Brexit, in the latest sign that the government is keener to listen since the general election.A No 10 spokesman said: ※The prime minister reiterated that the government＊s overarching goal is for a smooth, orderly exit culminating in a comprehensive free trade deal with the EU, with a period of implementation in order to avoid any cliff-edges.§Business groups have repeatedly stressed their desire for a transitional deal, with the CBI suggesting continued membership of the single market and the customs union, until new trading arrangements can be put in place.Some cabinet ministers, including , had been resistant to a formal transition period after Brexit day. But the new environment secretary and key leave campaigner is now reluctantly signed up, after being confronted with the reality of the risks of a ※cliff-edge Brexit§ for his department.David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has publicly softened his approach in recent weeks, telling a House of Lords select committee that ※practicalities§ would force a need for a transition period.He insisted that a free trade deal could be concluded during the two-year formal negotiating period 每 but that other countries would need time to prepare new customs systems.The international trade secretary, , also conceded that a transition deal might be necessary; but speaking to the BBC on Thursday he insisted that striking a new trade deal with the EU 每 the second part of the two-stage negotiation process 每 would be simple.※The free trade agreement that we will have to do with the  should be one of the easiest in human history.※We are already beginning with zero tariffs, and we are already beginning at the point of maximal regulatory equivalence, as it is called. In other words, our rules and our laws are exactly the same.§Two ※off-the-shelf§ models that could apply to the UK during the transition period include European Economic Area membership, which includes single market access and exemption from some EU rules, though members pay budget contributions and accept free movement.The Swiss model, membership of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), means access to EU market for some but not all areas of trade, with no duty to apply EU laws apart from some trade regulation, though free movement also applies.Advocates of a soft Brexit within the cabinet include the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who has been the target of leaks to undermine him from within the cabinet, including claims that he suggested trains were easy enough for even women to drive and argued public sector workers were overpaid.Gove will make his first speech as environment secretary on Friday where he will pledge a ※green Brexit§ and describe himself as ※an environmentalist first§.The newly returned cabinet minister will warn of the dangers of climate change, which he said ※threatens both fragile natural habitats and developing human societies§ and condemned how the world had ※allowed extractive and exploitative political systems to lay waste to natural resources.§Gove will say Brexit is an opportunity to ※review§ environmental protections. ※Outside the  there is scope for Britain ... to be a global leader in environmental policy across the board,§ he will say, pledging to develop a ※global gold standard§."															
"Britain＊s consumers and UK-focused firms are among the biggest losers one year on from the shock Brexit vote that drove .On the first anniversary of the , financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown said clear winners and losers have emerged, with the pound taking the biggest hit on the markets. Blue chip companies with a large proportion of foreign earnings are among the biggest winners.The pound tanked when the result of the referendum became clear on 24 June and 12 months on the currency is still down 15% against the dollar at just above $1.26. It is also down 14% against the euro, at about 1.13.A weaker pound has reduced the spending power of UK holidaymakers abroad, and put pressure on consumer finances by pushing up .※The main financial effect of Brexit has been felt in the pound,§ said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ※Holidaymakers have probably been the most obvious losers from  so far, though inflation is also gradually ratcheting up the pressure on consumers more broadly.§The fall in the pound and tougher backdrop for household finances has also hurt the fortunes of some UK focused companies. Hargreaves Lansdown said that while the  100 was up 18% over the past year, UK focused retailers Dixons Carphone and Next had suffered big falls, with shares down 29% and 27% respectively.Cash savers were also cited in the report as losers from the Brexit vote, because of a combination of low interest rates and higher inflation. ※The resurgence of inflation makes the low interest rate environment even more punitive for cash savers because their money is losing its buying power even faster,§ Khalaf said.The Brexit vote appeared to scupper the idea that the Bank of England would soon increase borrowing costs, with market expectations of a rate rise by 2018 plunging from 86% on the day of the referendum to 20% now. As Brexit negotiations finally got under way this week, the TUC said that 12 months after the referendum the government had failed to come up with a plan to make Brexit a success for working people.※We have spent the last year fighting for the best Brexit deal for working people 每 one that protects their jobs and their rights at work,§ said Frances O＊Grady, its general secretary.※A no-deal Brexit would be devastating for jobs and the UK economy 每 and after the election result, the prime minister has no mandate for it.※A good Brexit deal for working people means tariff-free and barrier-free trade with . And it means a level playing field for workers＊ rights written into the Brexit deal. That deal must protect all current rights and make sure hardworking Brits do not miss out on new protections enjoyed by EU workers in future.§Large multinationals listed on the FTSE 100 but with significant foreign earnings have been among the biggest winners from the vote, benefiting from a weaker pound. ※All of the top 10 performing stocks have significant international earnings which have helped propel their stock price performance thanks to weaker sterling,§ Khalaf said. ※There are other factors at play too however; for instance commodity producers Glencore and Antofagasta have benefited from price rises in the stuff they dig out of the ground.§The biggest 10 companies listed on the FTSE 100 have become more dominant since the Brexit vote: they now account for 46% of the leading index. elsewhere in the world have performed well over the past year. For example, the value of every ?100 invested a year ago in Germany＊s DAX is ?144, compared with ?123 for the FTSE 100.*Dixons Carphone dropped out of the FTSE 100 in March"															
															
															
"British  went into reverse in April, with production falling at the fastest rate in more than two and a half years.A total of 122,116 cars rolled off UK production lines last month, 18% fewer than in April 2016, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The trade body attributed what was the sharpest fall since August 2014 to the late timing of Easter this year.※Car production fell significantly in April due to the later Easter bank holiday weekend, which reduced the number of active production days that month, and also due to unplanned production adjustments,§ said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT.The drop in car production echoed the trend in , as government cuts to subsidies for green cars and a rise in prices hit demand.The UK car industry backed the remain camp in the run-up to the EU referendum and SMMT members are fearful about possible tariffs being imposed on parts imported from the EU after Brexit. in the event of a ※hard Brexit§, encouraging some manufacturers to look at moving production out of the country, according to PA Consulting Group. The average UK-built car has about 6,000 parts, with the majority coming from the EU and passing in and out of the country several times during the production process.※To guarantee future growth and investment into our industry and its vital supply chain, however, we need the next government to safeguard the conditions that have made us globally competitive, keeping us open and trading and delivering an ambitious industrial strategy for our sector,§ Hawes said. Taking the first four months of 2017 overall, almost 600,000 cars were built at UK factories, 1% more than over the same period a year earlier. Demand is being driven by foreign markets, with cars built for export up 3.5% in 2017 so far, while the number destined for the home market fell 7%.A total of 1.7m cars were produced in Britain in 2016, and the SMMT believes the number could surpass 2m by 2020, breaking the previous record of 1.92m set in 1972.Hawes said the broader trend for car production was positive. ※Overall, British car manufacturing remains in good health, with the production outlook still very positive and significant new models due to go into UK production shortly.§ The biggest manufacturers in the UK include Japan＊s Nissan in Sunderland, Indian-owned  in the West Midlands and north-west, and German-owned Mini in Oxford."															
"Ten years ago this month, Britain was on the cusp of change. Two things were about to happen, one planned and one unexpected.The change everybody knew about was that Tony Blair was going to stand down as prime minister after 10 years in the job, during which time he had won three elections on the trot.To mark his going, Dan Atkinson and I wrote a book summing up his legacy. . It painted a picture of Britain as mired in debt, where the public sector was on the brink of meltdown, where the country was trying to play the part of world policeman on the cheap, and where the growing size of the trade deficit exposed the perils of allowing manufacturing to shrivel.Fantasy Island was not exactly a bestseller but it sold reasonably well. The reason for that (apart, obviously, from the book＊s razor-sharp analysis and polished prose) was that the biggest financial crisis in a century erupted within two months of its publication and a month after Blair＊s departure from Downing Street. This was the unexpected event.Britain, as a result of what happened between the first inklings of trouble in July 2007 and the bottoming out of a deep slump in the early part of 2009, is an utterly changed country. There has been a lost decade of living standards. Dismal productivity growth and the proliferation of low-paid, insecure jobs have made a mockery of the idea that Britain was forging ahead in the knowledge economy. A decade of investment in the public sector has been followed by a decade of cuts. Without sounding unduly boastful, quite a lot of what was predicted in Fantasy Island came true.And, to be frank, not a lot has changed in the subsequent 10 years. The economy is still over-dependent on the financial sector and on the willingness of households to load up on debt. When the housing market slows 每 as in 2011-12 and currently 每 so does the economy. Income and wealth are highly concentrated because not only has growth been slow it has also been unevenly distributed. In the workplace, management is strong and unions are weak, which helps explain why real wages have grown more slowly since 2007 than in any decade since the 19th Century. London is rich and thriving but might as well be a separate country given how different it is from other, less prosperous, regions. Relative poverty, as the former prime minister , is heading for levels not experienced even under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.Imperfect though it is, at least tries to tackle some of these glaring weaknesses. Sure, there is a perhaps naive belief in the ability of the state to administer top-down solutions. Certainly, the document can 每 and will 每 be criticised for being stronger on how to spend money than how to create it. No question, some of the individual measures don＊t really cut it. The ?8bn bung to scrap tuition fees, for example, is not especially progressive.That said, though, there are plenty of good things in the manifesto. The employers who whinge constantly about the poor quality of school leavers and graduates will be asked to contribute more to the education budget through higher corporation tax.  plans to broaden stamp duty to a wider range of financial instruments, including derivatives, which will raise ?5bn and help lessen volatility.There is a recognition that macro-economic policy since the crisis has been flawed, with far too much emphasis on ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing and too little on tax and spending measures. Austerity has been tested to destruction, with both deficit reduction and growth much weaker than envisaged. There is a strong case, as the International Monetary Fund has noted, for countries to borrow to invest in infrastructure, especially when they can do so at today＊s low interest rates.Indeed, it is sign of how much ground has been ceded by the left over the last decade that these ideas are seen as dangerously radical. Germany and France have higher levels of corporation tax than Britain, but they also have better trained workforces and higher levels of productivity. A group of eurozone countries are planning a financial transactions tax. Balancing day-to-day spending while borrowing for roads, railways and superfast broadband, which is what John McDonnell is suggesting, is more Keynesian than Marxist.What＊s more, these essentially social-democratic ideas will seem even more mainstream if 每 as is entirely possible 每 there is another crisis.Mohammed El-Erian used to run Pimco, the world＊s biggest fund manager. that in 2008-09 there was a chance to construct a new growth model, but the opportunity was passed up. Financial markets have been kept happy by an unceasing diet of cheap money but the economic fundamentals are poor. Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and the eclipse of both the traditional parties of government in the French presidential election are warning signs that something is seriously amiss.El-Erian says the developed world is ※either going to take a turn towards higher, more inclusive growth that will reduce political polarisation and the politics of anger. Or alternatively, low growth becomes recession, artificial financial stability becomes unsettling volatility, and the politics get a lot messier§.Things, in other words, are back where they were in the run-up to the crash of 2007-08. Then, the series of regional financial crises in Mexico, south-east Asia, Russia, and Latin America were warnings that something bigger and much more serious was about to happen. These were akin to someone who is obese and a heavy smoker suffering a series of mini strokes and failing to change their lifestyle.The leak of Labour＊s draft manifesto led to some predictable headlines 每 ※Britain heading back to the 1970s§; ※This was the most expensive suicide note in history§. For me, though the most memorable given its personal connotations, was the Daily Mail＊s ※Corbyn＊s fantasy land§.Think about this for a moment. Real incomes are falling. Inequality is rising. The NHS is kept going on a wing and a prayer. The economy is barely rising despite more than eight years of unprecedented stimulus from the Bank of England. Personal debt is heading back towards its previous record levels. International co-operation has rarely been weaker. There is a profound disconnect between the financial markets, where asset prices regularly scale new heights, and the state of the real economy.Now ask yourself this. If any of the above rings true, what is the real fantasy: Labour＊s idea that income, wealth and power should be a bit more evenly distributed or the idea that the current state of affairs can be sustained for very much longer?"															
"The chancellor, , has called for closer economic ties with China as Britain enters a new, post-Brexit era.Speaking at the start of  celebrating President Xi Jinping＊s ※§, Hammond heaped praise on his hosts and said Britain was a ※natural partner§ for Beijing as it pushed ahead with a massive infrastructure campaign some call the most ambitious in history.※China and the UK have a long and rich trading history. Indeed, the English first attempted to find a trade route to  in the 16th century although it took us four decades to find one,§ Hammond told the opening session of the two-day forum. ※I welcome the ＆Belt and Road initiative＊ as an opportunity to strengthen these ties and I welcome the progress that has already been made.§ after Theresa May became prime minister in July and ordered a review of the controversial China-backed Hinkley Point C plant. That decision cast doubt on what had previously been cast as a ※golden age§ of ties under her predecessor David Cameron and former chancellor George Osborne. But  after the ?18bn project was approved. On Sunday Hammond hailed China＊s ability to drive ※phenomenal economic development§ and success in ※lifting§ 800 million Chinese citizens out of poverty over the past four decades. ※Since 1980 the Chinese economy has grown by over 2,500%. This year, it is expected to account for a quarter of total global economic growth,§ he told an audience of world leaders including Russian president Vladimir Putin, and Turkey＊s Recep Erdo?an. Britain now hoped to benefit from that growth as it charted its post-Brexit course, the chancellor added. ※As we embark on a new chapter in our history, as we leave the European Union, we want to maintain a close and open trading partnership with our European neighbours and at the same time pursue our ambition to secure free trade agreements around the world with new partners and old allies alike.§※Our ambition is for more trade, not less trade, and China clearly shares this ambition,§ Hammond added.The chancellor said that between now and 2030 about $26tn would need to be spent on infrastructure in Asia - $4tn of which China had pledged to help fund. ※But the scale of infrastructure investment required cannot be met by public financing alone and the UK, I believe, can be a natural partner in delivering this infrastructure by supporting the finance, the design and the delivery needed to make the vision a reality.§Liu Xiaoming, China＊s ambassador in London, said that while Brexit and next month＊s general election had brought ※uncertainties§, Downing Street was now ※in an excellent position to secure the opportunities [Xi＊s] initiative has to offer§.※Remarkable opportunities ＃ are now up for grabs,§ , China＊s official news agency. on Twitter: ※Britain is ready to work with all [Belt and Road] partners.§"															
"Chinese president Xi Jinping has kicked off a two-day showcase of what some call the most ambitious development project ever by comparing his country to a peace-loving explorer set on transforming the world with treasure-laden galleys not warships, guns or swords.Speaking at the start of a high-profile summit about , Xi hailed his multi-billion dollar infrastructure crusade as a means of building a modern-day version of the ancient Silk Road and a new ※golden age§ of globalisation.※The glory of the ancient Silk Road shows that geographical dispersion is not insurmountable,§ he told the 29 heads of state who have gathered in Beijing for the event, including Russian president , and Turkey＊s Recep Erdo?an. However, as Xi took to the stage his signature foreign policy initiative faced a backlash with India launching a scathing attack on the $900bn Chinese plan and announcing it would boycott proceedings., New Delhi believed the scheme was ※little more than a colonial enterprise [that would leave] debt and broken communities in its wake§.Xi told a different story on Sunday, painting what he called his ※project of the century§ as a bold and inclusive attempt to kickstart a new era of globalisation.In a 45-minute address, the Communist party chief vowed to throw his weight behind a global construction spree stretching all the way from Asia, across Europe and Africa, to the Americas.  ※The Belt and Road initiative is rooted in the ancient Silk Road ... but it is also open to all other countries,§ the Chinese leader said, promising to pump $125bn into the scheme. Just as Chinese traders and explorers such as , a Ming dynasty navigator, went out into the world in peace, so too would China now seek to engage with other countries. ※These pioneers won their place in history not as conquerors with warships guns or swords but are remembered as friendly emissaries leading caravans of camels and sailing treasure-loaded ships,§ Xi said.※This part of history shows that civilisation thrives with openness and that nations prosper from exchange.§Tom Miller, the author of , said that in many countries the attitude to Xi＊s infrastructure extravaganza was: ※The more money the better§. And on Sunday morning, a cast of global leaders who are hoping to benefit from Beijing＊s munificence lined up to heap praise on Xi Jinping.Ethiopia＊s prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, hailed what he called a unique, historic, extraordinary and momentous project. ※Many of us in the developing world 每 especially we in Africa 每 continue to view  as a successful economic model and a reliable ally in the fight against poverty and in our quest for prosperity,§ he said, describing the Belt and Road as the greatest economic collaboration of the 21st century. The British chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: ※I commend President Xi ... for setting in train such a bold and visionary project. This initiative is truly ground-breaking in the scale of its ambition, spanning more than 65 countries, across four continents, with the potential to raise the living standards of 70% of the global population.§One of the most resounding endorsements came from Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of key ally Pakistan, who told the audience he had come to offer his ※deepest tributes§ to Xi＊s ※seminal initiative§. ※We stand at the cusp of a geo-economic revolution. In fact, this is the dawn of a truly new era of synergetic intercontinental cooperation,§ Sharif said. Malaysia＊s prime Minister, Najib Razak,  from the audience for the ※visionary and exciting§ initiative while Chile＊s president, Michelle Bachelet, predicted it would ※pave the way for a more inclusive, equal, just, prosperous and peaceful society with development for all§. ※Chile is ready to become a bridge country between Asia and Latin America,§ Bachelet said.However, there are also deep-rooted doubts, with some suspecting Beijing is using its ※win-win§ project as a ploy to lure less powerful nations into its economic orbit and boost its geopolitical power. Privately, western diplomats voice concerns about China＊s true intentions and how much involvement non-Chinese companies will be allowed to have in Belt and Road projects. Only one G7 leader, the Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, is in Beijing for Xi＊s summit. In  released on Saturday, India, the plan＊s most vocal critic, cautioned China against pursuing projects that would create an ※unsustainable debt burden for communities§, damage the environment or infringe upon other countries＊ sovereignty. Such initiatives ※must be based on universally recognised international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality§, it said. Beijing hit back at critics, with its official news agency attacking the ※naysayers§ and ※fear mongers§ it claimed were hovering over Xi＊s plan like buzzards. The Belt and Road initiative was ※not and will never be neocolonialism by stealth§, Xinhua argued in . ※China harbours no intention to control or threaten any other nation. China needs no puppet states,§ it added, describing the summit as a chance not ※to assert a new hegemony, but an opportunity to bring an old one to an end§.Peter Cai, a fellow from Australia＊s Lowy Institute, said the two-day forum was Xi＊s latest attempt to burnish his credentials as . ※The two strongest champions of globalisation as I see it 每 the US and the UK 每 are both retreating [genuinely] or symbolically from their commitment to globalisation ... I see this as presenting a good strategic opportunity for China to promote itself as the new champion of globalisation.§ Cai said a Chinese construction blitz was good news for Asia, which suffers from a chronic deficit of infrastructure, but argued it was too early to tell whether Xi＊s lofty dreams would be fulfilled. ※Some projects are happening overseas but we are talking about multi-year infrastructure projects 每 some are just starting,§ he said. ※At this stage it is too early to pass judgment.§"															
"Language in politics is a fraught business. Certain terms and words are thrown around so often and so easily that they can lose their punch, if not their meaning.Guardian Australia＊s recent article ※ had at its core a grossly erroneous claim 每 that the Hawke-Keating governments were the tip of the arrow for neoliberalism, globally and at home. In recent times ※neoliberalism§ has re-emerged as a catch-all term for the economic policies of free trade, deregulation and privatisation implemented primarily in the US and UK, but also to varying degrees in other western democracies, during the 1980s and 1990s.A lot of economists would chide anyone using the term for imprecision, and in truth it applies only to varying degrees in different countries, and to none of them in its entirety.It＊s a notably poor fit with Australia under Bob Hawke and .Over this period, the Hawke and Keating Labor governments certainly undertook a series of economic reforms designed to open Australia＊s trade with Asia and reinvigorate our domestic economy. But to call the entirety of the Hawke/Keating agenda ※neoliberal§ is to look at it squinting through one eye.Far from the caricature that , Australia has enjoyed 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth since 1991. The US and UK have not been so lucky.Hawke and Keating recognised the consequences of unleashing market forces on the , and more importantly, unleashing them on Australian society. At the beginning of the 1980s, Australia was one of the most highly protected economies in the developed world. The meticulous crafting of policies from 1983-96 ensured that prosperity and social equality went hand in hand.If Hawke and Keating were simple merchants of neoliberalism, they wouldn＊t have reinstated Medicare, nor introduced a capital gains tax to rein in the excesses of the financial sector. They would never have established a more progressive income tax schedule across the board. They wouldn＊t have struck the Accords with trade unions to help bring down unemployment and deliver a social wage, which included greater funding for health, education, childcare and welfare for those who the market might otherwise have left behind.The Hawke-Keating economic reforms should be more accurately described and recognised as ※Australian Laborism§, which predated by a decade or more the Third Way ideology embraced by some US Democrats and part of the British Labour party, and to which they are often compared.It is a curious type of cultural cringe that I think distorts our debate to this day. Australian progressives in the 80s and 90s were distinctive and creative, and we do well to capture some of their spirit in thinking about reform today.  The difference between Australian Laborism and transatlantic ※Third Way§ is borne out in the data today. The share of income going to the top 1% ※is nearly 20% in the United States, compared with 14每15% in Britain ... and barely 9每10% in Australia,§ as .Australian Laborism showed that when the circumstances are right, policies that liberalise an economy, delivered in conjunction with policies that taper the excesses of market capitalism, can provide economic benefits for working Australians.  Finally, to attempt to pin the Hawke-Keating governments to the wall for opening up the Australian economy (because elements of the reforms were neoliberal) while not acknowledging the lift in living standards is disingenuous. It also conveniently overlooks the utter failure of the protected ※settlement§ status quo which was taking Australia, and working families across the nation, absolutely nowhere.The ethos of Australian Laborism guided the Rudd and Gillard governments when Labor was returned to power in 2007. The ambitious reform program 每 a price on carbon, a national broadband network, a national disability insurance scheme 每 appreciated that social and economic objectives were intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Equality could not take a back seat to the pursuit of economic growth. As , economic equality must be a driver of prosperity, not an afterthought to it.When the financial crisis arrived, Labor＊s response was swift, sweeping, substantial and most importantly stunningly successful. The mantra ※go hard, go early, go households§ captured Australian Labor＊s recognition that a robust economy depends upon a thriving middle class 每 the very antithesis of the trickle-down vision of neoliberalism. (It＊s incidentally also why, from Malcolm Turnbull to his paymasters in the Murdoch media, there is such a frenetic effort to write that successful stimulus out of history.)Labor＊s response helped keep Australians working and a recession at bay. US and UK stimulus measures emphasised cutting taxes and bailing out banks, but were insufficient to curtail the downturn or contain unemployment. The Rudd and Gillard reforms also exposed the hypocrisy of those in the corporate sector posturing as champions of neoliberalism. The business community baulked at Labor＊s proposal to cut the corporate tax rate 每 in exchange for a resources super profit tax 每 but subsequent Senate inquiries and ATO investigations have revealed that as many as one in three corporations were systematically and illegally avoiding their obligations. Far from embracing a level playing field, captains of industry sought to entrench their established power, acting out a grotesque pastiche of neoliberalism by corporate rule.Since the Labor government left office, and particularly since the financial crisis has subsided, two schools of thought have developed. The first school believes an appalling economic crisis like 2008 changes everything and that economic policy must change too, lest we end up in the same place again.The second school are those who have ※learned nothing and forgotten nothing§, as it was said of the House of Bourbon after the restoration of the French Monarchy in 1814.It seems bizarre that the second group can still spout their failed ideology with a straight face, let alone be tolerated in polite society. Nearly 10 years on from the crisis, many are still in positions of power and implementing similar policies to those which led to the crisis in the first place. However, if centre-left parties cannot articulate an economic framework which delivers rising living standards for workers, then cloaked in Trumpian populism, the real neoliberal ideologues may lead us down the road to ruin once more.The Hawke and Keating years showed Australia could shake off the ※Lucky Country§ epithet and create its own luck with pragmatic policy. The Rudd and Gillard years embraced the spirit of Australian Laborism, reinvigorating domestic economic policy to combat contemporary challenges. These governments proved that growth and equity are mutually reinforcing, not diametrically opposed.Just as it is mistaken to conflate Australian Laborism with neoliberalism, it would be doubly foolish to propose neoliberal reforms in the name of Hawke and Keating. Paul Keating himself has  that ※[neo]liberal economics has run into a dead end and has no answer to the contemporary malaise§.This is not a repudiation of the reforms he implemented as treasurer and continued as prime minister. Rather it is simply an acknowledgement that different challenges require different solutions. As rampant inequality grips the global economy and populist revolts sweep aside the Atlantic neoliberal consensus, centre-left parties must respond with imaginative policy solutions.Australian Laborism provides a guiding light. A dynamic public sector which pursues activist fiscal policy and honours a commitment to full employment is entirely compatible with the pragmatic heart of Australian Laborism. If centre-left parties wish to escape the poison of trickle-down policies, they could do far worse than properly understand the real intent and outcomes of policies implemented from 1983 onwards in Australia."															
"Global stock markets reached new peaks on Friday, but came off their best levels following disappointing US jobs data.Only 138,000 jobs were created across the US in May, well below the expected level of 180,000. .The jobs figures came a day after upbeat manufacturing surveys from the UK, Europe and US, which helped outweigh concerns about the UK election and Donald Trump＊s decision to .The UK outlook was also boosted on Friday by better-than-expected construction figures, with the Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers＊ index climbing from 53.1 to 56 in May, compared with a forecasted fall to 52.7.The FTSE 100 recorded a new closing high of 7,547, up only slightly after a flurry of buying earlier in the day pushed the intraday peak to 7,598.99. The  250 also suffered a rollercoaster ride after initially hitting a new record of 20,081 before ending the day at down slightly at 19,977.Investors shrugged off continuing weakness in the pound as the Conservative lead over Labour .But the FTSE 100 underperformed compared with its European counterparts, thanks to a slide in the oil price hitting commodity companies. Crude dropped more than 3% in the wake of Trump＊s climate decision to below $49 a barrel for Brent crude, which analysts said could prompt US drillers to increase their output. This would outweigh the moves by Opec and its allies to cut production and would put more downward pressure on prices.The German Dax climbed 158 points to 12,822 while the French CAC edged 24 points higher to 5,343, and the MSCI All-Country World index rose 0.3% to a record high. Meanwhile, the US Dow Industrial Index moved higher in early trading, up 33 points to a fresh high of 21,213.Analysts at Capital  said the modest increase in US jobs was ※not too discouraging§ and was likely to pick up again over the rest of the summer.It said: ※After all, the employment rate declined to 4.3% in May, its lowest level since 2001. With survey evidence suggesting it will fall below 4% in the next few months, and wage growth likely to pick up before long, we expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates steadily over the next year and a half.§The US central bank has indicated that it will increase interest rates for a fourth time by 0.25% after taking rates to near zero in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash. It has taken a cautious approach to increasing rates after the turmoil in global markets triggered in 2014 by hints from Fed bosses that higher long-term interest rates were likely.A hike could come as soon as a fortnight when Fed boss Janet Yellen and members of the Federal Open Market Committee next meet in Washington. , well above the 0.25% set by the Bank of England.With only a week to go before the UK election and three weeks before the start of Brexit negotiations, Capital Economics said the FTSE 100 and UK economy were in for a bumpy ride.※Thursday＊s general election will command the majority of attention this coming week. With the recent narrowing in the polls and major differences between the main parties both on Brexit and the stance and mix of fiscal policy, the outcome could have a rather greater impact on the economy and markets than the last few elections have done.§Kully Samra, managing director at the stockbroker Charles Schwab, said the weaker than expected US jobs report was ※merely a temporary blip on the radar§. He said: ※Wider US economic data remains buoyant and equity markets resilient, even in the face of the potential turmoil coming out of Washington. Underlying numbers are still robust which should help solidify June rate hike expectations.§Marc Ostwald, a strategist at ADM Investor Services, said one of the risks to a calm week ahead of the Fed meeting was the appearance of former FBI boss James Comey before a congressional committee on Thursday. He said the UK election outcome and a wide range of economic data from China would also influence investor confidence."															
															
															
"Barclaycard and the British Retail Consortium have warned that a spurt in spending in April was the result of the late timing of Easter and said the growing squeeze on incomes meant the underlying trend in high street activity was weak.The two surveys found that rising inflation had resulted in consumers devoting an increasingly share of their pay packets on household essentials.Barclaycard said consumer spending was 5.5% up on April 2016 but added that the increase was mainly driven by supermarkets and petrol stations. It said spending on these essentials was up more than 11% year on year, the fastest rate of growth since it began releasing consumer spending data in 2012.Paul Lockstone, managing director at Barclaycard, said: ※A late Easter and rising prices provided a superficial boost to spending in April, but behind the headline figure it＊s clear consumers are recognising and responding to the inflationary pressures being placed on household budgets. Despite growth across a number of categories, the spending picture in real terms is one of growing caution, as seen by declining confidence levels amongst the UK＊s consumers.§Consumer spending was boosted by the sharp fall in oil and other commodity prices in 2014 and 2015, which raised the real value of incomes by pushing the annual inflation rate to zero.But this trend has been reversed since the summer of 2016 through a combination of a rebound in oil prices and the rising cost of imports caused by the post-Brexit referendum drop in the value of the pound.Inflation has risen from 0.6% to 2.3% and is now running at the same level as the annual growth in average earnings. Further increases in inflation are expected over the coming months, despite the recovery in sterling against the US dollar from just above $1.20 to just below $1.30.Other recent data have indicated that consumers are no longer spending as freely as in the second half of 2016. , , while the  and have now fallen ?3,000 from the peak reached last December.The latest data for consumer spending and the housing market comes ahead of the Bank of England＊s interest-rate setting meeting on Thursday. Threadneedle Street is expected to leave borrowing costs on hold at 0.25%.The BRC＊s chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the 6.3% rise in sales reported by her organisation was distorted by the timing of Easter.※As expected, the Easter holidays provided the welcome boost to retail sales, which goes some way to making up for the disappointing start to the year. That said, the positive distortion from the timing of Easter was largely responsible for the month＊s growth and looking to the longer-term signs of a slowdown, the outlook isn＊t as rosy.※Taking a closer look at the sales figures, consumer spend on food and non-food items is diverging. Food categories continue to contribute the most weight to overall growth, although food inflation has a part to play in this. Meanwhile, consumers are being more cautious in their spending towards non-food products and focusing more on value-priced lines.§Dickinson said that life was set to become more difficult in the high street, adding that Theresa May should make consumers a priority as she negotiates Britain＊s exit from the EU.※Although today＊s figures do indicate that consumers are still willing to spend, with a cocktail of rising costs and slowing wage growth as the backdrop, conditions for consumers will get tougher. The next government needs to deliver a plan that puts consumers first in its economic policies and the forthcoming Brexit negotiations.§"															
"I am asked this question very often: why should we care about inequality? There are three reasons.First, every inequality in the treatment or position of individuals 每 including inequality in income and wealth 每 requires understanding and justification, because we are all fundamentally the same. That does not mean we should all have the same incomes because our effort and luck may vary, but we need to think about the reasons for any and every inequality.For example, we can adopt  每 that inequality can be justified only if it is in the interest of the least well-off (that is, so long as it raises the absolute income of the poorest). Or we can agree with  that inequality is acceptable so long as the rules of the game, such as equal access to the market, are observed. Or we can provide another rationale.But no matter which philosophical opinion we find the most attractive, we have to address the reasons for the existence of inequality. Second, we want to study inequality and its effects on economic growth 每 not only on the growth of the mean, like , but along the entire income distribution: for the poor, the middle class and the rich. This, unlike the first reason, is a very instrumental reason: we want to find out whether inequality helps or retards economic progress.Common sense, some heuristics and empirical evidence suggest that neither of the extremes 每 that all incomes are the same, or that inequality is extremely high 每 are desirable. The former might stunt incentives to work hard, study or take risks, meaning economic growth will suffer: communist economies are a case in point. The latter might imply perpetuation of inequality across generations, where people who do not work or study still remain on the top of the pyramid thanks to the wealth of their parents, while those with talents are stuck at the bottom because they cannot pay for school, for example.  is, broadly speaking, a good example of this extreme.So the objective is to find out what types of inequalities may be good for growth (for example, inequality due to differential effort) and what are not (inequality due to gender, race or parental wealth).Finally, we need to look at the relationship between inequality and politics. In every political system, even a democracy, the rich tend to hold more political power. The danger is that this political power will be used to promote policies that further cement the economic power of the rich. The higher the inequality, the more likely we are to move away from democracy toward . The implicit theme in all three reasons is that nuances are important. In each case, we are dealing with a continuum: justification of inequality is not black or white, and nor are our conclusions about its effect on growth or democracy. There is also a spillover from one sphere to another: suppose that more equality is good for democracy, but bad for economic growth of the poor. How do we work around these trade-offs?Such problems are not likely to be solved theoretically, nor once and for all. They will have to be dealt with empirically. And this is why the new and up-and-coming areas of inequality studies will benefit enormously from .The current interest in inequality should be seen as an important instance of the general growth of interest in heterogeneity of phenomena, as opposed to our hitherto almost exclusive focus on averages (such as GDP per capita and the ), ※representative agents§ and the like. As often happens in history, this interest has fortuitously coincided with much greater availability of data to study such heterogeneity. Let me conclude with the four areas where I think this rising interest and ability to address difficult questions leads us to expect most progress:"															
"The housing market continues to defy fears of a post-referendum slump after sellers＊ asking prices hit a new record high of more than ?313,000 on average in April.Across England and Wales, the average price tag on a property being put on the market increased by ?3,547 每 or 1.1% month-on-month 每 to reach ?313,655. The figures were released by property website Rightmove, whose records go back to 2002. It said the average asking price in April surpassed a previous high of ?310,471 reached in June 2016. Some economists have forecast static prices this year of 2% at most in response to a squeeze on disposable incomes from rising inflation and slowing wages growth. But others have argued the failure to increase the housing stock will keep prices increasing at nearer 5%.Rightmove said strong numbers of house sales being agreed 每 at levels not seen since before the credit crunch 每 have helped to keep pushing asking prices upwards. Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said there were signs of a ※strong spring market§, which should help to offset any jitters in the market before the general election on 8 June. , Rightmove said, after changes to previously generous tax rules deterred buy-to-let investors from competing for similar homes. Asking prices in this market are up by 6.5% year-on-year, with the typical price tag on a first-time property 每 one with up to two bedrooms 每 now at a record high of ?194,881. Across all sectors, asking prices are up by 2.2% year-on-year across England and Wales. Rightmove said the annual pace of asking price growth had generally slowed and was now at its lowest since April 2013. London and the north-east were the only regions in the study where average asking prices were lower than a year ago. In the capital they were downl 1.5% annually, at ?636,777 on average, while in the north-east they were down 0.7%, at an average of ?150,350.Eastern England has seen the strongest growth over the last year, with a 5.3% uplift taking the average property price there to ?349,269. The West Midlands reported the next strongest, with a 5% increase pushing average prices to ?215,784. In Wales, they were up by 4% year-on-year to reach ?186,172 on average. Shipside said the number of sales being agreed was the highest for this time of year since 2007. Last year, the chancellor gave a year＊s notice of phased reductions . First-time buyers appear to have been the main beneficiary, though a higher rate of stamp duty on second homes, which came into effect this month, also had the effect of spurring sales to people from purchasing an additional property.Shipside said: ※Strong buyer activity this month has led to 10% higher numbers of sales agreed than in the same period in 2016. This large year-on-year disparity should be viewed cautiously as the comparable timespan in 2016 saw a drop in buy-to-let activity with the additional second home stamp duty.§But he said the figures for agreed sales were also up by 3.8% when compared with two years ago.

"or many years, the idea that a government of the right should have an industrial policy was heresy. The state＊s role was to keep inflation and taxes low, then stay out of the way so that market forces could operate. Ronald Reagan summed up the philosophy when he said the nine most dangerous words in politics were: ※I＊m from the government and I＊m here to help.§The idea that Reagan pursued a form of pure laissez-faire is, of course, nonsense. Plenty of US firms reaped the benefits of vastly increased defence spending in the 1980s, a form of military Keynesianism, that had plenty of technological spin-offs.Similarly, all Conservative governments in Britain have an industrial strategy, even if they are not always prepared to confess as much. Margaret Thatcher based hers on inward investment and the City of London. Ted Heath was as likely as Harold Wilson to bail out a lame duck. Michael Heseltine was a powerful business secretary in John Major＊s government, eager for the UK to be at the cutting edge of the new industries then emerging.So when  calls for an industrial strategy to help deliver a ※stronger economy and a fairer society§, she is saying nothing new or radical. She is part of a tradition that stretches back to Neville Chamberlain＊s industrial interventionism as chancellor in the 1930s and beyond.The prime minister sketched out her vision for a more active role for the state in the foreword to the  每 Building our Industrial Strategy 每 published three months ago. The consultation period ends on Monday and will influence a white paper from the business secretary, Greg Clark.May＊s idea of trying to build a cross-party consensus around an industrial strategy is sensible. Britain＊s problem has never been the lack of a plan. There have been plenty of those down the decades. Nor were all the plans useless, although some of them were. Rather, there has been too much chopping and changing, a failure to stick at anything for long. Ministers regularly deliver lectures about the need to eschew short-termism but hardly lead by example.As the , Clark＊s three predecessors in the decade before he got the job all had a different industrial strategy. ※From 2008, [Peter] Mandelson looked to use his department to rebalance the economy away from one focused heavily on financial services. He called for a ＆new activism＊ and ＆targeted intervention＊ for government to invest to support particular enterprises. ※After 2010, [Vince] Cable sought to use government to support themes such as skills, technological development and creating conditions for investment and growth. After 2015, [Sajid] Javid also sought to distance himself from his predecessor, setting out a far more deregulatory and small-state role for government.§ That Germany would have three different industrial strategies in so short a time is unimaginable.So what could be done to prevent May＊s ※modern§ industrial strategy failing in its promise and before too long being supplanted by the latest fad?One approach would be to learn from the process that led to the adoption of the UN＊s  in 2015. The SDGs are not perfect, but they provide a template for how the government could turn its lofty aspirations into something more concrete.It sounds obvious, but the first thing to do is to identify the problem. In the case of the UN, it was that too many people were living in poverty despite a growing global economy. May＊s motivation is not that different. The economy should work for the many not the few.Second, break the problem down into its component parts. There are 17 individual SDGs 每 such as tackling hunger and ensuring universal access to clean water 每 which are further broken down into more than 160 targets.The government＊s industrial strategy green paper is candid about some of the UK economy＊s failings: its weak investment record; the poor level of skills and regional disparities that mean 61% of people live in areas with incomes 10% below the national average. Only two cities outside London 每 Bristol and Aberdeen 每 have productivity above the national average.That＊s the easy bit. It＊s proved much harder to raise investment levels - Britain has ranked in the lowest 25% of all rich countries in the OECD for investment in 48 out of the last 55 years - to improve skills, and to close the north-south divide. If the government has a role in trying to tackle these issues, and May is clear that she thinks it does, then Britain needs Industrial Strategy Goals. These should be limited in number, 17 is too many. Dame Kate Barker is chairing the -industrial strategy commission, set up to keep tabs on the Government＊s plan as it evolves. Third, set a date for the targets to be reached. In the case of the SDGs, the UN has given itself 15 years, which is a testing but realistic deadline provided action is not delayed.By 2030, Britain will be in the middle of a robot revolution and the industrial strategy should reflect that. .※The government is developing an industrial strategy which calls for employer-led sector deals to boost productivity and skills. But so far, efforts have focused on high-skill, high productivity, hi-tech export sectors such as automotive and aerospace,§ it said.Fourth, build as big a consensus around the plan as possible. In the case of the SDGs, governments, civil society, the private sector and the multilateral organisations all signed up. Getting everybody inside the tent took effort, but it is vital.One of the reasons Germany＊s industrial strategy has been successful is that the government, business and unions all agree with its broad principles. There would be no change of direction were Angela Merkel to be ousted as chancellor this autumn.: ※To be effective, we believe that any industrial strategy needs consistent application over a long period, probably to be measured in decades rather than years.§ In Germany that would not need to be spelled out.Finally, the industrial strategy goals should have independent monitoring of the progress made, or the lack of it. The government should take its industrial targets as seriously as its fiscal targets, with an independent watchdog created along the lines of the Office for Budget Responsibility. If the industrial strategy is as important as May says it is, ministers should not be allowed to mark their own homework."															
"※Historic§, ※massive§, ※phenomenal§.  has pulled out all his increasingly tired superlatives to describe his plans for reforming the byzantine and bonkers US tax system. Well, good luck with that.As he ponders his next move at Mar-a-Largo this Easter weekend, Trump will do well to remember that tax reform has a way of leaving a president with egg on his face. It＊s not without reason that no commander-in-chief has achieved it since Ronald Reagan, in 1986. Reagan, wildly popular, didn＊t pass tax reform until his second term and it took 10 tense months to pull it off. Trump, who is wildly unpopular and has  most of the people who would do the heavy lifting on tax reform, wants it done by summer. Say what you like about Trump, he doesn＊t lack ambition.When he accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976, Jimmy Carter (the anti-Trump) called the US tax code ※§. ※All my life I have heard promises about tax reform,§ he said, ※but it never quite happens. With your help, we are finally going to make it happen. And you can depend on it.§ Forty years on, the federal tax code covers close to 75,000 pages, 187 times longer than it was a century ago. The main problem, according to Cato Institute senior fellow , is that tax reform lies at the heart of Washington＊s quagmire. ※The tax code isn＊t just part of the Washington swamp,§ Tanner wrote recently. ※It  the swamp.§But to hear it from the Trump camp, tax is easy. After the failure to ※repeal and replace§ Obamacare, treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin recently told a group of financial journalists: ※Healthcare is a very, very complicated issue. In a way, [tax reform is] a lot simpler. It really is.§ Few beyond the Trumposphere would agree. But don＊t worry, dear reader. As Richard Rubin, the Wall Street Journal＊s tax wonk, , while tax policy is labyrinthine, tax reform stories are actually simple. In fact, there are only four: ※It＊s hard§, ※What does X mean for reform?§, ※What does reform mean for X?§, ※Check out weird tax thing§.When it comes to taxes, though, we＊re all in favor of simplification. Right? So let＊s cut Rubin＊s Rules down to two: ※Why is it hard?§ and ※What does X mean for reform?§ Those are the two questions that, in the weeks to come, will keep the president padding through the corridors of power, into the wee small hours.The White House needs a big win after its over healthcare reform. In principle, everyone agrees that the US needs tax reform. The Tax Foundation＊s  of tax competitiveness ranked the US a dismal 31st out of the 35 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries it measures. (If you really want simple taxes, move to Estonia or New Zealand). While everyone in Congress would like to see that score improve, no one agrees how.  is to cut taxes on middle-class Americans, reduce business taxes and simplify the tax code. Three tax bands will replace the current seven, with the threshold for paying tax rising and the top rate falling. Tax cuts that add to the national debt 每 that are not ※revenue neutral§ 每 have to expire after 10 years. Tax reform is more ambitious and Trump must balance the books in order to get it passed. In order to do so he has proposed cutting loopholes for the super-rich and corporations 每 including, perhaps, the  loophole used by billionaire hedge funders. A one-off 10% tax on repatriating the $2.5tn corporations have sitting in cash sitting overseas would pay for some cuts, as would a controversial ※border adjustment§ tax on imported goods.But even if Trump can get his pluses and minuses to balance out, the plan has to pass Congress. Democrats, hoping for a second major Trump fail, won＊t give the president any votes, not least because an  of Trump＊s plan by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center concluded it would  the biggest tax cuts, with about half of the benefits going to the top 1%.Among Republicans too, tax reform is a knotty issue. The proposed border tax has  managed the unusual feat of uniting Paul Ryan, the House speaker, and , Trump＊s top strategist. The tax would raise $1tn in revenue over 10 years, paying for other cuts and incentivizing US manufacturing (or so Trump argues) over overseas production. It also contains the word ※border§, which should appeal to his isolationist base.But treasury secretary Mnuchin and economic adviser Gary Cohn are against the tax, as are business leaders who argue it will effectively translate into a tax on consumers as retailers and others pass costs on to buyers. Even for Republicans, tax cuts for the rich paid for by price hikes at Walmart might prove a tough sell as the midterm elections approach.Then there are the special interest groups and their pet politicians who will be fighting to keep their tax breaks while lobbying for new ones they＊d like. Rewriting 75,000 pages of tax code will create a feeding frenzy of opportunity.※Tax cuts are easy, tax reform is hard,§ says Maya MacGuineas, president of the , a bipartisan and nonprofit organization that studies the impact of fiscal policy.Even with the national debt now marching its way to $20tn (a credit card debt of more than ) MacGuineas said she saw little sign that politicians were making the tough choices needed to pass true tax reform.※We are in a period of giveaways and politicians are reluctant to talk about hard choices,§ she said.Where X equals the Affordable Care Act, the answer is everything. Politically, Trump＊s failure to make good on his promise to repeal and replace Barack Obama＊s signature healthcare policy makes passing any new and major legislation both more important and more difficult. The rightwing Freedom Caucus played chicken with Trump＊s health plans and Trump was the first to blink. His threats of retaliation look about as convincing as those of an overweight school bully who finds his ※victim§ has a blackbelt in jiu-jitsu. The Freedom Caucus now knows it can hold out for the tax policies it likes and will likely derail any plan that appeases the moderates.Financially, the failure to repeal Obamacare also gives Trump a tax headache. Trumpcare (aka the American Health Care Act) could have Americans their health insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office, while handing  over the next decade to those with incomes of $1m or more by axing new taxes created under Obamacare, according to the non-partisan It would also have shaved $337bn off the federal budget over the next decade. If Trump＊s tax plans are to remain revenue neutral, and they will have to placate the Republican＊s deficit hawks, Trump will have to find other ways to make up that saving. He will also be under pressure to shoehorn those tax breaks back in to the tax reform package.He has pledged to go back for a second run at healthcare but to do so while tackling tax reform would risk creating a tsunami of wonk that could drown an administration that so far has shown little patience for the details.The net result of this swamp-a-thon? The grand plan will collapse and Republicans will eventually pass a 10-year tax cut for the rich, said Cato＊s Tanner. ※They are not going to just come out and say they want tax cuts for the rich,§ he said. ※Tax reform sounds so much more noble.§ But in the end? ※I don＊t think they really care about paying for those tax cuts.§"															
"Worries that the UK economy is losing steam have been strengthened by news of a housing market slowdown, a drop in industrial output and the weakest performance for a year by the construction industry.Economists on Friday said there was growing evidence that the UK economy slipped down a gear as it entered the new year, following a strong finish to 2016 that had confounded the doomsayers predicting a post-Brexit-vote slump.Now, 10 months on from the vote to leave the EU, economic indicators point to strains on companies from higher costs as the pound＊s slump makes imported materials and fuels more expensive. Consumers, the main driving force of UK economic growth, are also under pressure from , with signs they are becoming less willing to spend in shops, restaurants and bars.The  for February painted a picture of economic growth easing after the robust 0.7% expansion in the final three months of 2016. The Office for National Statistics said: ※Today＊s data show that overall UK economic activity was relatively subdued in February, following strong growth across the headline industries at the end of 2016.§The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said growth probably slipped to 0.5% in the first quarter, based on its its analysis of the latest official figures.※A key component of this moderation has been relatively weak retail sales in the first two months of this year. Consumption is expected to moderate further this year as increasing inflation erodes households＊ purchasing power,§ said James Warren, research fellow at the thinktank.As a result, the Bank of England would likely ignore rising price pressures from the weak pound in favour of shoring up growth and be in no hurry to raise interest rates from their , he added.The ONS figures will disappoint commentators who hoped a boost to exports from the weak pound would offset the slowdown in consumer spending as households grapple with the double whammy of . The Bank＊s governor, Mark Carney, said on Friday there were signs that strong consumer demand was ※coming off slowly§. ※That＊s what we expect but we＊ll monitor it and ensure that we chart the right path,§ he added at an event in London.The pound is down about 17% against the dollar and 11% against the euro since the referendum, making UK goods and services significantly cheaper to overseas buyers. A pound was worth just under $1.24 on Friday as the downbeat economic figures prompted investors to downgrade the UK＊s prospects.There has been  but the latest trade figures showed Britain＊s deficit for goods and services trade widened in February as exports fell and imports rose.The deficit on goods alone widened to ?12.5bn from ?12bn in January and was significantly deeper than the ?10.9bn forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. The ONS cautioned, however, that the widening was mainly down to an increase in imports of erratic goods, a category that includes big items such as ships and aircraft and those with irregular trading patterns such as precious stones and gold.Its figures for industrial production showed output fell by 0.7% in February as warmer weather knocked household energy demand. That drop defied economists＊ forecasts of a 0.2% rise. Within the industrial sector, manufacturing output dipped 0.1%, also missing forecasts for a 0.3% rise. Jack Coy at the Centre for  and Business Research consultancy said there was still a good chance manufacturing could help shore up the wider economy this year. ※Boosted by increased competitiveness from the weaker pound, manufacturers are enjoying bright prospects and strong order books. Furthermore, the exchange rate effect is likely to be magnified by strong demand in key export markets,§ he said.Figures for the construction sector showed that output fell 1.7% in February on the back of weaker infrastructure work and housebuilding. It was the biggest drop for almost a year and worse than forecasts for output to hold steady. The ONS said monthly construction figures were prone to swings and it noted three-month on three-month figures showed output continued to rise. There were also fresh signs of a housing market slowdown as Halifax, Britain＊s biggest mortgage lender, reported house prices were rising at their slowest annual pace for almost four years. They were up 3.8% in the three months to March compared with a year earlier. ※It＊s now incontrovertible that the housing market has slowed sharply this year, indicating that the monetary policy committee＊s interest rate cut in August provided only a temporary stimulus to demand,§ said Samuel Tombs at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics."															
															
"The  added just 98,000 jobs in March as a cold snap, a government hiring freeze and a faltering retail sector appear to have put the chill on Donald Trump＊s promise to boost hiring.The jobs market had got off to a flying start in 2017, adding an average of 236,500 jobs a month. February＊s jobs report was the first under Trump and was seized upon by the president as evidence that his promise to bring back US manufacturing jobs was coming true.Only two days ago the president took to Twitter to post: ※JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!§ and list the hiring decisions of major US firms since his election.Economists had been expecting the economy to add 180,000 jobs in March but a combination of factors appear to have stalled the growth in the jobs market.March saw snowstorms sweep across much of the eastern seaboard, which may have slowed hiring. Construction jobs rose by 6,000 in March, down from a gain of 59,000 in February. And in late January, Trump ordered a civilian government hiring freeze, calling for no vacant federal positions to be filled and none to be created until his budget director has drawn up a long-term cost-cutting plan. That decision will only now be filtering into the jobs figures.Retailers lost 30,000 jobs in March as many of its biggest names announced plans to shut stores in the face of online competition. In the past several months,  has announced it will close 63 stores; , 150; , 250; , 120; , 60; , 104; , 60; , up to 140.There was some good news. The unemployment rate declined to 4.5%, the lowest rate in a decade, and average hourly earnings rose 2.7%, or 68 cents, from a year earlier. But the numbers came as a shock to Wall Street, where investors were already rattled by Trump＊s airstrikes in Syria.Marcus Bullus, trading director at MB Capita, said: ※The March non-farm payrolls number was a phenomenal miss and will add to market uncertainty following the Syria missile strikes. Very few traders saw this one coming.§But other economists warned not to read too much into one month＊s figures. ※Although job growth slowed in March, and was much weaker than expected, the labor market remains in good shape. Job growth this year is running close to last year＊s pace, and is running well ahead of what is needed to keep up with labor force growth,§ said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher.The government figures came a day after ADP, the US＊s largest private payroll company, released its latest monthly survey. Private companies added 263,000 jobs in March, according to the report compiled by ADP and Moody＊s Analytics, far higher than the 185,000 analysts had been expecting.Most of the growth was in small businesses, which added 118,000 jobs. Goods-producing industries, including construction and manufacturing, added 82,000 jobs. ※Job growth is off to a strong start in 2017,§ Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody＊s Analytics, said in a statement. ※The gains are broad-based but most notable in the goods producing side of the economy including construction, manufacturing and mining.§"															
"The  has given financial firms a deadline of 14 July to explain how they are planning for the UK＊s departure from the EU and warned them to be ready for all possible outcomes, including a hard Brexit.The Bank wrote to hundreds of banks, insurers and other financial firms on Friday ordering them to get contingency plans in place. The move follows prime minister Theresa May＊s triggering of article 50 last week, formally launching the  process.Bank governor Mark Carney said central banks and financial firms should be planning for ※all eventualities§  (pdf).A key concern for financial firms is whether the UK will still hold the passporting rights that allow British-based banks and insurers to do business with the rest of the EU after Brexit. Some companies have already unveiled plans to move jobs and operations out of the UK and the Bank is now calling on all those with cross-border activities between the UK and the rest of the EU to report back by 14 July.Sam Woods, the Bank＊s deputy governor for prudential regulation and head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, wrote in Friday＊s letter: ※Many firms are well-advanced in their planning and have engaged closely with the PRA as part of that process. However, our current assessment is that the level of planning is uneven across firms and plans may not be being sufficiently tested against the most adverse potential outcomes.§Carney said the main purpose of the letter was to ensure ※all firms are making, and stand ready to execute in good time should the need arise, contingency plans for the full range of possible scenarios§.As the UK and EU governments prepare for tough Brexit negotiations, Carney used his speech to challenge those who want to cut the UK＊s access to the rest of . He urged politicians not to give in to protectionism on banking rules but to keep an open financial system.Highlighting what he believes is at stake if Brexit results in the City being cut off from the rest of Europe, Carney sought to portray London as a key part of the global financial system and reiterated his earlier claim that ※London is Europe＊s investment banker§.He said that repair work to the financial system since the global crisis had made it safer, simpler and fairer and that the UK had gone beyond the minimum global standards, meaning others could rely on it as a ※pillar of strength for the international monetary and financial system§. But, describing Brexit negotiations as a ※litmus test for responsible financial globalisation§, Carney suggested such gains were now at risk.※A decade of hard fought financial reform creates enormous opportunities,§ Carney said in a speech at Thomson Reuters in London＊s Canary Wharf on Friday. ※It is all too easy to give into protectionism, but the road less taken is often the most rewarding.§He made his case for an open financial system by describing a high road and a low road. ※We are at a fork in the road,§ Carney said. ※One path builds on the foundations of a new responsible global financial system that are being put in place ＃ The high road leads to more jobs, higher sustainable growth, and better risk management across the G20,§ he added, referring to the G20 group of mainly rich nations.※But there is another path 每 the low road 每 where trust and cooperation diminish, fragmentation hardens, capital flows are disrupted, and trade and innovation are curtailed.§The low road would be ※sub-optimal for all, with fewer jobs, lower growth and higher domestic risks§, he added.Carney has previously warned that . On Friday, he reiterated that more than half the equity and debt raised for European governments and business was raised in the UK.Carney called for the EU and UK to agree on rules to ensure money can continue to flow easily between countries, but he said he was not demanding a deal for financial services that was separate from a wider trade deal.※We fully recognise that the negotiations around financial services are one sliver, albeit an important sliver, but a sliver of a much wider set of discussions that the UK and the EU have just embarked upon,§ he said. Carney described the EU and UK as already ※ideally positioned to create an effective system of deference to each other＊s comparable regulatory outcomes, supported by commitments to common minimum standards and open supervisory cooperation§.Worries about a hard Brexit that leaves UK-based financial firms with little access to the EU have forced many companies to . That in turn has prompted warnings about a blow to tax revenues for the exchequer and to the UK＊s economic growth prospects.The insurers Lloyd＊s of London and Royal London are setting up subsidiaries outside the UK, while the investment banks JP Morgan and  are actively exploring the relocation of key operations.

"rexit, according to its cheerleaders, offers British businesses the chance to expand trade beyond Europe to the rest of the world. Trade minister Liam Fox infamously said the easy option of shipping goods across the Channel had deterred businesses large and small from looking further afield. They had become , and now they would be forced to be more entrepreneurial.Setting aside the reasons why countries all over the world mostly export to their neighbours (it＊s cheaper, and there are shared histories and cultures) and try to do so within free-trade blocs (profits are higher when tariffs are low and regulations are harmonised). let＊s consider the question of how fat and lazy business has become. Is it ready to accept Fox＊s challenge?One way of making an assessment is to examine the health of exporting hubs around the UK, and the readiness of employers and their workers for the task ahead.In just over a month, local elections in Britain will include votes for six directly elected mayors of combined local authorities, a new layer of local government. This has prompted the Office for National Statistics to pull together figures covering the new areas, from the Liverpool City Region and Greater Manchester combined authorities in the north to the west of England, and the odd couple of the Cambridge and Peterborough combined authority in the east.There will be six new authorities. Leeds, Newcastle and Sheffield failed to make the cut. , which from 4 May will have a ?1.1bn budget to spend on improving local transport and skills.As an economy, the West Midlands should be revving its engines quietly in readiness for Brexit. But the  that few would expect, especially when it lays claim to have the UK＊s second city at its heart, with hi-tech manufacturing to rival the German Ruhr.One basic measure of economic readiness is the percentage of people in employment. The national average is 73.9%. Of all the combined authorities, the West Midlands has the lowest at 65.1%. It also comes at the bottom of the pile on the ONS measure of labour productivity, with output per hour lower than in Manchester, Liverpool and the rest.One explanation for the low productivity figures might be found in the education sector, where the West Midlands achieves another low. According to the ONS, it has more than three times the average share of population with no qualifications, and a relatively low proportion of residents with a degree-level qualification.The West Midlands, a centre for traditional engineering and manufacturing industries, also has the worst female employment rate of the six authorities. Whatever the reasons, the lack of female participation in the workforce has a significant knock-on effect on average household disposable incomes, which are also the lowest of the six combined authorities.The conclusion must be that none of these tests finds Britain＊s industrial heartland in good shape and ready for the brave new world of .Champions of the region argue there are large pockets filled with hi-tech manufacturing, and that companies in the services sector can claim to be among the best in the country. Jaguar Land Rover and the aerospace firm Moog boast stellar productivity rates, while areas such as Sutton Coldfield are solidly wealthy and stuffed with highly paid graduates.It＊s certainly true that the average figures for the region are dragged down by the districts of Sandwell and neighbouring Dudley, which have struggled for years with little private investment or government support. Wolverhampton up the road now has a respected university, but this investment in higher education has so far done little to affect youth unemployment in that city.Another factor depressing the region＊s figures can probably be found in the number of skilled workers with productive jobs who would boost the ONS figures if only they lived inside the authority＊s boundaries, rather than in leafy Warwickshire and Shropshire villages.But that says much about the failures of policymakers. It says that , as the region＊s driving force, wasted the Millennium money thrown at it by Gordon Brown in the 10 years before the financial crash in a way that Leeds, Newcastle, Manchester and Liverpool didn＊t. Sadly, Birmingham＊s leaders were unable to construct a living city with a public transport system that knitted the region together.And it shows that the mayor will need more money than is currently on offer, especially when another 10?years of austerity was the main course on  menu. Council chiefs spend most of their time firefighting to protect the most vulnerable citizens, not debating how to copy London＊s cycleways. The combined authority＊s ?1.1bn budget is spread over 30 years. That will leave local businesses to play a bigger role 每 investing not just in their own plant and machinery, but also in the local infrastructure.Do they have the means at a time of extra costs from the apprenticeship levy, higher business rates and the uncertainty that comes with Brexit? It＊s a tall order."															
"ould it be 2005 and 2006 all over again? Industry figures last week showed that UK credit-card debt has soared . Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, data shows that late last year car loans were being taken out at a faster rate than any time in US history.Almost everyone in America leases a car or buys it using cheap credit. Except that they don＊t take the opportunity to lower their outgoings and cut their monthly loan bills. Instead, they take the cheap credit and buy a bigger car. A much bigger car.This applies as much to those on low incomes as the wealthy. And the same trend can be seen in the UK.In 2008 it was the mortgage sector in the US that triggered the worst global financial crash since 1929. US house buyers on low incomes were sold homes by lenders using teaser rates that offered massive discounts for two or three years on standard fixed rates. Refinancing was easy as long as the base rate remained low.Once the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, it become financially crippling to refinance a mortgage and arrears began to creep upwards.By 2006, millions of American families were in financial trouble and by 2008 hundreds of thousands were handing the keys of their homes back, leaving the banks with huge debts on their balance sheets.Today the US central bank is again raising interest rates, and the jump in credit costs is hitting the finances of low-income families, forcing them into arrears or to default on their loans.But the situation is very different to 2008 and even the years leading up to it. Car loans are an important component of the credit market, but are still dwarfed by home loans. As such, it is unlikely that dodgy car-loan books will see the big lenders getting themselves in such deep trouble.The lenders, and especially the big banks, have much bigger reserves, giving them deeper pockets when the times comes to cover their losses.The regulators are also alive to a problem they blatantly ignored ahead of the last crash.Last November, the New York Federal Reserve bank warned that arrears in the sub-prime car-loan sector were a ※§. The Bank of England has also voiced concern about rising household debts levels and last week promised a review of banks＊ lending standards.It is likely that the cause of the next crash will come from a dark corner of the financial services industry that regulators believe is insignificant until it whacks them on the nose. But, at least for now, they are not the complacent animals of yesteryear and will snap at the big financial firms to keep their practices in order.Another detail from 2008 that is absent in 2017 is the role of credit agencies, which ranked the worst sub-prime loans as triple-A in 2005 and 2006. These days the regulators have more realistic data to hand.There are also quirks in the official figures that give a false picture of consumers＊ financial position. For instance, the official figures show a collapse in the savings rate is to a significant degree the result of pension funds switching funds out of risky assets and into safer ones following the Brexit vote.This depresses the incomes of pensioners＊ funds and drags down the savings rate, but is a technical issue and?doesn＊t indicate that pensioners are on a spree, suddenly spending all their savings.Nonetheless, the regulators need to remain vigilant. Even low rates of default can ripple through the financial system. And should a crash be avoided in the UK, it could still happen in the US, where a Donald Trump inspired credit boom is predicted by many 每 with an accompanying hangover.Of all the warnings that pro-Brexit voters chose to ignore last June, the notion that planes might cease to link this island to the continent barely figured on the Project Fear register. Nine months on, with the pound depressed, food prices up, and article 50 triggered, it might be worth hesitating a little longer when Ryanair repeats that there is a  for a period when Brexit happens.Of course, Europe＊s biggest airline has form when it comes to courting publicity, and many of its chief executive＊s wider views on politics come across as headline-hunting exercises. But the Irish airline has a finely tuned sense for aviation agreements, and an ear for blarney, through its disputes with the European commission and its navigation of local employment and taxation laws. So it is worth noting that it has not been impressed by the Department for Exiting the EU＊s promises to prioritise airlines＊ concerns.The clock is ticking on Britain＊s two-year separation, but as  points out, its own flight schedules need to be fixed a year before that, effectively doubling the speed of Britain＊s dash into turbulence. And many of Britain＊s international flying rights do not exist outside the EU: there is no fallback agreement.The idea of grounded planes sounds preposterous to British ears; less so to continental airlines and governments, which might appreciate a new competitive advantage. More likely is that in 12 months＊ time Britain will face either the further relocation of Ryanair routes 每 and some of easyJet＊s 每 or have to accept Europe＊s terms for associate membership of its common aviation area.However, with flights to Europe accounting for two-thirds of all UK air traffic, March 2019 could bring plane-free skies not seen since Eyjafjallaj?kull exhaled its ash in 2010. Such a scenario remains unlikely, because surely a deal will be reached. But the very possibility will make Remainers shake their heads in wonder. Britain has the largest aviation industry in Europe, and to preserve it, ministers must now beg and wheedle to reclaim its rights, which they have just signed?away.Don＊t envy Jim Gianopulos, .

"Karen Millen is used to seeing her name in lights. With 400 outlets spread across 65 countries, there is even a store that bears the Kent-born designer＊s name in Mongolia.But last week Karen Millen, the woman, became famous all over again for the wrong reasons, after suffering the humiliation of being declared bankrupt over an unpaid tax bill.Until the public airing of her financial difficulties, Millen had appeared to be living a fashion fairytale. She had grown up in a council house on a Maidstone estate but had become a millionaire many times over by the time she was in her 30s, after the eponymous fashion label she had started with her husband  was sold for ?95m at the height of the retail boom that preceded the last recession.But despite receiving ?35m for her share of the business 每 a blockbuster deal that involved Millen signing away the rights to use her own name 每 the rags-to-riches story returned to rags in the high court after she failed to hand over an estimated ?6m that HM Revenue and Customs said it was owed. Millen told the  her accountants had advised her to use a tax planning scheme, the validity of which was successfully challenged by HMRC in 2010.Millen has not designed clothes for the company that bears her name for well over a decade, yet she remains forever yoked to the business that she started with Stanford in 1981, when she was just 19. ※When I hand over my credit card, people will often say: ＆How funny, you have the same name as the shop,＊§ she said in a recent interview.The enterprising couple got the business off the ground with a ?100 loan and used the money to buy bolts of cotton with which to make the crisp white shirts that would be their early bestsellers. The first store opened two years later and by the time they  retailing a sexy look of tight-fitting dresses and Versace-style bustiers that was firmly plugged in to the fashion zeitgeist.In the 13 years since Millen sold the company, she has appeared to be living in a bubble, dividing her time between her three children and charity fundraising. She celebrated her 50th birthday by throwing a 1930s-themed party on the Orient Express for close friends that included the models Kelly Brook and Caprice and the entrepreneur Jacqueline Gold. In interviews Millen, who was appointed an OBE for services to fashion in 2008, was often snapped posing by the swimming pool of her immaculate Georgian mansion, which boasted a football pitch and lake. It is now expected to be sold.Millen says she is ※devastated§ by bankruptcy but blames Kaupthing, the collapsed Icelandic bank that backed the 2004 deal, rather than her own financial decisions for her current woes. Her story is a stark reminder of the noughties＊ high street boom, fuelled by the expansion of Icelandic banks, that would go spectacularly bust during the credit crunch.Although Kaupthing had made her rich, Millen and Stanford, whose business interests remained linked despite their divorce in 2001, suffered heavy losses after the bank failed during the 2008 banking crisis, taking many of their personal investments with it.When the couple worked together, Millen had focused on the creative side while Stanford ran the shops. ※I was never the driving force behind it,§ she told one interviewer. ※It was always Kevin. He＊s the ambitious one. I＊ve just gone along with it.§ The same approach appears to have cost her dearly when it came to investing the fortune they made together.Without the involvement of the founders the Karen Millen stores have kept on going, although the chain is having something of a midlife crisis as millennials opt for a casual look even on nights out.※The consumer has moved on,§ says Lorna Hall, retail analyst at trend forecaster WGSN. ※Fashion trends have become more casual and that has sidelined brands like Karen Millen that had a vernacular focused on getting dressed up.§The shift in the fashion landscape has led to a concerted push by Karen Millen＊s new management to shed its ※Footballers＊ Wives§ image by highlighting, among other things, that its clothes are designed at head office in London＊s trendy Shoreditch district. However, the most recent accounts available at Companies House show a loss of ?10.5m on sales of ?161m in the year to the end of February 2016, reflecting the heavy investment involved in the revamp.※I never wear the clothes,§ Millen said in a 2012 interview as she started a legal campaign to  on new designs.※Sometimes I find it a little difficult as I have no control over what they design and at times it can be a little embarrassing,§ she said, before suggesting the brand had ※somewhat stood still§ while the clothing was ※too heavily branded and overpowering§.But the action also proved an expensive mistake. Insiders pointed out she had been paid ※a lot of money§ for her name and in 2016 Millen lost 每 the judge agreed with the company that letting her use her signature elsewhere would create confusion for shoppers. The ruling left her to foot an estimated ?2m-?3m bill for both sides＊ legal costs.Millen and Stanford have pursued several legal claims against the estate of  in an attempt to recover the tens of millions they 每 and many other investors 每 lost in Iceland＊s financial meltdown. The designer says the last nine years have been ※one long legal battle§ that has left her exhausted and ready to ※finally put the past behind me§. It seems Millen is finally letting go of Karen Millen."															
															
"The number of UK companies issuing profit warnings fell sharply in the second quarter, but experts warned there could be worse to come.According to advisory group EY, quoted companies issued 45 warnings in the three months to June, a 40% fall on the previous quarter and a third lower than this time last year. This is the biggest quarterly percentage drop since the second quarter of 2009. A stronger-than-expected global economic backdrop and falling forecasts have combined to significantly lower warnings, according to the report.But Alan Hudson, EY＊s head of restructuring for UK and Ireland, said: ※A low level of profit warnings should not lead to complacency. The reality in the market is that earnings forecasts have dipped and the economy＊s relative outperformance has enabled more companies to meet already low expectations.※Profit warnings may not rise dramatically without a shock, given that companies seem to have come to terms with passing a lower bar; but trickier conditions will catch out more companies and expose any weaknesses.§The most warnings issued during the quarter came from retailers, citing the impact of higher inflation on consumer spending. Jessica Clayton, the head of retail transaction advisory services at EY, says: ※A high number of general retailers＊ warnings is a red flag for the rest of the economy. It reflects weaker consumer confidence, a return to squeezed disposable incomes and rising concerns over the level of consumer borrowing.§Seven general retailers issued warnings, followed by six software and computer services companies and six service sector businesses.After the , three further companies have issued profit warnings, with signs that political uncertainty is slowing activity and denting confidence.Overall, a fifth of the profit warnings blamed international factors, while another fifth cited contract delays or cancellations."															
"Philip Hammond has welcomed an intervention by business leaders who  in Britain＊s departure from the European single market and customs union and said that people wanted to see a ※sensible Brexit§.The chancellor insisted he was happy to see the CBI making its voice heard, but his stance was apparently challenged by the trade secretary, Liam Fox, who said it would not be possible to indulge a ※perpetual transitional period§.Hammond also warned on Friday ※it would be madness not to seek to have the closest possible arrangement§ with Britain＊s largest trading partner and closest neighbour.※I＊m glad that the business community is exercising a voice in this discussion. I think that＊s helpful,§ Hammond said in an interview with Bloomberg and Reuters at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.He said he did not believe it would be ※legally or politically possible§ to  or customs union after Brexit 每 as that would limit the UK＊s ability to control immigration or make trade deals. But he said the benefits of the two models should be retained during a .He said: ※My preference is that we negotiate a transitional structure which takes us outside of those memberships but in the transition phase replicates as much as possible of the existing arrangements, so that the shock to business is minimised for the transition period.§ His tone contrasted that of Fox,one of the strongest proponents of  in the cabinet, who used a visit to Paris to deliver a seeming rebuke to the CBI＊s call for an indefinite delay in leaving the single market and customs union.He said it was perfectly reasonable that people should want to have some arrangements to ensure minimal disruption but added: ※We can＊t have a perpetual transitional period undermining the concept of Brexit itself.§Fox also dismissed warnings from the EU＊s chief Brexit negotiator, , that leaving the single market and customs union would carry consequences.※We＊re going into an arrangement with the EU already with zero tariffs, we＊re going there with complete regulatory equivalence and with customs systems that already work,§ he said. ※The only reason we wouldn＊t replicate them would be if politics got in the way of good economics.§Fox＊s bullish comments about the negotiations highlighted the split within the cabinet over how the government should approach Brexit. Hammond 每 the leading voice for a  within government 每 made clear that he thought there were great economic risks if the UK fails to achieve a good deal.He said: ※The thing that I remind my colleagues [about] is that if we lose access to our European markets, that will be an instant effect, overnight, and to people who are looking to us to protect jobs, economic growth, living standards, they won＊t thank us if we deliver them an instant hit with only a longer-term, slowly-building benefit to compensate. That＊s the concern that we have to have in our minds.§Asked if there was any chance that Brexit would not happen, the chancellor laughed and said: ※No. The British people have made up their minds.§But he made clear that the millions of people who did not want the UK to leave the EU were now determined that the outcome should not be economically damaging.※There＊s a significant constituency of people who voted to remain in the EU but have accepted the decision, but what they want to see is a Brexit that looks sensible to them.§He described that as a Brexit focused on protecting jobs, business, prosperity and trade, and one that recovers sovereignty for the UK but also recognises the reality of an interconnected world.※The EU will remain our largest trading partner and our nearest neighbours, and it would be madness not to seek to have the closest possible arrangement with them going forward,§ added Hammond.Hammond＊s comments came as more than 30 business leaders had a five-hour summit with the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and other ministers at the , to discuss their concerns about the direction of exit discussions with Europe. Business leaders reported that the meeting had gone ※better than expected§ and hinted at a thawing of the government position.Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers＊ organisation, said: ※This meeting has been a good first step and it＊s clear ministers are listening to business concerns, which we welcome. We had an open and frank discussion and we＊ve started a process where we will work together to obtain as much clarity and certainty as possible for industry as we prepare to leave the EU.§In a sign of the tightrope still to walk for Davis, the Chevening ※away day§ was also welcomed by some of corporate Britain＊s more ardent advocates of leaving the EU. Gerald Mason, of Tate & Lyle 每 the US-owned sugar giant which stands to benefit from Brexit and once employed Davis, said: ※It was a really positive and wide-ranging discussion about the challenges and the opportunities of Brexit and I was left encouraged by it.§But in contrast to some of the more alarmed warnings from businesses in recent weeks, the meeting seems to have gone some way to reassuring the country＊s biggest companies that the government was finally listening to their concerns on Brexit. ※It was a highly welcome and constructive engagement with government,§ said the HSBC chairman, Douglas Flint. The chancellor was not at the meeting because he is in . In his interview, he was also asked if Theresa May would still be prime minister in a month＊s time. He said: ※I＊m very confident about that. The prime minister has been very open about the fact that we didn＊t get the outcome from the election that we hoped for. But we＊ve got a job to do.§However, he appeared to acknowledge that the Conservatives＊ reputation had suffered, adding: ※In doing so we will rebuild our reputation with our public.§He argued that  每 which he claimed meant bringing together two parties from the same tradition 每 had ※created a stable base for a government which in the first session, at least, of parliament, will have quite a narrow focus§."															
"ome might say that  has landed his ideal job. As international trade secretary, his mission is to jet around the world doing a bit of meet-and-greet over dinner. Indeed, as no trade deals can be signed before Britain leaves the EU, and only the vaguest expressions of future interest can be made so long as the terms of the divorce remain unknown, the Flying Fox is rather obliged to do the bare minimum. And with lengthy transitional arrangements looking increasingly likely, the minister＊s time in office could well develop into an extended sabbatical. To his credit, the Flying Fox made little effort to imply he was finding his responsibilities in any way onerous in his first departmental questions of the new parliament. He spoke lyrically about how he had met 20 trade ministers in order to deepen relations before doing any actual work, and how he was now flat-out busy preparing for the Commonwealth summit. Choosing the wine, working out the seating plan and ordering the flowers.Fellow Conservative James Duddridge seemed to find this all very reassuring and wondered if, as well as doing trade deals with individual Commonwealth countries in Africa, it might be possible to do one mega deal with the whole of Africa. The Flying Fox sucked his teeth. He didn＊t want to put the mockers on it out of hand, but that would be a lot of work. Best to start with the Commonwealth and take it from there. After several Labour MPs observed that the government was living in cloud cuckoo land if it thought it could tie up any trade deals in the foreseeable future, the Tory Nigel Evans decided he had had enough of people having their heads filled with fake news. He was fed up with the media being so negative. Brexit was a total triumph and, , Evans thought it was about time everyone was a bit more patriotic and got behind the government. The Flying Fox agreed. ※It does appear that some elements of our media would rather see Britain fail than  succeed,§ he said. ※I cannot recall a single time in recent times when I have seen good economic news that the BBC did not describe as ＆despite Brexit＊.§ To illustrate this point, the Flying Fox read out some statistics that his department had just published showing that the UK had attracted record levels of foreign direct investment for the year 2016-17. ※No doubt the usual suspects will describe this as ＆despite Brexit＊,§ he sniped.  A few of the more committed Brexiteers murmured their approval, but most of the house just shook their heads in disbelief, amazed that a government minister seemed to have so little grasp of his own data. For what the figures also showed was that the number of new jobs created by foreign direct investment had actually fallen by 9%, while company expansions had fallen by 5% and mergers by 6%. No doubt the usual suspects would describe this as ※despite Brexit§.It was left to Labour＊s Barry Sheerman to supply the corrective. ※This frontbench team must know that this silly attack on the  cannot be used as an excuse for policy,§ he said. ※This is a secretary of state who has refused to meet the all-party parliamentary manufacturing group. The manufacturers I know have no confidence in him. They think he is is not competent, and they want his resignation.§ The Flying Fox chose to ignore this and sat down in a huff to let his junior minister face the incoming. Mark Garnier gives the impression of being rather better briefed than his boss, but even he didn＊t seem to have much idea why no one had been willing to stump up the ?1m needed to retain 300 Nestl谷 jobs in the UK. Presumably because everyone was more interested in . And it was well above his pay grade to comment on remarks by Michel Barnier, the EU＊s chief Brexit negotiator, that Britain didn＊t seem to understand . He settled for a diplomatic no comment. There was time for just one more intervention from the Flying Fox. He was proud to be wearing a British-made tie. And if more people wore British ties then Brexit would be an undoubted success. Making Britain Great Again. One tie at a time."															
" few weeks on from the general election, and David Cameron has been disinterred to say  每 while Theresa May is back to harping on in prime minister＊s questions about the debt left by the last Labour government. It＊s apparently 2015 all over again.It＊s tiresome to have to keep pointing it out, but Dave from PR was wrong then, and he remains wrong now. He was a good salesman, for sure. Pretending that ※The Deficit§ is a scary monster that will eat us unless we appease it by sacrificing our wages plays into many instinctual beliefs about the virtues of probity and thrift. But if anything, the monster in the room is the prevalence of what economist John Quiggin called ※§ 每 ideas that are constantly discredited, but insist on shambling back to life and lurching their way through our public discourse.The supposed justifications for austerity were always, Quiggin writes, ※§. The theory that government spending crowds out private sector investment never withstood scrutiny. As he points out, ※the painfully evident fact that there is already plenty of room for private expansion, in the form of unemployed workers and idle factories, is simply ignored§.The IMF 每 historically the world＊s foremost cheerleader of austerity 每 admitted that it was : these policies . Simon Wren-Lewis of Oxford University said that the issue was not whether attempts to reduce the deficit had damaged the economy, but ※§. while austerity ※deepened Europe＊s economic problems, it did not help in the aimed objective of reducing the ratio of debt to GDP to any significant extent§. Richard Portes at London Business School says that even the UK＊s sluggish growth under the Conservatives is down to the ※semi-covert§ backing away from George Osborne＊s initially brutal plans, which would have done even more harm.Paul Krugman wrote that in the post-crisis economy ※the government does everyone a service by running deficits and giving frustrated savers a chance to put their money to work ＃ deficit spending that expands the economy is, if anything, likely to lead to higher private investment than would otherwise materialise§. All this has led Joseph Stiglitz to remark that it＊s ※§.With the evidence so prolific that Cameron＊s supposed ※sound finance§ is anything but, and with battalions of respected economists lined up to denounce it (Sen, Krugman and Stiglitz are all Nobel prizewinners), why does this zombie idea keep resurrecting itself?The answer must surely lie in its political utility.

Just as austerity economics relies on the demonisation of immigrants and ※identity politics§ to mask its own crippling impact, so authentocracy relies on a false zero-sum formula where the ※white working class§ is in a battle with new arrivals for a share of a fixed pot of cash.

"The International Monetary Fund has warned leaders in the run-up to the  summit in Hamburg that they are putting at risk a recovery in global growth by pursuing national policies at the expense of internationally agreed rules on trade and climate change.In a barely veiled attack on the US president, Donald Trump, and his Russian counterpart, , who are expected to meet for the first time in the German city, the Washington-based lender of last resort said the ※myopic pursuit of zero-sum policies§ would prove damaging to all countries, including those that adopted them.Leaders of the G20 group of countries will meet on Friday amid growing concerns about the negative effects of globalisation on lower-income groups and developing countries.The IMF said the global economy was on an upswing and, in the short term, trade and GDP growth were expected to improve this year. But it warned that risks to growth remained, including from protectionist polices and a failure to cooperate in areas such as climate change.It said: ※A well-functioning multilateral framework for international economic relations is another key ingredient of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Myopic pursuit of zero-sum policies can only end by hurting all countries, as history shows.※Because national policies inevitably interact in a number of vital areas, creating strong spillovers across countries, the world economy works far better for all when policymakers engage in regular dialogue and work within agreed mechanisms to resolve disagreement,§ it said.Germany, which is chairing the G20, has mobilised thousands of police and deployed water cannon to deal with the huge  expected.The G20 was set up after the 2008 financial crash to provide a broader and more inclusive institution than the G7 group of rich states. Its membership represents about 85% of global GDP and includes Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Turkey and several European Union countries, as well as the EU being a member itself. Theresa May is expected to arrive at the summit on Friday.In a blogpost to accompany the IMF report, the body＊s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said: ※Countries need to look for ways to guard against risk, accelerate growth, and leverage the power of international cooperation. No country is an island, and policies taken by any nation can resonate stronger and last longer with coordination from the other G20 members.§Lagarde is known to be concerned that many of the imbalances in the global economy that gave rise to the 2008 financial crash have yet to be addressed, especially the disparity between those countries with huge savings and those with persistent debts.The report contrasts China, which it accuses of triggering a rapid expansion in output with , with German policies that inhibit investment in infrastructure and encourage .Lagarde is also concerned that European banks continue to lack the reserves needed to ward against another crash, and US banks will return to reckless lending under plans by Trump to loosen regulations.The report said: ※A broad rollback of the strengthening of financial regulation and oversight achieved since the crisis could lead to lower capital and liquidity buffers or weakened supervisory stances, with negative repercussions for global financial stability. ※In the medium term, failure to lift potential growth and make it more inclusive could damage social cohesion, and 每 in a self-defeating feedback loop 每 make it even harder to find the political consensus for necessary reforms.§ "															
"s Jeremy Corbyn has argued over Brexit, Labour must prioritise jobs and the economy, and that, for , means staying in the single market and the customs union 每 something the TUC and business also want.It＊s the largest, richest market in the world: with more than 500 million people, and worth ?11tn 每 fully a quarter of global GDP.

Some leave leaders  said we should stay in it, others not.Leaving would need to be followed by subsequent trade agreements 每 and not only with the remaining EU and European Economic Area member states, but also new agreements under World Trade Organisation rules with about 52 ※third countries§ outside the EU with which we have existing trade deals at present through the EU.These will take many years to negotiate: Canada＊s with the EU took seven years, and covered only manufactured goods. That＊s no good for the UK, which is an 80% service economy.Free-trade agreements do not normally cover many services, because of the complexity involved. Existing single market legislation covers: authorisation mechanisms and systems for granting licences to provide services; systems of mutual recognition of licensing requirements; commitment to common monitoring for observing standards; and a dispute resolution mechanism.Unless we stayed in the single market, any newly negotiated UK access agreement would have to be ratified by all 27 member states across more than 35 parliaments, including regional ones such as that of Wallonia in Belgium, which .The removal of non-tariff barriers with the EU (especially standards for goods and services) would be tough to negotiate, because they are numerous, complex and subject to frequent updating through amendments. EU standards for cars alone cover thousands of pages of legislation.This interim between leaving and finalising free trade deals could take years, with UK companies then facing trade barriers such as customs duties; customs procedures such as country of origin checks at borders; quotas and other quantitative restrictions; and other non-tariff barriers, including standards for goods and services.The EU ※passport§ of regulatory equivalency that EU institutions currently grant to UK banks and other financial institutions will no longer apply if we leave the single market 每 a huge threat to a sector estimated to provide 11% of Treasury revenues and 10% of GDP. Already leading banks plan to move jobs to rival financial centres such as Frankfurt, Dublin, Amsterdam or Paris.Furthermore, single market rules come with the social, environmental, health and safety standards and workers＊ and consumers＊ rights that we all take for granted. Hard-right Brexiteers see an opportunity to water down this ※red tape§, which they find an anathema.Does the single market mean uncontrolled EU migration? No. The right to free movement has never been unconditional; Belgium, for example, imposes restrictions by returning to their EU country of origin each year thousands of migrants who do not have jobs.In line with our September 2016 annual conference policy, Labour should lead the drive to remain in the single market and the customs union. There is probably now a cross-party parliamentary majority for that 每 certainly for a multi-year transitional deal that could even become permanent.

"ising inflation has been one of the big economic stories of the past year. The , such as clothes and food, dearer and the cost of living has risen steadily as a result.The drop in the was a welcome surprise. Two years ago, inflation was zero; in the month of the Brexit vote it was 0.5%. By May it had risen to 2.9%, with many City analysts confident that it would breach the 3% barrier within the next couple of months.Last month＊s fall, while much bigger than anybody in the financial markets was expecting, does not mean that inflation has reached a turning point. The coming months are likely to see some further moves upwards in the cost of living, but in the absence of a fresh fall in the value of the pound or a spike in oil prices the peak is not that far away.That will be good for consumers in two respects. Firstly, it means the squeeze on real incomes in 2017 and 2018 will be less severe and less pronounced than some have feared. Secondly, it removes the threat of an interest rate rise from the Bank of England. An August increase in the cost of borrowing, while never looking all that likely, is now off the agenda.There are still lagged effects of the fall in the pound but they are now fading. are a good guide to inflationary pressure early in the pipeline because they measure how much industry is paying for fuel and raw materials, and how much it is charging for goods when they leave factories.At their peak in January, industry＊s fuel and raw material bills were increasing at an annual rate of 19.9% but since then the rate of increase has halved to 9.9%. Similarly the cost of goods leaving factory gates was at its highest, 3.7%, in February and March but has now slipped back to 3.3%.It would be unwise, given Britain＊s issues down the years, to say inflation is a problem solved. . Workers in the UK could find a way of securing more generous pay awards. Neither, though, looks particularly likely. This is the 2010s not the 1970s."															
"he hall is a sea of pink and white. About 350 Puerto Ricans, mostly women, have come to hear their First Lady speak in what they hope will be the final push towards a new relationship between their island and the United States.When Beatriz Rossell車, the 32-year-old wife of the governor of , finally appears at the rally outside the capital San Juan, the room erupts into a frenzy of flag-waving. The American Stars and Stripes with its 50 stars, and the Puerto Rican emblem, with its single one, intertwine amid the flurry, giving the illusion that they have fused: 51 stars in a single banner of red, white and blue.Which is precisely the message that Beatriz Rossell車 wants to transmit when she manages to fight her way through the selfie-taking crowd to the microphone. ※Imagine this,§ she says in Spanish. ※Imagine that everyone agrees that it is time to take down the American flag and raise it up again with one more star for . Imagine how beautiful that would be.§Rossell車 and her supporters of the governing Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP) hope to take that spirit of unification to the polling stations on Sunday when Puerto Rico holds its fifth plebiscite on statehood in 50 years. The ambition is to deliver such a resounding cry from the island＊s 3.4 million citizens that Washington will be forced to take Puerto Rico on board as the 51st state of the United States.It is a forlorn hope, coming at a time of singular anguish for this Caribbean territory that has been an unincorporated US territory since the Spanish-American war of 1898.  that has seen its unemployment rate reach 12.4%, compared with 4.7% in the US as a whole, and its overall debt burden and pensions shortfall rise to more than $120bn.Last month, Beatriz Rossell車＊s husband Ricardo hit the nuclear button and  每 the first time in history that any US state or territory had done so. That followed the imposition last year by the US Congress of a fiscal control board that exerts federal oversight of the island＊s finances, imposing excruciating .Twenty minutes＊ drive away from the pro-statehood rally, the devastation of the past few years is laid bare at the R赤o Piedras campus of the University of Puerto Rico. The gates of the institution are padlocked and barricaded with old wooden crates and iron bars, and the tree-lined grounds are empty save for some workers clearing up rubbish.For the past 71 days students have occupied the campus in protest over cuts, terminating all its classes and turning Rio Piedras into a wasteland. Though the strike ended on Friday, the walls of the academic buildings are still festooned in strikers＊ graffiti: ※A country unemployed, a people tired 每 we must demand more,§ says one slogan. One of the strikers, Juan Collazo, 22, personifies the problems now faced by millions of Puerto Ricans. He decided to join the strike, he said, when cuts were  that, by some accounts, would slash up to $512m from the university＊s $900m annual budget, destroying its historic standing as a place of learning for thousands of poor citizens.Collazo calculates that if the cuts go ahead he will find his tuition fees rise from nothing 每 they are fully covered by federal grants 每 to $1,600 a year. That＊s an amount he says he could no way afford: jobs have all but dried up.The fallout of the financial crisis is hurting other members of his family, too. His mother has just lost her job as an elementary teacher; her workplace was one of  shuttered in the latest round of school closures. Amid such personal hardship, Collazo is left unmoved by Sunday＊s referendum on whether or not to become America＊s 51st state, in which he has no intention of participating. He calls himself an ※independista§, wanting full sovereignty for his country. He believes the vote is worse than pointless, it is manipulative: ※They are spending $8m holding this vote, and yet will the US Congress take any notice of it? No, they won＊t. This is just another attempt to divide and conquer us.§These are some of the disgruntled feelings that the governor, Ricardo Rossell車, is battling against having called the statehood vote. All opposition parties in the country have vowed to boycott the Sunday poll, further threatening its credibility.Rossell車 dismisses the boycott as a ruse on the part of the opposition to disguise their own political weakness. He says $8m is small change if it addresses the much greater cost of being a colony.※The current status is shameful,§ he says. ※It is shameful to be a colonial territory in the 21st century, and for the United States to own one. The nation that is the standard bearer of freedom and democracy should not be in this position 每 it＊s hard to go to Cuba and Venezuela and voice your support for democracy when you＊re not doing it at home.§Rossell車 speaks to the Guardian in the Throne Room, the gilded centerpiece of the 1530s governor＊s mansion known as La Fortaleza that was designed to welcome Spanish royalty. (They never showed up). The room stands as the embodiment of 500 years of colonial rule 每under Spain and then the US 每 which make it the oldest colonial territory in the world.The governor says that the melding of Spanish and American culture is a strength for Puerto Rico to embrace, not a liability to discard with independence. ※Some people will say you need to choose one over the other but I think this is a false narrative. Puerto Rico is the perfect connector of the Americas 每 the Latin American and the North American.§Even in the age of Trump? The president who has denigrated Mexican ※rapists and murderers§, promised to build a wall to keep Latinos out,  Puerto Rico＊s desire for a ※bailout§?※My view is, I don＊t know that he is anti-Latino,§ Rossell車 says with studious diplomacy. ※Obviously I＊ve heard some derogatory remarks but I don＊t know him personally, and it doesn＊t deter me.§But is there any sign that the US Congress is prepared to move an inch towards granting statehood? ※If we establish that the people of Puerto Rico want statehood and reject the current colonial status, then the nation that professes democracy is going to need to act,§ he says.Behind all this frenetic talking and disagreement is a key Puerto Rican paradox: the islanders are united at least by their unanimous obsession with the United States. You can see it in the framing of their major parties, which all define themselves in terms of their desired relationship with the mainland 每 Rossell車＊s PNP in favour of becoming the 51st state, the opposition Partido Popular Democr芍tico (PPD) broadly in favor of the status quo, and a small but influential independence party calling for a clean break.You see it with the exodus: more than 400,000 inhabitants have left the troubled island since the last status vote in 2012, overwhelmingly to the US. There are now almost 5.2 million Puerto Ricans living in the US, almost 2 million more than at home, making them an increasingly powerful voice in electorally sensitive states such as .Domestically, you see the paradox played out on the streets of San Juan, a Spanish-speaking Latin American city with US chain stores on every block. , with more than 80% of the island＊s food imported, largely from the US and all of it, by law, under the flag of the (very expensive) US merchant navy.Above all, you see Puerto Rico＊s fraught connection to the US in the strange legal context that was bestowed on its people under the terms of the 1917  that granted them US citizenship but not the federal vote. From that legislation a host of contradictions and insults have flowed.The most glaring of those is that Puerto Ricans living on the island cannot vote for US president, though if they move to one of the 50 states, they can. In short: Puerto Rico remains the awkward embarrassment of the US. America, a nation founded on the rejection of the imperial yoke continues to hold on to its own colonial outpost, 119 years after the fact.※The issue of eradicating colonialism is extremely important, not only for us as a country that＊s going through very hard times, but for the US which has been a beacon of freedom around the world, or at least has portrayed itself as that,§ says the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yul赤n Cruz. A member of the opposition PPD, she wants to see the island acquire full sovereign powers while retaining close links to the US 每 a sort of middle ground between statehood and independence.She thinks becoming the 51st state would only lock in Puerto Rico＊s dependence on its powerful overlord, which is why she＊s boycotting Sunday＊s vote. ※You don＊t fight injustice by asking to become part of the system that committed the injustice against you in the first place. That＊s like a freed slave striving to become a slave owner.§"															
"The TUC has demanded action from the government to close Britain＊s regional inequality divide after a report showed that incomes in the Midlands, Wales and the north of England are no higher than they were in the south-east two decades ago.Frances O＊Grady, the TUC general secretary, said ministers could not shrug off findings from the indicating that incomes in the most prosperous part of Britain 每 the south-east of England 每 were 25% higher than in the poorest region, the West Midlands.The IFS＊s annual living standards, poverty and inequality report highlighted Britain＊s growing  and the impact of decades of deindustrialisation on living standards in the UK＊s traditional manufacturing heartlands.The IFS said that in the mid-1970s, the east and West Midlands joined London and the south-east as the only four regions of the UK where median income was above the national average.By the mid-2010s, median income in the West Midlands was the lowest of any UK region and almost 10% below the national average. The east Midlands was 6% below the national average.The report also highlighted the concentration of hardship, with the poverty rate twice as high in the most deprived tenth of local areas as in the least deprived tenth. As a result, according to the IFS, a quarter of all poor children live in the 10% most deprived areas.Liberal Democrat welfare spokesperson Stephen Lloyd MP said: ※This report shows for the first time we are creating geographical ghettos of poverty that are trapping a generation of people and their children. ※The government, for all their talk about ＆strivers＊ and the ＆just about managing＊, are actively doing nothing to help.§The IFS said London 每 which has some of the richest neighbourhoods alongside some of the poorest 每 was the most unequal region in the UK but that inequality had fallen over the past decade as a result of falling incomes for the better-off accompanied by an increase in low-paid jobs.Since the late 2000s the incomes of those in the poorest 10th of households had risen by 10% while the incomes of those in the richest 10th of households had fallen by more than 10%.London＊s position in the national rankings varied according to whether incomes were calculated before or after housing costs. The high cost of property in the capital meant average incomes were slightly below the average for Great Britain after housing costs but 10% higher before housing costs were taken into account.Agnes Norris Keiller, a research economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: ※There are important gaps between the average incomes of different regions, though inequalities within regions are far larger than those between them. While London remains the most unequal part of the country, inequality in the capital has seen a dramatic decline over the last decade.§O＊Grady said: ※Action must be taken to close Britain＊s regional income gap. People are still missing out on the chance of decent, well-paid work because of where they live.※These findings cannot be shrugged off. Ministers need to explain how they＊ll deliver growth and boost living standards in every corner of the country. Not just wealthier parts of the capital.※The government has to get on with its much-trumpeted industrial strategy if we are to create good jobs where they＊re needed most. And they must put serious investment behind it.§A Treasury spokesman said that recent figures from the Office for National Statistics showed inequality in disposable income was lower than it had been for three decades, and the UK had the fifth lowest persistent poverty rates of the 28 countries in the EU.※We are building an economy that works for everyone by sharing prosperity and opportunity throughout the UK so nobody is held back because of where they come from§, the Treasury said. ※We have recently agreed seven devolution deals worth ?4.8bn, giving local leaders extra money and powers to create jobs, boost skills, build homes and improve local transport. Our national living wage is also helping to deliver the fastest pay rise in 20 years for the lowest-paid across our country.§"															
"How apt that a  for political writing as art (Tribute to NHS founder Clement Attlee wins Orwell prize, 16 June). Such reminders of Labour＊s totemic achievements are essential in challenging Tory doublethink. Indeed even your leader this week (, 14 June) suggested that ※in rhetorical terms, austerity has been over for a year§. Beware this Tory doublethink. Austerity is alive and kicking, harming national growth and living standards, and spreading poverty. It has fed rapacious cost-cutting, with devastating consequences 每 which fill your pages this week. The architect of this austerity, George Osborne, now London Evening Standard editor, suggests the misery should continue. He is profoundly wrong. More doublethink, I fear.In any democracy, if you impoverish the nation, you will lose the right to govern. But for this to work, we must champion the George Orwell of truth and challenge the George Osborne of austerity. The Tories＊ ideology that ※ignorance is strength§ is an ever present danger for which they should pay the ultimate electoral price."															
"Friday is the , a day dedicated to recognising the significant contribution that migrants make to the wellbeing of families back home and to the development of their countries of origin.We at the International Organization for  call for a wider and more active recognition of the many potential benefits of remittances for those who receive them, and financial inclusion for the many migrants who now form part of our community. help to cover the costs of basic needs. This includes education, housing, food and health. They also impact positively on savings, investments and job creation in communities. They represent an important safety net in times of crisis, providing critical resources which can help families cope with sudden shocks, for example a poor crop yield, or a natural disaster.The UK has a unique position to be able to help the current remittance framework. We have strong financial literacy, a healthy banking sector, a booming financial technology industry, and strong migrant and diaspora representative bodies. We need to work together to develop initiatives that can improve awareness, trust and access to low-cost and needs-based forms of money transfer for migrants. This is a win-win situation, not just for the individuals and countries receiving remittances, but also for a more financially and socially inclusive UK."															
"herever investors looked last week, the picture was rosy. The eurozone, for so long the laggard in the global growth league, could be seen zipping along following first-quarter GDP growth that hit 0.6%.German business confidence hit a record high, and France and Italy finally joined the party with higher than expected output. In the US, official estimates upgraded growth for the first quarter to an annualised 1.4% from an initial estimate of 0.7%. Even Japan, the standard-bearer for more than 20 years of economic stagnation, is due to exceed expectations this year as exports soar.The post-crash years of political upheaval and the threat of nations going bankrupt are long gone. The upbeat global outlook prompted central bankers to allow talk of a subject that has always caused turmoil on global markets whenever it is mentioned, namely higher interest rates. Last week was no exception.When Bank of England governor Mark Carney discussed how business investment, productivity and wages would soon begin to rise,  past $1.30. Investors, interpreting Carney as a not-so-secret hawk who would gladly increase the cost of credit, bought the pound in droves, pushing up its value against the dollar.Mario Draghi, the boss of the , spoke in a similar vein. He considered the day when the ECB might begin to withdraw some of the monetary stimulus that has done so much to keep the single currency and its member states afloat.The governor of the Bank of Canada joined the frenzy of hawkish comments in an interview that had him saying low rates had ※done their job§.Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, in London for a speech at the Royal Academy, pledged the US central bank to raising rates in accordance with its stated policy, despite some forecasts showing that recent growth upgrades could prove to be a false dawn.Bond dealers listened to all these comments and went into meltdown. Could it be, they asked, that the years of cheap and plentiful central bank funds were coming to an end? Within minutes a bond sell-off was in full?swing.Fortunately, a more considered position eventually held sway and the markets settled down. A closer look at Carney, Draghi and Yellen＊s comments showed that little had changed.Britain is still in the grip of uncertainty 每 political and economic 每 as the early skirmishes in a two-year battle over Brexit have clearly shown. Carney＊s almost academic discussion of when rates could rise was heavily caveated with doom about Brexit and its potential for harm. Draghi was essentially restating his existing position and Yellen was doing the same.To emphasise the point, Japan＊s central bank governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said he would maintain Tokyo＊s loose monetary policy and low interest rates for the foreseeable future.And a look at the economic data shows there is a more mixed picture than the bald GDP numbers would have investors believe. As one leading economic consultancy said, as the stock- and bond-market gyrations eased, rising inflation and sluggish wage growth, among other things, means that UK growth is expected to deteriorate this year. ※As with Draghi＊s comments, we think investors have misinterpreted Carney＊s message, and a rate hike this year is not the most likely outcome.§Meanwhile a GfK survey of UK consumer confidence fell to within touching distance of its post-referendum low, as households face a squeeze on their real incomes.Essentially, Europe still has its problems, as the Italian bank bailouts last week illustrated. The Nordic countries have high household debt ratios and the French are only at base camp in the long climb to economic credibility. These are not overheating economies that need cooling with interest rate rises. They are economies bedevilled by the legacies of the last crisis, many of which still need to be dealt?with.Whatever the fate of the east coast rail franchise, Virgin Trains has at least shown some staying power. On a line that promised easy pickings, first GNER and then National Express each lasted only 18 months before announcing they couldn＊t make it work. The present incumbent has managed two years , demanding that the Department for Transport renegotiate with preferential terms for the Stagecoach-Virgin partnership.The east coast line was reprivatised in 2015 after more than five years in the public sector. It had returned more than ?1bn in premiums to the Treasury, with dividends on top 每 a figure that Stagecoach confidently asserted it would trump. It may still do so. But the bulk of the promised ?3.3bn was due towards the end of the eight-year franchise 每 and it is already balking.What has reprivatisation brought? Some investment in customer service: ?21m spent on train interiors and ticketing innovations. But Virgin wasted no time in making passengers pay even more: its stealth rises alone doubled the average rail fare increase across Britain in 2016.Rail franchising has teetered on the brink since the fiasco that saw Virgin and Stagecoach being left to run the other London to Scotland mainline, west coast, in 2012. Genuine competition on UK railways has been the exception ever since the network was privatised.Now there is the unedifying prospect of the government funnelling more money into the pockets of two of Britain＊s richest men, Brian Souter and Richard Branson, who have made a fortune in dividends since privatisation. The DfT must not perpetuate the scandal of heads-I-win-tails-you-lose franchising, where business wants the taxpayer 每 and fare-paying passenger 每 to underwrite its losses.The government should not expend energy and money trying to bail out another private firm. Rather, it should call its bluff, harness the public mood, and nationalise east coast now.Andy Haldane, chief economist of the , made an interesting observation last week. ※For whatever reason,§ he said, ※there is far less of a social stigma attached to failings in maths than there is to reading and writing. It＊s socially acceptable not to have a head for figures, not to have a maths brain.§Haldane was speaking in his role as trustee of charity National , and he is quite right. Indeed, it can be a badge of honour to admit that a working out a percentage is too hard. Haldane, however, demonstrated his own prowess by calculating that ?8,400 of savings at a 2.5% rate of interest would generate ?210 in the first year. That was a hypothetical example, obviously, given that data from Moneyfacts shows a third of savings accounts now earn less than the 0.25% base rate. Even so, Haldane should keep banging on about numeracy."															
															
"ow we know: Royal Bank of Scotland＊s rights issue in 2008 wasn＊t a ?12bn cash call, it was a ?13bn affair. The extra ?1bn is how much Fred Goodwin＊s successors have spent settling and fighting claims from irate retail investors who thought the rights issue document was misleading., worth about ?200m, will probably bring an end to the process. One can＊t yet say so definitively, because some claimants outside the group haven＊t formally accepted, so the judge left the door ajar for a trial. But the diehards have only limited time in which to demonstrate they have the funds to continue, so a revival of proceedings is a long shot. Goodwin and three other former RBS directors can breathe more easily. They probably aren＊t going to be called as witnesses.The current chief executive of RBS, Ross McEwan, will also be relieved. He has made no secret of the fact that he regards the legal claim as a huge distraction from his day job of trying to improve RBS＊s fortunes. Fine, but he should try putting himself in the claimants＊ shoes. Most are small shareholders, and some are employees of RBS who were encouraged by former management to invest. The bank＊s abrasive tone with the claimants, and its seemingly freewheeling approach to racking up legal fees (a cool ?100m), have felt completely wrong. ※We have been very clear that putting our legacy issues behind us is a priority,§ said RBS as it described the settlement as a positive outcome. It may feel like a legacy issue for McEwan 每 but it＊s a hideous phrase to use when folk less wealthy than him are still living with the financial consequences of the UK＊s biggest banking catastrophe., chair of Santander, will be the toast of Frankfurt and Brussels. A small, but potentially nasty, crisis has been averted by the bank agreeing to buy the ※failing or likely to fail§ Banco Popular, Spain＊s sixth largest lender, for a nominal euro.For the  and the newish Single Resolution Board, it＊s a useful demonstration that a redesigned system for dispatching weak banks can do the job. Popular＊s shareholders and holders of its riskiest class of bonds get wiped out, which is what＊s meant to happen, and a troubled bank ends up in the arms of a stronger owner. Depositors are unaffected, no public money is involved, and everybody can move on.It would be harder to perform the trick in, say, Italy, where bondholders tend to be retail savers, but never mind, the Spanish example sets a good precedent that holders of lower-class IOUs can lose all their capital when a bank is in distress. Their CoCo, or contingent convertible capital, paper is called loss-absorbing for a reason.The harder part to understand, however, is why Santander is so willing to play along. It＊s true that, on paper, the numbers can be made to add up. Santander is raising 7bn (?61bn) via a rights issue to cover a 7.9bn provision for even more write-offs on Popular＊s troubled book of property loans. The prize at the end of the process is commanding market shares in  and Portugal, especially in lending to small businesses, and the chance to remove 500m from the combined cost base. The deal is expected to generate a return on investment of 13%-14% in 2020, says Santander.Will it really, though? A couple of big assumptions are being made. First, that Santander, without time to conduct a full examination, has a proper grasp on the awfulness of Popular＊s property loans. Second, that removing 500m of overheads from Popular will mean only a modest loss of customers. Both gambles could come good, especially if the Spanish economy continues to recover. Even so, on day one, this deal looks far better for the regulators than for the buyer. For Santander shareholders, the critical piece of information is the one they will not get: did Bot赤n jump to buy Popular, or was she pushed by the banking authorities?At most FTSE 100 companies, a 21% vote against the remuneration report would be a cause of embarrassment. At advertising giant WPP,  counts as a decent result. The shareholders are usually far more revolting.The chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell＊s pay packet fell from ?70m in 2015 to ※only§ ?48m last year, but that hardly explains the relative contentment. Rather, the shareholders were ambushed by WPP＊s promise in 2013 that the extravagant incentive scheme would be dismantled. But the new arrangements don＊t arrive until next year. During the transition period, Sorrell＊s winnings have been enormous, even for a successful public company. He played the long game on pay 每 and won."															
"anada＊s prime minister is a . Two years ago, Justin Trudeau＊s appointment of the country＊s  made headlines worldwide. Recently, his government has released what has been called the ※first §.But now Canada＊s own record on gender equality has been called into question by a perhaps unlikely source. The McKinsey Global Institute, a research arm of the corporate consultancy giant, has declared that the country＊s workplaces have a ※substantial gender gap§. In a , it describes tackling enduring gender inequalities at work as ※a considerable economic opportunity§ for Canada, which it predicts could add upwards of $150bn to the country＊s GDP by 2026. McKinsey＊s Tiffany Vogel  that gender equality is ※not just a moral imperative [and] not just the right thing to do 每 it＊s good business practice§.Recent  shows that for every $1 a man makes, on average a woman makes $0.74 每 in part because women are disproportionately represented in low-wage jobs, including in fast food and hotel work.A  每 most of whom are women 每 found that men earn more across all job categories, and are more likely to be offered full-time jobs or employed as managers. The gender issue pervades all levels of business: . McKinsey surveyed 69 of Canada＊s largest companies and found that fewer women were being promoted. Among these companies, women make up 45% of entry-level workers, 25% of vice-presidents and 15% of CEOs. ※The gender pay gap persists in all types of occupations, even when women are in higher-paying jobs,§ said Trish Hennessy, a director at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) thinktank. Pay gaps are particularly pronounced for immigrants and indigenous women, she added.Hennessy said one way to close these gaps is to ※revalue the caring work that women do§ 每 referring to unpaid work at home, caring for family members, and paid work including in early childhood education. ※Unionisation helps, too,§ she said. ※The gender pay gap is 每 unions can be a great equaliser.§ Last year, Canada also fell down in the World Economic Forum＊s global gender equality rankings, . In 1995, it was in first place. Armine Yalnizyan, a Canadian economist and business commentator, said that while gender inequality at work is a national problem, ※there are huge variations across the country§. For instance, she said the Saskatchewan province appears more equal than neighbouring Alberta, which has larger pay gaps. These gaps are falling among young people, she said, ※but they＊re nowhere near closed. It＊s people that don＊t have more than high-school [education] that see the biggest wage gap between women and men.§Yalnizyan said higher minimum wages ※would affect way more women than men, and would begin to compress wages§. She also described increasing access to childcare and early childhood education as a ※virtuous cycle§, enabling more women to work while also creating jobs.The McKinsey report says tackling these gender inequalities could lead to ※re-energising Canada＊s economy and its businesses§. It says GDP growth has slowed to approximately 2% a year, and that ※a significant part of the solution is for  to tap into the vast, unrealised potential of women§.Gender inequality at work is not a uniquely Canadian problem. , women make less than $0.80 for every $1 that men do. In the UK, the gender pay gap is .Globally, estimates suggest that just .

Last year,  it is in companies＊ interests to promote women up their ranks, and that tackling gender inequality could add ?10tn to the world economy. The Economist has printed stories with headlines such as ※§. Women executives have called for others to ※§, and there have been campaigns for more women in boardrooms and MBA programmes.In Canada, McKinsey＊s report argues, more women need to get into managerial roles, ※high-productivity§ sectors such as oil, mining and technology, or become entrepreneurs.

Canadian women university graduates outnumber men with these degrees 每 yet women are overrepresented in lower-paid jobs and are more likely to work part-time, juggling unpaid child care and other responsibilities at home. Hennessy said that Canadian women are more educated than ever, and are already ※contributing to economic growth 每 but as long as the gender pay gap persists, the revolution remains unfinished§.She added: ※Pay matters, but so do working conditions.

"his summer marks 10 years since the beginning of the financial crash in the UK, when depositors lined up outside branches of a small British bank, Northern Rock, to withdraw all of their savings as quickly as possible, particularly since everyone else was doing the same. This led to the UK＊s first bank run in 150 years. , which seemed a prudent reaction. When the dust settled, it was clear the elites had failed to anticipate the near-apocalyptic events. They had placed too much faith in market liberalisation, deregulation and tax cutting that benefitted the very wealthy disproportionately. In an instant everything changed. Yet nothing did., the rich are back. While?the rest of society have shared in an equality of misery following the crash, the top 1% 每 households with incomes of ?275,000 每 have now recovered all the ground they lost during the world＊s worst post-second world war slump. The share of income going to the very richest is now 8.5%. That＊s double their share in 1985. The question has to be asked: has the value of the 1% in society doubled in the last 20 years? What have all these higher earners 每 in the City or in the boardrooms 每 done that has been so socially useful to see their share of total wages go up so much?It＊s not that we are richer as a nation. . Remember the recession was caused by the financial sector＊s innovations 每 the excessive leverage; the perverse incentives; the fraudulent promotion of risky products as safe 每 and its promotion that greed was the ultimate good. While public spending as a proportion of GDP might be roughly constant since the crash, the country＊s needs are higher, so there＊s a feeling of less to go round. This has happened while there＊s been a quiet secession of the successful.All the rise in inequality is due to this group racing away with the goodies from the economy, while the rest of us are being squeezed closer together. For the very wealthy, rules are bent to suit their needs. When a dividend tax was readied for 2016-17, the very wealthy took their payments early and avoided ?800m, money that could have been used for schools and hospitals. . Can you imagine a supermarket worker asking to bring forward his pay to avoid a tax charge? The richest in our society are not worth the rewards they give themselves. It＊s because they have captured ideologically the political process that these absurdities continue. . The rich mistakenly think all their power and money and success is down to their brilliance and hard work. .The more as a society we have pursued meritocracy and ※equality of opportunity§ the?more unequal we have become and the less socially mobile. . Because politics is colonised by the thoughts of wealthy ※meritocrats§, we end up advocating social mobility in unequal systems without thinking about who is going down when the clever are going up. Lots of debate about student debt but barely a squeak about the other half of the country that needs apprenticeships.Because meritocracy is a myth used to forgive the vice of greed,  and  end up being paid astronomical amounts. Both are workers whose wages are not very competitive because quality is hard to judge, particularly in advance, and it is worth paying a lot more for better outcomes. So they get paid whatever they can get away with. Labour have their answer: taxing the rich and spending to reshape the welfare state. The Conservatives understand the problem but do not want to intervene and regulate to ensure the stability that affordable homes, job security, educational prospects bring.The prime minister has sought to portray the divide as one between ※locals§ and ※globals§, who inhabit different economies. One linked by roadside chats; the other by FaceTime. Today＊s Conservatism does not want to level relationships between poor and rich, to provide policies that allow workers to set bosses＊ pay or tenants to hold their landlords to account or empower consumers over corporates. Be warned: if a party cannot stand with the country, the country will end up standing with someone else."

In response to the suggestion that Hammond had called on Treasury officials to comb through public spending in search of savings, and that fuel duty was on the table, Halfon tweeted:Speaking to the Guardian, he said: ※Any rise in fuel duty would really hit hardworking people. It doesn＊t just push up the costs for drivers but small businesses, bus fares and food prices because of the transportation costs. The fuel duty freeze has been one of [the] great achievements of this government 每 and why reverse that.§Other areas of potential savings reported to be under consideration by Hammond include the higher-rate pension tax relief and the possibility of postponing the 2020 target to raise the personal allowance threshold to ?12,500.

"There are signs Britain＊s home baking boom may be running out of steam, just as Channel 4 prepares to relaunch one of its main catalysts, .The amount of baking ingredients, including flour, dried fruits and cake coverings, sold by supermarkets fell 3.8% in the year to the end of March, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel.Every series of the Bake Off so far has spurred a peak in baking activity, with  used in the show when it aired on the BBC. But these peaks have gradually diminished over the past four years. Activity in between the shows reached a new low last summer.Bakery kits, dried fruit and bread mixes have been hit the hardest, according to research from IRI, the grocery market analysis firm. It recorded declines at all the major brands, including Jus-Rol, Silver Spoon, Homepride, Allinson and McDougalls. Only Dr Oetker, the German maker of icing, sprinkles, flavourings and other baking ingredients, increased sales volumes.Thomas Steel, an analyst at Kantar,  that consumers are purchasing both less per trip and not as often: ※Home baking across all retailers has seen brands being ousted by own-label ranges.§Channel 4 is expected to relaunch the Bake Off show, which it controversially poached from the BBC, in September with only Paul Hollywood staying on from the original presenting and judging team. But it is not clear whether the new look Bake Off will be able to maintain the popularity of the BBC version which secured .Series three winner John Whaite told the Grocer that Britain＊s home baking boom since the show first aired in 2010 was largely down to the influence of one key presenter who will not be part of the  version - Mary Berry. ※Mary＊s really soft approach and the way she gives honest but gentle criticism really emboldens people and encourages them to give it a go,§ he said.Even before Channel 4 bought the format, sales of baking ingredients had begun to fall back from a peak in 2014, according to IRI.Maureen Hinton, group research director at retail consultancy GlobalData, said that the trend was likely to continue unless Channel 4 was able to come up with ※something very different that inspires people＊s interest§.As budgets are squeezed by rising inflation, which is reducing families＊ spending power, Hinton said cooking main meals from scratch might rise but baking was a ※niche activity§.※It＊s more of a leisure activity.

"irst, a little primer on inflation. The UK inflation rate for June 2017 as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) was 2.6%, the . That is to say that the cost of living, measured by prices of a representative ※basket of goods§ from computer games to children＊s clothing, rose by 2.6% over the prior 12-month period, although it was down from 2.9% the month before.This rise was less than experts had expected. But the predictions are that we will see numbers over 3% later this year. After that inflation is expected to fall back again towards zero.Over the past few years we have become used to inflation being very low 每 indeed, it averaged 0% in 2015. It seems that worries about falling prices, or deflation, have gone for now. Most other countries in the world are experiencing low and falling inflation, including the euro area with a rate of 1.3% in June, down from 1.9% a couple of months ago. The US is at 1.6%, down from 2.8% earlier this year.The main reason inflation is rising in the UK is because of . Import prices have risen because of the fall in the value of the pound, which is down about 13% to the dollar from $1.49 on 23 June versus $1.30 today, hence inflation. is the rate of change of prices. To illustrate it simply, if prices last year were ?100 and this year they are ?102 then prices have risen by 2.0% (?102/?100). If next year prices rise to ?105 then inflation is ?105/?102=2.94%. So even though prices rose in both years the rate of change of prices has increased.The Brexit vote was largely unexpected and was not priced in by the markets. The fall in the pound occurred because markets felt that UK prospects had deteriorated as a result of the vote to leave the EU. Experts predicted that with this big rise in uncertainty consumers would start to save more and spend less as a precaution, but they didn＊t. Consumer spending held up and unsecured borrowing rose sharply. That is why the economy took longer to slow than many, , expected.But that is now in full reverse as prices are , which are growing at under 2%, so real wages, adjusted for price rises, are falling once more. Pay settlements are coming in at a norm of 2%.There is little or no likelihood that wage growth is going to pick up beyond 2% any time soon. Consumers will retrench and spend less and demand will drop. The savings rate, which is at historically low rates, will start to pick up. Workers will continue to hurt. According to official data real wages are 7% below pre-recession levels, so pay packets buy less.The economy in 2017 has started slowing. UK retail sales grew  in June. The  was estimated to have decreased by 1.2% in the three months to May 2017 compared with the three months to February 2017. In the first quarter of 2017 the UK economy was the slowest growing economy in the G8 and the EU28. Business confidence has fallen and is now at its lowest point for almost six years, the  reports.The question for the UK＊s monetary policymakers is what they should do when inflation is high but the economy is slowing, as occurred in July and August 2008, although on a much worse scale. Inflation may be bad 每 it erodes the value of people＊s savings 每 but low growth and unemployment are much worse. There were three votes (out of eight, with one seat currently vacant)  at the last meeting of the monetary policy committee (MPC), but that looks to be a huge mistake, in my view.If the MPC raises rates to deal with inflation this would cause the economy to slow even faster, as the price of money rises. Interest rate rises could easily push the UK back into recession.My advice would be that the monetary police committee should wait and watch and see if the economy worsens. If it does then it should cut rates and do more asset buying. The big problem is markets have no idea what a Brexit future will look like. In economic terms, the Brexit chickens have started to come home to roost."

"A century-long rise in life expectancy has stalled since 2010 when austerity brought about deep cuts in  and social care spending, according to research by a former government adviser on the links between poverty and ill-health. at birth had been going up so fast that women were gaining an extra year of life every five years and men an additional 12 months every three-and-a-half years.But those trends have almost halved since ministers made a ※political decision§ in 2010 to reduce the amount of money it put into the public sector, said Sir Michael Marmot. The upward trend in longer life that began in Britain just after the first world war has slowed so dramatically that women now only gain an extra year after a decade while for men the same gain now takes six years to arrive. The rate of increase was ※pretty close to having ground to a halt§, Marmot said.※I am deeply concerned with the levelling off; I expected it to just keep getting better. Since 2009-2015 it＊s pretty flat, whereas we are used to it getting better and better all the time,§ added Marmot, who published a major review of health inequalities for Gordon Brown＊s Labour government in early 2010. In 1919 men lived for an average of 52.5 years and women for 56.1 years. That rose to 64.1 years and 68.7 years respectively by 1946. Life expectancy then rose in an almost unbroken gradual upward curve to 77.1 years for men and 81.4 years for women in 2005 and again to 78.7 and 82.6 in 2010, the year David Cameron＊s Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition took office. Since then life expectancy has continued to creep upwards, but at a slower rate, according to Marmot＊s latest analysis. In 2015 average life expectancy in Britain was 79.6 years for men and 83.1 years for women, according to the latest Office for National Statistics data. Marmot, who is the director of the Institute of  Equity at University College London, denied the rise had stalled because there was a natural limit to how much life expectancy can increase. ※It is not inevitable that it should have levelled off,§ he said.There is no reason why the UK could not emulate Hong Kong, where life expectancy for men is 81.1 years for men and 87.3 for women 每 the highest in the world 每 Marmot added. Hong Kong has overtaken Japan in terms of how long citizens can expect to live. Marmot, who has also advised the World Health Organisation, did not claim that the introduction of austerity had led directly to life expectancy stagnating. But he highlighted that ※miserly§ levels of spending on health and social care in recent years 每 at a time of rising health need linked to the ageing population 每 had affected the amount and quality of care older people receive. The long-term trend for NHS budget increases is 3.8% a year, with rises of 1.1% a year since 2010. ※If we don＊t spend appropriately on social care, if we don＊t spend appropriately on health care, the quality of life will get worse for older people and maybe the length of life, too,§ he added. Marmot cited the growing numbers of deaths among the over-75s and over-85s and continuing high death rates from heart disease as other key potential factors in the stalling rise in life expectancy. ※Life expectancy has been increasing year on year for a generation, to the extent that we had begun to take it for granted as inevitable. But this authoritative analysis suggests this long period of improvement may now be coming to an end, with big implications for us all,§ said a spokesman for the charity Age UK. Cases of dementia and Alzheimer＊s have been rising so rapidly that they are now the leading cause of death for both sexes, among women 80 and over and men 85+. The increase in dementia and needs of the ageing population will place the NHS and social care services ※under considerable strain§ in the near future, Marmot added. Dr Matthew Norton, director of policy at Alzheimer＊s Research UK, said: ※This report shines a spotlight on a hard truth: that unless we can find ways to prevent and treat dementia, deaths from the condition will continue to rise as our population ages. The reality today is that with no treatments to stop or slow the underlying diseases, the condition is placing an ever-growing strain on our health services.§ The Department of Health played down Marmot＊s findings. A spokesman pointed out that the NHS had just last week been judged to be  out of 11 rich countries analysed in a major review published by the Commonwealth Fund, a respected US thinktank.※Life expectancy continues to increase, with cancer survival rates at a record high whilst smoking rates are at an all-time low. We continue to invest to ensure our ageing population is well cared-for, with ?6bn extra going into the NHS [in England] over the last two years and an additional ?2bn for the social care system,§ he added."															
"Nikil Saval writes that ※Globalisation could take place in services, capital and ideas ＃ but what it meant most often was making it cheaper to trade across borders§ (, 15 July). We hear no more from him about cross-border movements of capital. When I studied economics in the 1950s we spoke of ※capital flight§ as a major cause of economic stagnation and regulatory capture. The rich in most of South America appeared to be free to invest their winnings in US equities to the detriment of their local industries. My pension fund invests more abroad than in UK equities. Am I complicit in a?modern version of capital flight? Could it be that another tenet of conventional wisdom needs to be challenged: that free movement of capital across borders benefits us all?  The main drivers of environmental destruction (, 11 July) are over-population and economic growth. Over-population is caused by poverty. Economic growth 每 seen by most as a good thing 每 is needed only to service debt. This was pointed by CH Douglas＊s Social Credit movement in the 1920s and more recently by EF Schumacher and others. Allowing banks to issue 97% of money as debt is at the heart of the problem."															
"or Spreadsheet Phil, the numbers look bad. Growth is weakening.  means debt interest payments are rising. The recent election showed a nation heartily sick of austerity. There are pressures for higher public-sector pay.The one big initiative announced by  in his year or so as chancellor was to move the annual budget from the spring to the autumn. Preparatory work for the first of those will begin in earnest over the summer, and nothing so far has suggested that Hammond will be in a generous mood. Quite the contrary, in fact.The chancellor＊s thinking is clear enough. Ten years ago, when the financial crisis broke, the UK was running an annual  每 the shortfall between what the state raises in revenue and what it spends 每 of around 2.5% of gross domestic product. As a result of the subsequent deep recession, the deficit ballooned to a peacetime record of 10% of GDP. Since then, tax increases, spending curbs and modest growth have combined to narrow the deficit, but nowhere near as fast as envisaged.Hammond is worried about the economic implications of Brexit but he also knows that Britain faces challenges from a growing, elderly population. The demographic time bomb is ticking loudly:  for those born in the 1970s, and the disastrous . Had the Conservatives won a healthy overall majority in last month＊s election, Spreadsheet Phil would be out of a job. As it is, his position has strengthened as the authority of the prime minister has weakened. Theresa May would like a generous autumn budget but, as far as the chancellor is concerned, she can 每 to coin a phrase 每 go . The first budget of a parliament tends to be a sombre affair, because governments like to get the bad news out of the way early. If taxes are to be raised and spending cut, the thinking is better to do it early than when an election is looming. Despite the government＊s need for the support of the  to stay in office, this pattern is likely to persist.Hammond＊s argument goes like this. There has been an easing of the government＊s stance towards the deficit since he took over as chancellor, with the date for running a budget surplus put back by five years to fund some extra spending on public infrastructure and a slightly less draconian approach to welfare cuts.Both the deficit and the national debt are higher than he would like. The Brexit process mean these are uncertain times for the economy. Abandoning the path of fiscal rectitude would risk losing the confidence of international investors, who would respond to higher spending and higher borrowing by taking their money out of Britain. Higher interest rates would be necessary to prevent capital flight, and this would nullify the effect of the fiscal boost. All that Britain would have to show for it would be a bigger debt tab that would be picked up by future generations.Critics of austerity say the government has got it wrong from the start. The order of priorities should have been ※growth first, deficit reduction second§, and not the other way round. Fiscal policy 每 tax and spending 每 is a more powerful weapon when interest rates are at rock-bottom levels and should have been used more aggressively. Cutting back on public investment was a mistake that has only partly been rectified.All this is true, but slightly beside the point, since the chances of the government admitting that austerity has been a failure are precisely zero. That would mean telling voters that all the sacrifices since 2010 had been in vain, which would be a hard sell.On the other hand, voters seem to want more police to fight crime, more money for the emergency services after their heroics this summer, extra investment in the NHS and no cuts in funding for schools. If Hammond is to find money for higher public spending without increasing borrowing, he will either have to ditch government plans to reduce personal and corporate taxes or find new sources of revenue. One option would be for the government to embrace the idea of a financial transaction tax, AKA the Robin Hood tax. at an event in London, ticks all the right boxes.＊s starting point is that Britain already has a financial transaction tax, and has had one for more than 300 years. It is called stamp duty, which is levied on the purchase of shares issued by British companies, and raises just over ?3bn a year, half of it from citizens of other countries. Some trading activities are exempt from stamp duty and Persaud believes these exemptions should be restricted. He also proposes that the tax should be broadened to cover transactions in corporate bonds and cash flows arising from equity and derivative transactions. He estimates that this would raise ?4.7bn a year.One argument against a financial transaction tax is that it would lead to fewer transactions and so would not raise any money. Persaud said he accepted that the tax would change behaviour (indeed, that is part of the reason for having one), but that he had already made allowances for the reduction in activity in his calculations. If there was no change in behaviour, the tax would raise ?13bn a year.Nor does he accept that a tougher stamp duty regime would lead to a relocation of business. Liability for the tax would depend on where the financial instruments were issued and who owned them. A US investor, for example, would pay the tax on shares issued in the UK, but not on securities traded in the UK but not issued there. Likewise, a British investor would pay the tax on securities wherever they were issued and traded.Persaud, himself a former banker, thinks big finance is a bit of a racket. If a company wants to raise money in the City, the charges amount to 2% of the trade 每 a rate unchanged in more than 100 years. Put another way, all the efficiency gains since the late 19th century have been captured by those who run the industry rather than shared with the customers. It is hard to think of any other sector where this is true.The Treasury has always been opposed to a financial transaction tax, in large part due to its institutional capture by the City. Official attitudes would change, though, with a Labour government. Why? Because Persaud＊s presentation was organised by the  party and he was introduced by the shadow chancellor. While Spreadsheet Phil is looking for a magic money tree, John McDonnell has already found one."															
"he City has been getting mightily excited in recent weeks at the prospect of the  next month. Sorry to disappoint, but it＊s not going to happen. In truth, it was never going to happen. The Old Lady has been showing a bit of leg, that＊s all.If there was any serious doubt about the outcome of the August meeting of the Bank＊s monetary policy committee, the  puts the issue to rest.Unemployment matters to the eight members of the Bank＊s monetary policy committee because they are looking for evidence that a reduction in the jobless rate 每 a tightening of the labour market in the jargon of the trade 每 is leading to a pick-up in wage inflation.The idea is that falling unemployment changes the balance of power in the labour market. When the jobless total is high, employers are in control because people are desperate to find work or are worried about being made redundant. When the jobless total falls, workers can be more choosy about who they work for and employers have to pay more.The Bank＊s model of the economy assumes that This equilibrium level of unemployment is precisely the same as the actual level of unemployment 每 4.5%. On the basis that a stitch in time saves nine, some members of the MPC think interest rates should go up now before wage inflation starts to spiral.For these inflation hawks, the latest labour market figures support their argument. Regular pay in the three months ending in May was 2% up on the same three months last year. That compared with annual earnings growth of 1.8% in the quarter ending April.But the case for a pre-emptive interest-rate strike will be countered by the MPC＊s doves. They will say that the Bank＊s estimate of the equilibrium level of unemployment has been steadily reduced in recent years as it has become clear that the economy can operate with much shorter dole queues without a pick-up in inflation. It is quite possible that the equilibrium level of unemployment is lower than 4.5%.What＊s more, even after the pick-up in regular pay, living standards are currently being squeezed hard. Prices are going up more quickly than wages and that is feeding through into weaker consumer spending. At some point, perhaps not too far away, it might lead to higher unemployment 每 and lower inflation 每 as well.At the last meeting of the MPC, five members voted to keep rates on hold. Of the three members who plumped for a rate rise, one, Kristin Forbes, has now left the committee. The question is whether there is anything in the latest labour market data to persuade the doves to drop their wait-and-see approach. There isn＊t."															
"The publicity now given to the decision of Her Majesty＊s Most Loyal Opposition to start opposing the government on Europe is indicative of its curious failure to do so hitherto (, 28 August). Labour＊s new policy of a very soft Brexit is to be welcomed, but for all the advocates of such a policy there is the huge question mark hovering overhead 每 why advocate adhering to the single market and the customs union without also insisting on being part of the decision-making process on the rules of these bodies? This is the essential weakness of those who keep insisting that the UK will leave the EU.Your leader (, 28 August) states that ※further steps are not ruled out§; unless this includes taking the first opportunity to reverse article 50, Labour＊s change of direction is only taking us down a side alley. It matters much less what Labour party policy is on our transition out of the EU, than what their policy is on the shape of the final destination. We are given to understand that  would favour remaining in the single market and customs union long term, rather than leave it altogether, if he is able to negotiate a special arrangement for the UK on the issue of freedom of movement. Isn＊t that remarkably similar to the policy that David Cameron followed in 2015? Cameron, of course, failed. Corbyn might be more successful and produce a new freedom of movement deal for the UK acceptable to all 27 EU states and to the UK electorate. If that happens then one of the biggest issues for the electorate goes away. So why focus now on just the single market and customs union? Why leave the EU at all? Surely any successful negotiations on this issue should prompt another referendum. The Socialist Labour party warned that the Labour party would betray not only its members but the democratic vote by the British people to leave the . As soon as that vote was announced on 23 June 2016, Britain should have left the EU, including the customs union, the single market and, above all, the ※free movement of labour and capital§ which has seen the population of Britain rise from 59 million to 67 million. The UK should not pay a penny or cent to the EU. If the border in Ireland is a concern, the solution is simple: return Northern Ireland back to the Republic of Ireland from where it was taken. Labour＊s establishment tendency has made its major play to sabotage the prospects of a Labour government seriously challenging austerity with this plan to stitch up a transitional deal that would keep Britain in the single market and customs union. The prospect that a Labour government might sweep away the austerity straitjacket is weakened with the commitment to fully accept the EU treaties, rules and directives that constrain public spending, inhibit public ownership and police the EU marketisation regime. The decision will threaten Corbyn＊s reputation for straightforward dealing and honesty. Millions of  voters 每 including many who were won back in the last election 每 will see this as a betrayal. Corbyn＊s careful positioning on Brexit, his immediate pledge to respect the referendum result, his emphasis on protecting the rights of EU citizens living and working here, and on strengthened workers＊ rights for all went a long way to detoxify the post Brexit debate. This is now threatened. The senior Labour MPs in heartland seats are quite right to be concerned about the change in Labour＊s  stance. This policy may be fine when Labour is in government, but even if Theresa May＊s government falls tomorrow, it makes taking power much more difficult. Labour need another 60 seats; where will those seats come from if they alienate the former Labour voters who voted leave? As a matter of urgency, Labour needs to put together and publicise policies on immigration, investment and jobs for the communities left behind by successive governments, Labour and Tory, over the past 40 years.Plans need to be set out to tackle poverty wages and increase opportunities for good, well-paid and secure employment in current blackspots. Undercutting of wages must end, the problem of delays with GP appointments tackled. There must be an agreed plan for investment in social (not just affordable) housing. Labour needs to spell out plans to improve road and rail networks in the north and Midlands; the transport minister saying last week that it is up to councils in the north to improve rail links between northern cities is a disgrace.Labour needs a bold plan to tackle the problems felt by the communities left behind. Labour gave people hope in 1945. It needs to do nothing less in 2017 if it is to have any realistic possibility of putting its Brexit plans into action. When will we come to accept the reality that there is no such thing as ※soft Brexit§. As Professor Bogdanor wrote in your paper (, 3 August) ※the ultimate choice we face is either ＆hard Brexit＊ or remain§. Soft Brexit, as now proposed by the Labour party, implies for an undefined period of time accepting EU rules and regulations, the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, paying into?the EU budget and, crucially, accepting free movement of labour. So in reality no Brexit at all. This might be the best approach, but to call it any form of Brexit is a delusion. If Labour policies are henceforth to be dictated by the need to keep the ※Ukip vote§, then one has to ask, what exactly is the point of the Labour party? Are we now back to the days of ※power at all costs§ and ※my party, right or wrong§? And if the party leadership should cave in to the demands of those MPs opposing the policy change, wouldn＊t it simply mean Labour losing votes in ※remain§ areas, in favour of parties with slightly more principle, such as the Greens? Good to see that the Labour party is now pressing for a four-year transitional period before we leave the single market and the customs union. So instead of rushing headlong over a cliff, we will now march over the same cliff, but just more slowly. Some choice. Now that Corbyn has decided to stay in the single market, will he now apologise to the four MPs whom he sacked from the shadow cabinet in June for supporting it? And reinstate them, please?"															
"Welcome back to the Guardian＊s agenda-setting Monday economic analysis page (, 28 August). It takes me back 25 years to why I first started to buy the paper. More of this would be most welcome; in particular, more on the sort of fundamental transformation that will be required to pre- and post-income regimes if the situation is to be reversed.On the opposite page Natalie Nougayr豕de more or less encourages President Macron (as if he needed it) to show the French a bit of the tough love that was Thatcherism. In fairness, she does acknowledge that ※In France, income inequality and poverty rates are lower than in Britain and Germany,§ but does not speculate whether that would be the case if they had had a Thatcher or a Hartz IV, the German labour market reforms.  levels in France are undesirably high, but if you were unemployed in France would you be gasping for access to the conditions of the bottom 25% of the ※employed§ in the UK or Germany? Of course, it＊s not the real choice that the French should have to make but that＊s a longer story. Larry Elliott gives us the up-to-date figures for the growing disparity in wealth in the US. The totals confirm Charles Murray＊s 2012 assessment, Coming Apart: The State of White America 1960-2010. Marray＊s findings were that educational attainment was the principal driving force of inequality. The well-educated clump together, through marriage and in excluding communities. The less-educated are left out-of-sight and out-of-mind in deprived communities.In Britain, this separation is most easily seen in housing and in the disparity of living standards between the extended  area and the rest of the UK. A change in taxation is only a simplistic political solution to a problem that arises from the way we have allowed society to develop. If we rely on taxation to fill the gap, we will end with a society where it is usual for part to live with the benefits of the modern world, and part that can only look at pictures of the unattainable. We need to start with an education system that prepares citizens for life in a world in which they can expect to live, and a working environment that enables them to afford to live there. As so often with discussions about inequality (, 29 August) your leader homes in on unfairness rather than how extremes of inequality are among the main drivers of boom and bust syndromes. As we＊re seeing at the moment it also adversely affects the ability of an economy to recover from the bust. Herbert Hoover in the three years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Tories since 2010 failed to recognise what Galbraith concluded. The rich cannot buy great quantities of bread. Excess wealth leads not to useful job creation but to useless speculation where the assets (particularly property) are divided from the rest of us. Recovery is sparked by the ordinary citizen with the money and the security to spend it, buying the goods and services which keep the economy ticking over. If City speculators, property developers, overpaid CEOs and greedy shareholders were going to kickstart the economy they would have done so by now."															
"UK house prices dipped this month, dragging down the annual growth rate, in further evidence of a cooling market.The average price of a home fell 0.1% between July and August to ?210,495, according to Nationwide, Britain＊s biggest building society.  and June but , the first time this had happened since the financial crisis.The latest monthly price drop took the annual growth rate back down to 2.1%, a level last seen in May, which was the lowest rate in four years, from 2.9% in July.Robert Gardner, Nationwide＊s chief economist, said: ※The slowdown in house price growth to the 2-3% range in recent months from the 4-5% prevailing in 2016 is consistent with signs of cooling in the housing market and the wider economy.§He noted that economic growth had halved from last year to about 0.3% per quarter in the first half of this year and that the number of mortgages approved for house purchase hit a nine-month low in June, while surveyors had reported softening in the number of new buyer inquiries.He said in some respects the slowdown in the housing market was surprising, given the strength of the labour market, while mortgage rates have remained close to all-time lows.Household finances are under mounting pressure, with the cost of living rising steadily as the weak pound bites, and wage growth stagnating.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the slowdown in house price growth reflected the squeeze on real wages (adjusted for inflation) and the slowdown in the pace that mortgage rates are falling. ※Prices likely will continue to struggle to rise much, given that inflation still has further to rise, consumer confidence has deteriorated sharply since June and lenders intend to reduce the supply of unsecured credit. ※From February, new lending also will not generate borrowing allowances from the Bank＊s term funding scheme, raising the costs of credit significantly. Accordingly, we still think that prices will be up just 1.5% year-over-year in December.§A shortage in the number of homes on the market is underpinning house price growth, with the number of properties on estate agents＊ books close to 30-year lows.  expects prices to rise by 2% over 2017 as a whole. It says house prices across the country are still 12% above their 2007 peak.After increases in stamp duty in spring 2016, revenues from the tax have reached all-time high highs, rising to ?12.8bn in the 12 months to June, well above the ?10.6bn peak recorded in late 2007."															
"ttacks on excessive executive pay and calls for more consensual company management have always marked  out from that of her more Thatcherite colleagues. Mrs May has highlighted these issues often since she became prime minister. At the weekend she returned to the theme in , echoing Edward Heath＊s 1973 phrase about the ※unacceptable face of capitalism§. Now she is having , launching a package of measures on high pay, workers＊ rights and corporate governance to mark her return to the political stage after the summer break.Mrs May＊s concern about these issues is right and rational. They are unfinished business for modern Britain. Unfortunately there is little that measures up in this package. Several of the ideas that Mrs May floated in 2016 每 themselves fairly modest in the first place 每 have now been trimmed back or dropped altogether, in response to lobbying by the chancellor, . Binding annual votes by shareholders on executive pay have bitten the dust. Now the City＊s self-regulatory code will require companies only to publish the pay ratio between CEOs and their workforce average. Plans to put employee representatives on company boards have been abandoned. Now the appointment of a non-executive director ※to represent employees§ will suffice.The dilution of the proposals reflects several things. The most obvious of these is Mrs May＊s loss of political authority since her . She is a leader on probation now. She must negotiate everything she does. But the most significant explanation may in fact be the wider Tory party＊s continuing refusal to take City excess and the corporate reform agenda seriously.Mr Hammond＊s rearguard action can perhaps be explained as the typical act of a departmental minister trying to protect his clients. Yet all too few Tory MPs embraced Mrs May＊s ideas even when she was strong, let alone now that she is weak. Too much of the Tory party remains smugly beguiled by laissez-faire dogmas, in spite of the massive evidence of their failings. Too little of the party is genuinely inquisitive about issues like workplace codetermination. None of?it, Mrs May included, seems to have had a fresh thought about trade unions or workers＊ representation for at least 30 years.In spite of countless good reasons to do so, few leading Conservatives look to German, Scandinavian, Japanese or South Korean corporate thinking for better ideas, even in the wake of a financial crisis that wrecked public confidence in the City. Even one of Mrs May＊s brightest allies, , has accused her of ※flirting with anti-capitalism§ and chided her for not supporting ※British enterprise§, rather than supporting her effort to make British companies act with restraint on pay and adopt long-term strategies.The irony, even in her weakened position, is that Mrs May ought now to find a readier Tory audience for her ideas than in the past. The increased prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government, the very same prospect that holds the Tories back from ditching Mrs May, also highlights their need to find a compelling alternative to Labour＊s revived statism and centralism. Logically, the Conservative party needs to find a believable and pragmatic business agenda that reins in top pay and treats workers more fairly. Yet it will never do?that by sticking to the status quo."															
															
"UK pay growth has amid signs that the lowest level of unemployment since the mid 1970s may be increasing workers＊ bargaining power. showed that earnings growth in the three months to June was 2.1% higher than in the same period in 2016, and up from 2% in the three months to May and a recent low of 1.8% in April. The ONS said unemployment in the quarter ending in June was down 57,000 on the previous three months at 1,484,000. The jobless rate fell to a 42-year low of 4.4%. Employment was up by 125,000 at 32.1 million in the three months to June, the highest rate (75.1%) since modern records began in 1971.Its breakdown of the 338,000 increase in employment over the past year found that full-time jobs were up by 380,000, while part-time posts fell by 43,000. Male employment was at a level not seen since 1991, while female employment was at the highest rate since 1971.The ability of the economy to generate new jobs contradicts  before last year＊s EU referendum that a vote to leave would lead to a sharp rise in the jobless total. The then chancellor George Osborne predicted that unemployment would  within two years of a vote to leave. The first year following the Brexit vote saw unemployment fall by 157,000.But despite the additional jobs and the acceleration in earnings growth, living standards remain under pressure because pay has failed to keep pace with inflation, which  in June.The increase from 0.9% a year earlier has largely been the result of  caused by the  since the Brexit vote.Ruth Gregory, the UK economist at Capital , said: ※The latest labour market figures provided some signs that the tightening in the labour market may be leading to a recovery in wage growth at long last.§The increase in employment had beaten consensus expectations of a 97,000 rise, she added.The City responded to the unemployment and earnings data by pushing up the value of the pound against the dollar by half a cent on foreign exchanges.A tighter labour market is seen as strengthening the hand of the hawks on the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee, who are  in interest rates.The ONS reported that the availability of jobs in the UK continues to attract workers from overseas, but found that the rate of increase had slowed over the past year.Between April and June 2016, and the same three months of 2017, the number of non-UK nationals from the EU working in Britain rose by 126,000 to 2.37 million. In the previous year, there had been an increase of 242,000. The number of workers from the rest of the world fell by 18,000 between April and June.While the private sector continues to take on more staff, ONS figures showed state employment had fallen to its lowest level since 1999. The number of public sector jobs in the three months to March stood at 5.42 million, down 7,000 over the quarter and 20,000 over the year.Matt Hughes, a senior labour market statistician at the ONS, said: ※The employment picture remains strong, with a new record high employment rate and another fall in the unemployment rate. Despite the strong jobs picture, however, real earnings continue to decline.※The number of workers born elsewhere in the EU continues to increase, but the annual rate of change has slowed markedly.※New figures on the number of workers who say they are on zero-hours contracts show a small drop on last year.§Damian Hinds, the employment minister, said the 338,000 increase in employment in the year to June had been primarily driven by full-time, permanent jobs. ※More than 3 million more people are in work now than in 2010, with seven in 10 of these roles being in higher-skilled work,§ he said."															
															
" might find it tough to accept but there is light at the end of the tunnel for UK inflation.Rising prices have been one of the big economic stories of the past 12 months, but for the past two months the financial markets have been surprised by the weakness of cost-of-living pressures.The reason for that is simple: the two factors that have been driving inflation higher since the summer of 2016 每 higher global oil prices and the sharp fall in the value of sterling after the EU referendum 每 have almost washed through the system.A quick look at the  helps explain what has been going on. Producer prices are a measure of inflation early in the supply chain, since they gauge both the cost to firms of buying in fuel and raw material, and the prices of goods as they leave factory gates.Fuel and raw material prices rose fast in the second half of 2016, with the annual rate of increase peaking at 19.9% in January. Since then, though, it has fallen month after month, dropping from 10% in June to 6.5% in July.Factory gate prices showed a similar, although less dramatic profile. They were rising at an annual rate of 3.7% in February and March, but have now slipped back to 3.2%.As Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, put it: ※While there is still some residual impact of sterling devaluation to feed through, with underlying inflationary pressures low, we think that consumer price inflation is close to topping out for the immediate future.§ It＊s not all good news, of course. There is probably still in the pipeline some residual inflationary pressure caused by sterling＊s fall which will show up in the coming months. The Bank of England expects  to reach 3% later in the year.What＊s more, despite the better-than-expected inflation data in the past two months, prices are still rising faster than wages. The squeeze on living standards will continue for a while yet, even though the pressure on real incomes will not be quite so pronounced.But with the economy moving at the pace of a slow-moving commuter train, the prospect of inflation rising to well over 3% now looks remote.

"China＊s credit-fuelled economic strategy has been branded as dangerous by the International Monetary Fund in a strongly-worded statement warning that its approach risks .The IMF used its  on the world＊s second biggest economy to stress that faster expansion in 2017 was coming at the cost of a jump in private sector debt and an increasing use of complex financial instruments. While the IMF increased its forecast for Chinese expansion in 2017 from 6.2% to 6.7%, it stressed that this was the result of the authorities in Beijing putting a higher priority on hitting a growth target than on the quality of the economic output. The Chinese government has pledged to double the size of the economy between 2010 and 2020 and has been prepared to see non-financial sector debt rise rapidly in order to achieve its aim. Total debt has quadrupled since the financial crisis to stand at $28tn (?22tn) at the end of last year.The IMF said debt as a proportion of gross domestic product would rise from 235% to almost 300% by 2022. Previously, the Washington-based IMF 每 which publishes annual reports on its member countries 每 had said debt would peak at 270% of GDP.※International experience suggests that China＊s credit growth is on a dangerous trajectory, with increasing risks of a disruptive adjustment and/or a marked growth slowdown,§ the IMF said.With many of the advanced economies of the west struggling in the years since the financial crisis of 2007-09,  has acted as the growth engine of the global economy, accounting for more than half the increase in world GDP in recent years.But the IMF expressed concern at the methods used to keep the economy expanding rapidly 每 an increase in government spending to fund infrastructure programmes and a willingness to allow state-controlled banks to lend more for speculative property developments. It said the buildup of public and private debt would limit the ability of Beijing to act in the event of a financial crisis.In its report, the IMF noted that debt was becoming less effective as a means of stimulating activity, noting that China needed three times as much credit in 2016 to achieve the same amount of growth as in 2008. ※Since 2008, private sector debt relative to GDP has risen by 80 percentage points to about 175% 每 such large increases have internationally been associated with sharp growth slowdowns and often financial crises§, the IMF said. It added that growth in the five years between 2012 and 2016 would have averaged 5.5% rather than 7.25% had credit growth been kept to a sustainable rate.The fund said it now expected China to expand at an average rate of 6.4% over the next three years.※The near-term growth outlook has firmed but at the cost of higher medium-term risks. Policy support, recovering external demand, and reform progress have helped keep growth strong. Amid strong momentum and an expectation that the authorities will do what it takes to achieve their medium-term growth target, staff have increased their medium-term baseline growth projections,§ the IMF said. ※However, risks around this baseline have also increased. The main cost of this stronger growth outlook is further large increases in public and private debt. Such large increases have internationally been associated with sharp growth slowdowns and often financial crises. Staff thus recommends replacing precise numerical growth targets with a commitment to reforms that deliver the fastest sustainable growth path.§The IMF also highlighted its worries about the rapid growth of China＊s banking sector, now one of the largest in the world. ※China now has one of the largest banking sectors in the world. At 310% GDP, China＊s banking sector is above the advanced economy average and nearly three times the emerging market average. ※The sharp growth in recent years reflects both a rise in credit to the real economy and intra-financial sector claims. The increase in size, complexity and interconnectedness of these exposures have resulted in sharply rising risks.§ Beijing rejected the IMF＊s criticisms, saying that the stronger growth outlook for 2017 was the result of a rebalancing of the economy and the government＊s reform programme rather than a reliance on debt."															
"here＊s nothing like the failure of a competitor to perk up other airline＊s share prices. Sure enough, , almost every other European airline gained altitude. EasyJet＊s shares were up 4.5%, Ryanair＊s by 3.3%, British Airways owner IAG＊s by 2.9%, and even little Wizz Air improved 4.6%.The reaction makes sense. Air Berlin has been loss-making for years but it is still a top 10 European airline, measured by numbers of passengers, and thus has been able to irritate rivals by merely surviving. That is why one reason why low-cost winners, such as easyJet and , grumble about irrational economics and the current state of overcapacity in the market.In a business like aviation, it is rarely safe to assume any airline＊s financial crisis is terminal. But Air Berlin＊s troubles, like those at Alitalia (now in administration), do look destined to lead a major restructuring of some form. Credit lines from the German government are only a temporary measure. The harder fact is that Etihad, a big shareholder in both Air Berlin and Alitalia, seems to have abandoned its strange strategy of throwing millions of euros at loss-making investments.Should either easyJet or Ryanair exploit a once-in-a-generation opportunity to pick up the pieces, buy Air Berlin and bag a big slice of the German market? Ryanair has spoken about wanting a 20% share there eventually and  has been expanding too.Both should tread carefully. The prize assets are slots at big German airports. If they become available on a clean basis, then fine. But restructuring a loss-making airline of the size of Air Berlin could be a messy business.Yet Ryanair has certainly got the right idea in demanding that state-aid rules are followed. The Irish carrier smells ※an obvious conspiracy§ to deliver Air Berlin on a debt-free basis to national flag-carrier Lufthansa. A stitch-up would indeed be outrageous. It is worth making a fuss at Brussels 每 just don＊t get mugged into overpaying as an alternative.The City＊s fund managers would like you to know they are not a bunch of supine lickspittles on the troubled issue of executive pay. On the contrary, says Chris Cummings, chief executive of trade body the Investment Association, 2017＊s round of annual meetings shows shareholders ※are flexing their muscles and holding big business to account§.Really? This claim seems to rest on ※dissent§ being defined as a vote of 20% or more against a company＊s pay resolution. True, such a level can be noteworthy in a field where Soviet-style majorities are commonplace. But would you really describe a 20% vote as a muscular show of force? If you score a fifth of goals in a football match, you＊ve lost.The association＊s curious yardstick is also capable of generating flattering conclusions whatever the reading. When the number of ※rebellions§ falls, as at FTSE 100 companies, it means ※companies have listened§. But when the figure increases, as at FTSE 250 firms, we＊re told it doesn＊t mean the board has closed its ears; rather, it shows the companies are ※in the investor spotlight§.To be fair to the association, its work behind the scenes almost certainly contributed to six FTSE 350 companies withdrawing contentious pay proposals last year instead of risking a defeat. That is a significant figure. The association is also plainly on the side of reform. It has backed the mandatory publication of pay ratios and wants boardroom pay to be simpler.Jolly good, but before boasting about its members＊ toughness, the association needs to look outside the window. FTSE 100 chief executives took a collective 17% pay cut to ※only§ ?4.5m last year but, to most observers, the big new factor was the government＊s threat to introduce pay ratios, workers on pay committees and annual binding votes. Those ideas probably persuaded a few pay committees to tone things down, at least temporarily.Yes, greater fund manager pressure may have helped at the margin, but, please, don＊t tell us shareholder activism is winning. If it were that easy, the government wouldn＊t be contemplating reform after so many years of dancing around the subject.Annoyed that ? So you should be. Linking the annual increase to July＊s retail prices index, which consistently gives higher readings than the consumer prices index, makes no sense. The Bank of England uses CPI for inflation-targeting. CPI is used for calculating annual increases to benefits. And CPI forms one part of the triple-lock on pensions. By rights, RPI should be history.To quote the Office for National Statistics: ※We know there will be a focus on the RPI this month, but the national statistician has been clear it is not a good measure and we do not recommend its use.§ The ONS trots out the same line every August. It＊s time ministers noticed."															
"The bosses of some of the world＊s biggest companies are facing mounting pressure to quit Donald Trump＊s high-profile business advisory council as two more people resigned on Tuesday in the wake of the president＊s handling of the fatal Charlottesville protests. following Trump＊s failure to immediately condemn white nationalists for the weekend of violence that left one woman dead and 19 injured.Another member, Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, quit on Tuesday morning. Paul said: ※ And late on Tuesday, America＊s biggest coalition of trade unions resigned its seat on Trump＊s manufacturing council in response to his controversial .The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) was the fifth member of the panel to quit over the president＊s handling of events in Charlottesville.Richard Trumka, the AFL-CIO president, said in a statement that Trump＊s extraordinary defense of far-right marchers had undermined his own ※forced remarks§ at the White House on Monday, when he condemned groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. ※We cannot sit on a council for a president who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,§ said Trumka, whose group claims to represent 12 million workers and retirees.Walmart＊s CEO, Doug McMillon, issued a strongly worded rebuke of Trump for missing ※a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists§.Walmart said McMillon, who sits on another of Trump＊s panels, the Strategic and Policy Forum, would not resign his position because the company wanted to ※stay engaged to try to influence decisions in a positive way and help bring people together§. Several other companies have issued similar statements.But the backlash is continuing. Online customers threatened boycotts and lobbied the companies of the manufacturing council＊s . The panel includes the bosses of Dell, General Electric, General Motors, Campbell Soup and Whirlpool.Along with McMillon, the CEOs of General Motors, JP Morgan and Pepsi sit on Trump＊s policy forum.Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color of Change, a US racial justice organization, said more than 80,000 people had signed the group＊s  calling for CEOs to quit.※You can＊t take our money by day and make us feel unsafe by night,§ he said. ※These corporations should decide what side of history they are on. They talk about diversity, they target our community. Would it be OK for staffers at Pepsi to walk around with Nazi pins on?§His comments were echoed by protesters outside Trump Tower in New York, where the president was spending the day holding meetings.※Really I don＊t think any patriotic American should support a president who is trying to divide us. I＊d encourage every CEO who is on this council to resign in protest because Trump＊s refusal to really come out against white supremacy is just not acceptable,§ said Josh Friedman, a 23-year-old activist who co-organized Monday night＊s Trump Tower protest.The protests came after the chief executives of the pharmaceutical giant Merck, the sportswear retailer Under Armour and the computer company Intel all resigned from the council on Monday.Merck＊s Kenneth Frazier was the first to quit, citing his ※responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism§.Trump promptly attacked Frazier, one of a handful of black CEOs and a man whose grandfather was born into slavery. ※Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President＊s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!§ he .But Trump＊s assault did not stop the Under Armour founder, Kevin Plank, and the Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich, following suit. ※Politics and political agendas have sidelined the important mission of rebuilding America＊s manufacturing base. I resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them,§ said Krzanich.The former US treasury secretary Larry Summers has added his voice to calls for bosses to quit Trump＊s panels. ※Since Inauguration Day, I have been  by abdication of moral responsibility on the part of business leaders who have lent their reputations to President Trump,§ he wrote in ※Every member of Trump＊s advisory councils should wrestle with his or her conscience and ponder Edmund Burke＊s famous warning that ＆all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing＊.§The president, however, remained combative on Tuesday, tweeting: Trump took two days to condemn racists for the violence in Charlottesville and was criticized by Republicans, as well as his opponents, for failing to denounce extremism. He has still stopped short of describing as an act of terrorism James Alex Fields Jr＊s alleged use of a car to mow down a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville.Trump sparked widespread criticism when he half-heartedly criticized violence ※on many sides§. According to the Associated Press, the president only made a fuller statement after White House senior advisers, including his new chief of staff, John Kelly, warned him that without a specific condemnation of the white supremacists who marched on Charlottesville, the negative story would not go away and could endanger his legislative agenda.The row has deepened animosity towards Trump＊s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who formerly ran the Breitbart website, which he described as ※the platform for the alt-right§. Congressional leaders representing black, Hispanic and Asian groups wrote to Trump on Tuesday calling for the removal of Bannon and the White House aides Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka, both of whom have close ties to Bannon.※Americans deserve to know that white nationalists, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis are not in a position to influence US policy,§ the letter says. ※In this time of tumult in our country, Americans deserve a leader that will bring us all together and denounce those who seek to tear us apart.§Several companies have said they intend to remain on Trump＊s jobs council, including Dell, Campbell Soup and Whirlpool. ※The reprehensible scenes of bigotry and hatred on display in Charlottesville over the weekend have no place in our society,§ Campbell Soup said in a statement.※We believe it continues to be important for Campbell to have a voice and provide input on matters that will affect our industry, our company and our employees in support of growth. Therefore, Ms [Denise] Morrison [the company＊s president] will remain on the president＊s Manufacturing Jobs Initiative.§"															
"Sterling fell against the dollar on Tuesday after the CPI rate of inflation remained unchanged in July, reducing pressure on the  to increase interest rates to curb the rising cost of living.The pound shed more than a cent to reach $1.2855 on the foreign exchange markets, after the consumer prices index held steady at 2.6% last month, the same level as recorded in June. City economists had expected a slight rise to 2.7% on the back of higher costs for producers following the slump in sterling in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union, which has led to rising inflation this year. The unchanged growth in prices weakens the case for a rate hike by the , even through inflation remains above Threadneedle Street＊s 2% target. The BoE is next due to make a decision on interest rates next month, after more than a decade without an increase in the aftermath of the financial crisis.The latest CPI figures published on Tuesday could indicate inflation is getting close to its peak, according to economists, after the  in the space of two months. Even so, the BoE＊s monetary policy committee had said earlier this month it expected CPI to climb to about 3% in October before gradually retreating.※Although we expect CPI inflation to rise a bit further over the months ahead, the end of inflation＊s ascent now looks in sight,§ said Victoria Clarke, of Investec. She said the question now turned to whether inflation would outstrip the BoE＊s 2% target by more than 1%, a level that would require the governor, Mark Carney, to write an open letter to the chancellor to explain why. Inflationary pressures were visible across a number of import-intensive goods including food, clothing and furniture last month, according to the data from the Office for National Statistics. The rate of CPI was curbed by weaker energy price inflation, amid falling fuel prices.There was a fall in the producer prices index, which shows inflation at the early stages of the pipeline before reaching consumers, meaning that the rise in firms＊ cost pressures eased in July. The data release came at the same time as July＊s retail price index measure of inflation showed an increase to 3.6%, a typically higher measure of prices than CPI which will be used to calculate the  for commuters in England and Wales. The July inflation data is significant because it shows higher costs for consumers outstripping expected growth in pay, which the BoE has said could be hindered by uncertainty over Brexit harming companies＊ willingness to raise wages. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and recruitment firm Adecco said on Tuesday that basic pay over the next 12 months was expected to , well below the pace of inflation, even amid low levels of unemployment. ※Although inflation is likely to start falling next year, we understand some families are concerned today about the cost of living,§ said a spokesperson for the Treasury.

"US gasoline prices have increased to a two-year high as crude oil refineries along the Texas Gulf coast shuttered in the wake of .Prices at the pump are expected to rise after gasoline futures 每 the wholesale prices charged to gas stations 每 increased 5% early Monday, to their highest prices since July 2015.The Gulf of Mexico accounts for nearly 20% of total US crude oil production, and the  Gulf coast is home to nearly a third of US refining capacity, according to the department of energy＊s energy information administration.Phil Flynnof thePrice Futures Group said another reason for the spike in gasoline prices is the Houston shipping channel remains closed. He said: ※Even if some refineries come back online, they can＊t move product. This drove [gasoline] futures to a two-year high and diesel prices spiked as well.  shortage fears are driving retail prices.§The spike in prices is not expected to filter through to consumers for a week and may not last too long. Gas prices have risen sharply following past storms but returned to normal within two to four weeks, according to analysts Pira Energy.But the scale of the latest disaster is still only taking shape. Gus Faucher, senior vice-chief economist of PNC, said it was still too early to assess the impact of the disaster on the US economy. ※The potential for a larger economic impact is there,§ he said. ※Houston metro area is the fourth largest in the country and a lot of its industries, oil production and shipping, are tied to the wider economy.§The impact of other recent disaster such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were felt most in the areas they made land. Houston＊s economic importance could make this storm most costly, said Faucher, but with the waters still rising it was too early to assess the full extent of the damage.As of Sunday, Goldman Sachs energy analysts estimated nearly 3m barrels a day of refinery capacity was offline, representing 16.5% of the total US capacity. Additionally, about one million barrels a day of crude-oil production is now offline, representing 11% of the US＊s current 9.3m barrels a day of current production. Three percent of US natural gas production is down because of the storm.The majority of the refineries shut are in the Corpus Christi area, which were closed before Harvey＊s hit. Houston refineries began to shut on Sunday; Goldman said it was possible the refinery outage figures could rise further.The Eagle Ford shale-oil region 每 which sits on 3bn barrels of oil reserves 每 was in the direct path of Harvey, although further inland. Eagle Ford oil production is currently around 1.34m barrels a day, according to Platts Analytics＊ Bentek Energy. As a precaution before the storm, offshore US Gulf operators closed 378,633 barrels a day of production, or 21% of total crude-oil output and 26% of natural gas production, said according to a US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement survey Sunday.※Historically, onshore production has rebounded faster than offshore production and this would be consistent with producer commentary that loss of production is due to preventive shut-ins for now,§ Goldman Sachs said.With major ports in Houston and Corpus Christi closed to vessel traffic, S&P Global Platts said imports and exports of crude and refined products will be delayed. So far there are no reported oil spills or damages to storage tanks in Corpus Christi area ports.The effects will be felt beyond just Texas, S&P Global Platts said. ※Texas is also a major source of refined products to the Northeast via Colonial Pipeline, and waterborne refined products and crude exports. US Gulf coast refiners exported 2.7 million b/d of refined products in May, primarily to buyers in Latin America and Europe. US Gulf coast refiners regularly export gasoline to Mexico, for instance, and diesel to Europe.§"															
"Many of the anti-austerity policies that have led to a revival of Portugal＊s economy (, 24 August) did not actually originate from the Socialist government, but from conditions set by radical leftwing and green parties to enable the Socialists to govern after they failed to win a majority in the 2015 national elections.Among demands by the Communists, Left Bloc and Greens were the reversal of privatisation, a swift elimination of salary and pension cuts, and a substantial increase in the national minimum wage. These were mostly accepted by the Socialists, who went on to form a minority administration that relies on support from the radical left in parliament.Portugal＊s proportional electoral system is a key reason this anti-austerity grouping was able to happen, because it gives smaller parties seats in parliament. If Portugal used Britain＊s first-past-the-post system, it would instead be governed by the rightwing  Ahead party, which won the most seats in parliament and would almost certainly be continuing the stringent cuts it had previously been implementing.The lesson from Portugal is not just that breaking with austerity is good for the economy, but that a more democratic electoral system provides the basis for challenging the mantra of ※there is no alternative§ by giving a stronger voice to a wider range of political views.If Britain used proportional representation, we would not simply be relieved that  did better than expected in June＊s general election but would be potentially experiencing our own anti-austerity economic revival from a Labour-led minority government in partnership with smaller progressive parties.? Owen Jones praises Ant車nio Costa＊s Socialist government in Portugal for reversing two years of EU- and IMF-enforced austerity. Rightly so. Before Costa took power a year ago, most of the important austerity measures had been enacted. Portugal was ready for a change of direction. This made good economic sense and it seems to be working. The example of Greece, however, shows that political perspectives alone don＊t cut it. Alexis Tsipras＊s leftwing party took over a country that had struggled for four years to reform, against an intransigent body of cartels, unions and government employees. The light was beginning to shine when  took over. Against their promise to relax austerity, they carried on passing austerity measures in parliament, but in practice ignored their own laws. In fact many were reversed. None of the key measures needed were respected. The same group of unions, cartels, politicians and government officers has made sure of that. Has employing more civil servants, or refusing to privatise or reform key industries, helped the Greek crisis? Clearly not, as we face further borrowings.Economists deal with theories. Politicians ditto. If only life were that simple. The problems of longstanding mismanagement defy an austerity versus social spending solution. Left versus right political thinking doesn＊t help. Someone has to have the courage to face the tangled knots of corruption and entitlement that are strangling . Simple answers from Portugal are simply no answer. Owen Jones is right to cite the example of Portugal to demonstrate that austerity is a political choice rather than an economic necessity. But there are other relevant instances. Britain＊s economy shrank during the traumatic first and second quarters of 2009. But under the guidance of Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling there followed no fewer than five quarters of economic growth from Q3 of 2009 to Q3 of 2010. The UK economy was recovering swiftly from the crisis. Then Cameron and Osborne slammed on the brakes and growth ground to a halt.In January 2009 the German government under Angela Merkel approved a 50bn economic stimulus plan.  exited the recession in the second and third quarters of 2009. The most successful economy in Europe turned its back firmly on austerity. Owen Jones could have included Iceland in his roundup of successful post-austerity economies (austerity: never anything other than the ruthless tactic of the Chicago School shock doctrine and the 1% it enriches). Don＊t suppose Owen＊s evidence might convince Labour＊s reluctant wing that the party can now not only be trusted with the economy but is even electable, and so worthy of their wholehearted support?"															
"What Jo Johnson, the universities minister, forgets (, 14 August) is the distorting effect of the very unequal distribution of wealth in this country. Those whose parents or grandparents can afford to pay off their student debts on graduation are not burdened, as are the majority of graduates, with repayment over 30 years via the 9% premium on income tax. In?other words, many graduates from well-to-do families escape having to pay this 9% addition to income tax, whereas those from less affluent backgrounds do not. Is this really a fair system?Nor can a repayment system in which 75% of recipients do not pay off their debts over those 30 years be called efficient. What has driven the system, and indeed its extension to adult education and nursing, is the fact that the Student Loans Company＊s borrowing is, like the notorious public finance initiative, ※off the books§ and therefore does not register as government borrowing 每 until the debt is written off 30 years down the line when it comes back on to the books.I agree with Johnson that it is fair that graduates should make some contribution to costs from their acknowledged higher earnings but, as the calculations by London  for MillionPlus some years ago showed, a straightforward 3% graduate tax paid by all graduates earning above threshold over a 30-year period would be just as cost effective as the current loan system. Such a system would be both fairer and more efficient. But in the short run, it would require accepting upfront government debt 每?a?taboo to the Treasury. For all of us working to improve the lives of young people with disabilities, it＊s concerning to see the government＊s own university tsar admit there is no true equality of opportunity at university (, 10 August). Deaf young people are 50% less likely to go to university than their hearing friends 每 and for those who do make it, the higher education system throws up enormous barriers.I know from personal experience how hard it can be as a deaf student, having being left without proper funding or support for the whole of my first year. It is disheartening to see that the government is admitting that the vision of a level playing field for all young people is still so far off. For deaf young people, and so many others, action is needed immediately. If, on average, graduates increase their lifetime incomes by ?170,000 to ?250,000, they would pay an extra ?51,000 to ?75,000 more tax which, coincidentally, is about the same as the debt they now end up with after studying, so surely this is the way to fund university education? But this complacency, in the face of the much higher drop-out rate among poorer students, is typical of how the Tories view the world. ※The proportion of young people on free school meals is at a record high,§ says , omitting to mention that under the Tories this benefit is under pressure from their penny pinching. So the universities minister now has a crystal ball. I＊d like to know how he, or anyone else, is able to say with confidence that students graduating now will earn up to ?250,000 more during their lifetimes (ie by about 2057). Logically, it makes no sense to compare this generation with my own. When I graduated in 1976 only 9% of 18-year-olds attended university. Now, with the figure nearer 40-45%, high levels of graduate unemployment and an economic system facing years of further stagnation and decline, only a crazed optimist would wish to engage in such specious speculation.

" for commuters in England and Wales will increase by 3.6% from next year, adding pressure to incomes already squeezed by higher prices.The rise, the biggest annual increase in five years, is set by the government and linked to July＊s retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation announced by the  on Tuesday. The higher fares will take effect from January.Economists had expected RPI to increase to 3.5% in July, while rail fares rose by 2.3% at the start of 2017 based on last year＊s figures.The change applies to about 40% of rail fares, including season tickets on many commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities. So-called regulated fares are set by the government but normally provide the benchmark for rises across the network.Unions and campaigners have been holding protests against the rises at railway stations around the country. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said government policies of holding down wages while allowing fares to rise was a ※toxic combination§. He said: ※The private operators and government say the rises are necessary to fund investment but the reality is that they are pocketing the profits while passengers are paying  with rail engineering work being , skilled railway jobs being lost and staff cut on trains, stations and at ticket offices.§The Aslef general secretary, Mick Whelan, called for the system to be reformed, saying: ※The government must intervene to make fares simpler, fairer and cheaper in Brexit Britain. Passengers and taxpayers will rightly be asking what they are paying for.§He said fares should at the least be linked to the consumer price index (CPI), which rose by 2.6% in July, rather than RPI. Stephen Joseph, the chief executive of , called for a fares freeze: ※[The government＊s] frozen fuel duty for the last seven years and we think rail fares should be given the same treatment.§Joseph also said it was unacceptable that the government continued to use the higher RPI rate to calculate rail fare rises. ※Passengers would be forgiven for thinking they are being taken for a ride when RPI has been dropped as an official measure for most other things.§The rail industry defended the steep increase. Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train companies and , said: ※Money from fares pays to run and improve the railway, making journeys better, boosting the economy, creating skilled jobs and supporting communities across Britain. It＊s also the case that many major rail industry costs rise directly in line with RPI.§Inflation had been expected to rise again after an unexpected fall in June, helped by falling fuel prices, which offset the rising costs of food, clothing and household goods.Although CPI did not resume its upward trajectory last month, it is still running above the government＊s 2% inflation target and outstripping the pace of wage rises. That has led to a rising cost of living, heaping pressure on households. Consumers are using credit cards to fund spending and the .Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at data company IHS Markit, said there were still risks ※skewed towards inflation rising in coming months§, while wage growth is expected to remain below 2%. James Tucker, the head of CPI inflation at the Office for National Statistics, said RPI was not seen as a good measure by the statistics authority. However, the Treasury said the use of RPI was ※consistent with the general approach adopted across the rail industry§, while the measure is used to account for inflation in the cost of running train services. ※Although inflation is likely to start falling next year, we understand some families are concerned today about the cost of living,§ a Treasury spokesperson added. Labour said the latest rise meant the average commuter will be paying ?2,888 for their season ticket in January, ?694 more than they paid in 2010. Some are paying over ?2,500 more to travel to work than in 2010, it added. A Virgin Trains season ticket between Birmingham and London Euston will now cost ?10,567, while season tickets on some routes have risen by more than 40% since 2010. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said the rises were ※truly staggering§, adding: ※The truth is that our fragmented, privatised railway drives up costs and leaves passengers paying more for less. The railways need serious reform.§In Scotland, the blow for some rail travellers will be eased slightly as the Scottish government plans to limit regulated off-peak fares to an increase of 1% below RPI, or 2.6%, although season tickets will rise at the RPI rate.

"ll history now, isn＊t it? The credit crisis that , the ensuing banking crash and global recession. One bumper episode from the long-ago past, when the iPhone was a newborn and Amy Winehouse still made records. Now?done, dusted, reformed and resolved. Or so one assumes, from the?official?self-congratulation.The European commission marks the?10th anniversary of the credit crisis by : ※Back to recovery thanks?to decisive EU action.§ Yes, the same clapped-out European establishment that has spent the last decade kicking a can down the road. The head of the derivatives industry body, ISDA, : ※We sometimes forget to articulate the social value of what we do.§ Indeed so: before the crash, bankers  about how the derivatives that they were paid so much to flog were ※crap§ and ※vomit§.Everyone knows history is written by?the victors, but this is something else: bullshit recounted by the bullshitters. Even the banks are back to bragging  they generously chip in to Her Majesty＊s Exchequer, presumably hoping no one will point out that they took ?1.3tn from taxpayers  in 2008.Let＊s get three things straight. First, it was working- and middle-class Britons who paid for the mess, who are still paying for it now and who will keep paying for it decades from now. Second, the crash has prompted almost no fundamental reckoning or reform. And, most importantly, the combination of those first two factors means the crash that began in 2007 cannot be consigned to the past. Today＊s politics 每 from Brexit to Trump and the collapse of centrism 每 is just one of its products. For politicians and financiers to treat the crash as history brings to mind  in Ulysses: ※History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.§Here＊s the stuff of historical bad dreams: at the height of the banking crisis in 2008, every man, woman and child in Britain  each to bankers. The economy tanked, Gordon Brown got booted out 每 and David Cameron pretended a private banking catastrophe was a crisis of a supposedly profligate public sector.You know what happened next: first the kids＊ Sure Start centre closed, then the library; your mum waited ages to get her hip replacement; the working poor had their social security stolen, and the local comp began sending begging letters. Debt racked up through the greed of financiers being dumped on the poor, the young and people with disabilities in what must rank as the biggest bait and switch in postwar Britain. I say that, but we have only had seven years of austerity. If Philip Hammond stays in No 11 and sticks to plan (one must hope he does neither), the cuts will continue until the middle of the next decade. After 2025, who knows what will remain of our councils, our welfare state and our public realm.One truism of this era is that the average British worker earns less after inflation than they did when RBS nearly died. Most of us have seen not a recovery, but a ripping up of our social contract 每 so that over  are now in precarious employment. But the highest earners are way ahead of where they were in 2008. Finance-sector bonuses are as generous as they were during the boom, while a bad year for the average FTSE boss is one in which he or she .In the US, Barack Obama set up the?independent financial crisis inquiry commission, which produced a 545-page report into the causes of the crash and possible remedies. The British equivalent was Alistair Darling creating the , led by a banker. Three-quarters of the combined working lives of its members had been spent either at a bank, or in a closely related field. George Osborne＊s version was the  每 40% of whose authors were ex-bankers.In Britain, disgrace is almost always for the poor; the rich can almost always find redemption. The chairman of Northern Rock, Matt Ridley, can now be?found in the Times chirruping about the virtues of the free market; the Eton-educated viscount spends rather fewer column inches on his past helming one of the biggest-ever recipients of state support. Its former chief executive  is in private equity. Andy Hornby, HBOS boss as it ploughed into the rocks, is now chief operating officer at betting firm Ladbrokes Coral.The banks got bailed out. Their bosses still get paid out. The rest of us get austerity. Whatever technical reforms have followed on from the crash, the economic and business model that created it remains intact. We could have used the nationalised banks to direct credit to strategic industries and regions; instead, Labour and the Tories insisted on treating them as if they were still private sector industries. We could have used the crash to make Britain a far more equal and democratic society. Instead, the UK is still grossly unequal.And so we remain reliant on debt 每 aptly termed ※the raw material for bubbles and crashes§ by Daniel M邦gge at the University of Amsterdam. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the UK is  than it was when Northern Rock collapsed. Government debt has shot up under the Conservatives, but so too has household borrowing. Were the UK to crash again, its government no longer has the political capital nor the fiscal headroom to save the financial system. And with interest rates scraping along the bottom, the Bank of England has barely any firepower left. Ten years of political fudge and failed austerity has left Britain＊s state machinery tapped out.It has also left the country in barely suppressed civil war between those sinking into debt because their wages aren＊t going up fast enough, and the asset holders who got bailed out and then handed out extra money in the form of quantitative easing. Think about?the battles now being fought along these lines: baby boomers v millennials who have neither permanent homes nor secure jobs 每 but a huge chunk of student debt. The metropolitan elite v?everywhere else.In trying so desperately to retain their?position after the crash, the political and financial elites who caused it have ushered in the era of Brexit and Trump. ※They had learned nothing and forgotten nothing§ was Talleyrand＊s obituary for the Bourbons. Much the same will be said of us. Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"															
"The unwillingness of young graduates to move from their home regions is behind a marked drop in Britain＊s labour mobility since the turn of the millennium, a thinktank has said.A study by the Resolution Foundation showed that the share of the population prepared to switch both region and employer in 2016 had fallen from 0.8% to 0.6%.The thinktank said the decline was only partly the result of the deep of 2007-09 and came despite a number of factors 每 an increase in renting, a rise in the number of graduates and higher immigration 每 that would tend to make the country more mobile.It said the evidence was that the decline was being driven by the young, particularly young graduates, many of whom were giving up the chance of getting a pay rise by their reluctance to move. A person under 30 who moves job and employer secured an 11% boost to their wages, the Resolution Foundation said.The stay-at-home tendency among graduates coincided with an increase in the proportion of those with degrees doing non-graduate jobs and, according to the thinktank, was one possible explanation for Britain＊s dismal pay and record over the past decade. In 2001, when 31% of graduates were doing jobs for which they were overqualified 每 1.8% of people with degrees moved region and employer. By 2016, only 1% of graduates moved region and employer, and 35.6% were doing non-graduate jobs.It said international migrants accounted for an increasing proportion of UK regional job-to-job moves 每 up from 8% to 24% over the past two decades 每 and warned the government it needed to be alive to the impact of on labour mobility.Stephen Clarke, a policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ※The Noman Tebbit notion that the unemployed should be getting on their bikes and travelling around looking for work is obviously outdated, but our thinking on job mobility in the UK has not really evolved much beyond it. With only 10% of those moving regions for jobs previously unemployed, the focus needs to be on why there has been a fall in the share of people already in work moving region and employer, a move that leaves the typical earner ?2,000 better off.※Job mobility matters not just for the individual getting the pay rise but to our economy as a whole. On a basic level that＊s about avoiding labour shortages, but more importantly in an economy nearing full employment, ensuring the talent and potential of individuals and firms doesn＊t go to waste is essential to boosting productivity.※But not everyone can up sticks. Alongside encouraging more mobility among the minority of in-work people 每 such as young people and graduates 每 for whom it is often more feasible to move, we should be improving thinking on how people can move into jobs they are qualified for without uprooting their family＊s lives. That involves thinking not just about progression and employment, but housing and transport too.§"															
"t is now apparent that the issue of inequality is the economic topic of 2017. One of the clearest signs of the problem is how the national economic pie is split up 每 the latest GDP figures show the share of national income going to employees at 50-year lows. A recent study by the IMF looks at why less of the economic pie is going to workers 每 and finds that while global forces are at play, the drop in union membership is a significant factor.The fall in the share of national income going to workers is neither a new thing, nor something which is unique to Australian workers.Indeed, in its April Work Economic Outlook the IMF . It found that the share of national income going to labour had fallen during the 1970s and 1980s, levelled off somewhat in the 1990s and then fell again in the first decade of this century:Australia is certainly not excluded from this experience. The decline in the share of income going to Australian workers is in line, and possibly even worse, than in the USA and Canada over the past 45 years:This has real consequences, because declines in the share of income going to labour is quite solidly linked to rises in inequality:The reasoning is pretty obvious 每 wages are more evenly spread across households, whereas income that comes via capital (profits from investments) is more concentrated at the higher end of the income scale.But the question is: why has the share of income going to labour fallen across advanced economies, and what is to blame?To answer this question, the IMF has recently released  which looks at the issue with relation to the USA. Rather than look across different advanced economies, this paper looks across different industries within the USA to see whether the fall in the share of income going to labour is due to industry-specific factors, or perhaps because of the changing nature of work 每 such as workers going from high paying jobs to lower paying ones.While the USA＊s economy is different in size and make-up from Australia＊s, there are enough similarities that make for a good comparison.The paper found that three main factors caused the decline in labour share of income, and they would be familiar to many Australian workers.First, the paper found that the causes were not industry-specific or geographical, but that ※the decline in the labor share [was] common across most states and industries, with varying degrees§. This means the fall of income going to labour was not because people had shifted to lower paying work in lower paid areas of the country, but that the decline occurred in all industries 每 even high paying ones.The biggest factor was ※technological change§ 每 mostly from automation of routine tasks. The rise of robots can not only reduce the need for labour in certain jobs, it also redistributes the income from the worker to the employer.The second biggest factor was that of globalisation. Perhaps surprisingly, here the authors are not talking about the ability to offshore work. Indeed, they found there was no link between the level of offshoring and declining labour share of income.What was important was the competition the industry faced from imports and also the level with which the industry was dependent upon imports to make its products.And the final factor was the fall in unionisation. More important than the impact of technological change and trade, the link between the decline in unionisation and the decline in labour＊s share of income was ※highly statistically significant§ and contributed around 19% of the fall in the labour share of income 每 roughly the same as that contributed by import competition.The paper noted that in the USA, the number of private sector workers who are union members has dropped by 19% since the early 2000s. Such a drop has also occurred in Australia. Since 2011, the number of private-sector workers in a trade union has dropped 14%:But the drop among public-sector workers has been even larger 每 down 18% since 2011. This has seen the percentage of public-sector workers in a union fall from 43% in 2011 to 39% in 2016:And the decline is but part of a very long-term trend. It is scarcely hard to credit that in 1990, 40% of all Australian workers were in a union, compared to just 15% now:That fall in the number of workers represented by a union represents a decrease in the ability for workers to bargain effectively for pay rises. The paper notes that in the USA, the premium on wages in the private sector for union workers is around 20%.The report in some ways is depressing reading for workers. Given the economic benefits of technological improvement and trade, introducing polices to restrict such a thing in the name of improving workers＊ incomes would be woefully misguided.Some factors however do have positive impact 每 the big one being education. The study found that ※labour share declined less (or increased more) in industries that experienced a larger increase in the average education and experience of its workforce§.But while this would suggest increasing the skills of workers and encouraging people to stay in school or go on to further study is important, the report highlights the massive tidal wave of economic forces against which workers are battling.It noted that to completely offset the drag on labour income that comes via the technological change of automation, average schooling in the USA would need to increase by about 2.5 times more than it has since the early 2000s.The forces of economic change and globalisation are here to stay, and while this report finds that policies which encourage education and the improvement of worker skills will improve workers＊ share of income and help in the fight against rising inequality, it also makes clear, that the fastest and easiest solution is to join a union.

"Three issues stand out from your coverage of the Nottingham slavery trials (, 12 August).First, despite the increasing amount of information available, most people do not understand that slavery is widespread in the UK, or if they do, don＊t know how to spot it or what to do about?it.Second, modern-day slavery is found in every form of UK economic activity 每 food, clothing, social care, fishing, hotels, leisure and construction etc.Third, the requirements on companies to investigate slavery in supply chains are weak.

"Britain＊s economic model is broken and produces widespread inequality, the Archbishop of Canterbury has warned in  said the UK needed to make fundamental choices about the direction of its economy, in a study that found the gains from growth are being diverted into profits rather than wages.※Our economic model is broken,§ said Welby. ※Britain stands at a watershed moment where we need to make fundamental choices about the sort of economy we need. We are failing those who will grow up into a world where the gap between the richest and poorest parts of the country is significant and destabilising.§The report by the IPPR thinktank＊s commission on economic justice, which features senior business and public figures alongside Welby, stressed that all political parties needed to reject the current patterns of economic growth that delivered most of the gains to corporations and the richest in society.It said the situation had worsened in recent years as workers struggled to make ends meet after the longest period of earnings stagnation for 150 years.The interim report by the commission, , proposes fundamental reform of the British economy ※on a scale comparable with the Attlee reforms of the 1940s and the Thatcher revolution of the 1980s§.Pointing to rising debt levels, the report called for an urgent public debate on the role of banks and the financial sector in the British economy. It also flagged extra support for trade unions to act as a bulwark against shareholder interests in the workplace. The report, which is expected to produce a series of policy initiatives when it unveils final conclusions next autumn, also said ministers must tackle the market dominance of digital companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google.A spokesman for the Treasury said the chancellor, Philip Hammond, rejected the accusations in the report that the government had cut investment and presided over a rise in inequality.He claimed that employment was at a record high, the public finances were in better shape and the Gini co-efficient measure of inequality was at a 30-year low.But the chancellor accepted that a higher level of investment was needed to promote growth. ※That is why we are investing ?23bn in infrastructure, R&D and housing while also reforming technical education to prepare for the high paid, high skilled jobs of the future,§ the Treasury spokesman said.Theresa May is under pressure to reboot her premiership after failing to gain a majority in the last election. She was criticised from many inside her own party for ditching previous pledges to support the ※just about managing§ group in favour of further austerity.The IPPR＊s initiative has echoes of the thinktank＊s commission on social justice, which provided many of the policies adopted by New Labour when it came to power in 1997.It is understood the commission hopes ministers will accept some of the criticisms in the report and be prepared to implement many of the proposals.Tom Kibasi, the IPPR director and chair of the commission, said: ※We don＊t have a British economic model. We have an economic muddle.※The persistent economic problems we have experienced since the 2008 financial crash won＊t be fixed with a bit of tinkering. There is a growing consensus across business, trade unions and civil society that a radical new approach is now needed.§The commission＊s membership is drawn from a wide group of business leaders and civil society groups including: Dominic Barton, the global managing partner of the consultancy McKinsey and Company; Helena Morrissey, Legal & General＊s head of personal investment; Sir Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of the John Lewis Partnership; Sara Bryson, a community organiser in Tyne and Wear for the charity Citizens UK; and Sally Tallant, the director of the Liverpool Biennial contemporary art festival.John McDonnell MP, the shadow chancellor, said: ※The commission＊s findings drive home the deep problems of the British economy, which have been gravely worsened by seven years of Tory failure that has seen average wages fall and debt rise.※The Tories have given huge tax breaks to the super-rich and giant corporations, but failed to deliver the investment in infrastructure, skills and research and development that are needed to create the secure, high-wage jobs of the future. As the report shows, the result is an economy dominated by insecurity and falling living standards.§The commission has conducted fresh analysis that shows average earnings per employee have fallen by 6% despite GDP per head rising by 12% since 2010. It said that since the 1970s the share of national income which has gone to wages has gradually declined, from 80% to 73%, while the share going to profits has increased. It said the wage share is now the lowest it has been since the second world war.Kibasi said the report＊s analysis found that the economy ※is no longer raising living standards for a majority of the population, breaking the ＆economic promise＊ that has underpinned public life since the second world war.

"Donald Trump has been rebuked by the US central bank chief, Janet Yellen, for  that made the system ※substantially safer§ and did nothing to restrict growth or lending.Yellen, the Federal Reserve chair, used a speech at the  on Friday in the US ski resort of Jackson Hole to warn that policymakers might have forgotten the terrible damage wreaked on the global economy in 2008 when they seek to lift regulations that prevent risky behaviour.※Already, for some, memories of this experience may be fading 每 memories of just how costly the financial crisis was,§ she said.※The core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth.§The president, who has  on the Dodd-Frank law at the centre of banker complaints, is backing calls from executives on Wall Street and Republicans in Congress for looser financial regulations to spur growth.In February, he said: ※I have so many people, friends of mine, that had nice businesses. They can＊t borrow money. They just can＊t get any money because the banks just won＊t let them borrow it, because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.§The Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, has said a sustainable growth rate above 3% a year can be achieved once banks are relieved of the shackles imposed on them by Dodd-Frank.In June, he proposed reducing the powers of the main consumer watchdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, weakening the Fed＊s oversight of large financial institutions and looser mortgage lending rules.The Dodd每Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed in 2010 by the then president Barack Obama in response to the financial crisis. It brought in hundreds of new regulations including tougher consumer lending rules and the need for banks to hold bigger capital reserves. Yellen said: ※The evidence shows that reforms since the crisis have made the financial system substantially safer. Reforms have boosted the resilience of the financial system. Banks are safer.※[The changes] resulted in a return of lending growth and profitability among US banks. Material adverse effects of capital regulation on broader measures of lending are not readily apparent.§Some changes to individual regulations may be warranted, Yellen said, and she mentioned the possible relaxation of the Volcker rule preventing banks from using their own funds to trade shares. A further relaxation of rules that apply to medium-sized and smaller banks could also be part of limited reforms. But overall, she said, ※any adjustment to the regulatory framework should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience§ in a financial system she said was now better able to weather future shocks.The speech in Wyoming could be Yellen＊s last as Fed chair. Her four-year term comes to an end next year and it is not clear whether Trump will reappoint her or she would .Trump has already nominated a new Fed vice-chair of financial supervision, Randal Quarles, who has signalled an appetite to lessen the burden of regulation.There has been much speculation in Washington that a failure to renew Yellen＊s contract would be another step on the road to looser regulation.Most central bank watchers were keen to hear Yellen＊s views on the likely path of interest rates, but there was no mention of when the  or the debate raging inside the Fed over the path of rates in the next few years."															
"or years, Americans have misunderstood the nuclear threat from North Korea, misjudging how to address it. They have also misunderstood the bilateral trade deficits with China, overestimating their importance. Today, as President  threatens new trade barriers against China, on which the United States must depend to help rein in an increasingly dangerous North Korea, these two issues have become closely connected. Yet US officials seem no closer to figuring them out.The stakes obviously are much higher regarding North Korea, with US-South Korean joint military exercises this week aggravating already-high tensions. If the US and  do get into a military confrontation, there is a real risk that nuclear weapons will be used. Even a conventional war would likely be catastrophic.Trade is relevant to the North Korean nuclear challenge, because strict economic sanctions by China 每 potentially including a halt in oil supplies 每 are probably the world＊s best bet for stopping the North＊s nuclear programme (in exchange for certain security guarantees from the US). Trump may well understand this. But he apparently believes that he can use US trade with  as a bargaining chip to secure its help in dealing with North Korea. This is the wrong approach.Trump＊s approach to governance 每 characterised by an unprecedented lack of interest in rules, principles, alliances, and institutions 每 is sometimes described as transactional. Justifications of that approach typically focus on Trump＊s business background, which supposedly makes him the dealmaker the US needs. In fact, Trump＊s behaviour reflects a lack of regard for some of the most elementary requirements for successful negotiation.A skilful negotiator knows that one must look at the game from the other player＊s viewpoint, in order to determine which outcomes they may view as favourable, and find common ground. Moreover, concluding a deal requires credibility with respect to both inducements and punishments.Trump＊s attempts at bargaining with China reflect a failure on both fronts. From China＊s perspective, a nuclear-armed North Korea is undesirable, but still less problematic than the potential breakdown of order in the country, which could produce an influx of refugees into China and bring American troops closer to China＊s border. Against this background, erratic US trade threats are not the way to convince China to apply pressure on its troublesome ally.Instead, the US, along with South Korea, should promise that, if Chinese-backed sanctions did cause the North Korean regime to collapse, China would not be confronted either by US troops north of the 38th parallel or by a unified, nuclear-armed Korean peninsula. In the shorter term, the US and South Korea should offer to pause the deployment of America＊s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, if China adopts and enforces additional sanctions on the North.But credibility on the part of the US president is needed to make this 每 or any 每 strategy work. Unfortunately, Trump＊s statements 每 whether about the past, the present, or the future 每 are often out of touch with reality. On the North Korean nuclear issue alone, he has shown a remarkable lack of consistency, credibility, and follow-through.In January, Trump  that North Korea＊s development of a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US ※won＊t happen!§ By July, the North was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US, and it is believed that the country already possesses the capability to produce a miniaturised, ICBM-ready nuclear payload.Earlier this month, when Trump said that any North Korean threat ※will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen§, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un responded by threatening to attack Guam. Instead of delivering fire and fury, Trump  that if Kim ※utters one threat in a form of an overt threat ＃ he will truly regret it. And he will regret it fast.§ These statements clearly are neither credible nor accurate.Trump has displayed similar caprice and lack of follow-through with respect to China. In December, then-President-elect Trump challenged the ※One China§ policy that his predecessors, Democrats and Republicans alike, had respected. He either didn＊t know that China is more willing to go to war over Taiwan than the US is, or was displaying his characteristic shortsightedness. In any case, on 9 February, he had to , losing face just a couple of weeks after his inauguration and setting a bad precedent for future deal-making with the strategically savvy Chinese.Likewise, Trump backed down on his   that he would name China a currency manipulator as soon as he took office. It was a  threat all along 每 not least because, if Chinese authorities had stopped intervening in the foreign-exchange market in 2015-16, the result would have been a  renminbi, not a stronger one.By now, Chinese president Xi Jinping, like most world leaders, has learned to discount Trump＊s warnings. Trump＊s statements suggesting a lack of loyalty to America＊s allies 每 he took months to affirm his support for article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, Nato＊s bedrock collective defence clause 每 have left even close US partners hesitant to make deals with his administration.The White House is still pursuing aggressive trade policy measures against China, only some of which have any merit. (While the effort to enforce intellectual property rights has some basis in reality, the attempt to block steel imports using a national security exemption is farcical.) But these initiatives will not do much, if anything, for America＊s trade balance, real income growth, or employment. And they certainly won＊t convince China to help mitigate the North Korean nuclear threat.? "															
"ince a revolving door was installed at the entrance to the West Wing of the White House, it has been difficult to keep track of the comings and goings in America＊s corridors of power. Anything written about the Trump administration＊s personnel and policies may be invalid before it is published.At least for the time being, however, the key economic policy actors remain in place. Steven Mnuchin is still treasury secretary and has not been mentioned in dispatches during the latest power struggles. Gary Cohn continues to chair the National Economic Council, though he is reported to be unhappy about some of the president＊s statements on non-economic issues. And of course Janet Yellen is still at the helm at the , at least until February next year.But this stability does not seem to indicate a single settled view on economic and financial policy, particularly the future framework of financial regulation. A remarkable recent  laid bare some major disagreements.Central bankers typically make a virtue of understatement and ambiguity. Fed watchers need to analyse minute differences in wording and tone to identify shifts in thinking. As Alan Greenspan famously told a congressional committee, ※if I turn out to be particularly clear, you have probably misunderstood what I said.§ So the language used on this occasion by Fischer, normally the mildest and most courteous of men, should cause us to sit up and take notice.He argued that the United States＊ political system ※may be taking us in a direction that is very dangerous§. Referring to moves to roll back elements of the new regulatory order established in response to the debacles of 2008-09, he lamented that ※everybody wants to go back to the status quo before the great financial crisis§. And he declared that ※one cannot understand why grown intelligent people reach the conclusion that you should get rid of all the things you have put in place in the last 10 years.§This is remarkable language, which merits deconstruction. Fischer cannot possibly mean literally that ※everybody§ wants to return to the status quo . The academic community is mainly in favour of even tighter regulation of banks, with higher capital requirements. With few exceptions, the press is even more hawkish. Furthermore, I do not know a single bank chairman who thinks that going back to leverage ratios above 40, and tier 1 capital of 2%, would make any sense at all.So who is ※everybody§ in this formulation? The phrase reminds me of my mother＊s frequent observation that ※somebody,§ unnamed, had not tidied his bedroom (I was an only child). But here the suspect is not so obvious. The only concrete proposals to emerge from the administration so far are in . It is true that the paper＊s title, A Financial System that Creates Economic Opportunities, has a political flavour; but the specific ideas it floats are not exactly those found on the wilder shores where ※free banking§ advocates roam.The authors of the paper 每 which was signed by Mnuchin himself 每 want to reform the complex, incoherent and overlapping patchwork of regulatory agencies left in place since the crisis. Former Fed chair Paul Volcker, hardly a lobbyist for investment banks, has been making the same argument for some time.The paper also recommends some rationalisation of the extremely complex rule books, relieving some simpler banks of the most burdensome and costly processes, and reducing the number of required regulatory submissions and stress test exercises. One can argue about the details, but, overall, this does not look like a return to a pre-crisis free-for-all. There is no suggestion in the paper that capital requirements should be significantly lowered, though it does recommend that the capital surcharge for systemically important banks should be ※re-evaluated.§The one worrying section, for a non-US reader, concerns international standards, which should be accepted and implemented only if they ※meet the needs of the US financial system and the American people§. Exactly how the latter will be consulted on the calibration of risk weights in the Basel accord is not spelled out.It is, nonetheless, hard to see why this document should have so rudely disturbed Fischer＊s equipoise. Perhaps he was giving us a glimpse of more fundamental disagreements on financial regulation at the heart of the administration. Or perhaps the Fed itself fears that regulatory rationalisation is code for some cutback in its own responsibilities, which have been expanded remarkably since the crisis.It would be unfortunate if the Fed＊s opposition to change prevented a debate on whether, 10 years on, every one of the changes made 每 often in a tearing hurry 每 make sense, both individually and collectively. After all, many changes in the competitive environment within which banks operate 每 new payment systems, peer-to-peer lenders, shadow banks and the rest 每 require careful analysis and thought.So the US Treasury is surely right to open a debate. And it has done so in a thoughtful fashion. Central bankers should take care not to suggest that there is nothing to discuss, that nanny knows best and the children should not ask awkward questions, like ※Why?§ That was never a good way to persuade a teenage boy to keep his room tidy. It will not work for lawmakers or banks, either."															
															
"The food and drink industry has issued a warning of significant disruption and economic damage if the government fails to stem the flow of EU nationals leaving the UK.Nearly a third of British food and drink businesses have had non-UK EU workers leave their employment since last summer＊s Brexit vote, according to a survey of more than 600 businesses representing nearly a quarter of the food chain＊s 4 million workforce.

This is a scenario that will hurt the UK culturally and economically.§Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents most major British retailers, said: ※An abrupt reduction in the number of EU workers eligible to work in the UK after Brexit would result in significant disruption for the entire food supply chain, with consequences for the availability and price of UK goods for consumers.※EU workers are key to getting British food on our shelves; from producing food, through transport to colleagues in store they are vital in providing the service and quality British consumers demand.§He said EU workers needed more clarity about their status once the UK leaves the .The latest warnings from the food industry came as British businesses faced their biggest challenge in recruiting skilled labour in a decade.

"heresa May sped to Teesside on Wednesday afternoon to launch , a 25-year regeneration project backed by Ben Houchen, the new Conservative mayor of Tees Valley. It cannot have been coincidence that hours earlier in Leeds there was a gathering of an embryonic northern council of regional politicians and business interests, angered by the  of the electrification of the Leeds-Manchester line announced last month. Called the northern transport summit, in fact its ambitions were much wider: to coordinate and amplify a regional identity. As Andy Burnham, , unless the north finds its political voice, ※we will be waiting for ever for a powerhouse§.What had turbocharged the sense of grievance over the delay to the trans-Pennine electrification, and to other out-of-London rail improvements, was  of government backing for Crossrail 2, the ?31bn north-south London rail route. Transport for London had been in a standoff over who would pay, with the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, whose disastrous cost-cutting when he was justice secretary has now largely been reversed. The tension over the London-centric investment of scarce infrastructure spending was worsened by the publication of the thinktank IPPR North＊s now annual estimate of relative funding between the south-east and the north, which showed that parity funding over the past 10 years would have meant ?59bn more in investment for the north. The?government angrily disputed the figures, as it does every year, claiming that the IPPR does not take into account infrastructure investment in one region that benefits a much wider area, like the improvements to the A14?linking the Midlands to the East Anglian port of Felixstowe. The IPPR points out that it?assigns regional spending according to official Treasury figures.But this is only partly about the economic impact of a creaking transport network. It is also about the huge opportunity that has been missed in a decade of ultra-low interest rates that a less ideologically bound government would have exploited for renewal: the country could now be reaping the benefits of development like a national 4G network or universal access to high-speed fibre broadband. Instead, by 2022 there will be little 每 not even substantial inroads into the debt 每 to show for Tory economic policy. Most importantly, it is about the political possibilities of forging a northern political identity that, as old loyalties dissolve and different alignments emerge, could become politically decisive. That is what is in play, and that may explain why 每 with Jeremy Corbyn already on the campaign trail 每 Mrs May headed north at short notice.The shape of politics in a decade＊s time has rarely been quite so uncertain. But if the recent past is any guide at all, the Tories may be on the point of making inroads in the region. Although last June the Tories failed to capitalise as they had hoped on the fall of Ukip, still  in a region that has broadly been hostile territory for more than a generation. If the English divide between provincial and metropolitan, between the citizens of ※somewhere§ and the citizens of ※nowhere§ 每 as they were so infamously categorised by Mrs May in her first leader＊s speech 每 really becomes entrenched, another election might deliver a dozen or more semi-rural and smalltown northern seats to the Conservatives. Already, 15 of the 50 constituencies the Tories are best placed to win in the UK are in the part of England that stretches from the Humber to the Scottish border.Earlier this week,  每 the godfather both of austerity and the northern powerhouse 每 challenged Mrs May to prove her commitment to building an economy that works for the whole country by backing his project. The advice may have been self-interested, but he was right."

The accepted exceptions to this are when the security council authorises military action or when it is in self-defence under article 51 of the charter.Writing a month into the invasion, Marjorie Cohn, a professor of law at California＊s Thomas Jefferson School of Law and a former president of the US National Lawyers Guild, described the US and British attack as ※a patently illegal use of armed force§. The bombing was not a legitimate form of self-defence under article 51 for two reasons, according to Cohn.First, ※the attacks in New York and Washington DC were criminal attacks, not ＆armed attacks＊ by another state§.

To win a war we need to win the hearts and minds of the people. We cannot do this while the most valuable crop they are growing is illegal. Afghanistan＊s economy is now heavily dependent on opium, and at present the trade is run by the , who are sustained by its profits, and export it to feed addiction and crime in the west. The illicit opium trade is one factor in the endemic corruption that is holding the country back. Meanwhile, about 6 million Africans die of cancer each year, their agony unrelieved by morphine or heroin.Five problems, one solution. Buy the opium crop from the Afghan farmers, medicalise it, and use it in Africa. Everyone benefits, except the Taliban and the drug barons.When asked why this is not done, the stock government reply is that some of the medical morphine might leak on to the drugs market.So sad, as Trump would say."															
															
"The pound slumped to three-decade lows against the US dollar after the Brexit vote on worries about the UK economy＊s long-term prospects outside the EU. This month, Sterling has been caught in the crossfire as the euro made gains and the dollar faltered. The pound dropped to its lowest level against the euro in 2017 after Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank,  Meanwhile, dovish comments from the Federal Reserve and political turbulence in Washington fuelled a drop in the dollar against sterling. Compared with the night of June＊s referendum, the pound is down about 13% against the dollar and around 16% against the euro.The FTSE 100 index of shares in big companies plunged the day after the referendum but quickly recovered and ended 2016 at an all-time peak. That rise was driven in part by the pound＊s weakness which helps the many companies in the index that report in dollars and those that export from the UK. The FTSE 100 was buoyed after Janet Yellen, the chair of the Federal Reserve, suggested weak  The FTSE 100 is now around 15% above its level on the night of the Brexit vote. The more domestically-focused FTSE 250 index of midcaps is up about 13% from its level on 23 June.Inflation has risen since the Brexit vote as the pound＊s sharp drop makes imports to the UK more expensive. Last month the rate of inflation unexpectedly remained static at 2.6%, the same level as recorded in June and lower than economists had predicted. The figure, which could indicate inflation is close to its peak, was mainly driven by lower petrol and diesel prices, offsetting the rising cost of food, clothing and household goods. But it will be noticeable to households who were enjoying a period of virtually no inflation at all before the Brexit vote. At 2.6% inflation is still well above the Bank of England＊s 2% target, while it＊s also contributing to the fall in real wages as prices rise faster than There has been , raising hopes that a stronger trade performance can offset a downturn in consumer spending.

Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, was in surplus by ?184m, according to , while City economists had expected the government to record a ?1bn deficit.

Wage growth in the three months to June was 2.1% higher than in the same period in 2016, and up from 2% in the three months to May and a recent low of 1.8% in April. However, adjusting that to account for the impact of inflation, pay was down 0.5% on the year.

"he report released last week by the centre-left thinktank IPPR commission on economic justice comes not a moment too soon. In hosting a, the IPPR seeks to publicise our failures as an economy on the cusp of a ※decade of disruption§. The topography of the economy features some very low valleys: as a nation, the UK is not generating rising prosperity for a majority; a high employment rate masks an increasingly insecure ※casualised§ labour force; and Britain remains a pretty unequal place. The UK is damned as a low productivity economy, investing less than our rivals, with an overall current account deficit that ranks the largest of all the G7 countries.While a picture can be painted that Britain is doing all right, this does not reflect many people＊s experience. Although GDP has risen about 10% since the crisis, disposable income per person has been roughly flat. For some, hope is draining away: a survey by the  of respondents think millennials will have a worse standard of life than their parents.While the scale of the analysis is to be praised, the commission has not outlined the scale of the solution.

"Unemployment fell by 11,000 on the month but there was a rise in underemployment 每 measured as part-timers who want full-time jobs 每 of 14,000. Also there was a big fall in the number of workers from eastern . For the third month in a row real wages 每 that is, wage rises adjusted for prices changes 每 declined, this time by 0.5% for June. Even though CPI inflation was 2.6%, wage growth was only 2.1%. Between April and June real pay was down 1.4%, which means a sharp fall in living standards. Hence retail sales remain weak as consumers are squeezed by the fall in their living standards.The main driver behind this has been the Brexit vote which lowered the pound and increased prices. The claims by some rightwing economists that a free trade nirvana will emerge if there is a hard Brexit has been rightly met this week by incredulity by the economics profession.  It turns out that there is a huge disparity between the overwhelming majority of economists that say we would be worse off with Brexit and the handful that say otherwise.There was other related bad news, including a worsening of the UK＊s trade performance. Despite a boost in exports from the lower pound, this was matched by the trade in goods deficit widening unexpectedly to ?12.7bn, from ?11.3bn in May. Exports fell by 2.8% but imports rose by 1.6%, according to the Office for National Statistics. It was the biggest deficit in nine months and much wider than economists＊ forecasts of ?11bn. The move of the public finances to positive territory for the first time in a decade was a brief respite that will not continue. For the year public sector net borrowing at ?22.8bn in the four months to July is nearly ?2bn higher than it was a year ago.The most recent economic data has not fundamentally changed the post-Brexit picture for the UK economy. Growth is slowing in the UK, while it is picking up elsewhere in the EU. There are two obvious reasons why this is the case. First, Brexit is adding to uncertainty about investment decisions and other long-term economic commitments. Second, inflation has risen because the pound has fallen, and this is squeezing consumers＊ purchasing power. Normally, we would expect a recovery in the other EU economies to benefit the UK. Because of , growth in the UK and other EU economies are now moving in opposite directions.The pound is now extremely weak in historical terms. Since the euro was launched in 1999, sterling has never been below 1.10 and $1.30 at the same time until this month. The devalued pound does not seem to be boosting exports, but it is eroding living standards and squeezing consumer spending.The UK continues to look good in terms of employment, but employment is growing faster in continental Europe. In my view, it is likely that UK unemployment will rise over the next year, as growth is slowing, while the jobless total will continue to fall elsewhere in the EU. Over the recovery following the global financial crisis, the UK has been one of the better-performing economies until now. That may now be about to change, as other EU economies gather momentum and the UK economy falters."

"Worries about rising inflation among UK consumers are at their greatest in three and a half years, while people＊s confidence in Britain＊s financial situation has worsened, according to a survey.A monthly poll by Lloyds Bank found that 65% of people felt negative about levels of inflation in July, up from 60% in June and the highest level since January 2014.The report chimes with Markit＊s household finance index, which is one of the most-watched measures of household sentiment and reported in July that UK households faced intense pressures over costs after a steep rise in prices for goods and services. Inflation was , and is expected to rise to 3% in coming months.

Nearly 80% of people felt positive about their own job security, down slightly from June.The future outlook seems more uncertain, however. The proportion of people who thought they would be saving more in six months＊ time fell to 20% in July from 27% in June. Fewer people also believed that they would be paying off more debt in six months＊ time, with the balance dropping to 15% from 20%.Analysis by Lloyds of its customer account data suggests that people are cutting back spending on essentials such as rent, mortgage payments, utility bills, food and fuel. It showed that the year-on-year growth in consumers＊ spending on essentials fell to 2% in from from 3% in June. Food, which accounts for 40% of essential spending, recorded a year-on-year increase of 2%, down from 4% in June. Fuel spend rose by 5%, the lowest rate of growth since last October, and down from a peak of 13% in April.Robin Bulloch, the managing director of Lloyds Bank, said: ※Despite a slight slowdown in the rate of essential spending growth over the summer, concerns around inflation have continued to build, which has an impact on future intentions. ※With the rate of savings already at a record low, significantly fewer people now expect to be putting more money aside in six months＊ time. While the pressure on disposable income makes this understandable, it does mean consumers are less able to absorb any further squeeze on their finances.§"															
"hen Provident Financial lost ?1.7bn in share value a little over a week ago, a handful of people asked whether this was a Northern Rock moment. The Provident extends high-interest loans to?low-income people, and as such could?be seen as a bellwether in the manner of a sub-prime mortgage company, the first to go under when debt becomes unbearable, the signal that credit is, once again, about to crunch.The immediate anxiety, voiced by the?economist and Green party MEP , was that the financial system may have done something perilously stupid. Again. ※If they＊re bundling up these assets and selling them on, that will be much more serious,§ she said. This is, of course, what determined the depth of the last crash, the wheeze of the , which left no one able to distinguish between a good debt and a bad one. Ten years on from the start of the crash, we could get bitten by the same manoeuvre that everybody has spent the past decade saying was a terrible idea.Yet financial recklessness would only be kerosene on an already-lit bonfire: the real threat of a recession is not from a few bad debtors bringing down a system that is unable to disaggregate them from all the other, decent debt. It might be helpful to discard the terms ※good§ and ※bad§ just to lay this notion to rest, that some people are a good bet and others aren＊t. The real problem with debt is that there is just too much of it.Provident, incidentally, told a different story about its doldrums: it had dallied with some automation 每 replacing doorstep lenders with iPads 每 and it didn＊t come off. In the quest for the ever-cheaper employee, it underestimated how much its business relied on human judgment. This is plausible: and I don＊t just choose to find it so because it kicks against the prevailing narrative that only employers create wealth, and employees are dispensable drones, waiting to be rationalised into cheaper, zero-hours drones.  is a very similar business, and its share price hasn＊t moved.But if the debtors at the bottom aren＊t at crisis point yet, the signs of a surfeit of debt are everywhere. Alex Brazier, executive director of financial stability at the Bank of England, , with average?household debt having . He warned against the economy having to sit through ※endless repeats of the ＆Debt?Strikes Back＊ movie§.There is something obscurely insulting about being warned about household debt by the Bank of England. It never warns employers about stagnant wages, or the government about the benefit freeze. , as if any consideration of the human decisions behind them are too political for comment. But personal debt, miraculously, isn＊t political at all.But that doesn＊t make Brazier wrong. Edward Smythe of the campaign group Positive Money, breaks it down: ※If you look at total outstanding consumer loans, in July, they＊re at ?200bn, an ?18.5bn net increase every year.§ Households spent more than their income by ?17.5bn in the first quarter of this year. Economists are interested in where that money comes from 每 whether it＊s access to credit, selling assets or spending savings. The government is presumably, in some dusty corner, interested in why that money is needed, whether it is a result of pauperised wages每 real wage growth is negative and looks set to decrease 每 benefit changes, or some rush of blood to the head where we all suddenly need Sky Sports and cigarettes but aren＊t prepared to work for them.The sources of all this debt are changing: about half the net increase was in personal contract purchase car loans. Four in five new cars are now bought by PCP 每 an inherently unstable system that leaves both consumers and car manufacturers exposed. It＊s a bit like a mortgage system for cars, except you don＊t own it at the end, ideally you wouldn＊t be living in it, and while a housing crash has been seen before, nobody yet knows what a car crash would look like. Student loan debt is counted separately from consumer loans, and stands at ?13bn a year. However much you think you＊ve accommodated student fees into your picture of Britons＊ finances, it is always astounding to consider how life-changing that decision has been for the younger generation.Other debts are lower in quantity but perhaps more telling: affects about 430,0000 people 每  每 and costs public services, including mental health, police and homelessness interventions, ?1.2bn a year. Meanwhile, , with charities calling for a better social fund, coupled with greater transparency on fees from funeral directors.Expanding credit, as we know from the noughties, can make economies look very healthy, generating spending and a certain devil-may-care nonchalance, but not indefinitely. At some point, servicing the debt becomes so onerous that discretionary spending becomes impossible. The classic canary-in-the-mine watcher doesn＊t wait for a bank collapse but simply looks at the growth figures. That＊s what led Credit Suisse to conclude in July that Britain was ※§, and had a 38% chance of a recession within six months. Just on the balance of probabilities we are due a downturn 每 no decade has passed without one since the 70s. Very few people, outside the delusional bubble of Brexit enthusiasts, are forecasting much growth.The grownups are starting to agree that this is merely the way of the world: we have booms, we have busts 每 we endure. There is some kudos to be gained from recognising and naming the first warning signs, and some reputational damage to be done by naming them wrongly, too soon. Yet this?would not be recession-as-usual. The buildup of debt has come not from?a?decade of living slightly too well, and ready to face the consequences: it has come from a decade of stagnant wages and austerity.Nobody could have predicted how much the last crash would cost the taxpayer. But we know now, and that＊s not all we know: we know that cutting public spending causes untold hardship to very little discernible benefit; we know that , and if any government dealing with the next recession can even afford monetary financing, it must be overt, and have a general, identifiable social purpose. We also know that austerity comes with a narrative 每 the demonisation of poverty 每 which has a catastrophic affect on politics.We don＊t need any ailing canaries to tell us there＊s a gas leak: we need to start asking how to escape this mine.

"A former senior Treasury mandarin has compared  to heroin and called for an end to almost a decade of electronic money printing by central banks. Nick Macpherson was permanent secretary to the Treasury when  officials started buying UK government bonds to stimulate the economy following the financial crisis. On Monday, he said it was ※time to move on§ from QE, which is credited with helping Britain into recovery but remains in use nine years later amid concerns over Brexit.Threadneedle Street initially began pumping ?200bn into the gilt market in 2009 to boost the economy, before expanding the programme to ?435bn, including an extra ?60bn following the EU referendum. The bond buying scheme is similar to massive stimulus packages used by other countries, such as the US Federal Reserve＊s $4.5tn of asset purchases (?3.5tn) and the European Central Bank＊s 2.3tn (?2.1tn) plan. Lord Macpherson＊s call comes as  in a process known as ※normalisation§ almost a decade on from the crash. Some indications could be given at a meeting of senior officials at Jackson Hole in the US later this week. Mario Draghi, the ECB governor, is expected to be the star turn at the event watched by global investors, although he is not thought to be preparing to announce the end of QE just yet.While QE is credited with lowering borrowing costs and helping banks to lend more to consumers and businesses, critics say such schemes inflate assets owned by the richest in society, while punishing savers without large amounts of wealth. Macpherson did not single out the specific bond-buying programme of a particular central bank.  he wrote on Twitter. The former senior civil servant was writing in response to George Osborne＊s former adviser Rupert Harrison, now a fund manager at BlackRock, who had tweeted a link to a In another reply to Harrison＊s tweet, he appeared to suggest that QE was a ※policy which is yielding diminishing returns§. Harrison said people are ※waking up to the impending ECB slow-motion car crash§ and that there were ※political constraints on eurozone monetary policy starting to bite once again§."															
"t＊s often said that the mark of a civilised society is how it treats its most vulnerable citizens in times of austerity. And in the past week, Britain has had not one but two damning judgments 每 the first from a committee room in Geneva, the second in a courtroom in London.Last Thursday a United Nations inquiry into disability rights in the UK ruled that the government is failing in its duties in everything from education, work and housing to . Presented with overwhelming evidence of a range of regressive policies and multibillion-pound cuts to disability services, it described the treatment of disabled people in this country as a ※§.Less than 24 hours later, Luke Davey lost his appeal against his . I  last year, just as the then-39-year-old started his court battle. Luke is quadriplegic, has cerebral palsy and is registered blind. But in this climate of cuts to disability services, after 23 years of 24/7 support, his care hours have been suddenly gutted. Without enough funding for full-time personal assistants, his mother, Jasmine, is forced to fill in the gaps: sitting in the bungalow to ensure he＊s not alone, and lifting her 14-stone son into a hoist. Jasmine, it＊s worth noting, is 75 and has cancer.This is grotesque, but it becomes more grotesque still when we consider this situation is not rare. By this financial year, around 200,000 disabled people will have lost  in income through a combination of cuts, from the bedroom tax to the abolition of disability living allowance. Meanwhile, 1 million disabled people now have to live without the social care they .I am struck daily by the number of readers who tell me what＊s being done to them by this government, simply because they have the nerve to be disabled and, often, poor. Grandmothers falling into depression and anxiety waiting to hear whether they＊ll be deemed ※fit for work§. Middle-aged men with arthritis sitting in a coat in their living room because they can＊t afford to put the heating on. Young disabled women turning to sex work after having their  Living Allowance removed, and having no other way to pay the bills.Bit by bit, the abuse of disabled people in Britain is being normalised. This isn＊t simply the result of newspapers and politicians dehumanising the ※scrounging§ disabled. It＊s that the hardship being witnessed is now so common, so widespread, it＊s as if it＊s beyond comprehension.Resisting this becomes almost an act of defiance: to say that it＊s not normal for a self-proclaimed  to have to be shamed publicly by the United Nations over its treatment of disabled citizens; that it＊s not economically necessary for one of the wealthiest nations on Earth to cut benefits and social care so deeply that disabled people are housebound, hungry, or suicidal.When the ※most vulnerable citizens§ line is used by well-meaning voices, there＊s a secret second sentence that＊s rarely uttered: disabled people, truth be told, do not need to be vulnerable. Contrary to the myth sold by years of austerity, to be afraid, desperate or isolated is not a normal state of affairs for people with disabilities. Vulnerability comes when politicians choose to pull the support disabled people need in order to live dignified, fulfilling, independent lives 每 knowing full well the misery it will cause.※I＊m nervous, really nervous,§ Luke had told me last year when I asked how he was feeling about his court battle. ※But I have to do it. If I don＊t, God knows what will happen to me or my mum.§This was the week this country lost the right to call itself civilised. If that doesn＊t shame politicians to address its treatment of disabled citizens, surely nothing will. Frances Ryan is a journalist and political commentator"															
"When David Cameron set out to create a ※two-speed Europe§ , the former prime minister did so with the words of the Eurosceptic Tory right ringing in his ears.Europe was doomed. Mounting problems for Greece and rising numbers of immigrants showed that Britain must cut itself free from a failing union. Far from prospering from our membership of the world＊s largest economy, the EU was hindering mighty Britannia. Take back control. Let Brussels sink.※We＊ve shackled ourselves to a corpse,§ said Douglas Carswell in the days before he abandoned the Tory whip to join Ukip. ※We pay for the privilege of being members of this poverty-producing club.§How the tables have turned. Britain now appears stuck in the slow lane of a different kind of two-speed Europe. The UK economy has made its slowest start to a year since 2012, while the eurozone grows twice as fast. The former grew by a tepid 0.3% in the three months to June, while the the latter expanded at a much healthier 0.6%. The UK economy grew at an annualised rate of 1% in the first six months, less than half the average growth rate of about 2.5% in the years running up to the EU referendum.It＊s a better picture than the fire, brimstone and oblivion George Osborne forecast ahead of the  vote, but Britain isn＊t keeping pace with the corpse it＊s unshackling itself from.The reason for the changed landscape? Brexit and the economic uncertainty it unleashed, according to David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee. ※Britain is fast become the sick man of Europe,§ he .Looking a little closer, sterling tells the story of our parting of ways. The pound has fallen to its lowest levels in eight years as the UK economy sputters, but it＊s also falling because the euro is gaining ground - part of a broad recovery under way since 2014.British holidaymakers buying currency at some UK airports have been offered as little as 0.86 to the pound in recent weeks. A pound is currently worth 1.09 on the money markets, down from 1.31 before the Brexit referendum, and some economists expect it to reach parity.It＊s at home, however, that sterling＊s fall in value has had its most deleterious effect on the economy. The slump boosted inflation to 2.6% in July and the Bank of England expects the cost of living to rise further, forecasting an increase in the consumer price index to 3% by next month.Higher prices are putting pressure on household spending, a key driver in the UK economy. The impact from the pound＊s fall of more than 16% since the referendum has fed through into higher prices for imported goods, which in turn has pushed up prices on the high street.Consumers are tightening their belts as costs increase while wages aren＊t going up anywhere near as fast. Earnings increased at a rate of 2.1% in June, failing to match the rate of inflation and meaning a 0.5% drop in real income.As a consequence, spending is growing at its weakest rate in almost three years. It was only shopping in supermarkets that kept retail sales growing in July as other retailers＊ business fell off. Rail fares are set to rise by 3.6% next year, compounding the pain.On the plus side, unemployment is at levels unseen since the mid 1970s. That could help increase workers＊ bargaining power in seeking higher pay, but it has yet to push up earnings significantly. There are also signs that inflation could be coming close to its peak, after failing to rise as much as expected in July.There is hope the drop in sterling can make Britain＊s manufacturing sector more competitive as our products become cheaper for foreign buyers, but manufacturing only accounts for 10% of the UK economy and there are few signs the boost has been commensurate with the drop in the value of sterling. Put simply, the manufacturing sector should be doing even better than it is, given the weak pound.Contrast the picture with Europe, where production is racing ahead. The most recent eurozone purchasing managers＊ index, a key barometer of economic activity, came in better than its equivalent measure in the UK for the fourth straight month in July. Economic confidence is at its highest level in a decade. The European commission＊s measure of economic sentiment increased to 111.9 in August, its highest level since July 2007, just before the financial crisis hit.Nor are measures of business optimism in the UK keeping pace with Europe. Results of a survey of company executives show their confidence about future production growth remains at the average levels seen over the past five years. The consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said this suggests firms will only invest cautiously in extra capacity.The latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics show this to be the case in the three months to June, when business investment contributed nothing to economic growth. That indicates that firms are standing on the sidelines, fearing that spending now might be wasted should the economy fall off a cliff in the not-to-distant future. Who could blame them given the cloudy political picture?The TUC has called for the government to leave single market membership on the table to give businesses confidence to invest, a position that Labour, has now adopted. The party with the most socialist agenda in a generation now also has the most business friendly one too.Despite the recent sluggish performance of the economy, City economists expect an improvement in the second half of the year. That could help steady ministers＊ nerves as they negotiate Britain＊s divorce in Brussels, but if isolation from Europe crystallises in the event ministers fail to reach a deal, there is gathering evidence the UK economy will suffer while our biggest trading partner carries on unharmed. UK exports to the EU were worth ?241bn in 2016, and accounted for 44% of all of the country＊s exports. British imports from the EU were worth ?312bnand accounted for 53% of all imports.Cameron failed to build his vision of a two-speed Europe, in which Britain remained inside the EU, but on the edge of a eurozone binding itself ever closer.Theresa May is finding it harder still to deliver Brexit. What form it will take is still up for grabs, with the Tory party riven by infighting and the government having a wafer-thin majority. Without clarity and progress, the economy suffers.Far from leaving a Europein its death throes, Britain is struggling under the weight of the Brexit vote, shackled to its damaging consequences."															
"oday, the unclear prospects of  loom large over our economy and our politics. The vote to leave was, by definition, a vote against the status quo. A majority of British people felt they had little to lose and perhaps something to gain from a radical shake-up of the economy. ※Take back control§ resonated because it was an expression of a feeling of powerlessness in the globalised economy.The general election that was ostensibly called on the question of Brexit rapidly focused on the state of the country at home 每 schools funding, NHS deficits, public sector pay, reductions in police numbers. And the increase in voting by people in their 20s and 30s revealed the depth of frustration among younger generations, so many of whom are unable to access decent housing and are weighed down by mounting student debt. This generation expect that they will be poorer than their parents because they will be.The blaze that engulfed Grenfell Tower shortly after the election ended, upended and ruined lives. Its blackened concrete shell now stands as a boundary stone marking the tear in the fabric of British society. Grotesque inequalities of wealth and power were exposed in the most terrible way imaginable.The pressure has been building for the best part of a decade. Since the financial crisis of 2008, the British economy has been performing neither normally nor well. Outside London and the south-east, no part of the UK has yet seen a full recovery. Many have suffered from deteriorating public services and welfare protections as a result of the programme of austerity that has failed to reduce public debt.What＊s more, real incomes are falling again; their decline in the UK since 2008 has been the largest of all developed countries apart from Greece, Mexico and Portugal and we are in the middle of the longest stagnation of earnings since the 1860s. The economy feels unfair because it is unfair.The political upheavals of recent years have prompted many to ask questions about the root causes. But alongside asking why this has happened, we need to address a more profound question: why is it so hard to see things getting better? The reason is that politically led policymaking focuses, understandably, on solving the problems that are felt in the present and might be expressed at the ballot box. It is much less concerned with the near-term future and not at all concerned with the long term. It is this absence of either a long-term vision or a long-term plan that makes it impossible to see a better future ahead of us.Successful change demands a destination to guide its direction and to bring the country together in common purpose. In 1942, William Beveridge＊s vision of ※full employment in a free society§ gave much-needed direction for the postwar government that created a new economic and social settlement for Britain. We need a comparable vision today.That＊s why shortly after the referendum last year, the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice was established. It brings together a broad cross-section of British business, trade unions, civil society and academia. Its members range from the archbishop of Canterbury to local community organisers to leaders in the City of London; half of the commissioners are women; a quarter are from ethnic minorities. It reflects 21st-century Britain.Later this week, the commission＊s interim report will set out a fresh vision for the British economy, an economy that joins prosperity with justice and builds the common good.Most people in Britain want the same things from the economy. They want an economy that creates broadly shared prosperity, that is balanced across households and regions and that is environmentally sustainable. They want an economy that works for everyone, not just a minority who are already better off; that not only improves individual living standards and wellbeing but strengthens the public goods we share in common; that safeguards the future as well as enriching the present.Vision without action is merely delusion, as a proverb goes. That＊s why now is the moment for major reforms to Britain＊s economy to be proposed, dissected and debated 每 and, most importantly, adopted. For ordinary households, the task of fundamentally changing the economy is urgent as well as important.After all, the real lesson of these turbulent political times is that the economy does not belong exclusively to those at the top of it, whether in business, government or society. It belongs to us all. The economy should serve society, not the other way round. If we don＊t like the way it is working, we need to assert our collective power to change it."															
															
"The German chancellor, , has described big bonuses to car industry executives as unfair following the diesel emissions scandal and called on the industry to rein them in.In an , Merkel was asked about multimillion-euro bonuses for car executives in the wake of the scandal, which erupted nearly two years ago when .※No I don＊t think this is fair,§ she said. ※I don＊t know how the automotive industry is going to respond. They have supervisory boards on which union representatives sit and I think there should be a more sensitive approach [to executive bonuses].§ Merkel added that it was not up to politicians to cap executive pay and bonuses. She said: ※The car industry has made big mistakes which could be subject to criminal proceedings. Loopholes were exploited.§ She described herself as ※annoyed and angered§ by the scandal. ※Trust has been lost and it is going to be very hard to win it back. There is still a breach of trust.§Her comments came after the German finance ministry identified the emissions scandal that has engulfed the country＊s carmakers as a major risk to the German economy.In its , the ministry named the issue as a threat to Germany, along with Britain＊s decision to leave the European Union and protectionist trade policies by the US government. But it said it was impossible to put a figure on the potential damage it could cause. The car industry is Germany＊s biggest exporter and provides about 800,000 jobs.In April, Volkswagen  in the US for cheating on emissions tests to make its cars appear far less polluting than they were.

EU antitrust regulators are also investigating allegations of a cartel among a group of German carmakers, a measure that could result in hefty fines for the companies.The German finance ministry said in its report: ※Risks linked to how Brexit will shape out and future US trade policies remain. In addition, the so-called diesel crisis should be classified as a new risk to the German economy even though its effects are not possible to quantify at the moment.§Europe＊s largest economy relied on strong household and state spending in the second quarter, when GDP growth was 0.6%. Weaker net foreign trade dampened growth, as growth in exports was outstripped by imports. The ministry said it expected the industrial sector to continue its upswing in the third quarter, pointing to robust orders and strong business sentiment indicators. But the diesel problem could cloud the German growth outlook, it said. ※Given the importance of the automotive industry [the diesel crisis] must be classified in the medium term as a risk to the overall economic development.§"															
"George Osborne was a worried man. It was May 2016 and the EU referendum was only a month away. The polls were tight, much too tight for comfort as far as the then chancellor was concerned.This had not been for the lack of effort on Osborne＊s part. He had published  of  and had orchestrated heavyweight overseas support for the remain side from the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organisation and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.But with voters seemingly impervious to the barrage of warnings, it was time to put the frighteners on them. The earlier Treasury paper had predicted what the economy might look like in 2030; the . It predicted a year-long recession, an increase in unemployment of 500,000, turmoil in the financial markets and falling house prices 每 all of which turned out to be well wide of the mark. To put it mildly, this was not the Treasury＊s finest hour.In one respect, though, the Treasury was right. The vote to leave the EU resulted in a sharp fall in the value of sterling, which pushed up the cost of imports and reduced consumers＊ spending power.  每 most notably in the rise in the annual inflation rate since the referendum and the sluggishness of retail spending.Clearly, the economy has not collapsed since the Brexit vote in the way that Osborne said it would. But nor is it in the best of health. Unemployment is falling rather than rising, but the UK＊s productivity performance is woeful. The fall in the value of the pound should help to rebalance the economy by making exports cheaper and imports dearer, but the squeeze on consumers has come through much more quickly than the boost to the trade figures. The retail sales figures would look even more sickly were it not for the spending by overseas tourists, who are finding the UK a cheap place to shop.Following a spurt of (largely) debt-financed spending in the second half of 2016, Britain has fallen back into a low-growth period of around 0.2-0.3% a quarter. Some modest acceleration can be expected in 2018, because by then inflation will have fallen back and real incomes will start rising again. But it will be the wrong sort of growth 每 the traditional UK model based on rising consumption rather than rising investment and exports. Quite simply, the UK lacks the productive capacity to take advantage of the boost to competitiveness provided by a falling currency, so when consumption is weak, growth overall is weak too.The reasons for that are familiar enough. An overvalued currency attracted hot money into the City, but disadvantaged manufacturers. Britain＊s management has been poor. There has been too little attention paid to skills and training. The further education system is not really fit for purpose. Britain has nothing like Germany＊s KfW government-run development bank, which prefers to nurture businesses with patient long-term finance rather than gouging them with high interest rates.Solving these deep structural problems will take time and effort, which UK governments have tended to lack. It has been far easier, sadly, to get a sugar rush by stimulating the housing market. A hollowed-out manufacturing sector and a chronic trade deficit are the inevitable results.Understandably, there is currently a great deal of debate about the sort of trading arrangements Britain will have with the EU and with the rest of the world after Brexit. But in some ways this is putting the cart before the horse. For Britain to have a successful post-Brexit trade strategy it first needs to have a productivity strategy and an industrial strategy.As it pondered the future of apprenticeship quango Learndirect in 2011, the coalition wanted two things: to raise cash and cut down the number of ※Neets§ (those not in education, employment or training). It thought it had found the answer: sell the quango. The result has not been a good advert for privatisation.The proceeds were minor, raising ?36m from the private equity arm of Lloyds Bank, which at the time was 40% owned by the government. But at first, the company appeared to do well. The number of trainees reached nearly 73,000, and over the years Learndirect＊s owners reaped millions in dividends from mostly taxpayer-provided work training young people. There was enough money for the company to spend ?504,000 sponsoring a Formula One team.However, education watchdog Ofsted last week issued a withering report branding its training ※inadequate§ and pointing out that 70% of Learndirect＊s apprentices did not meet the minimum standards. Standards were so low that the Department for Education said it would withdraw all funding from the company.Learndirect knew that Ofsted＊s report was going to be damning and was so fearful about the impact that it fought a court battle to prevent its publication. One of Learndirect＊s concerns was that the report could have such a ※catastrophic§ impact that it might have to call in administrators.It lost the battle and the report was published; the DfE pulled its contracts. But Learndirect has not gone under and has reassured trainees, staff and investors that it is financially stable.Is this because Learndirect＊s parent has set up an ostensibly mirror company 每 Learndirect Apprenticeships 每 which it tells us is a ※separate legal entity§ and therefore not removed from the government＊s approved list?Andy Palmer, Learndirect＊s chief executive, and Ken Hills, its chairman, did not respond to questions. Neither did Learndirect Apprenticeships＊ two directors listed at Companies House 每 Andy Palmer and Ken Hills.Michael O＊Leary is rarely cast in the role of killjoy.

But there could be consequences. If airports cut back on booze sales, they will make less money, and could plug that gap with higher landing charges. This means: higher fares. So there might be fewer drunk passengers for O＊Leary to deal with, but also fewer passengers in general."															
"The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has taken aim at the isolationist rhetoric of  in a pointed speech in which he told US business leaders that free trade was the solution to, not the cause of, global turmoil.Speaking to the US Chamber of Commerce, Davis said Britain would not take part in a ※race to the bottom§ in order to secure new free trade deals with countries outside the EU after .But he conceded that one of the UK government＊s Brexit proposals, a so-called track-and-trace scheme using technology and trust to  as part of a mooted new customs arrangement, may not happen. Asked by a FedEx executive to explain how the proposed regime would work in practice, Davis said it was less likely to be accepted than a more conventional system, adding that it was ※blue-sky§. He said he did not want to see a return to 1930s-style protectionism and hinted that the US president should  on global trade. ※The answers to the problems of the west cannot be to turn our backs on globalisation and trade,§ Davis said, without mentioning Trump directly. ※It feels to me it is necessary to make the case once more for free trade and capitalism.§Trump has been a firm advocate of a new protectionist agenda for the US, prioritising its manufacturing, and has blamed ※terrible deals§ with states such as China and Mexico for much of the country＊s economic problems.Davis said the pace of change ※may feel like a threat§, but said western economies had to find ways to compete. ※There is no future in trying to be cheaper than China,§ he said.Instead, he said the major aim of US-UK cooperation should be a renewed focus on easing trade in services. ※We must work together to convince other countries of the benefits,§ he said. Asked by one business leader if the UK had been able to persuade the Trump administration of the importance of services as well as goods, given Trump＊s particular fixation on the , Davis said: ※It＊s natural I＊m afraid in politics for people to focus on the obvious, and it＊s easy to see lots of cars crossing a border, for example. It＊s harder to see the effect of the virtual world of services. But we are working on it.§In the speech, Davis also appeared to give his backing to cabinet colleagues such as Michael Gove, who has said the UK is not prepared to  on items such as chlorinated chicken in order to secure a trade deal with the US. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has suggested that the UK should be open to more flexible regulations in order to open up new markets. Davis said he was ※no fan of excess burdens for business ... [but] we will not be engaging in a regulatory race to the bottom.§ He said Britain had an ※opportunity to lead a race to the top on quality and standards across the globe§.Asked about the timeframe for a new US-UK , Davis said he did not expect any new agreements to come into force during a transition period after the UK leaves the EU, but added that new deals could be concluded in preparation for the end of the transition.However, he also refused to rule out the UK would paying part of its  during the transition period. ※I＊m not ruling anything in or out. I never do. It＊s an idea that＊s been floated around,§ he said.Davis called the Brexit negotiation ※probably the most complicated negotiation in history and our enemy is time§.He said the UK was going through the EU＊s financial demands ※line by line and we have very good lawyers, so it is getting a bit tense§.Throughout the speech, Davis struck an upbeat note and called himself a determined optimist after the bruising round of talks in Brussels, where the EU＊s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said progress was hampered by a  between the two sides.Instead, it was Fox who continued the  with Brussels as Davis flew across the Atlantic to woo US business leaders.Speaking in Japan on a trip with the prime minister and business leaders to  for future trade talks, he said the UK ※can＊t be blackmailed into paying a price§ when asked whether it was time for the UK to name a figure for an exit settlement.※We think we should begin discussions on the final settlement because that＊s good for business, and it＊s good for the prosperity both of the British people and of the rest of the people of the ,§ he said.Asked whether he agreed with Fox, Davis said he did not want to comment directly. ※We are in a difficult, tough, complicated negotiation; it will be turbulent and what we are having is the first ripple, and there will be many more ripples along the way,§ he said.Davis said he was confident the government would last the , beyond the Brexit cut-off date of March 2019. ※The real issue on Brexit is mostly practical, what is in the mutual best interest of all [of] us,§ he said. ※That＊s the driver. There is a majority to carry Brexit through parliament.§"															
"wenty years have passed since former chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown launched his scheme to promote the British film industry, and in doing so innocently spawned numerous lucrative tax relief opportunities for advisers and their investors.The scheme, which allowed investors to claim back 40% of a film company＊s losses against their own tax bills, ended up meaning that many investors were able to claim around ?40,000 tax relief for every ?20,000 they put into a production. Brown  每 effectively claiming tax relief twice on the same production 每 in 2004, after it became clear it was being abused.There are still tax reliefs for the British film industry and they make up just a few of the estimated 1,140 schemes offered by  on everything from plant and machinery to pension saving.Their complexity, and the fact that they favour companies and individuals with the greatest wealth, means that understanding and exploiting the benefits of tax relief is a vast industry.Every government, including David Cameron＊s coalition with the Liberal Democrats, has promised to cut back on the number of reliefs and tackle the avoidance and evasion it inevitably promotes, and each has failed.In fact Cameron＊s government increased the number of reliefs by almost 100, according to the Office for Tax Simplification, an agency that then-chancellor George Osborne founded in 2010.In 2015, a report by MPs on the public accounts committee (PAC) found that ※HMRC does not effectively monitor changes in the cost of tax reliefs, so is slow in identifying instances where a relief is being exploited for a purpose parliament did not intend§.It concluded 每 despite vehement denials from the Treasury 每 that ※HMRC and HM Treasury often show a worrying lack of curiosity about the cost of tax reliefs§.For instance, the costs of research and development tax relief increased from around ?100m in 2001 to more than ?1bn in 2011-12, ※while the actual amount of business expenditure on R&D has stayed more or less the same§, the PAC said. Today the cost of R&D tax relief is ?2bn and still corporate expenditure hasn＊t budged.It is a safe bet that Philip Hammond＊s budget later this year will include tax breaks to support his modest plans to boost investment and encourage long-term planning.In Britain, there is an assumption that tax incentives are a spur to action 每 for households or companies alike 每 and without them little would change.The argument goes that few people would save for a pension without money off their tax and the British film industry would be left high and dry without the tax breaks that encourage investment. Companies would drop plans to buy the equipment they need without tax relief. Likewise, private landlords would let their flats go unmaintained if the cost were not tax-deductible.In short, the HMRC must forego tax to get everyone from the small-time entrepreneur to the boss of a major corporation out of bed in the morning and off to work. Among corporations, it has become commonplace to lobby local and central governments for cash with the threat of leaving for foreign climes if the money is not forthcoming.Around ?100bn is spent on tax relief, which means that if it were cancelled and everyone just paid the tax that was due on their income and profits, the government would have ?880bn to spend and not the ?780bn it expects to dispense this year.The Treasury argues that in some instances corporate tax relief is only a fraction of the total help on offer. One example is R&D tax credits, which account for ?2bn of the ?10bn spent supporting research and development. It also points out that tax relief is cheap to administer, and that a complex tax system is a necessary response to a complex economy.But the reason the coalition added 100 tax reliefs to its already massive roster was because they were quick and easy to put in place, not because they were effective.Far better would be to spend some of the money on scrutinising the claims of corporations for help. It would be more transparent 每 and their needs might turn out to be like those of a young adult seeking funds from the bank of mum and dad when they are more than capable of looking after?themselves.More pernicious is the use of tax relief to support households. Why does the 45p-rate taxpayer get 45p from the government towards their pension saving, when the 20p-rate taxpayer gets just 20p? When upwards of ?30bn is lost to the exchequer by encouraging pension saving, it is reasonable to ask why the same amount of government support cannot be given to all.For a government that wants to support families that are ※just about managing§, tax breaks are an irrelevance. Most don＊t pay tax, and many don＊t even understand how tax is calculated. They need investment in the things that bring well-paid jobs. And nothing the government has done with its growing list of tax reliefs has achieved that."															
"The most effective deceits are those that are wrapped up in a kernel of truth and Owen Jones is certainly right that postwar consensus-based politics has been damaged by the weakening of the role of the state in a mixed economy and the acceptance of increasing inequality (, 17 August).But that political central ground is defined by the acceptance that there is not a monopoly on truth and thus a willingness to compromise to try to find common ground with those who share core attitudes of openness, toleration and respect for all in our society. That feeds into solid commitments to parliamentary democracy, gradualism, internationalism and the similar seeking of common ground and partnerships with open societies in Europe and elsewhere.This contrasts with the views we increasingly see from the ideologues on the right and left who seek to divide rather than unite by painting pictures of elite or establishment conspiracies, who have a barely skin-deep commitment to parliamentary democracy and the rule of law, and who see international commitments, responsibilities and relationships as either a threat to their project, win/lose battles, or opportunities for sanctimonious posturing while people such as the Yazidis wait to be massacred on a hillside. The absence of a political centre ground committed to a mixed economy, parliamentary democracy and an open society is indeed a loss. Owen Jones asks of ※centrists§, ※Will they raise taxes on the rich and major corporations to end cuts? Will they abolish the burden of student debt? Will utilities be brought into public ownership?§ He should ask the same questions of Corbyn＊s Labour party if it were to gain power in a post-Brexit UK, when we＊ll be desperate for any trade deal and inward investment available; socialist states have never been attractive to international finance. If he really wants the  manifesto to come to fruition his priority should now be to support anyone 每 left, right or centre 每 who is willing to fight for the UK to remain in the EU. Owen Jones criticises, with some justification, the inadequacy of political labels within the Labour party. Self-defined centrists can of course reject this claim because they are impeccably left on identity politics and other social issues. But there is an underlying and fundamental distinction to be made in this Brexit-benighted and austerity-plagued time. That is to separate continued adherents to the policies and philosophies of neoliberalism from those who oppose its continuing and destructive sway. There?is?probably no better way to separate Labour＊s sheep-costumed Blair-type wolves from centre-left and leftwingers struggling, however imperfectly, for alternatives to toxic neoliberalism. It was instructive to read Simon Jenkins (, 17 August) and Owen Jones in parallel. Both identify the central political issue in the US and the UK as the economic position of the working class. Here I am using the term working class in the broad sense of all those whose income relies primarily on the sale of their labour, not in the narrower sociological sense which is commonly associated with the concept of the white working class used by Jenkins. But?the problem is how capitalism works as a system. When there is a crisis, or the economy is stagnating, capitalists will do everything in their power, not just in electoral terms, to ensure they are not the ones to suffer. They will make this the precondition to invest in order get the economy moving again. This is what has recently progressive governments in Latin America and what would face Jeremy Corbyn if he succeeds in raising expectations enough to be elected as prime minister.  Owen Jones has polarised the world a bit further by devising a new category to heap scorn upon. It is a manifesto for de-selection of Labour MPs. ※I can hear the cries already＃§ he writes. This is one such cry 每 he ignores the necessity of building a centre-left coalition that, since the 1930s, has been the only way for?progressives to achieve political power.  In The German Ideology, Marx and Engels wrote ※the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas§. Sadly, the last 40 years have borne this out. Owen Jones＊ timely piece implies this when he writes ※centrists aren＊t pragmatists, they＊re ideologues§ and it is this ruling ideology that the left is challenging. Owen Jones makes an interesting point. Traditional warnings from history may exclude the centre 每 but history suggests that the fight against fascism should not be staked on self-professed centrists with authoritarian tendencies and a stubborn commitment to austerity."															
"t is too early to tell whether  was the result of waning confidence among the nation＊s shoppers or the restraints placed on banks by the regulator.Either way it spells trouble for an economy dependent on consumer spending to drive GDP growth. With business investment in the doldrums and exports unable to make much headway despite the low pound, the consumer is the linchpin preventing the economy stalling altogether.Admittedly consumers＊ appetite for credit is still high and the annual growth rate only slowed to 9.8% from 10% in June. Yet it is increasingly clear that the post-2014 boom in jobs and growth was tied to a period of 10%-plus consumer credit growth and that era now appears to be over.Adding to the gloom, a fall in consumer confidence predicted by the European commission＊s monthly index for August confirmed the trend. Of several measures used to compile the data, the test of confidence in the state of the UK economy over the next 12 months was the worst. It slid to a four-year low, the commission said.Brexit uncertainty is likely to play a big part in this. And while the reaction cannot be described as a panic, households are visibly pulling in their horns.No wonder Lloyds bank＊s business survey for August showed that overall business confidence fell 13 points to a one-year low of 17%. It＊s clear that business leaders can also see a difficult year ahead.There are different ways of looking at the world＊s richest people and how they have fared since the 2008 crash. A glance at the Forbes rich list reveals that the usual suspects are amassing even greater piles of wealth than when Lehman Brothers hit the buffers.Microsoft＊s Bill Gates leads the pack again with a fortune of $86bn (?66bn) followed by investment guru Warren Buffett, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos and Zara owner Amancio Ortega.Facebook＊s Mark Zuckerberg, Mexican telecoms magnate Carlos Slim and Larry Ellison, who founded the Oracle database business, rank five, six and seven, the Koch brothers are eighth and ninth with $48.3bn each, and financial information provider Michael Bloomberg manages a respectable 10th place with $47.5bn.From one angle they are obscenely rich, but from another viewpoint they at least created, or invested in, businesses that employ millions of people.China＊s second-richest person is a property magnate who has seen his wealth increase by $9bn in just the past seven days. Hui Ka Yan has become Asia＊s second richest person (after Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, the Chinese version of Amazon) on the back of a boom in prices. No effort required.So far China＊s property boom has added $43.8bn to the fortunes of the country＊s property tycoons this year, a collective gain of 85%, according to Bloomberg. No wonder economists fear that without a clampdown on credit, a crash awaits. For anyone who still spends time shopping on the high street for clothes, Marks & Spencer remains a strong reference point. News that online, fast fashion operator Asos  is seen by some in the City as a ※seminal moment§ that illustrates the passing of the old in favour of younger, more nimble rivals.Certainly, given M&S＊s problems with its fashions and persistent failure to restock popular lines and sizes, the retailer is an example of how difficult many 20th century businesses have found the transition to servicing niche tech-savvy audiences with fickle tastes.But for much of Asos＊s existence, the difference has been more stark in the relative employment practices. Where M&S paid a decent wage and offered one of the most generous non-final salary pension schemes, according to the Community union many  warehouse workers were employed by the agency Transline on ※unacceptable§ pay rates and with few benefits.M&S staff were permanent and could to some extent negotiate their rotas. The Community union, which has recently begun to represent Asos staff, claimed they could be sent home without pay if they weren＊t needed.Asos claims it was entirely misrepresented by the former chair of the business select committee, Iain Wright, when he called for a halt to such practices. However, Asos subsequently terminated the contract with Transline, increased the number of permanent contracts and raised workers＊ wages by about 10%.The Community union reckons Asos is on the right path. To verify that, the new business committee chair, Labour＊s Rachel Reeves, should prioritise a visit and see for herself."															
"The Chinese government has served notice on the country＊s foreign investment spree in football clubs, skyscrapers and Hollywood as it moves to curb  among domestic companies.The announcement of restrictions in a range of sectors follows a buying spree around the globe during which Chinese firms and business tycoons have taken control of assets including , the US film producer behind Jurassic World and Warcraft, buildings such as  in London, and English football clubs including  and . The curbs were announced in a document released on Friday by the state council, China＊s cabinet, in the latest move to halt a string of foreign acquisitions. This week the International Monetary Fund described China＊s credit-fuelled economic strategy as dangerous, in a strongly worded statement warning that the country＊s approach risks .Raising concerns that some of the companies involved may be taking on too much debt, the council said: ※There are great opportunities for our nation＊s companies to embark on foreign investment, but they also face numerous risks and challenges.§ It added that through the new guidance, the government hopes to promote the ※rational, orderly and healthy development of foreign investment while effectively guarding against risks§.The document limits overseas investments in areas such as hotels, cinemas, the entertainment industry, real estate and sports clubs. It also bans outright investments in enterprises related to gambling and the sex industry. The Chinese government had already flagged hotels as an area of concern, having reportedly asked the insurance group Anbang . One of China＊s biggest conglomerates, Wanda Group, also bowed to pressure from the government when it abandoned the $1bn (?780m) purchase of the entertainment company Dick Clark Productions earlier this year. In 2016 Wanda , having become the world＊s biggest cinema operator in 2012 with its purchase of a majority stake in US chain AMC for $2.6bn. At the same time, the document encourages companies to plough money into projects related to the , President Xi Jinping＊s signature foreign policy initiative that seeks to link China with other parts of Asia and eastern Europe through multibillion-dollar investments in ports, highways, railways, power plants and other infrastructure.As part of his drive for stronger government leadership over the economy, Xi has been moving to reassert control over top state enterprises while reining in sprawling conglomerates such as Wanda, Anbang,  and HNA Group, which have expanded rapidly via debt-fuelled foreign acquisitions. China＊s state planner, the national development and reform commission, said on Friday it would provide better guidance on risks to companies investing overseas in order to prevent ※vicious§ competition and corruption. It also cited unspecified security risks for Chinese companies investing abroad, but did not give any further details about how it planned to strengthen rules or why it was concerned about corruption and unhealthy competition between companies. The UK government approved Chinese state-backed investment in the construction of the ?18bn  nuclear power plant in September, after Theresa May unexpectedly placed the controversial scheme in Somerset under review, causing tensions with Beijing.

"he latest wages figures released by the Bureau of Statistics revealed that Australians＊ real wages continue to fall, and that in the past year wages grew by a record low 1.9% 每 and it also marked the 20 consecutive quarter of falling wages growth for private sector workers.Any hope that wages growth has turned a corner will need to wait another three months. While the Fair Work Commission increased the minimum wage by 3.3% in June, this only took effect from the start of July, meaning any flow-on impacts won＊t be observed until the September quarter figures come out in three months time.And should those figures show some improvement, it will be a blessed relief, because the June quarter figures released on Wednesday showing wages for all workers grew by just 1.9% over the past year are just the latest of a very long slide:For private sector workers the news was slightly worse 每 their wages grew by just 1.8% 每 a new record low, compared to public sector workers having a relatively solid 2.4% growth:The growth of public sector wages came mostly from New South Wales and Victoria. Public service employees in the Australian Capital Territory (most for whom are commonwealth public servants) saw their wages grow by the least amount 每 just 1.6% 每 a rate lower than the national private sector growth.The lowest private sector wages growth occurred again in Western Australia 每 the annual growth of 1.0% equalled last month＊s record low level:But to be honest, it is hardly news any more to say that a new record low in wage growth has been achieved. The last time private sector wages did not set a new record for low growth was December 2013. There have now been 19 consecutive quarters of falling wages growth for all workers and 20 consecutive quarters for private sector workers.The last time the annual growth of wages for private sector workers improved was June 2012:A new record was also set for quarterly growth of wages. In the June quarter, private sector wages grew by just 0.4%. That made it 10 quarters in a row of quarterly growth not being above 0.5%. To give some context, prior to this current run such a feat had occurred only once before 每 in the GFC quarter of September 2009:It is an utterly dreadful state of affairs because it means yet again, despite very low inflation growth, real wages are continuing to fall.In the 12 months to June, the RBA＊s underlying inflation measure grew by 1.84% 每 faster than the private sector wage growth of 1.78% and only slightly less than the 1.86% growth for all workers:It means that private sector real wages remain at the level where they were four and half years ago:And while this is bad news for workers and anyone hoping for an improvement in their standard of living, it is also bad news for the government.As I noted at the time, the budget figures contained some rather heroic projections for wages growth over the next four years 每 predictions which if they don＊t come to pass will make it very unlikely that the budget will return to surplus, because wages growth is a strong driver of income tax growth.The budget predicted that wages in June this year would grow annually by 2.0% and the unemployment rate would be 5.75%. The final result of 1.9% is slightly worse, but the unemployment rate of 5.6% is slightly better. And this is a problem, because generally there is a link between the unemployment rate and wages growth. When the unemployment rate falls, wages growth is expected to pick up. But in the past two years, while the unemployment rate has fallen, so too has wage growth:The problem for the government is its budget projections have wages growth improving very quickly, while the unemployment rate is expected to barely fall at all. The budget actually predicts by next June the unemployment rate will be 5.75% 每 worse than it is now, and yet wages are meant to be growing faster than they are now at 2.5%. By June 2019, with an expected unemployment rate of 5.5% 每 just .01 percentage point better than now 每 wages are expected to be growing by 3% 每 1.1 percentage points better than now. This path of slightly improving unemployment rates but strongly improving wages growth continues until June 2021, when with an unemployment rate of 5.25% wages are supposed to be growing at 3.75%.It is a path that would be rather unexpected 每 especially since the budget would have us believe that in June 2021 inflation would be rising at just 2.5%, meaning real wages growth would be 1.25% 每 a rate not experienced since 2012:The record low wages growth is bad news all round. Bad for workers, bad for companies hoping consumers will begin to spend in the shops, and bad for the government hoping income tax revenue will grow as fast as its budget papers predict it will.

"When Canadian Mark Carney accepted the job of  governor in 2012, he said he was honoured to accept the ※important and demanding role§. It is doubtful he could have foreseen, however, quite how demanding it would turn out to be.As the man charged with maintaining calm in the financial markets and the economy, Carney had the most testing of years in 2016. The year started with wild swings in global markets. As the EU referendum campaign got under way, Carney＊s Brexit recession warning drew calls for his resignation from pro-leave supporters.The shock result sent the pound tumbling and sparked a political crisis. The Bank stepped in with an interest rate cut and more electronic money printing. There was a fresh onslaught from politicians in autumn as senior Tories lambasted the Bank , but after weeks of speculation over his future Carney agreed to stay on as governor for an extra year until the  deadline is expected to expire in 2019.After Donald Trump won the US presidential race on an anti-globalisation ticket, Carney ended the year with a plea for politicians to do more to share out the gains from global trade. Here is Carney＊s year in quotes: Carney started the year on a gloomy note by , saying UK growth was still too weak. Amid turmoil in global markets in January, Carney said the UK faced ※a powerful set of forces§. ※The world is weaker and UK growth has slowed,§ he added. ※The year has turned and in my view the decision proved straightforward. Now is not yet the time to raise interest rates.§His new stance marked something of a climbdown on his guidance in the summer of 2015 that a decision about raising rates would  at the end of the year. That did little to help shake off the tag of  given to the Bank governor by one MP.In one of many warnings to come about the potential consequences of a vote for Brexit, Carney said in January that  每 a reference to the global investors who fund the UK＊s big current account deficit with the rest of the world.※The global general environment has become much more febrile, much more volatile, and relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that kind of environment,§ Carney told MPs.In February at a G20 meeting in Shanghai, Carney argued that  to prop up the global recovery, but he warned that politicians must not rely solely on low interest rates and should use government policy to help boost growth.※Several commentators are peddling the myth that monetary policy is ＆out of ammunition＊ ＃ This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed,§ . In March, Carney was forced to fend off accusations that Threadneedle Street was being too supportive of the government＊s pro-EU line and described as ※entirely unfounded§ the suggestion from the pro-Brexit Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg that the Bank was being politically partisan.※I am expressing the views of the Bank,§ he said. ※We weren＊t leant on by anybody.§ In April, Carney said Britain＊s economy could struggle to grow if the country voted to quit the EU, and warned that Britain＊s economy already appeared to be losing steam before the EU referendum.※Risks around the referendum are the biggest risks facing the UK economy, we have contingency planning to decrease the potential impacts of uncertainty,§ he .At a press conference in May, Carney said a vote to leave the EU could possibly .※Material slowdown in growth, notable increase in inflation. That＊s the MPC＊s judgement. It＊s a judgment not based on a whim, it＊s a judgment based on rigorous analysis and careful consideration. ※There＊s a range of possible scenarios around those directions, which could possibly include a technical recession.§  is confirmed, with share prices crashing and David Cameron announcing his intention to step down as prime minister, Carney insisted: ※We are well prepared for this.§He said: ※We have taken all the necessary steps to prepare for today＊s events. In the future, we will not hesitate to take any additional measures required to meet our responsibilities as the United Kingdom moves forward.§A week after the referendum, Carney said ※some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer§, . In a wide-ranging speech he also highlighted a cocktail of economic, political and geopolitical uncertainty.※All this uncertainty has contributed to a form of economic post-traumatic stress disorder amongst households and businesses, as well as in financial markets,§ he said. ※Today, uncertainty has meant an inchoate sense of economic insecurity for many people, despite generalised economic prosperity. Across the advanced economies, employment appears less secure, wages more subdued, and inequality more pronounced.§ In July, Carney  over whether the Bank had ※peddled phoney forecasts§ about the risks of a Brexit vote. The governor said accusations from critics that the Bank had been dishonest were ※extraordinary§.※We have an obligation to give these assessments. ※If we view something as the biggest risk to financial stability, we have an obligation to parliament and to the people of the UK to make that clear.§ and expanding the Bank＊s electronic money-printing programme to shore up the post-referendum economy, Carney said it was time for action. ※There is a clear case for stimulus, and stimulus now, in order to have an effect when the economy really needs it.§In September, with the economy continuing to show signs of resilience since the referendum, Carney rejected criticism that the central bank had overcooked warnings of a hit to the economy from the Brexit vote. He also defended the Bank＊s post-referendum stimulus package.※I am absolutely serene about the ＃ judgments made both by the MPC and the FPC,§ Carney told parliament＊s Treasury committee, referring to the Bank＊s monetary and financial policy committees. Fielding questions from schoolchildren in Coventry, Carney revealed he likes milk chocolate and dogs.Asked about childhood nicknames, he answered: ※I was given nicknames that were variants of my last name which is Carney, so I was called Carnival, or Carnage, or things like that. I like Carnage a little better than Carnival. It seemed a little more manly I guess.§ Carney made another call in September for politicians to  on supporting economic growth.※The  has long stressed that central bank policies are not the cause of low rates, but responses to them. We are actors in a play written by others.※Long-run prosperity was never in the gift of monetary policymakers. As the 10th anniversary of the start of the crisis approaches, a consensus is growing that escaping this low-growth, low-inflation trap will require a rebalancing between monetary, fiscal and structural policies.§Just a week after Theresa May took a swipe at the impact of the Bank＊s actions on ※ordinary§ people, Carney said: ※We are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side.§ After an onslaught on his performance by the Conservative party establishment, Carney insisted  as he weighed up the option of departing in two years or extending his contract by a further three years to 2021. ※It is entirely personal, and no one should read anything into that decision in terms of government policy, actual, imagined, potential, past, etc. This is a role that requires total attention, devotion, and I intend to give it for as long as I can.§At the end of October, Carney ended  about his future by  until 2019.※By taking my term in office beyond the expected period of the article 50 process, this should help contribute to securing an orderly transition to the UK＊s new relationship with Europe,§ he said.Keeping interest rates at their record low of 0.25% and , Carney and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee said individuals seemed to be resilient for now.※For households, the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence. Perceptions of job security remain strong. Wages are growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year,§ he said.※An excessive focus on monetary policy in many respects is . We can＊t make the structural decisions that change the path of productivity. Monetary policy doesn＊t drive fundamentals,§ Carney told MPs in November.In November, Carney  if their access to the City of London was disrupted after Britain leaves the EU. ※The UK is effectively the investment banker for Europe.§Carney finished the year with a rallying cry to policymakers across advanced economies to tackle the causes of a  among people who felt left behind by globalisation.Speaking weeks after Trump won the US presidential race, : ※From the rising spectre of global terrorism to intensifying geopolitical tensions and financial crises, for too long, for too many people, the world seems to be getting riskier ＃ We need to move towards more inclusive growth where everyone has a stake in globalisation.§He also called for economists to be more honest about the price paid by some for technological advances. ※The fundamental challenge is that, alongside its great benefits, every technological revolution mercilessly destroys jobs and livelihoods 每 and therefore identities 每 well before new ones emerge.§"															
"Households are being left with less cash to spend on treats or to stash away as savings as the rising cost of essentials like food and fuel take a bigger chunk out of family budgets.A new report on household finances from Lloyds bank echoed other signs that  is raising import costs for the UK and trickling through to higher prices for consumers. Household spending on essentials rose at the fastest pace for almost three years in November 每 going up by 1% compared to a year ago 每 and the bank found consumers were growing increasingly worried about price pressures. Much of the pressure on household budgets last month came from  Spending on fuel soared by 5.9% year-on-year 每 the biggest increase since February 2013. That pre-Christmas hit to family finances was in stark contrast to the same time last year when spending on fuel sank by 9.3%.The Lloyds spending power report, which analysed current account data, also noted a relatively sharp rise in spending on food. That was up 1.6% on the year 每 the biggest increase in 20 months. ※2016 has been a year of sustained growth in consumer outgoings, with the steady rise in expenditure on food and fuel driving a significant increase in overall essential spending,§ said Robin Bulloch, managing director at Lloyds.The findings chime with official figures showing inflation picked up to .With the pound down more than 17% against the dollar since the  vote, economists say UK companies will continue to face rising bills for imports such as food and fuel, as inflation climbs further in 2017.Following high-profile pricing tussles between supermarkets and big brands such as Typhoo and Walkers, consumers are becoming more worried about inflation, according to surveys. Lloyds polled households to accompany its spending report and found that the percentage of people who have a negative view of inflation has risen by 11 percentage points over the last 12 months, to now stand at 49%. When asked about the outlook for their disposable income, almost a third (31%) of people saw themselves having less money in 12 months＊ time once all household bills and essentials are paid."															
															
"s the summer of 1929 drew to a close, the celebrated Yale university economist  took to the pages of the New York Times to opine about Wall Street. Share prices had been rising all year; investors had been speculating with borrowed money on the assumption that the good times would continue. It was the bull market of all time, and those taking a punt wanted reassurance that their money was safe.Fisher provided it for them, predicting confidently: ※Stock markets have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.§ On that day, the  was less than two months away. It was the worst share tip in history. Nothing else comes close.The crisis broke on Thursday 24 October, when the market dropped by 11%. Black Thursday was followed by a 13% fall on Black Monday and a further 12% tumble on Black Tuesday. By early November, Fisher was ruined and the stock market was in a downward spiral that would only bottom out in June 1932, at which point companies quoted on the New York stock exchange had lost 90% of their value and the world had changed utterly.The Great Crash was followed by the , the biggest setback to the global economy since the dawn of the modern industrial age in the middle of the 18th century. Within three years of Fisher＊s ill-judged prediction, a quarter of America＊s working population was unemployed and desperate. As the economist JK Galbraith put it: ※. Others were tortured by the fear that they might go hungry.§Banks that weren＊t failing were foreclosing on debtors. There was no welfare state to cushion the fall for those such as  每 farmers caught between rising debts and crashing commodity prices. One estimate suggests 34 million Americans had no income at all. By mid-1932, the do-nothing approach of Herbert Hoover was discredited and the Democrat was on course to become US president.Across the Atlantic, Germany was suffering its second economic calamity in less than a decade. In 1923, the vindictive peace terms imposed by the Treaty of Versailles had helped to create the conditions for hyperinflation, when one dollar could be exchanged for 4.2 trillion marks, people carted wheelbarrows full of useless notes through the streets, and cigarettes were used as money. In 1932, a savage austerity programme left 6 million unemployed. Germany suffered as the pound fell and rival British exports became cheaper. More than 40% of Germany＊s industrial workers were idle and Nazi brownshirts were fighting communists for control of the streets. By 1932, the austerity policies of the German chancellor Heinrich Br邦ning were discredited and was on course to replace him.It would be wrong to think nobody saw the crisis coming. Fisher＊s prediction may well have been a riposte to a quite different (and remarkably accurate) prediction made by the investment adviser Roger Babson in early September 1929.  that a crash was coming and that it would be a bad one. ※Factories will shut down,§ Babson predicted, ※men will be thrown out of work.§ Anticipating how the slump would feed on itself, he warned: ※The vicious cycle will get in and the result will be a serious business depression.§ Cassandras are ignored until it is too late. And Babson, who had form as a pessimist, was duly ignored. The Dr Doom of the 2008 crisis, New York University＊s , suffered the same fate.F Scott Fitzgerald described the Great Crash as the moment the j. It marked the passing of a first age of globalisation that had flourished in the decades before the first world war with free movements of capital, freedom and 每 to a lesser extent 每 goods. In the decade or so after the guns fell silent in 1918, policymakers had been trying to re-create what they saw as a golden period of liberalism. The Great Depression put paid to those plans, ushering in, instead, an era of isolationism, protectionism, aggressive nationalism and totalitarianism. There was no meaningful recovery until nations took up arms again in 1939.In Britain, recovery was concentrated in the south of England and too weak to dent ingrained unemployment in the old industrial areas. The  for jobs took place in 1936, seven years after the start of the crisis. It was a similar story in the US, where a recovery during Roosevelt＊s first presidential term ended in a second mini-slump in 1937. Sir Winston Churchill, who lost a packet in the Crash, described the period 1914 to 1945 as the second 30 years＊ war.Only one other financial meltdown can compare to the Wall Street Crash for the length of its impact: the one that hit a climax with the bankruptcy of in September 2008. Without the Great Depression, there would have been no New Deal and no Keynesian revolution in economics. Roosevelt might never have progressed beyond the New York governor＊s mansion in Albany. Hitler, whose political star was on the wane by the late 1920s, would have been a historical footnote .Similarly, without the long-lingering effects of the 2008 crash, there would have been no , would still be a New York City builder and Europe would not be quaking at the possibility of replacing Fran?ois Hollande as French president.Not since the 1930s have there been such acute fears of a populist backlash against the prevailing orthodoxy. As then, a prolonged period of poor economic performance has led to a political reaction that looks like feeding back into a desire for a different economic approach. The early 30s share with the mid-2010s a sense that the political establishment has lost the confidence of large numbers of voters, who have rejected ※business as usual§ and backed politicians they see as challenging the status quo.Trump is not the first president to urge an America-first policy: Roosevelt was of a similar mind after he replaced  in 1933. Nor is this the first time there has been such a wide gulf between Wall Street and the rest of the country. The loathing of the bankers in the 20s hardened into a desire for retribution in the 30s.According to Lord Robert Skidelsky, biographer of : ※We got into the Great Depression for the same reason as in 2008: there was a great pile of debt, there was gambling on margin on the stock market, there was over-inflation of assets, and interest rates were too high to support a full employment level of investment.§There are other similarities. The 20s had been good for owners of assets but not for workers. There had been a sharp increase in unemployment at the start of the decade and labour markets had not fully recovered by the time an even bigger slump began in 1929. But while employees saw their slice of the economic cake get smaller, for the rich and powerful, the Roaring Twenties were the best of times. In the US, the halving of the top rate of income tax to 32% meant more money for speculation in the stock and property markets. Share prices rose sixfold on Wall Street in the decade leading up to the Wall Street Crash.Inequality was high and rising, and demand only maintained through a credit bubble. Unemployment between 1921 and 1929 averaged 8% in the US, 9% in Germany and 12% in Britain. Labour markets had never really recovered from a severe recession at the start of the 20s designed to stamp out a post-war inflationary boom.Above all, in both periods global politics were in flux. From around 1890, the balance of power between the great European nations that had kept the peace for three quarters of a century after the battle of Waterloo in 1815 started to break down. The Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires were in decline before the first world war; the US, Germany and Russia were on the rise.More importantly, Britain, which had been the linchpin of late 19th-century globalisation had been weakened by the first world war and was no longer able to provide the leadership role. America was not yet ready to take up the mantle.Stephen King, senior economic adviser to HSBC and author of a forthcoming book on the crisis of globalisation, , says: ※There are similarities between now and the 1920 and 1930s in the sense that you had a declining superpower. Britain was declining then and the US is potentially declining now.§King says that in the 20s, the idea of a world ruled by empires was crumbling. Eventually, the US did take on Britain＊s role as the defender of western values, but not until the 40s, when it was pivotal in both defeating totalitarianism and in creating the economic and political institutions 每 the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank 每 that were designed to ensure the calamitous events of the 30s never happened again.※There are severe doubts about whether the US is able or willing to play the role it played in the second half of the 20th century, and that＊s worrisome because if the US is not playing it, who does? If nobody is prepared to play that role, the question is whether we are moving towards a more chaotic era.§There are, of course, differences as well as similarities between the two epochs. At this year＊s meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, held in the week of Trump＊s inauguration, members of the global business elite found reasons to be cheerful.Some took comfort from technology: the idea that Facebook, Snapchat and Google have shrunk the world. Others said slapping tariffs on imported goods in an era of complex international supply chains would push up the cost of exports and make it unthinkable even for a country as big as the US to adopt a go-it-alone economic strategy. Roberto Azev那do, managing director of the World Trade Organisation said: ※The big difference between the financial crisis of 2008 and the early 1930s is that today we have multilateral trade rules, and in the 30s we didn＊t.§The biggest difference between the two crises, however, is that in the early 1930s blunders by central banks and finance ministries made matters a lot worse than they need have been. Not all stock market crashes morph into slumps, and one was avoided 每 just about 每 in the period after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Early signs from data for industrial production and world trade in late 2008 showed declines akin to those during the first months of the Great Depression. Policymakers have been rightly castigated for being asleep at the wheel while the sub-prime mortgage crisis was gestating, but knowing some economic history helped when Lehman Brothers went bust. In the early 30s, central banks waited too long to cut interest rates and allowed deflation to set in. There was a policy of malign neglect towards the banks, which were allowed to go bust in droves. Faced with higher budget deficits caused by higher unemployment and slower growth, finance ministers made matters worse by raising taxes and cutting spending.The response to the Crash, according to Adam Tooze in his book , was deflationary policies were pursued everywhere. ※The question that critics have asked ever since is why the world was so eager to commit to this collective austerity. If Keynesian and monetarist economists can agree on one thing, it is the disastrous consequences of this deflationary consensus.§At the heart of this consensus was the gold standard, the strongly held belief that it should be possible to exchange pounds, dollars, marks or francs for gold at a fixed exchange rate. The system had its own automatic regulatory process: if a country lived beyond its means and ran a current account surplus, gold would flow out and would only return once policy had been tightened to reduce imports. After concerted efforts by the Bank of England and the Treasury, Britain returned to the gold standard in 1925 at its pre-war parity of $4.86. This involved a rise in the exchange rate that made life more difficult for exporters.What the policymakers failed to realise was that the world had moved on since the pre-1914 era. Despite being on the winning side, Britain＊s economy was much weaker. Germany＊s economy had also suffered between 1914 and 1918, and was further hobbled by reparations. America, by contrast, was in a much stronger position.This changing balance of power meant that restoring the pre-war regime was a long and painful process, and by the late 20s the strains of attempting to do so were starting to become unbearable in just the same way as the strains on the euro 每 the closest modern equivalent to the gold standard 每 have become evident since 2008.Instead of easing off, policymakers in the early stages of the Great Depression thought the answer was to redouble their efforts. Peter Temin, an economic historian, compares central banks and finance ministries to the 18th-century doctors who treated Mozart with mercury: ※Not only were they singularly ineffective in curing the economic disease; they also killed the patient.§Skidelsky explains that in Britain, the so-called ※§ kicked in during the early stages of the crisis. Tax revenues fell because growth was weaker while spending on unemployment benefits rose. The public finances fell into the red.Instead of welcoming the extra borrowing as a cushion against a deeper recession, the authorities took steps to balance the budget. ＊s government set up the May committee to see what could be done about the deficit. Given the membership, heavily weighted in favour of businessmen, the outcome was never in doubt: sterling was under pressure and in order to maintain Britain＊s gold standard parity, the May committee recommended cuts of ?97m from the state＊s ?885m budget. Unemployment pay was to be cut by 30% in order to balance the budget within a year.The severity of the cuts split the Labour government and prompted the formation of a national government led by MacDonald. Philip Snowden, the chancellor, said the alternative to the status quo was ※the Deluge§. Financial editors were invited to the Treasury to be briefed on measures being taken to protect the pound, and when one asked whether Britain should or could stay on the gold standard, the Treasury mandarin Sir Warren Fisher rose to his feet and thundered: ※To suggest we should leave the gold standard is an affront not only to the national honour, but to the personal honour of every man or woman in the country.§The show of fiscal masochism failed to prevent fresh selling of the pound, and eventually the pressure became unbearable. In September 1931, Britain provided as big a shock to the rest of the world as , by coming off the gold standard.The pound fell and the boost to UK exports was reinforced six months later when the coalition government announced a policy of imperial preference, the erection of tariff barriers around colonies and former colonies such as Australia and New Zealand.Britain was not the first country to resort to protectionism. The now infamous had been announced in the US in 1930. But America had a recent history of protectionism 每 it had built up its manufacturing strength behind a 40% tariff in the second half of the 19th century. Britain, as Tooze explains, had been in favour of free trade since the .※Now it was responsible for initiating the death spiral of protectionism and beggar-thy-neighbour currency wars that would tear the global economy apart.§ Britain＊s 1931 exit from the gold standard meant it secured first-mover advantage over its main rivals. For Germany, the pain was especially severe, since the country＊s mountain of foreign debt ruled out devaluation and left Chancellor Br邦ning＊s government with the choice between default and deflation. Br邦ning settled for another round of austerity, not realising that for voters there was a third choice: a party that insisted that national solutions were the answer to a broken international system.The reason borrowing costs were slashed in 2008 is that central bankers knew their history. , then chairman of America＊s Federal Reserve, was a student of the Great Depression and fully acknowledged that his institution could not afford to make the same mistake twice. Interest rates were cut to barely above zero; money was created through the process known as quantitative easing; the banks were bailed out; Barack Obama pushed a fiscal stimulus programme through Congress.But the policy was only a partial success. Low interest rates and quantitative easing have averted Great Depression 2.0 by flooding economies with cheap money. This has driven up the prices of assets 每 shares, bonds and houses 每 to the benefit of those who are rich or comfortably off.For those not doing so well, it has been a different story. Wage increases have been hard to come by, and the strong desire of governments to reduce budget deficits has resulted in unpopular austerity measures.  have been well learned , and the over-hasty tightening of fiscal policy has slowed growth and caused political alienation among those who feel they are being punished for a crisis they did not create, while the real villains get away scot-free . A familiar refrain in both the referendum on Brexit and the 2016 US presidential election was: there might be a recovery going on, but it＊s not happening around here.Internationalism died in the early 30s because it came to be associated with discredited policies: rampant speculation, mass unemployment, permanent austerity and falling living standards.Totalitarian states promoted themselves as alternatives to failed and decrepit liberal democracies. Hitler＊s Germany was one, Stalin＊s Soviet Union another. While the first era of globalisation was breaking up, Moscow was pushing ahead with the collectivisation of agriculture and rapid industrialisation.What＊s more, the economic record of the totalitarian countries in the 30s was far superior to that of the liberal democracies. Growth averaged 0.3% a year in Britain, the US and France, compared with 3.1% a year in Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union. Erik Britton, founder of the consultancy Fathom , says: ※The 1920s saw the failure of liberal free-trade, free-market policies to deliver stability and growth. Alternative people came along with a populist stance that really worked, for a while.§There is, Britton says, a reason mainstream parties are currently being rejected: ※It is not safe to assume you can deliver unsatisfactory economic outcomes for a decade without a political reaction that feeds back into the economics.§Economic devastation caused by the Great Depression did eventually force western democracies into rethinking policy. The key period was the 18 months between Britain coming off the gold standard in September 1931 and Roosevelt＊s arrival in the White House in March 1933. Under Hoover, US economic policy had been relentlessly deflationary. As in Germany 每 the other country to suffer most grievously from the Depression 每 there was a dogged insistence on protecting the currency and on balancing the budget.That changed under FDR. Policy became both more interventionist and more isolationist. If London could adopt a Britain-first policy, then so could Washington. Roosevelt swiftly took the dollar off the gold standard and scuppered attempts to prevent currency wars. Wall Street was reined in; fiscal policy was loosened. But it was too late. By then, Hitler was chancellor and tightening his grip on power. Ultimately, the Depression was brought to an end not by the New Deal, but by war.King says the world is already starting to become more protectionist in terms of movement of capital and labour. Trump has been naming and shaming US companies seeking to take advantage of cheaper labour in the emerging countries, while Brexit is an example of the idea that migration needs to be controlled.The US supported the post-war global instutional framework: the UN, IMF and European Union, through the . ※It tried to create a framework in which individual countries could flourish,§ King adds. ※But I don＊t see that [happening again] in the future, which creates difficulties for the rest of the world.§So far, financial markets have taken a positive view of Trump. They have concentrated on the growth potential of his plans for tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending, rather than his threat to build a wall along the Rio Grande and to slap tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports.There is, though, a darker vision of the future, where every country tries to do what Trump is doing. In this scenario, a shrinking global economy leads to shrinking global trade, and deflation means personal debts become more onerous. ※It becomes a vicious, self-fulfilling cycle,§ Britton says. ※People seek answers and find it in authoritarianism, populism and protectionism. If one country can show it works, there is a strong temptation for others to follow suit.§This may prove too pessimistic. The global economy is growing by around 3% a year; Britain and the US (if not the eurozone) have seen unemployment halve since the 2008-09 crisis; low oil prices have kept inflation low and led to rising living standards.Even so, it is not hard to see why support for the policy ideas that have driven the  每 free movement of capital, goods and people 每 has started to fracture. The winners from the liberal economic system that emerged at the end of the cold war have, like their forebears in the 20s, failed to look out for the losers. A rising tide has not lifted all boats, and those who do not consider themselves the beneficiaries of globalisation have grown weary of hearing how marvellous it is.The 30s are proof that nothing in economics is inevitable. There was eventually a backlash against the economic orthodoxies and Skidelsky can see why there is another backlash happening today. ※Globalisation enables capital to escape national and union control. I am much more sympathetic since the start of the crisis to the Marxist way of analysing things. ※Trump will be impeached, assassinated or frustrated by Congress,§ Skidelsky suggests. ※Or he will remain popular enough to overcome the liberal consensus that he is a shit of the first order. After all, a lot of people agree with what he is doing.§ This article was amended on 6 March 2017.

"he retreat of the advanced economies from the global economy 每 and, in the case of the UK, from regional trading arrangements 每 has received a lot of attention lately. At a time when the global economy＊s underlying structures are under strain, this could have far-reaching consequences.Whether by choice or necessity, the vast majority of the world＊s economies are part of a multilateral system that gives their counterparts in the advanced world 每 especially the US and  每 enormous privileges. Three stand out.First, because they issue the world＊s main reserve currencies, the advanced economies get to exchange bits of paper that they printed for goods and services produced by others. Second, for most global investors, these economies＊ bonds are a quasi-automatic component of portfolio allocations, so their governments＊ budget deficits are financed in part by other countries＊ savings. The advanced economies＊ final key advantage is voting power and representation. They command either veto power or a blocking minority in the Bretton Woods institutions (the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank), which gives them a disproportionate influence on the rules and practices that govern the international economic and monetary system. And, given their historical dominance of these organisations, their nationals are de factoassured the top positions. These privileges don＊t come for free 每 at least they shouldn＊t. In exchange, the advanced economies are supposed to fulfil certain responsibilities that help ensure the system＊s functioning and stability. But recent developments have cast doubts on whether the advanced economies are able to hold up their end of this bargain. Perhaps the most obvious example is the 2008 global financial crisis. The result of excessive risk-taking and lax regulation in the advanced economies, the financial system＊s near-meltdown disrupted global trade, threw millions into unemployment, and almost tipped the world into a multi-year depression. But there have been other lapses, too. For example, political obstacles to comprehensive economic policymaking in many advanced economies have undermined the implementation of structural reforms and responsive fiscal policies in recent years, holding back business investment, undermining productivity growth, worsening inequality, and threatening future potential growth. Such economic lapses have contributed to the emergence of anti-establishment political movements that are looking to change 每 or are already changing 每 long-established cross-border trade relations, including those within the  and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).Meanwhile, a prolonged and excessive reliance on monetary policy, including direct central-bank involvement in market activities, has distorted asset prices and contributed to resource misallocation. And the advanced economies 每 particularly Europe 每 have shown little appetite for reforming outdated elements of governance and representation at the international financial institutions, despite major changes in the global economy. The result of all this is a multilateral system that is less effective, less collaborative, less trusted, and more vulnerable to ad hoc tinkering. Against this background, it should not be surprising that globalisation and regionalisation no longer command the degree of support they once did 每 or that some rising political movements on both sides of the Atlantic are condemning both concepts to win more support for their own causes. It is not yet clear whether this is a temporary and reversible phenomenon or the beginning of a protracted challenge to the functioning of the global economy. What is clear is that it is affecting two important relationships. The first is the relationship between small and large economies. For a long time, small, well-managed, and open economies were the leading beneficiaries of the Bretton Woods system and, more generally, of multilateralism. Their size not only made them crave access to outside markets; it also made other market actors more willing to integrate them into regional pacts, owing to their limited displacement potential. Membership in effective international institutions brought these countries into consequential global policy discussions, while their own capabilities allowed them to exploit opportunities in cross-border production and consumption chains. But, at a time of surging nationalism, these small and open economies, however well managed, are likely to suffer. Their trading relationships are less stable; the trade pacts on which they depend are vulnerable; and their participation in global policy discussions is less assured. The second relationship is that between the Bretton Woods institutions and parallel institutional arrangements. For example, while they pale in significance to, say, the World Bank, China-led institutions have proved appealing to a growing number of countries; most US allies have joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, despite American opposition. Similarly, bilateral payment agreements 每 which, not long ago, most countries would have opposed via the IMF, owing to their inconsistency with multilateralism 每 are proliferating. The concern is that these alternative approaches could undermine, rather than reinforce, a predictable and beneficial rules-based system of cross-border interactions. The Bretton Woods organisations, instituted after world war two to maintain stability, risk losing their influence, and the countries with the clout to bolster them seem unwilling at this stage to press ahead boldly with the needed reforms. If these tendencies continue, developing countries will probably suffer the most; but they won＊t be alone. In the short term, the world economy would face slower economic growth and the risk of greater financial instability. In the longer term, it would confront the threat of systemic fragmentation and proliferating trade wars. "															
"Almost every British city depends on the EU more than any other market for their exports, according to a new analysis that underscores the risks to the jobs and growth from a hard  deal. found British cities would have to dramatically increase trade with other international markets to compensate for a downturn in exports to the EU once the UK leaves the bloc. Almost half, or 46%, of exports from urban centres go to the EU, compared with just 15% to the US and 4% to China.The focus on exports in the thinktank＊s annual healthcheck on cities follows Theresa May＊s speech this month setting out a vision for a ※global Britain§. In her first key announcement on Brexit, the prime minister also confirmed the government planned .That plan has raised fears for the UK＊s long-term prosperity, given its strong reliance on the EU as a trading partner. The Centre for Cities said its report showed the importance of getting a new EU trade deal in Brexit talks. It says that while UK cities cover just 8% of land in the UK, they account for 54% of the population, 60% of jobs and 62% of all exports.Data from 2014 shows 61 of the 62 places the thinktank defines as cities send more goods and services to the EU than anywhere else. In the one exception, Hull, almost a third of exports are to the EU, while 46% go to the US thanks to the city＊s strong overseas sales of pharmaceutical and medical goods. Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser has a research and development centre in Hull.The thinktank＊s chief executive, Alexandra Jones, said protecting and promoting exports from cities would be key to improving the UK＊s productivity performance and ensuring living standards continue to rise.※Securing the best possible EU trade deal will be critical for the prosperity of cities across Britain, and should be the government＊s top priority as we prepare to leave the single market and potentially the customs union,§ she said.※While it＊s right to be ambitious about increasing exports to countries such as the US and China, the outcome of EU trade negotiations will have a much bigger impact on places and people up and down the country.§Some supporters of leaving the European single market have argued the move  and also push British businesses to seek trade with faster growing markets further afield.But the Centre for Cities report estimated trade with non-EU markets would have to rise substantially to fill the gap of any EU trade downturn. For example, to make up for a 10% decrease in exports to the EU, British cities would have to nearly double exports to China.The thinktank also urges the government to seek trade agreements covering as many sectors as possible, rather than prioritising deals for high-profile industries based in a small number of places. It notes that some places like Sunderland, where carmaker Nissan is based, are heavily reliant on a specific industry but they form the minority of cities 每 a total of seven. ※For most cities, their exports are generated by a range of industries. In total, 35 cities had less than one-fifth of their exports concentrated in one industry,§ the report notes.It found a north/south divide. Places in the north and Midlands mainly export goods, which make up almost 90% of exports from Derby and Hull, for example. Southern cities have a much greater reliance on exporting services, with nine out of the top 10 cities located in the south of England.The report＊s analysis of cities＊ trade links with the EU showed Exeter was most reliant on it for exports, with 70% going to the bloc. The city exports across a range of industries, including transport equipment, insurance and pensions. Exeter is followed by Plymouth, Bristol, Mansfield, Cardiff and Aberdeen, which all send 60% or more of their exports to the EU.The city least reliant on the EU for exports was Derby, home to Rolls-Royce. A quarter 每 25% 每 of its exports go to the EU, 22% to the US and 5% to China. For Hull, 29% of exports to go the EU, 46% to the US and 2% to China. "															
"he prospect of en masse sounds the lowest note of the austerity politics. Maintained nurseries have enjoyed a level of Ofsted success that the rest of the education sector might look upon with envy. In 2015, , compared with just 12% of the sector as a whole. So my wife and I were more than happy to move our youngest adopted child from his private nursery when he became eligible to attend. Six months later, I would say that that our experience of his new nursery has been similarly outstanding. That was clear from the very first time we attended Cheveley Park, Durham. The walls were bursting with beautiful displays, and the confidence of the staff in dealing with our child meant he adapted quickly and enjoyed being there from the outset. As a result, his progress accelerated quickly. Within a month he could recognise his printed name and made a pretty good stab at writing it too. He now comes home with enough paintings and ※make and dos§ to fill our recycling bin twice every week, and his newfound love of drawing has wallpapered the fridge. His language skills have mushroomed, and the nursery＊s structured approach to phonics is providing him with a solid base that he can build on in reception. The prospect of it closing is outrageous. One clear strength of the nursery is its attachment to the local primary school and the resulting ethos it shares with its educational partner. Our son wears the same school uniform as the older children, is taught by nursery assistants who work across both preschool and reception classes, and performed the Christmas pantomime alongside children from the two years above him. His nursery experience is integrated within the community of the school and, as a result, we know that the transition to primary school ought to be seamless. His first day in reception will be a gentle continuation of his present experiences, rather than a jarring, tear-filled departure.I＊m not suggesting that the key workers in his private nursery weren＊t good. They absolutely cared for the children who attended, but the nursery＊s high turnover of staff meant that a majority of workers there were very young and so had, by definition, limited experience. Conversely, the staff profile working within his state-maintained nursery hasn＊t changed for 10 years. The level of experience that this produces, the resources that those staff have built up over the years and the implementation of refined working practices doesn＊t compare at all with the private nursery he attended before. Perhaps the most important outcome of his attendance at Cheveley Park is the development of his social skills. The lack of focused activities in his previous nursery meant that he was often left to his own devices for large chunks of the day. We quite often arrived at his nursery to find him looking a little lost by the sandpit with the same dinosaur in his hand that he was playing with the previous day. By contrast, his present nursery works hard to make sure that he interacts with his peers, and he seems like an altogether more confident little boy.It is this experience that leads us to believe that organisations like Cheveley Park ought to be celebrated. Their remit ought to be extended rather than diminished. High-quality nursery education is a fundamental social leveller, and an outstanding nursery primer shouldn＊t be thwarted by financial restrictions. Indeed, if we are serious about correcting our lack of social mobility, a professionally determined preschool should sit at the heart of every community."															
"he story has rather got lost in the midst of Donald Trump＊s statements this week about his fabled wall, the merits of torture, and all the other stuff that has underlined the frightening nature of his arrival in power 每 but on Monday, the new president hosted a remarkable meeting.In the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Trump held : among them, the presidents of the , the , and the . Despite US unions overwhelmingly backing Hillary Clinton 每 the carpenters, for example, recently warned that ※§ 每 all was apparently warmth and cordiality.※The respect that the president of the United States just showed us ＃ was nothing short of incredible,§ , president of the umbrella organisation . He then praised Trump＊s plans for infrastructure, trade and energy policy, and looked ahead to the administration ※putting America back to work§, with ※the middle class jobs our members and all Americans are demanding§.Welcome, once again, to the element of Trump-ism that liberal dismay drowns out, but which partly accounts for the fact that this most unqualified of presidents is in office 每 and which, for all his dismal approval ratings, is surely playing pretty well in the post-industrial places whose support took him over the line in November.Understand that, and you may realise why his loudly ridiculed  may have sounded potent and promising to millions of Americans. Through the same prism, moreover, you might be able to discern something too often overlooked: that amid Trump＊s lies and bigotry, there may lurk a political project of spectacular daring. In the way it put Trump on political ground long assumed to belong to the Democrats, one US columnist said the summit with the unions represented a ※§. The same applies to his economic policy on the whole.Put simply, Trump and his people want to eat the American left＊s lunch. At the same time, they intend to shred the Republican party＊s ingrained belief in laissez-faire economics, reset rightwing politics 每 somehow bagging ※60% of the white vote, and 40% of the black and Hispanic vote§ 每 whereupon a new dawn will break and ※we＊ll govern for 50 years§. The quotes come from the  gave to the writer Michael Wolff, a few days after Trump was?elected. ※Like [Andrew] Jackson＊s populism, we＊re going to build an entirely new political movement,§ he said. ※It＊s everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy＃ With negative interest rates throughout the world, it＊s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Shipyards, ironworks, get them all jacked up ＃ It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution 每 conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.§Trump , with a familiar sense that he hasn＊t fully thought things through: ※We are going to put a lot of people back to work. We are going to use common sense and we are going to do it the way it is supposed to be done.§On the face of it, half this project rests on visions of America＊s threadbare infrastructure being rebuilt, and gleaming roads, bridges and airports standing as monuments to Trump＊s reign. The remainder seems to be all about bringing home manufacturing jobs said to have been shifted abroad, using a mixture of protectionism, the lifting of regulation, loud threats to errant corporations, and the engendering of a new patriotic spirit.Whether the  will materialise is partly down to politics: essentially, whether Republicans in Congress will endorse a huge burst of the kind of economic interventionism they have been trained to hate for the best part of 40 years. It also rests on simple maths, and how on earth Trump and his people might square the kind of fiscal activism not seen since the 1930s with his plans to slash taxes.Trump has vaguely talked about public-private partnerships and tax breaks for infrastructure companies; by way of calling his bluff, Democrats in the Senate have  they say could largely be funded by the federal government. But there is undoubtedly something worth discussing here: America＊s fabric is in a mess, you can just about imagine squads of newly hired workers restoring it, and the huge economic stimulus that would create.But Trump＊s plans for a renaissance of manufacturing work are something else. Ford and General Motors, he said this week, were ※§ and thereby ※bring jobs back to America, like I promised on the campaign trail§. But how? It is one of the more overlooked facets of the modern American economy that many manufacturing businesses are already coming back to the US because automation means that labour costs are no longer a deal-breaker: a robot is even cheaper than a Chinese worker, so ※§ is a rational choice.Manufacturing businesses depend less and less on workers. Among plenty of examples, one in particular highlights the contrast between Trump＊s plans and reality: in , a General Motors factory runs night and day, making engines for such hugely popular cars as the Chevrolet Tahoe. This might suggest a portent of where Trump might take the US economy, were it not for the fact that  than 10?years ago.In the words of a recent report in the Financial Times: ※In places like Buffalo there is evidence that US manufacturing has a bright future. It just does not look like a future that will include millions of jobs.§ This is a truth that eludes dozens of politicians (including Trump＊s new friend Theresa May,  is smattered with promises of ※good§ and ※secure§ jobs, but no credible idea of how they might be created). If Trump＊s plans for jobs somehow work, he will become even more formidable. If they don＊t, their failure will not just take down his political project, but arguably threaten a much bigger idea: that old-fashioned, secure jobs are still a viable economic option, and that politicians can deliver them.If this is a delusion, it applies just as much to the Democrats as to the new Trumpite Republicans (witness the pledge in  of ※a full-employment economy, where everyone has a job that pays enough to raise a family and live in dignity§). Across the world, in fact, what remains of the left and centre-left remains stubbornly wedded to visions of crowded production lines and the glories of the archetypal worker.A more future-fit politics, built around the declining importance of paid employment and the need to rebuild policy accordingly, has yet to take shape; for the moment, the left and the hard right are awkwardly united not just in their disdain for globalisation, but?also in their belief that politicians can get their countries back to an idyll of factories extending to the horizon and jobs for all.Trump, of all people, may be about to test that idea to destruction. In other words, watch out lefties: this most reckless, nasty, dangerous man is playing not just with his chips, but yours too."															
"t＊s official. The north-south divide in Britain is now wider than at any time since the beginning of the industrial revolution 每 wider than when Charles Dickens was writing about Victorian squalor, and wider than in the depression years of the 1930s, when George Orwell exposed the grinding poverty of northern England in .Remarkable new evidence from a?study by the academic Philip McCann, The UK Regional-National Economic Problem, shows that while economic output per head, measured by gross value added, is near ?43,000 a year in London 每 and as high as ?135,000 in inner west London 每 almost half the UK population lives, in regions where output per head is below ?22,325.Indeed the regional divide is so vast that, at ?13,500 per person, economic output in Gwent, , is a tenth that of one of the wealthiest part of London; and in the Tees and Welsh valleys it has now fallen below that of Lithuania, Slovenia and Slovakia.Of course, in both the north and south we are all better off than 100 years ago, but the divide in income, jobs and pay is increasing faster than ever. Average household incomes in Wales, Northern Ireland and the northern regions of England are around 60% of those in Greater London. Last year, when jobs rose by 277,000 in London they rose by only 1,000 in the north-west and fell by 40,000 in the north-east. In London 10% of workers are officially low paid. In the north the figure is 25%.It was a revolt of the regions 每 northern industrial towns hit by wave after wave of crushing global change 每 that pushed the Brexit vote over the edge. Sadly, with the north more dependent on European trade 每 59% of the north-east＊s goods exports go to the European Union against only 39% of London＊s 每 the post-referendum optimism felt by northern leave voters will be short lived, as standards of living fall faster and even more jobs are lost in leave-voting areas.Nothing the chancellor＊s autumn statement can offer will be sufficient to bridge this divide. Historical gaps in infrastructure spending are set only to widen over the next few years: transport investment per head will be ?1,900 a year in London between now and 2020 but less than ?300 in the north-east. Three-quarters of Government and Research Council research and development spending is in the southern third of the country while the north-east receives only 7%. Even talk of a ※§ cannot obscure a cut in regional aid from ?3.3bn a year in the first decade of the century to around ?2bn in the second.All this leaves us with a United Kingdom that is united in name only. Britain now has the most extreme inter-regional inequalities of any country in western Europe, yet the biggest concentration of political power in a centre that is singularly ill equipped to narrow the divide. Quite simply, our London-centric constitution has failed to unlock the potential, unleash the enterprise, or even meet the needs and aspirations of, our northern regions.And this centralisation does not even meet the needs of London. While northern communities live with long-term unemployment, forced migration and in some cases depopulation, the capital city struggles with congestion, overheating, high house prices and poor housing supply 每 challenges that a more balanced regional policy could address.So we need to engage the regions and nations in a UK每wide debate that is about much more than the terms of Brexit. For this reason, I advocate a People＊s Constitutional Convention, modelled on the successful Scottish convention of 1989, which energised  and built a consensus for progressive change. Such a gathering should start with everyday concerns 每 how to create more jobs, raise living standards and improve services 每 and ask what constitutional settlement can best meet our needs and aspirations.A people＊s convention could propose more power for the north and, in turn, encourage an outpouring of innovation, creativity and local decision-making in each region and nation. Such a convention could explore a more federal way for resolving the future role of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the UK.After last week＊s , the regions and nations could unite and demand a better deal under article 50. Powers now held in Brussels 每 from decisions concerning regional policy, agriculture and fisheries, to social and environmental protection 每 should be repatriated not to Whitehall but to the regions and nations, giving them power over ?2bn-?3bn of public spending.There is no going back to pre-23 June Britain. What is open to us is a fresh and more expansive vision of Britain than the Tory Brexiteers could ever deliver, in which we view Britain not through the lens of London but as an association of four nations and many distinct regions, whose potential remains largely untapped, and which are at their best when local initiative is unlocked and the right balance is struck between the autonomy our communities desire and the co-operation we need.A new and different Britain 每 empowered, confident and outward-looking 每 is the answer to the harsher, shriller version of Brexit Britain on display at the Conservative conference. A party that questions the right of EU nationals to stay in Britain, then proposes employers single out the foreigners in their workforces, and ridicules any notion that we could think of ourselves as citizens of both Britain and the world, is not going to build the Britain our young people want.The Labour party should now ask the government to sponsor a convention. If ministers refuse 每 as happened in Scotland in 1989 每 then Labour should invite the other political parties to join them. The convention should engage citizens outside the established political process and should rule out nothing 每 from a written constitution on federal lines to an elected Senate of the Nations and Regions to replace the unelected House of Lords. Out of such a gathering can emerge a more tolerant, inclusive, equal and outward-looking Britain 每 the best alternative to the Conservatives＊ hard-Brexit Britain. For an even bigger decision than what type of Brexit we want to end up with is what kind of nation we seek to become."															
"hen community action is matched with local democratic powers we can halt big developers building second homes for wealthy visitors 每  has shown 每 and boost affordable developments that meet the needs of local people 每 as proposed by the .At the  we＊re working on scaling up the possibilities for community-led housing. We are furthering the case for large scale, democratically run social housing models, such as renters cooperatives, and the rolling out of ownership models that offer long term security but with less debt, such as community land trust homes and mutual home ownership schemes. With levels of home ownership at an all-time low, the promise of right to buy to give more people a share in the nation＊s property wealth has failed dramatically. In fact, in the midst of today＊s housing crisis, people in all tenures are losing what control they had over their homes and the areas in which they live. The loss of social housing puts those who cannot afford to buy at the mercy of private landlords, with weak protections against eviction or rent hikes. Even those who own a home are not really in control. Home ownership does not mean safety, security or control if you find yourself unable to pay the mortgage, or in negative equity. Not just individually, but as a society we＊ve lost control of our housing system. With the house price gap between regions growing bigger since the Brexit vote, and a London-driven housing bubble looming over the wider economy, this is the time to ask: what would real control look like over how we do housing? Some communities affected by the housing crisis are managing to change how it affects people in their area. We could learn from their achievements in seizing back some control.Groups such as like Focus E15,  and the Butterfields Estate residents, who have proposed alternative plans for preserving and improving their homes, demonstrate the resilience and ingenuity of London tenants threatened with eviction. Another example is St Ives＊ , which shows a commitment by the community to prioritise local need over wealth from holiday makers. And the building of affordable homes through urban community land trusts 每 such as developments going up in Liverpool, Bournemouth, Bristol and Leeds this year 每 shows demand for models of ownership that allow people long term security in a home, without the expectation of rising prices. It is this price expectation that has been turning homes into assets for 40 years. But endeavours like these are up against it. The soaring value of land, particularly in cities, skews the wider market and encourages developers to hoard sites while prices climb.  At the New  Foundation we are pursuing routes to enable communities, in partnership with local institutions and civic powers, to take back some control over housing locally. The aim is to empower more people to demand and create housing projects that really meet real local need. What could this look like?In Wales the government is working in partnership with the Welsh Cooperative Centre and Confederation of Cooperative  to build homes led by local communities that are cooperatively managed. Across the rest of the UK, community-led projects have not yet gained similar levels of political championship, but are nonetheless catching the attention of many local authorities struggling to provide affordable homes and protect them from being lost to private landlords through right to buy.  One way non-profit and low cost housing can work for all types of locations and people is to keep as much land as possible in public or community ownership. As public land is sold off, we＊re working to improve local knowledge and interest in sites we already own, and devising ways to level the playing field of who gets access. Without action, private developers backed by big finance will continue to win. The housing crisis will not be solved by communities going it alone, but bolstering and rolling out their achievements and building partnerships with powers locally, are important steps to be taken now.

"Underlying inflation has slipped again, from 0.5% in June to 0.4% in September, keeping alive the prospect of another interest rate cut. But economists are split over when that may be.Bureau of Statistics figures released on Wednesday show underlying inflation is growing at an annual rate of 1.7%. The Reserve Bank＊s target is 2-3%.※It gives the RBA an excuse to cut interest rates to 1.25% next Tuesday and we wouldn＊t rule this out§, said a Capital  briefing note to clients.※We continue to expect the Reserve Bank to cut the cash rate to 1.25% at the November board meeting, although we hold this view without great conviction,§ Commonwealth Bank＊s chief economist, Michael Blythe, wrote in a note.The RBA governor, Philip Lowe, dedicated a  to reasons why inflation was so low globally.He said low inflation and wages in Australia had seen a drop in inflation expectations among consumers and businesses, although not to unprecedented levels.The RBA board meets on Tuesday, Melbourne Cup day, to decide on interest rates.※Looking to the future, we expect that the various factors holding inflation down will continue for a while yet,§ Lowe cautioned last week.※But this does not mean that we have drifted into a world of permanently lower inflation in Australia.※The experience elsewhere suggests that we do need to guard against inflation expectations falling too far, for if this were to occur it would be more difficult to achieve the inflation target.§ Blythe argued on Wednesday that inflation may have bottomed in Australia, for four reasons.He said the slowdown in inflation rates for services and non-tradeable goods appeared to have ended, while the proportion of consumer price index (CPI) categories that are recording price rises of less than 2% a year had stopped rising.He also said the categories of goods excluded from CPI were tracking sideways in annual growth terms, while a measure of ※structural price§ growth had picked up recently.The RBA would have to juggle conflicting priorities and may decide to tolerate lower inflation, and for longer, for the good of the economy.※A central bank concerned about low inflation and the risk to inflation expectations may certainly cut,§ he wrote.※But a central bank worried about housing, debt and financial stability may leave interest rates alone.§The ABS figures for headline inflation complicated the story.They showed a rise in the annual growth rate of headline inflation from 1% to 1.3% between the March and September quarters.Headline inflation is different from underlying inflation because its includes prices of goods that can be volatile. The rise in headline inflation to 1.3% was mainly due to a large 19.5% quarterly increase in the price of fruit and a 5.9% rise in the price of vegetables.The RBA is likely to look through those numbers because they reflect adverse weather conditions, including floods, in major growing areas, which affected supply.Other large price increases included electricity (up 5.4%) and tobacco (up 2.3%), which were partially offset by falls in communication (-2.3%) and fuel (-2.9%).Shane Oliver, AMP Capital＊s chief economist, said both headline and underlying inflation are in line with the RBA＊s inflation forecasts, and the rise in headline inflation may reduce the likelihood of inflation expectations deteriorating in the short term.For that reason, the RBA probably will not cut rates next week.※The RBA can afford to be patient in waiting for inflation to head back to target and thereby avoid the risk of adding to financial instability (read a further acceleration in Sydney and Melbourne home price gains) with another rate cut for now,§ he said."															
"A major cut in immigration from the European Union to Britain after Brexit would produce a damaging long-term hit to future economic growth while yielding only a ※modest boost§ of under 1% to the wages of low-paid workers, has found.The study by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) thinktank says a ※middle range§  where EU immigration falls by as much as 91,000 a year would cut the growth of gross domestic product per head by 3.4% lower than it would otherwise have been by 2030.But in the more extreme scenario of a hard Brexit where EU immigration was cut by 150,000 a year 每 which may be needed to hit Theresa May＊s 100,000 a year net migration target 每 the economists say this would hit annual GDP per head by 5.4%.While the economy was taking such a long-term damaging hit the NIESR economists say the effect on wages of those in low-skilled jobs in the most directly affected industries such as construction, retail, hospitality and food processing would be, if at all, relatively modest. The study＊s ※middle range§ scenario says the pay of those in such low-skilled jobs would rise by up to 0.51% by 2030 while in the hard Brexit scenario they would increase by 0.82% a year.Jonathan Portes, NIESR research fellow and one of the report＊s authors, said: ※Prior to the referendum, a number of analyses estimated the long-term impacts of Brexit on the UK economy; but none incorporated the impacts of Brexit-induced reductions in migration. Our estimates suggest that the negative impacts on per capita GDP will be significant, potentially approaching those resulting from reduced trade.§He said the 3.4% hit to per capita GDP from a 91,000 reduction in EU migration in the NIESR＊s central scenario was on a similar scale to the impact from the falls in trade and investment projected by the Treasury, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before the Brexit referendum.The analysis by Portes and his co-author, Giuseppe Forte, shows that the economic damage of deep cuts in EU migration go even beyond  (OBR) at the chancellor＊s autumn statement last month. The OBR, in the absence of a new government policy on immigration, based its assumptions on a conservative 80,000 a year reduction in net migration to Britain. It estimated that this cut would cost the economy ?0.8bn in 2016-17 rising to ?5.9bn a year by 2000-21 and with a total hit of ?16bn over the next five years.The NIESR estimate suggests a similar fall in EU immigration will prove even more damaging to the British economy. This is because, unlike the OBR model, it includes an assumption that the fall in net migration will also cut the growth in labour productivity in Britain by reducing the competition for work.The authors say their analysis uses a methodology similar to that employed by mainstream economic forecasters to model the impact of Brexit-induced reductions in trade on productivity and growth.※The broad scenario (not forecasts) we depict imply that the negative impacts on per capita GDP will be significant, potentially approaching those resulting from reduced trade. By contrast, the increase in low-skilled wages, resulting from reduced migration is expected to be, if at all, relatively modest,§ they conclude.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said she welcomed the report as it was being published at a time when evidence-based analysis on immigration and its effects was becoming a rarity: ※The report requires further scrutiny, but in broad terms it clearly shows that economic growth would be hit substantially by sharp cuts in immigration, while any boost to wages is likely to be minimal and confined to some of the very lowest-paid sectors. ※Labour will offer a fair immigration policy, which benefits the whole economy and maximises prosperity for all. The government should abandon its unachievable and damaging net migration targets.§"															
"This week there is much unenlightening squabbling about economic forecasts. In 1971 I arrived at university intending to read engineering and economics. After two weeks I swapped to pure engineering because I had realised that there was no ※right answer§ in economics. I have spent my life developing mathematical models of physical systems and making ※engineering forecasts§ or predictions, as engineers call them. Now, older and wiser, I realise that there is no right answer in engineering either.However, engineers address that difficulty directly. It is standard engineering practice to attach an estimate of error or uncertainty to a central estimate 每 to provide only a central estimate can be highly misleading. It seems this approach has not reached economics. With proper analysis of the forecasting model it will be possible to attach a probability of exceedance to any central estimate. The Brexiters might then adopt a level with, say, a 30% probability of exceedance (optimistic), whereas the remainers might adopt 60% (cautious). Political interpretation of a result can then be clearly distinguished from the model used to derive it. Such an approach might also have been useful before the referendum. I recommend it to economists who may find the results both frightening and embarrassing!"															
"The Resolution Foundation＊s prediction that inequalities are going to grow (, 1 February) makes gloomy reading. Sadly it is underestimated because it takes no account of cuts in what , when she was secretary of state at the Department of Health and Social Security 40 years ago, called ※the social wage§. By this she meant ※the publicly provided services which mean so much to family healthcare, education, housing and a?good environment§. She estimated that in 1975 the social wage added ?20 a week to the average working household. At the time the average full-time weekly wage of a male manual worker was ?52 and a female manual worker ?31.Every week you have reported cuts not only to health, education and social care but also to parks, museums, libraries, children＊s centres, buses and public lavatories. All these services are essential to a caring society and can only be provided collectively. They are part of our social fabric and the more threadbare this becomes the less autonomy children, people with disabilities and older, frail people enjoy. At the same time it becomes harder for their families to support them. Instead of insisting that families should do more (and they already do a great deal 每 there are five times as many family and friends caring for older people as there are paid carers), the government should reverse the massive cuts made to local authorities＊ budgets and increase the ※social wage§. So basic income has to be ※an interesting idea whose time has not yet come§ (, 2 February). Britain is after all a conservative-thinking, backward country, and will be the last in the developed world to try basic income, because it looks expensive and people are lazy. We prefer to hand people a grudging, dead dole on condition that they work no more than 16 hours a week, and spend the rest of their time applying for jobs that simply do not exist.On the other hand, we could transform JSA etc into a useful stimulus to the green sector of the economy, the sector that protects and heals the condition of society and environment. The cost is negligible, and the benefit to society and economy will be significant. It?could be done as a pilot in any willing local authority with very little delay. ※§ (search it) will bring about a smooth transition from the clunking machinery of Beveridge to the calm simplicity of basic income. Your editorial makes some valid points. Yes, there are basic income schemes that would be expensive; and if a basic income were too high then it might disincentivise employment. However, there are also schemes that would not be expensive, and there are schemes that would be more likely to incentivise employment than to disincentivise it.Research for the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex (see , ISER, June 2016) shows that a basic income of ?60 a week could be paid for by reducing the income tax personal allowance, increasing the rate of income tax by just 3%, and revising national insurance contribution regulations, and would not need additional public expenditure. The scheme would take a lot of households off means-tested benefits, and every one of those households would experience lower deduction rates on additional earned income, so employment would be incentivised. The scheme would reduce poverty, reduce inequality, and, importantly, would not impose losses on low-income households at the point of implementation, which some other proposed schemes would do.It is the current benefits system that disincentivises employment, because a lot of households experience almost no additional disposable income if they earn more; and it is the current system of in-work benefits that function as a significant subsidy to wages, because tax credits and universal credit go up if wages go down. A basic income would not do that, so it would have less of a subsidy effect.It is of course important to hear differing views on whether basic income is an idea whose time has come: but those views 每 and especially those offered by the Guardian 每 should be based on the available evidence. Your editorial is overhasty in kicking the universal basic income into the long grass. Can you suggest any alternative that can tackle the discontent in a world where job destruction through technology seems bound to outpace the creation of jobs, many of which will be very low-paid? If not, it would be wise to build on the successful pilots around the world to develop ways to make UBI a reality.  might be part of the increased revenue stream to which those whose quality of life has not been significantly affected by the 2008 crash, people like me, should contribute.

"his Christmas break, for anybody steeped in the assumptions that have underpinned non-mainstream political thinking, needs to be a moment of realisation.  will happen. Globalisation will fall apart. Freedom of movement as an unconditional right in the EU will end. The concept of the west as upholder, and occasional enforcer, of human rights across the world is, at the very least, on hold.It is not pessimism that makes me write this, but optimism. Optimism that, if we adapt our thinking to the new reality fast enough, we can go on fighting for social justice and human rights, on behalf of that generation staring glumly at their touchscreens over the Christmas table. But that is a big if. This holiday season, I guarantee that you will hear older relatives repeatedly say the words ※will never§. ※Britain will never leave the EU.§ ※ will never take office.§ ※Fascism will never return to Germany and Austria.§ Since denial is the first stage of grief, it is forgivable for people to struggle through from Brexit to Boxing Day saying these things 每 but not beyond. When world-changing events happen, the denial reflex is strong because most rational people configure their principles around existing facts.For example, the European institutions that guarantee freedom of movement came to embody the principle, held by many, that borders should be as open as possible. No matter that freedom of movement within  was conditional on a three-metre-high razor fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave at Melilla. The ※freedom§ bit seemed to embody a general principle.In future, we will have to separate our principles from institutions that once embodied them.Likewise for that more vaguely defined principle: Europeanism. It took me until the age of 40 to visit the US. By then, I had travelled by foot, air, rail and road across Europe. I was convinced this was an inexhaustible cultural playground, a place from which all my values emanated, while much of the US was simply ※flyover country§. A young generation that spends stag weekends in Riga, childhood holidays in Disney World Florida and gap years in Thailand is going to be less Europeanist than mine. But their globalism was built on the assumption that Paris or Berlin were short-hop weekend destinations to be reached with a waft of one＊s passport towards a friendly border guard. This mindset, too, will have to change. To avoid Brexit plunging us into  predicted by the Treasury, we have to pursue two outcomes: first, to minimise our break with the EU single market; and, if that fails, to maximise it unsentimentally.For those gripped with the denial instinct, the objective of minimising the break comes easy 每 but not the means. The means through which we can achieve ※soft Brexit§ are tough, self-centred negotiations that put the British national interest first. If we fail 每 because Europe is a mess, ruled by an elite in denial of its own failures 每 it would be logical to pursue a total reconfiguration of our trade, industrial base and attitude to globalisation. Even those, like me, fighting for the softest possible Brexit must contemplate what the social justice agenda might look like after a ※hard§ one.As for the global power system,  show he intends to shatter it. For the first time in a generation, the section of the Israeli right prone to the most violent rhetoric about the Palestinians will go unrestrained by Washington. For the first time in a generation, human rights campaigners in Russia will have to look at the state department and the CIA as a kind of informal conduit back to  and the  security agency, not their allies.Underlying all these changes is the fact that the global system is becoming a negative-sum game. For more than three generations, it was a positive-sum game. It is the difference between the  and pass the parcel. In GBBO, even though only one person wins, there is always more cake at the end than at the start. In pass the parcel, everybody except the winner loses, and what is in the parcel is always a disappointment. Globalisation was a positive-sum game, even if, for the former industrial populations of the west, it was barely positive. It lasted so long that people began to assume pass-the-parcel economics had become impossible. We are about to find out that is a fallacy. You can still fight for social justice, wealth redistribution and human rights in a negative-sum world 每 but you can＊t do it by clinging to ※principles§ you assumed were general but are not.Since free movement as an absolute right will be gone, once we leave the EU, I would reconfigure migration policy to deliver maximum social justice for two sets of people: those who already live here, including three million EU nationals; and , whose right to claim asylum here should be absolute.In a globalised world, ※competitiveness§ meant a race to the bottom: low wages and a shrunken welfare state. In a negative-sum world, it means a fight to locate well-paid, high-skill jobs in the UK and not elsewhere. The weapons should be active industrial policy, tax breaks, high welfare spending and free university education, paid for by the state.Being a nuclear-armed state whose main ally for more than 70 years is suddenly ruled by an erratic kleptocrat who is morally indebted to the Kremlin should prompt the biggest rethink of all. For four years, at least Britain must operate diplomatically on our own. We must cease fostering the illusion that we have the power, on our own, to save the  revolution, restrain  in its next assault on , or force Abdel Fattah el-Sisi . We should go on trying, of course, but with little promise of success.These sobering facts will confront the left and the climate movement with hard choices, just as they confront the liberal centre. All we can do, as Churchill put it to the US Congress on Boxing Day in 1941, is ※draw the sword for freedom and cast away the scabbard§."															
"The new chancellor could barely have hoped for a better backdrop. High street spending is booming, inflation remains low, unemployment is the lowest it＊s been for more than a decade. And all that despite the shock referendum result and warnings from people like Bank of England governor Mark Carney and the International Monetary Fund that a vote to leave could spark recession.But it would be a very unwise chancellor who said Britain had escaped this vote unscathed.  negotiations have not even started and in crucial areas such as business investment very little data is available at this point to reveal quite how much the referendum upheaval has knocked the economy off course.Enter the government＊s independent forecasters then, and the picture the  paints for 2017 is a gloomy one, even if it＊s not quite as bleak as some commentators＊ forecasts in the aftermath of the vote.Consider the effects of the weak pound for a start. The UK currency was hammered by the Brexit vote and is down aabout 10% against the euro and 16% against the dollar since the referendum. That means all manner of UK imports have shot up in price, be it food ingredients for brands like Marmite or metals for car part makers in the Midlands. It is only a matter of time before those costs get passed on to shoppers in one way or another. Some shelf prices have already risen, in other cases manufacturers are charging the same price for smaller products 每 a phenomenon known as shrinkflation: like fewer Maltesers in a bag, and less triangular chunks in a Toblerone.The , more than double the current rate of 0.9%. Just as costs start taking off, the jobs market is set to weaken. The OBR＊s conservative forecast is for unemployment to nudge up to 5.2% next year from 5% this year. With companies struggling to get more out of each worker 每 known as productivity 每 pay will struggle to keep pace with higher inflation. Average earnings are forecast to grow just 2.4% in 2017, meaning they will be barely rising in real terms. That＊s assuming nervous businesses are happy to keep awarding pay rises 每 the reality could well be worse for workers. There are some winners in the very near-term. Exporters are expected to get a boost from the weak pound, making their goods cheaper overseas. But in the longer-term they are forecast to lose out as protracted Brexit negotiations hit trade. With all that on the horizon, Hammond was probably wise to leave himself some spare money to step in when Brexit really starts to bite. Fast-forward to his budget this time next year and it looks like the chancellor will be setting out a budget not for the just about managing 每 but for the poor and getting poorer."															
"The vote to leave the EU has increased demand for consultants and boosted their pay as jittery business chiefs bring in outside help to navigate uncertain times, according to a snapshot of the jobs market.The average advertised salary for consultancy jobs was 8.9% higher than a year ago at ?47,760 in August, according to jobs search engine Adzuna. The increase defied the trend of the overall jobs market, where the average advertised salary was down 1.6% from August 2015.The higher salaries on offer for consultants reflected a significant increase in demand. Consultant jobs were up 10% on a year ago, again bucking the trend of the overall jobs market where vacancies dipped 2.3% from a year ago.Adzuna, which tracks job adverts from about 500 sources, said the market was still looking resilient in the face of political uncertainty after June＊s referendum. It also noted that while advertised salaries were down on a year ago, they were up in month-on-month terms, by 0.3% to ?32,784 in August. That was the first monthly rise since February.Alongside consultants, other sectors enjoying year-on-year salary growth in August included maintenance, with a 12.1% rise, and public relations (PR) at 4%.Doug Monro, Adzuna＊s co-founder, said the consultancy industry was benefitting from the leave vote. ※In an uncertain environment, companies are looking for highly skilled experts, without having to shoulder the burden of an expanding wage bill. Consultants are also helping them demystify the business consequences of the vote,§ he said.※Other industries like PR are also seeing salaries rise as employers prefer to commission projects to outside agencies, rather than hire permanent internal staff.§Official data since the referendum showed  in the wake of the Brexit vote, but unemployment held at a multi-year low. Other indicators suggest  but that businesses are nervous about investing and hiring as they wait to see when Brexit negotiations will begin and how they will progress. Adzuna＊s monthly jobs report showed there continued to be significant variation around the UK in competition for jobs. Nationwide, the number of jobseekers per vacancy remained at 0.49. Northern Ireland had the highest competition, with 8.39 jobseekers per vacancy. It was also the region with the lowest average advertised salary at ?28,134.Competition was lowest in south east England, where applicants had the upper hand over employers with a ratio of just 0.25 jobseekers per job 每 four jobs on offer for every jobseeker. Salaries there were second highest in the UK behind London, at an average of ?31,817."															
"Liam Fox＊s Department for International Trade may have broken EU procurement rules by .Albert Sanchez-Graells, senior lecturer in law at Bristol University law school, said the ※cultural fit§ criteria, included in two advertisements asking tech firms to bid for work with government, were too subjective to comply with EU procurement rules.※Nobody who does procurement professionally would not have identified this as something that cannot be done,§ he said.In a pair of , the Department for International Trade specified that in order to have the right ※cultural fit§ for the task, they must ※be committed to the best possible outcome for the United Kingdom following its departure from the European Union§.Even after Britain has left the European Union, it will still be expected to comply with World Trade Organisation rules on non-discrimination in public procurement.Such rules ban subjective criteria, which ※open the way for unlimited discretion§, as Sanchez-Graells put it 〞 potentially allowing discrimination on political grounds, for example.※I think that the government＊s policy (or the Department for International Trade tenders, if this is an isolated incident) constitutes §, he said.The requirement to back the best deal for Britain is one of a list of criteria applicants for the two DIT contracts are asked to fulfil, alongside being ※focused enough to stick to the task at hand§, ※committed and hard-working§ and ※enthused by the prospect of working at the frontline in such an exciting and dynamic area§.In total, these ※cultural fit§ criteria will be given a 15% weighting in assessing which company to pick, the ads say.

I believe that these clear rules have been broken.§Pro-Brexit ministers have sometimes been frustrated by civil servants＊ lack of enthusiasm for the complex task of unpicking Britain＊s close relationship with the EU and appear to be determined to hire firms that share their optimism.Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and prominent leave campaigner, used  to condemn ※droning and moaning§ about the risks of leaving the EU.Last December, contractor Deloitte apologised after details of a damning report it had written about Downing Street＊s plans for handling the article 50 process were leaked.The company also agreed to pull out of bidding for government contracts for six months.Farron said: ※The Conservative Brexit government demanding there must be a ＆cultural fit＊ is straight out of the pages of .※The private opinions of government employees have always been their own business.

One invites bids from firms to ※investigate the feasibility of designing a system to manage intelligence on market access barriers§; another is for ※investigating the feasibility of creating certain services around trade remedies as trade legislation is transferred from the EU to the UK§.Academics and former senior civil servants have repeatedly warned about the complexity of the task facing politicians in extricating Britain from the EU, with one thinktank, UK in a Changing Europe,  that it could overwhelm the capacities of the state; but these sceptics have often been accused of trying to ※block Brexit§."															
															
"Britain＊s version of austerity is more aligned to the poorest nations of the European Union,  which reveal the UK was the only rich EU country to cut welfare spending as a proportion of GDP between 2011 and 2014.France, Germany and Italy increased spending on welfare, as did the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Denmark, Luxembourg, Finland and Austria. Even Portugal, Spain, Slovakia and Poland marginally increased the proportion of national income they spend on welfare.France pushed spending from 32.7% to 34.3% and Germany raised the level from 28.6% to 29.1%, while Italy managed to commit 30% in 2014 compared with 28.5% in 2011.But the UK cut the amount it spends on what Eurostat calls social protection (as a proportion of GDP) over the four years from 29.1% to 27.4%.Its compatriots in the austerity camp are , Latvia, Lithuania, Ireland, Greece, Hungary and Romania.Britain is also among the lowest spenders per head of population, matching the EU average, but falling behind Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Denmark, Finland and Sweden.France and Germany both spent 131% of the average, though this failed to match the 140% spent by Denmark.Slovakia spent 52% of the EU average while Ireland managed 87%, bringing it close to Italy＊s 98% per capita.The UK also spent more as a proportion of GDP than any other country on subsidising housing, illustrating the importance since the financial crash in 2008 for successive governments to . benefit accounted for 7.7% of all benefits compared with 1.4% in Spain and 4.2% in Sweden.

"Government borrowing was higher than expected at ?12.6bn in November as the growth in income tax receipts slowed .Official figures showed that income tax receipts increased by only 1.1%, after several years of consistent 3%-plus growth, to prevent the UK＊s budget deficit falling at the pace forecast by City analysts.Economists polled by Reuters had expected borrowing of only ?12.1bn.But the November borrowing figure was lower than last year＊s ?13.2bn and put the Treasury on course to meet the Office for Budget Responsibility＊s revised target for borrowing by the end of the year.The OBR said in March it expected the budget deficit - the gap between government spending and tax income - to fall to ?55bn, or more than 20% on the previous year. But in the autumn statement it revised the figure to say the fall would be more like 10%, to ?68bn. The OBR made the revision to take account of the Brexit vote shock, which slowed economic growth and reduced the government＊s income.Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the modest improvement on last year was ※reassuring for the chancellor§.He said: ※This is welcome for Hammond as it would have been somewhat embarrassing if the first set of public finance figures after the  had immediately put question marks over his new fiscal targets,§ he said.The Office for National Statistics said that excluding the publicly owned banks, figures for the financial year to date 每 April to November 每 showed the deficit fell by ?7.7bn to ?59.5bn, compared with the same eight months in 2015.A bigger interest bill on the government＊s debts was another burden on the exchequer, but was offset by lower public investment, which limited the outflow of funds from Whitehall.VAT receipts were up 4.4% year-on-year in November and corporation tax receipts were up 22.9% year-on-year, showing that economic activity remained robust. A spokesman for the Treasury said: ※The government has made significant progress in bringing the public finances under control, but our debt and deficit remain too high. ※That is why the chancellor set out new fiscal rules to return the budget to balance, while creating the space to support the economy and raise productivity through a new ?23bn national productivity investment fund.§Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital , said: ※Looking through some of the monthly volatility, receipts growth has been on a slight upward trend since May 每 adding to the evidence that the economy has held up well following the vote to leave the EU.※Meanwhile, an acceleration in annual VAT receipts growth from 3.7% to 4.4% reinforces the recent surveys that imply that consumer spending has been fairly strong at the start of the festive season.※Accordingly, we think borrowing should come in close to the OBR＊s current ?68bn forecast for the 2016-17 fiscal year.§"															
"Philip Hammond＊s first and last was a sombre affair. The chancellor largely dispensed with political theatre to tell it straight. Britain＊s economy is dysfunctional. Austerity has failed. Welfare cuts are going to bite. will be a ?60bn drag on growth and the public finances. That＊s the way it is.The one small nod towards gimmickry was the ?7m the government has made available to save , a stately home in South Yorkshire said to be the inspiration for Pemberley in Jane Austen＊s Pride and Prejudice. A different chancellor would have milked the literary allusion for a few cheap laughs.Not Hammond, though. At root, his statement was all about how the vulnerabilities of the British economy have been exposed by the decision to leave the . There is a 30% productivity gap between Britain and Germany. Prosperity is concentrated in London and the south-east. There has been insufficient investment in research and development, in transport infrastructure, in superfast broadband and in housing.These deficiencies explain why the government has struggled in vain to eliminate the record peacetime budget deficit it inherited from Labour in 2010 and why the UK＊s balance of payments deficit is running at 6% of national output. In or out of the EU, they would need to be addressed.  has made tackling them more urgent.The vote on 23 June has given Hammond the chance to break with the past. Although the economy is expected to slow over the next two years, the chancellor has decided to borrow to invest. The government has put aside ?23bn for infrastructure projects over the next five years, a relatively modest sum in the context of a ?1.8tn economy but welcome nevertheless.Money has become available because Hammond has dispensed with George Osborne＊s plan to run a budget surplus by the end of the current parliament in 2019-20. By pushing deficit reduction beyond the next election, the chancellor has given himself scope for some additional public expenditure while at the same time holding something back in case the relatively benign forecasts for the economy from the  (OBR) prove optimistic.Before the referendum, Osborne made dire predictions for the economy should Britain vote to leave the EU. The Treasury suggested there would be an instant recession necessitating an emergency budget involving ?30bn of tax increases and spending cuts.In the event, strong consumer confidence has meant the economy has beaten expectations. The OBR has slightly raised its growth forecast for 2016, a year in which the UK＊s economy looks likely to expand more quickly than any of its G7 rivals.Next year it is a different story. The OBR thinks the fall in the value of the pound will result in dearer imports, higher inflation and a stalling of real income growth. It also expects uncertainty caused by the Brexit divorce negotiations to result in weaker private investment.Both these assumptions look plausible despite Hammond＊s autumn statement measures. Higher government spending on infrastructure is designed to compensate for the hesitancy of the private sector to commit to new capital projects, while the higher national living wage, the modest adjustments to universal credit and yet another year of frozen fuel duties are intended to support the consumer.But the impact of these moves should not be exaggerated. There was a strong element of continuity in the autumn statement: the bulk of the cuts announced by Osborne will still go ahead. There was no extra money for the struggling NHS and thin gruel for the so-called Jams (just about managing households) despite the hype. The Child Poverty Action Group has calculated that a single parent with one child and no housing costs earning ?15,000 a year will be ?170 a year better off as a result of the new universal credit regime. But the same person stood to lose out by ?3,170 a year as a result of the summer 2015 budget. Hammond has the scope to provide more help for the Jams during 2017 when there will be both a spring and an autumn budget. The OBR says the delay in balancing the budget until the next parliament means he has the scope to borrow ?56bn more by 2020-21 than Osborne was planning. Of that, ?20bn will be soaked up by lower growth and a further ?10bn has been earmarked for higher spending, mainly on infrastructure. That leaves Hammond ?26.5bn to play with.The autumn statement, in other words, is not a self-contained work like Pride and Prejudice, but more a trilogy with parts two and three to come next year. Which one? Well, the economy is shrouded in fog, the government believes that fiscal pain will be worth it in the end and the chancellor makes a virtue out of being Mr Ordinary. Simple really: Fifty Shades of Grey."															
"o not run away with the idea that the chancellor has borrowed the clothes of Donald Trump and ordered an infrastructure splurge. Ploughing ?23bn into a new national productivity investment fund sounds impressive until you remember that the HS2 high-speed railway, funded separately, is due to cost ?56bn at the last count.Remember, too, that the ?23bn will be spent over five years, so an average of ?4.6bn a year. And note that the spending is weighted towards the later years; in the first year, 2017-18, the figure is just ?2.4bn.Of that sum,  and the outlay should properly be seen as a necessary response to government figures that showed the number of affordable homes built in England last year fell to the lowest level for 24 years.Hammond, in his speech, said he had deliberately avoided turning his statement into a long list of individual projects being supported. But was that to avoid boring his audience or because government is still uncertain about what it wants to build?Some of the known elements 每 the ?1bn to explore 5G broadband and the upgrade to rail and road links between Oxford and Cambridge 每 already feel over-familiar. Does the government even know how it plans to spend all its ?23bn? Decisions on almost a third 每 the ?7bn earmarked for 2021/22 每 will only be made ※in due course,§ according to the Treasury document.※The missing component in the autumn statement was a new pipeline of transparent, viable projects for much heralded high-value investment,§ said John Hicks, director of AECOM, an infrastructure services firm that has worked on 2012 Olympics and Crossrail. Andrew Jameson of MUFG, which invests in infrastructure around the world, made a similar point: ※It is disappointing that the statement did not indicate any real signs of a properly-defined pipeline of core infrastructure projects, likes schools and hospitals, which has been lacking in recent years and is much needed in the UK.§In Hammond＊s defence, one could argue that the government has a plan to get there eventually. He said between 1% and 1.2% of GDP will be invested every year from 2020 in economic infrastructure, which is defined as transport, energy, flood defences, water, waste and digital communications, areas covered by the new-ish national infrastructure commission.A ratio of 1%-1.2% compares to 0.8% of GDP being spent currently, so Hammond＊s commitment is meaningful. But four years is a long time to wait for a bigger set of projects that businesses like to term ※shovel ready§. And the shame is that so much could have been done, and earlier, if successive governments had not been bewitched by big-budget HS2. Those dull but easy-to-do road and rail upgrades will do more to meet  than the new high-speed railway.: they will be hurt by the ban on letting agents＊ fees charged to tenants. London-based estate agent Foxtons fell 14%; Countrywide, the UK＊s largest agency, was 5% lower.Their trade bodies queued up to warn that the fees will just rebound on tenants via higher rents. Maybe they will, in part, but the process should not be mechanical. Estate agents will first have to persuade landlords to pick up fees previously charged to tenants. Some landlords, one suspects, will make the reasonable point that the agents have only themselves to blame for milking the market. Many of those landlords have their own complaints about agents＊ price-gouging tactics.The chancellor＊s ban is welcome. It does not guarantee to improve the lot of tenants. But it will make fees more transparent, which is definitely an improvement. This article was amended on 25 November 2016. An earlier version misnamed Andrew Jameson as Andrew Johnson."															
"Government departments have been told to outline potential spending cuts of up to 6% with the aim of saving up to ?3.5bn by 2020.Before the budget on 8 March, the chief secretary to the Treasury, David Gauke, announced that all Whitehall departments should submit ways to contribute to the government＊s ※efficiency review§.Up to ?1bn of the savings will be reinvested in ※priority areas§, rather than being used to reduce the deficit, the Treasury announced, but did not give specific details.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused the government of ※sneaking out§ the announcement late on Monday night and said it was proof that the chancellor, Philip Hammond, ※represents more of the same Tory austerity§. Departments have been asked to begin drawing up proposals based on two scenarios 每 one for making 3% spending cuts, and another for making 6%. The cuts would come into force shortly after the UK leaves the EU, according to the two-year timetable for the article 50 process of withdrawal, and just before the next scheduled general election.Gauke and the Cabinet Office minister Ben Gummer said the review was ※part of an ongoing commitment to modern, flexible public services that deliver the best value for money for taxpayers§.Core budgets for schools and the NHS will not come under review, the announcement said, and savings made by local government cuts will be used to ease pressures on social care. There was repeated criticism of the government throughout the winter for , which NHS and council chiefs have said is chronically underfunded. and legal commitments to spend 0.7% of GDP on international aid will also continue to be met, the Treasury said. ※We are committed to a modern, high-quality public sector that delivers the services people need in the most efficient way possible,§ Gauke said. ※There has been considerable progress, but there is further to go and the whole of government is working together to consider how we can live within our means while delivering maximum value for every pound of taxpayers＊ money.§McDonnell said the chancellor ※urgently needs to explain why this announcement was made in the way it was and why after seven years of failed austerity he thinks more of the same will now work§.He added: ※For all Hammond＊s talk of ＆resetting＊ the Tory government＊s economic policy last summer it is now beyond doubt that Hammond represents more of the same Tory austerity.※Sneaking out an announcement asking departments to model cuts of 3% and 6% for 2019-20 is no way to manage public spending.§"															
"s liberal democracy seems to be crumbling under the weight of widespread despondency, some hardline opinions are in danger of becoming received wisdoms. In the global market, we are told, we must work harder and?improve productivity. The welfare state has become too large and we need?to cut back on benefits. Immigration is out of control and borders need to be strengthened.The choice seems to be either to accept this new paradigm or risk the likes of  gaining power. The centre ground is being dragged to the left and right, and collapsing down the middle. Meanwhile progressive politics has returned to its comfort zone, busily opposing everything and offering almost nothing. Where is the vision, the ambition, the belief?Yet into this bleak picture drops a book and an author bristling with hope, optimism and answers. Rutger Bregman is a 28-year-old Dutchman whose book, , has taken Holland by storm and could yet revitalise progressive thought around the globe. His solutions are quite simple and staunchly set against current trends: we should institute a universal basic income for everyone that covers minimum living expenses 每 say around ?12,000 a year; the working week should be shortened to 15 hours; borders should be opened and migrants allowed to move wherever they choose.If that all sounds like fantasy politics, then Bregman has assembled a wealth of empirical evidence to make his case. Better than that, though, it is not a dry, statistical analysis 每 although he doesn＊t shy from solid data 每 but a book written with verve, wit and imagination. The effect is charmingly persuasive, even when you can＊t quite believe what you＊re reading.Bregman lives in Utrecht, arguably?Holland＊s most progressive city, where cycling is almost obligatory and motorists are effectively deemed guilty until proven innocent. His house is a few yards from the pretty canal that cuts through the centre of a carefully thought-out town.Thin, with a pallid complexion and a wispy rumour of a beard, he looks even younger than 28, but he speaks with impressive authority on his subject. Bregman does something very smart and mature in his book. Instead of just attacking capitalism and post-enlightenment liberalism, at the outset he celebrates its achievements. He shows the incredible improvements in life expectancy, health, wealth, education and freedoms that have been achieved in the last couple of centuries.As for much derided globalisation, he credits it with lifting 700 million Chinese out of extreme poverty 每 hugely more than communism ever achieved. But whereas idealists in the 60s extolled Maoism, regardless of the death and destruction it wrought, no one gets too misty eyed about what the international market has done for China. Why, I ask, are the progressive-minded so reluctant to acknowledge this remarkable turnaround?※I think the big problem on the left,§ says Bregman, ※is that it only knows what it＊s against. So it＊s against austerity, against the establishment, against homophobia, against racism. I＊m not saying I＊m not against those things, but I think you should be  something. You need to have a new vision of where you want to go.§Bregman has a vision. And it＊s a pretty clear one. But, wait a second. Universal benefit, a 15-hour working week, open borders, really? How?※I＊ve heard for three years that many of my ideas are unrealistic and unreasonable and that we can＊t afford them,§ he says, by way of preamble to a more comprehensive reply. ※And the simple answer is ＆Oh, you want to stick to the status quo? How＊s that been working out?＊§In Bregman＊s Holland the status quo has taken quite a bashing of late, and as a result the white-haired Wilders, who wants to , has emerged as the country＊s most powerful politician. The debate in what used to be Europe＊s most tolerant nation has become increasingly toxic. But as bad as that situation is, it still doesn＊t explain how a universal basic income would be paid for. ※The first thing we should acknowledge,§ says Bregman, ※is that poverty is hugely expensive. It varies from country to country, but most of the time it＊s around 3, 4 or 5% of GDP. If you look at what it would cost just to top up the income of all the poor people in a country, it would cost about 1% of GDP.§Perhaps, but he＊s talking about paying everyone 每 rich and poor 每 around ?12,000 a year. That＊s a vast amount of money. How could that be achieved? You＊d have to tax the middle class so much that what they＊d receive would be wiped out, and then try to tax the very wealthy at a much higher rate 每 which has not proven a successful policy, because the rich are very good at protecting their money.Bregman gets a little bit vague at this point. He says that even neoliberal economists such as Milton Friedman were keen on universal basic income (UBI), although they tend to call it negative income tax. He also notes that the country that has come closest to implementing a UBI is . It was only because the Democrat-controlled Senate thought Nixon wasn＊t offering enough money in the basic income that the policy was ditched at the last moment.He acknowledges that a genuinely universal system would involve a massive overhaul of our tax system and that it would require an enormous amount of public and political support. But you＊ve got to start somewhere, is his outlook, and the best place to start is in redefining what we mean by work.※There was a poll in the UK that showed that . Well, it＊s not the bin men, and the care workers and the teachers that say that. We＊re talking about consultants, bankers, accountants, lawyers etc. The implications of that are radical. We could cut the working week by a third and be just as rich. Probably richer!§Well, I say, just because someone doesn＊t value their job, doesn＊t mean that it doesn＊t have value. These things can be part of an invisible network of jobs that keeps everything else going. They can＊t just be excised like that.※That＊s the best we can come up with nowadays?§ he asks, shocked at my dull pragmatism. ※People are saying: ＆I feel alienated, I think my job is useless＊, and the only answer we have for them is ＆No, no, it＊s really useful. You know the invisible hand knows best. We＊re paying you so much money, it  to be useful!＊§I say I was thinking more of the film , which, after all, is about a banker. He thinks his life is worthless and yet we see the depth of his effect on others when his input is stripped away. Anyway, I take his point. We should reconsider much of what society 每 through the inequality of financial payment 每 deems important.※One of the basic lessons of history,§ says Bregman, ※is that things can be different. The way we＊ve structured our economy, our system of welfare, it＊s not natural. It could be different.§Bregman is the son of a small-town Protestant preacher in the south of Holland. He studied history at university and thought of becoming an academic, but found that life too cloistered. Instead he began working as a journalist, but realised the news was a distorting way of viewing the world. It＊s about exceptions 每 terrorism, corruption, crisis 每 rather than the everyday means of how things actually work.So he found a job at a new newspaper, the , that enabled him to write in a way that brings together journalism and a more academic approach to the world. The result is a hybrid that＊s reminiscent of : lots of compelling anecdotes, backed up with information from an array of surveys and research papers delivered in a tremendously readable style.But there＊s also an extra layer of idealism with Bregman, a belief that people are essentially good and that all it requires is a rational analysis of the facts and good governance to make the most profound and lasting changes. As he repeatedly points out, democracy, equal rights for men and women, the abolition of slavery 每 these were all once deemed the preserve of utopians.He quotes approvingly the famous Oscar Wilde formulation: ※A map of the world that does not include utopia is not worth even glancing at, for it leaves out the one country at which humanity is always landing. And when humanity lands there, it looks out and seeing a better country sets sail. Progress is the realisation of utopias.§But utopias also have a habit of turning out to be dystopias. Bregman is alive to this threat, and is scathing in his assessment of the communist experiment, but also argues that the unintended consequences of massive change can sometimes be virtuous too. I mention that in his book he suggests that universal basic income will enable the low-paid to study and then get the kinds of jobs they want to do. In which case, I wonder, who will be a cleaner?He smiles at the question.※I think one of the most important facts of basic income would be that it＊s not only a redistribution of income, but also of power. So the cleaners and bin men would have a lot more bargaining power. If you look at a university, for example, the cleaners will get paid more than the professors, which I think is an entirely good thing. Professors love their jobs, they don＊t need additional money for it. The cleaners don＊t like their jobs 每 well, they get rewarded for it!§I suggest that someone suffering through a PhD might not share that particular conviction. But he answers with a conviction that has triumphed over doubt. ※Basic income would give people the most important freedom: the freedom of deciding for themselves what they want to do with their lives.§I can imagine many old heads questioning the wisdom of a young man who has barely experienced the stubborn complexity of the world. But Bregman is clearly on to something. Following his advocacy,  are conducting trials on basic income. . Two Scottish councils, , are looking at a scheme and the Swiss are also interested. The , has said that it ※might be an idea whose time has come§, and Beno?t Hamon, the French Socialist candidate in the forthcoming elections, has included it in his manifesto. Even visionary US tech billionaire Elon Musk is in favour.One reason why Musk supports a basic income is that work is likely to become much more scarce in the near future of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence 每 and that＊s also a reason for a much reduced working week. In a way Bregman has less of a hard sell with shorter working hours. History is moving that way and has been for some time. It＊s just a question of when and how we＊re going to acknowledge the inevitable.However, there are still problems to iron out, some of which Bregman doesn＊t tackle in his book. For instance, expertise tends to be gathered over intense periods of study and practice. Who wants to fly on a plane piloted by someone with limited flying hours, or be operated on by a surgeon who hasn＊t done much surgery?Bregman＊s answer is to point out that overworked pilots and surgeons are a danger. Yes, but that doesn＊t mean a lack of work is not also a potential menace. Now he gets really fuzzy, saying that there would be a paid 15 hours, and then if pilots and surgeons and other experts wanted they could also work in their spare time. When I try to pin him down on what that would mean, he says we need to redefine work as contributing to society in ※your own way§.This sounds a little too utopian to my ears. Yet if you step back and examine where we are, there is undoubtedly a rational cause to rethink work, especially the well-remunerated jobs that don＊t appear to create anything of tangible value. It＊s impossible to read  without wondering at the efficacy of advertising executives, management consultants, speculative currency investors and, yes, perhaps even feature writers.Probably Bregman＊s weakest argument is for open borders 每 not because it isn＊t viable long term, but because he doesn＊t really examine the drawbacks. Three obvious problems are 1) population density 每 if millions more arrived in an already cramped Holland, it would create a great deal of tension to say the least. 2) Cultural conflicts 每 the large-scale movement of people from one culture into another does present genuine difficulties of assimilation, many of which Holland and other European countries are already contending with. 3) If it is the better-off in poorer countries who are most likely to leave, it robs those nations of a much-needed middle class.Bregman listens to all these points and says that for him, open borders are not something he believes will happen tomorrow. It＊s an aspiration, something to work towards. The same could be said for all of his arguments. However, the critical thing is that he has pointed towards a destination, somewhere that in these embattled times the progressively minded can aim towards, and he＊s provided some well-researched evidence to support his contentions.Yes, he is a utopian, but a practical one. He knows there are many problems to overcome, but the first and toughest is the belief that things can change. In that he has made a major contribution. Listen out for Rutger Bregman.

"here are many problems afflicting the British economy, and many afflicting the . The trouble with Brexit is that it is almost guaranteed to aggravate both.Although I continue to emphasise the economic damage likely to result from cutting ourselves off from half of our export market, in common with many Remainers I am also exercised by the geopolitical risks in any move that encourages the current outbreak of nationalism in Europe.One of the many depressing aspects of the referendum has been the way some of the more extreme Brexiters have been exulting in interpreting it as the first step on the road to the break-up of the European Union. What is it about these people? Don＊t they realise that the postwar arrangement that evolved into the EU was set up principally so that we should not yet again see Europe tearing itself apart?It began as a move towards political union by economic means. But even the most zealous ※federalists§ learn from experience: towards the end of his life, Jean Monnet himself, one of the EU＊s founding fathers, told a British historian that he no longer believed in ※ever closer union§.I once met Monnet; he was the honoured guest at a  dinner. He asked me whether I thought Britain was serious about Europe. I replied that I was not sure ＃British politicians of both major parties spent more than a decade trying to persuade the French that we should be allowed to join what was then the European Economic Community. Now the allegiance of France itself is threatened by the possibility that the Front National will triumph in the French elections. And Marine Le Pen has delighted in the thought that our referendum result may be giving an extra push to her own campaign.One of the motives behind our original application was the realisation that membership of the European Free Trade Area (Efta) was not enough. Yet Brexiters fantasise about the wonders of going back to that primitive state: a state that 每 as Sir Ivan Rogers, former ambassador to the EU,  每 could take a decade to achieve, if not more.Rogers is the realist whose judgment and sound advice were too much for that converted Brexiter Theresa May to stomach. He emphasised in public last week what he had previously tried to get across in private: that the road to a satisfactory  deal would be arduous. Indeed, between the lines his view seems to be that a ※satisfactory§ deal is probably not achievable at all.If it were not so serious, the course of the Brexit debate could reasonably qualify as the stuff of high farce. The British media seem obsessed by the travails of the Ukip leadership; but who cares about Ukip? They have served their dubious historical purpose, and, to all intents and purposes, what was once the Conservative and Unionist party might just as well be renamed the Conservative and Ukip party.A central element in this sad tale is, of course, the role of immigration.We are told that immigration was the main reason for the discontent that surfaced on 23 June last year. Yet my old friend David Davis 每 many friendships go through trying times 每 continues to make it abundantly clear that, throughout the nonsense of the Brexit ※process§, our economy will continue to need skilled and unskilled immigrants from the rest of the EU. (By the way, contrary to what a Manchester taxi driver recently told me, we are still in the EU and may be for some time. Needless to say, this cab driver was a first-generation immigrant who told me there were too many immigrants in this country.)Even Liam Fox, a hard-line Brexiter if ever there were one, recently conceded that he knew of no recent free trade agreement that did not also involve concessions on migration.So why the hell are we having to risk sacrificing much of our European trade, and potential future investment and prosperity, for the sake of offering sops to the Cerberus of Ukip?It should surely have become obvious by now to May that she is living in a fantasy world if she thinks the rest of the EU is going to take our exit from the EU lying down. It will demand that we pay up for our ?50bn of legal obligations, which will dwarf the putative ?350m a week promised on the ridiculous Leavers＊ battle bus during the referendum campaign.Ah, but ※the people have spoken§, have they not? Well, it is a fine democratic tradition that, after they have spoken in a general election, the people can speak again, often with a somewhat different view. It was therefore a most welcome contribution to the Lords＊ debate on Brexit last week when Lord Butler of Brockwell, the former cabinet secretary, said: ※My lords, one has to ask why those who base their arguments for Brexit on the will of the people are now opposed to consulting the people on the outcome of the negotiations. One has to suspect that they fear that they will get a different answer.§The problem is that much damage is likely to be wreaked meanwhile.Personally, I think it would be an act of real statesmanship if, as things go from bad to worse in the next year, May were to address the nation and say that, while in good faith she had tried to carry out the will of the people, she had come to the view that Brexit would after all be a historic, calamitous mistake.Alas, some hope!"															
"t may have been nine years ago, but the financial crisis continues to throw its long shadow over Britain. Last week, RBS, at the time of the crisis the world＊s biggest bank, announced  of ?7bn 每 so chalking up cumulatively some ?58bn of losses since 2008.It is now even clearer than it was at the time that had the government not stepped in, taking a , RBS would have gone bust, threatening a more widespread banking panic with cascading consequences hard to contain. At the very least, Britain would have had an even deeper recession 每 and much slower recovery. At worst, there would have been a full-scale depression.In one way, ?45bn has rarely been better spent; but, in another, a clutch of hard questions that would have been asked if the bank had gone bust were avoided. How could it be that RBS＊s managers and shareholders could ever have allowed it to grow so large when so much of what it was doing was not just valueless, but actively ? Why was the wider financial and regulatory ecosystem of which RBS was a part not more alert to what was going on, and instead, to an extent, egging the bank on? What system could permit a business horror story with such near-calamitous results; and even so was part of an inequitable capitalism that helped trigger the resentments contributing to Brexit?For RBS is not alone in losing its way so badly. Too many great names in British business have revealed feet of clay in the past few years.  to the UK, US and Brazilian governments to settle bribery and corruption claims in 12 countries. Tesco had to take huge writedowns over scarcely credible, large-scale . British banks have paid more than  policies, over the past 15 years. Then there are the never-ending accounting and contractual irregularities that plague the public outsourcing industry, from Serco to G4S.It is not only a British phenomenon 每 Germany＊s  in tricking regulators over the emissions of its diesel engines. But, as global investment managers will acknowledge, British companies seem disproportionately caught out by serious irregularities in accounting. But then British companies, largely because of the way their fragmented shareholder base interacts with the stock market and the injunctions of British company law, are uniquely under pressure to provide good short-term financial results.There was a collective sigh of relief last week when, after just 48 hours, Kraft Heinz  每 a company that has consistently taken a long-term view in building an environmentally sustainable business. But if Unilever is to stay independent and protect its values, it is going to have to apply to itself 每 even if more judiciously 每 the flint-eyed treatment that Kraft Heinz would have administered. Loyal shareholders, if they are to stay loyal, are going to have to be rewarded quickly and generously. Last week, post the bid, Unilever announced it would do just that.People at large know these issues are fundamental, but business and finance seem distant, difficult-to-understand worlds over which nobody, let alone governments, seem to have much leverage. If you hold with a Corbyn-type philosophy, it is proof positive that the only solution to today＊s capitalism is socialist transformation 每 but it is a view few share. The 20th-century experience of attempted socialist transformations is hardly encouraging. In any case, if you have regular contact with senior business executives, what is impressive is their enthusiasm to build businesses and create value rather than a hunger to exploit their workforce and cut corners.The trouble is that too often it does not come out that way: they are prisoners of a business ecosystem over which they too feel they have little leverage 每 plunged into a dog eat dog world in which honest-to-Ggod business building is rarely the priority.What has to change is the architecture in which British companies operate, so that it gives better expression for the best of business intent. Nor is this just of corporate interest. Britain＊s indifferent record in innovation and investment, its poor productivity and even the inequalities of income between regions 每 among the worst in the industrialised world 每 are linked umbilically to the way much business is compelled to behave. To its credit, the May government, publishing green papers on corporate governance and industrial strategy in quick succession, recognises this truth. The difficulty is to identify what should follow.Queue , set up 20 months ago, with the aim of plugging the gap (full declaration: I co-chair it). Having marshalled the evidence last spring which proves that companies which put their purpose before profit outperform companies that do not, tomorrow it releases its policy report. The report＊s innovation is to think systemically across how company law, financial reporting, executive pay, the investment management industry, shareholding structures and financial flows could all be reformed in a way that cumulatively represents a new settlement for British capitalism.Better still, the recommendations build on many current initiatives whose general direction in a statement of core beliefs is supported by a cross-section of companies, investment houses and advisory firms.For the first time in my career, there is an alignment between a critical mass of business which recognises the system in which it operates needs to be re-engineered, a government that agrees, and a set of recommendations that could be implemented. Change could happen. Purposeful companies could be built.It is a watershed moment. When the task force was launched, we hoped it would make a difference, but addressing these questions was a minority sport. Not today, with Brexit looming 每 and beyond it the digital revolution and environmental and demographic challenges. Britain has needed a different capitalism for decades, but it has taken the reality of leaving the EU to drive the point home. Perhaps, just perhaps, it might happen 每 a silver lining in otherwise very dark clouds."															
"emember when the term ※pink dollar§ was first coined? It was one of the buzz phrases of the 1990s: a time of much change with regard to views on homosexuality in many countries. Lesbians were snogging on TV for the first time in Britain. In 1994, Australia passed a human rights act that finally scrapped the banning of gay sex. Meanwhile, there was a tornado of media coverage around the world of this ※pink dollar§, as companies realised that a more open LGBT demographic was something they could lucratively market to.Twenty years later, China is finally sparking its own pink dollar moment. Last month China Daily, the state-run newspaper, ran a feature with the headline, . It claimed the country＊s estimated 70 million LGBT people represent a market worth $300bn per year. In comparison, according to Witeck Communications, a company specialising in analysing the LGBT market, the US equivalent is worth $790bn a year. Homosexuality was illegal in  until 1997 but only declassified as a mental health disorder in 2001. Now, due to increasingly liberal attitudes among young urban Chinese, many big firms in the country market themselves as LGBT-friendly. On the other end of the business scale, an increasing amount of startups are tailoring their products and services for LGBT people to capitalise on this change.Zhu Qiming, chief executive of mobile game developer Star-G Technologies, which targets gay gamers, told China Daily: ※With rising social tolerance, people in the LGBT community have begun to demonstrate their identity and meet other members of the community through a range of social activities＃ I see strong demand going unfulfilled, and that provides us with ＆pink＊ opportunities.§Last October Geng Le, chief executive of the vastly successful Chinese gay dating app Blued, helped organise the first , which awarded investment to new companies targeting the LGBT market. ※There＊s a new concept of consumption upgrade offering more tailored services,§ he said. ※For example, an LGBT person might use a normal travel company, but if there＊s an agency designing LGBT-friendly itineraries the experience is better. Companies have realised there＊s a gap.§ Meanwhile global firms such as Starbucks, Alibaba, Nike and Adidas have got in on the act of marketing themselves as LGBT-friendly in China. Last year Alibaba-owned shopping giant Taobao organised trips for ten gay Chinese couples to  每 gay marriage is not legal in China. ※This is the other style of business expansion we＊re seeing,§ said Geng. ※They＊re just showing their attitude, really.§Chinese state media regularly runs articles in praise of such attitudes, but the progressive views lauded in newspaper columns are not always reflected in people＊s working lives. ※A lot of Chinese companies like Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu put LGBT-friendly messages on social media,§ said Steven Bielinski, organiser of China＊s first LGBT job fairs, which began in 2015 in Beijing. ※But they haven＊t necessarily done much when it comes to internal company LGBT policies.§There are no employment laws in China that specifically outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexuality, and court cases based on such discrimination are rare. Even in tier one cities, in which increasingly progressive attitudes abound, the vast majority of LGBT people do not talk to work colleagues about their sexuality. This year＊s, which polled 30,000 LGBT people across China, found that only 5% of participants said they told any family, friends or colleagues about their sexuality.Why is this supposed period of big market change not being reflected on a similar scale in workplaces? Of the five lesbian, gay or transgender people interviewed for this article about their work experiences, four said they never talked openly about their sexuality or gender identification at work. They said this was not a huge source of pain for them, just a practicality. ※I don＊t want to risk it,§ said Fei, a Beijing-based sales rep for a US-owned IT company. ※In my job there＊s fierce competition, I don＊t want people using my sexuality [against me]. I＊m dealing with government clients; I don＊t want them to have weird feelings.Fei＊s company has rigid policies against sexuality-based discrimination. ※I do feel protected by them,§ he said. ※And I feel like things are changing in China. When I was at university in 2001 finding a date was difficult because people didn＊t feel there could be a future. I had a relationship that ended because the guy had to have a sham marriage to a woman. It＊s still a straight man＊s world, but the young generation is getting more international.§Acceptance of homosexuality varies across different industries everywhere, but in China the differences are more pronounced. Gang, a lawyer based in Shanghai, considered the country＊s most gay-friendly city, said: ※Lawyers are always ahead of the times. The cases we deal with often involve emerging issues in society, so my colleagues wouldn＊t be interested in something so outdated [as homophobia].§ Despite this view, Gang is not openly gay at work. ※I don＊t want to bring my personal life up there,§ he said.Many people who work in less modern Chinese firms have to face more worrying attitudes. Yuan, a lesbian woman, used to do admin for a firm that sold tea. ※Once an industry is labeled, people in that industry are expected to fit a mould,§ she said. ※I suppressed myself for years.§Yuan pretended she was married to a man to help hide her sexuality, and encountered colleagues obsessed with the traditional heterosexual Chinese family unit. ※They would say, ＆You＊re like a boy＊ or, ＆I can＊t imagine what your husband must be like＊,§ she said. ※One colleague said she planned to send her kid to the UK rather than the US because ＆there are so many gays in the US＊. Career development was a concern 每 my bosses thought being LGBT was abnormal.§Accounts such as Yuan＊s make for pessimistic reading, but Geng thinks big business LGBT support will gradually help shift the boulder. ※There have been arguments about whether companies use LGBT marketing as a gimmick,§ he said. ※But whatever their purposes are, they＊re making LGBT people more visible. It＊s a good thing, and the impact of the economy as the force of social progress is beyond our imagination.§Bielinski added: ※There are perhaps hundreds of Chinese companies aware of LGBT as a customer group. They＊re still in the learning phase, but they will be thinking about what this means for their internal human resources policies.§Don＊t call it a society-shoving revolution quite yet, then. But China＊s pink economy is undoubtedly becoming red hot. "															
"Britain＊s post-referendum recovery in manufacturing . Two months of rising output were followed by a chunky  in October.To put it mildly, this came as a shock to economic forecasters. Strong consumer demand, the fall in the value of sterling and, especially, strong survey evidence, had all pointed to rising factory production.It didn＊t happen. The  was compounded by North Sea oil output falling as a result of routine maintenance. It meant that industrial production, which includes the offshore and onshore energy sectors and mining and quarrying as well as the output from factories, was down by 1.3% between September and October.That represented the biggest one-month decline since September 2012, a period when the eurozone was going through a particularly acute crisis.The Office for National Statistics always warns against reading too much into the data for a single month and it seems highly probable that North Sea oil production will have bounced back in November.Even so, the figures are worrying in two respects. Firstly, they mean that it will take a very strong performance in November and December to prevent a second successive quarterly fall in industrial production. Even a 1% increase in both months would result in a 0.1% decline in the fourth quarter. That would leave the sector, which accounts for 15% of economic output, in a technical recession.Secondly, the weakness seen in October cannot be dismissed as a one-off. Even if City economists are right in their belief that the outlook for UK manufacturing is brighter than the latest figures suggest, there is a lot of ground to make up.Manufacturing output in the three months to October was 5.7% below its level when the economy nosedived into recession in the first quarter of 2008. Industrial production, affected by the gradual depletion of North Sea fields, has seen an even bigger fall: 8.6%.The economy, in other words, is more unbalanced than it ever was."															
"Industrial production fell sharply and unexpectedly in October, dealing a blow to hopes that the UK economy will end 2016 on a high.A surprise 1.3% drop in production over the month followed a 0.4% decrease in September, according to , and was the biggest monthly fall in four years. Economists had forecast a 0.2% rise for October. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said the figures were ※an appreciable blow§ to prospects for the UK economy in the fourth quarter. Archer said: ※We had believed that there was a good chance that UK GDP growth in the fourth quarter could match the resilient 0.5% growth in the third quarter. October＊s drop in industrial production puts a significant dent in prospects.§One of the fall＊s main drivers was a 10.8% decline in oil and gas extraction resulting from a temporary shutdown in the Buzzard oilfield in the North Sea.A breakdown of the figures also showed that output 每 the largest part of industrial production 每 also fell unexpectedly, by 0.9% in October after a 0.6% increase a month earlier. Economists were expecting a 0.2% rise in manufacturing.Kate Davies, senior statistician at the ONS, said: ※October saw a sharp fall in UK oil output, largely down to the total shutdown of the major Buzzard oilfield.※Small falls in output across a range of sectors also contributed to a drop in overall manufacturing.§On an annual basis, industrial production was down 1.1% in October, while the narrower measure of manufacturing output was down 0.4%.Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, a forecasting group, said Britain＊s ※makers§ had got off to a weak start in the fourth quarter, but said some of the erratic factors that were behind the weak performance in October should start to fade.※As the role of temporary factors set to fade at some point, an improved performance over the remainder of the quarter seems likely, but that industry will make a positive contribution to GDP growth is looking tenuous,§ Beck said."															
"Australia＊s economy slipped backwards in the September quarter, by a greater than expected 0.5%.It is the first time in five years the economy has recorded three months of negative growth. When the economy previously contracted in a single quarter, in March 2011 (by 0.2%), it had suffered from the Queensland flood.If it contracts again in the December quarter, Australia will be in a technical recession 每 ending 25 years of economic growth.Australia＊s annual economic growth rate has now dropped from 3.3% to just 1.8%.Economists say it is now more consistent with the softening in the labour market that has occurred since the start of the year. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, in a hastily convened media conference, said Labor must now support the government＊s $48bn tax cut plan because the economy needed it.※This is the ticket to the next 25 years of growth,§ he said on Wednesday. ※But we cannot achieve that if we cannot get the partners in this parliament that will engage with us in the national interest, that won＊t be engaging in party political games, that won＊t engage in negative politics and wrecking and destroying, but will engage to lift the burden on business so they can invest and employ more people.§James Pearson, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also called for corporate tax cuts.※Australia must not be like the frog in the pot of water that is slowly brought to boil,§ he said.※To regain our competitiveness, and therefore create and sustain jobs, we must encourage our businesses, which employ most Australian workers, to invest and grow. That includes by cutting the burden of company tax to stimulate investment.§But the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, criticised Morrison＊s management of the economy. ※This is the second-worst economic growth result in the last 25 years,§ he said. ※It is true that quarterly figures do bounce around, and we would hope and trust that next quarter＊s figures are much stronger after this very low base, but the fact of the matter is that this is a deeply concerning result.§※The treasurer a few moments ago, in what I thought was a rather pathetic press conference, spent the whole time blaming the Labor party. Scott Morrison must take responsibility,§ he said.The Bureau of Statistics data showed economic activity contracted in a range of areas in the last quarter, highlighting the ongoing fragility of the economy.Falls in public expenditure, net exports, private investment in new buildings, new engineering, and new and used dwellings all detracted significantly from growth.Mining investment fell for the 12th consecutive quarter (down 10.6%), while non-mining investment rose by 4.8%.Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said one of the wettest winters on record caused disruptions, contributing to the unexpected decline in home building activity 每 including a 9% fall in new home building activity in Victoria.He said lending conditions were tightened in the second half of 2015, with housing finance contracting over the half year to March 2016, and that had negative spill-over effects.He said global growth and trade had also been lacklustre this year, while the labour market had been weaker than last year.Michael Blythe, the chief economist of the Commonwealth Bank, said growth was also affected by the election campaign in June and July, when measures of economic and political uncertainty spiked to near-record highs.※This uncertainty had a real economic impact on consumer and business activity,§ he wrote in a note to clients. ※It is not surprising that some economic drivers weakened at the time.Both Blythe and Hanlan believe economic growth should pick up again in the December quarter.※In a sense it should be easier for the economy to grow from here,§ Blythe said.※The income drag from falling commodity prices has ended in spectacular fashion with the surge in key bulk commodity prices. The spending drag from falling mining capital expenditure will soon be complete. What lies ahead are the benefits of rising mining production and resource exports.§Philip Lowe, the Reserve Bank governor, acknowledged after Tuesday＊s board meeting that ※some slowing§ in economic growth rate was likely, before it picked up again in the new year., at 1.5%, where it will stay until February at least when the Bank returns from its summer recess."															
"t is estimated that today＊s obesity epidemic costs the global economy about $2tn (?1.6tn) or some 3% of GDP. For individuals, deciding what to eat is a jealously guarded privilege, but for economists obesity is not really about people exercising free-market choice. Instead it is a market failure.The causes of the epidemic are complex, spanning the social sciences to biology and technology. Consider, for example, the shift towards urbanisation and car transport. By reducing many people＊s daily physical activity, these are estimated together to reduce individuals＊ need for food by 300 calories a day. So how much less food should the car driver eat to compensate? About one biscuit less a day 每 a trivial change that only goes to illustrate that few of us really understand the energy needs of our bodies.In market terms, making a rational choice at the dining table requires people to know how much energy they need and how much they are getting 每 yet neither of these is known. As any one who has ever tried to lose weight knows, in these matters talk is cheap and advice is unreliable. At various times sugar, protein, fat, starch, fast food, home cooking and snacks have all been held to be responsible for the obesity epidemic.  Back in the 1950s, the dominant theory was that eating fat was responsible for making you obese 每 and by sating appetite, sugar could help to reduce weight gain. However, food companies prefer to deflect rhetoric about poor diet being the primary cause of obesity, and instead promote messages focused on exercise and other factors 每 a phenomenon termed ※§. Nonetheless, the political spotlight is now on sugar, with ※environmental§ changes proposed to reduce the appeal of sugary foods, such as warning labels and nutritional information panels. There＊s serious talk of taxing them, in the way that tobacco has been. None of this is supported by any real evidence, but certainly new taxes are always popular with governments. (It＊s pretty obvious, after all, that there are plenty of thin children who enjoy sugary foods, and plenty of overweight people whose tastes lie elsewhere.) Prof Kevin Fenton, national director for health and wellbeing at Public Health England, says there are , by which he means a de-sugaring of foods such as cakes, biscuits and puddings. But these foods are not sugary by accident 每 they are sugary because that＊s what we like about them. It＊s like salted crisps having salt removed ＃ but yes, the health industry has pushed that one too. Solutions based on labelling of foods by calorific content to improve consumer choices belie both human psychology and the complexity of the body＊s digestive mechanisms. As a result, it is futile leaving a solution to the food and drink industry, or on relying on ※education§ to correct consumer behaviour.However, consumer choices are being skewed by government actions, such as massive programmes of agricultural support that actually favour fast foods over healthy eating. Billions of dollars go towards subsidising junk foods, through farm subsidies for producing ingredients such as soya and high-glucose corn syrup.  affects poor households far more than their richer neighbours 每 and the cost of eating healthily is a very practical reason why.And, as the US economist Richard McKenzie has pointed out, . For example, fast food has become cheaper, in part because of mechanisation and in part because the workers producing it are paid less and less. At the same time, the economic forces that propelled 1960s women away from the kitchen and into jobs also propelled families towards processed foodstuffs and eating out ＃ or just snacking.When markets go wrong, governments need to step in. Agricultural support should be switched away from junk foods and towards producing healthy ones. The low wages and poor training that fast-food outlets rely on should be made a thing of the past, and tax incentives (such as zero VAT) should support the labour-intensive production of ※real food§ in cafes and restaurants. Market corrections, rather than punitive moves aimed at individuals, are the only way to tackle what has become, in economic as well as in social terms, a very real crisis."															
"Borrowing on credit cards and loans grew at its fastest rate in almost a decade in October, according to figures from Britain＊s high street banks, as lenders competed to offer the best deals.The British Bankers＊ Association (BBA) said consumer credit was up by 7% year on year, the fast annual rate of growth since November 2006. In total, net unsecured borrowing increased by ?633m during the month, up from ?465m in September.The borrowing spree was fuelled by an increase in personal loans and overdrafts. On a seasonally adjusted basis, net borrowing added up to ?413m, higher than the previous six-month average of ?286m. Outstanding borrowing on credit cards grew by ?220m 每 just above the six-month average of ?211m.Lenders have been battling to top the best-buy tables for personal loans and credit cards. Interest rates have been cut and deals have been changed. In October, First Direct  its customers through personal loans to ?50,000, and credit card companies have been extending interest-free periods. , according to official figures, and the BBA＊s data suggests some of that spending was done on credit.Rebecca Harding, chief economist at the BBA, said:※Consumer credit is now growing at its fastest rate since November 2006, reflecting strong retail sales growth. Consumer confidence remains robust as borrowers take advantage of record low interest rates.§Paul Gordon, managing director of credit cards at Lloyds Banking Group, said the figures suggested consumers ※are proving relatively resilient in the face of continued uncertainty§. He added: ※As we move towards the end of the calendar year, we can expect that the use of credit cards will continue to rise 每 particularly in relation to Black Friday and Christmas sales 每 but the impact of recent political and economic changes on borrowing patterns is yet to be seen.§The BBA＊s seasonally adjusted figures for mortgage lending show that the number of home loans approved for house purchases reached a five-month high in October, at 40,851. The number of remortgages dropped slightly to 24,622 but the number of other loans secured on property rose to 8,847 每 its highest since January 2014.Andrew Wishart, assistant economist at Capital , said approvals for purchases were now not far off the monthly average of 43,000 that the BBA reported in 2015, ※with the short-term effect of the referendum on housing market confidence and activity now seemingly behind us§.He added: ※But with recent strong demand from first-time buyers set to be hampered by higher inflation, and credit standards no looser than last year, we don＊t expect approvals to surge.§ "															
"The UK faces the risk next year of a return to the squeeze in real pay suffered earlier in the decade as higher prices and a stalling of jobs growth puts living standards under pressure, a thinktank has warned. 每 which concentrates on the living standards of those on low to middle incomes 每 said 2015-16 had been the fastest year of real wage growth since 2001 but said the combination of low inflation and strongly rising employment would not be repeated.Torsten Bell, the foundation＊s director, said 2016 was ※getting a bad press§ but added: ※We may well come to look back at 2016 with fond nostalgia 每 not least given what 2017 looks set to have to offer. The issue is not that last year was awful, more that it risks being as good as it gets.§ The foundation＊s analysis of official shows that the 3% increase in non-pensioner household incomes in 2015-16 was evenly shared, with all parts of the income distribution seeing growth of over 2%.Bell said 2014-15 had also been a strong year for real income growth. ※Very rapid employment growth coupled with near zero inflation created a solid living standards recovery over the past few years, with the added bonus for low earners of the national living wage more recently.§He added that the strong recent performance had to be set against the unprecedented squeeze on real incomes during the deep recession of 2008-09 and the years that followed. However, Bell said neither of the two factors that had caused living standards to rise over the past two years would be repeated in 2017.  had slowed to a trickle in recent months as the labour market entered a holding pattern in the spring.※The good news is that employment remains close to record highs at over 75% and firms are by and large not planning on shrinking their workforces,§ Bell said. ※The bad news is that without further employment growth in 2017 one of the big boosts to household incomes of recent years (more people working and earning) will weaken. That leaves other determinants of income growth to pick up the slack. Unfortunately they look set to do the opposite.§Bell said ultra-low inflation had been the other factor boosting living standards but that prices were now starting to rise rapidly, with the result that the UK was ※on course for fast, significant and repeated falls in real earnings growth early in the new year. ※This earnings freefall means we expect wage growth to fall to around 1% in the three months to January 每 the slowest real wage rises in over two years. With inflation forecast to continue rising we project real earnings growth hovering around, or even below, zero for the second half of the year. A return to  is a real risk.§"

Yet the bubble was the culmination of a prolonged period of strong growth that saw Japan＊s economy rebuilt after the devastation caused by the second world war.Similarly, there was an explanation for the bidding up of technology stocks during the Dotcom bubble of the 1990s. There were real digital breakthroughs happening, but easy credit meant the boom got out of hand.China＊s economic transformation since the reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s has been remarkable. According to the  and more than 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty. Fortunes have been earned, with Deloitte noting that there are now more billionaires in Beijing (100) than in New York City (95).After three decades of rapid expansion, China＊s economy was showing signs of overheating when the financial crisis began in 2007. But its export-dominated economy was vulnerable to the collapse in trade and industrial production that followed the demise of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers.The government in Beijing, fearful that economic hardship would lead to political unrest, eased policy aggressively. Banks were flooded with cash and there was an extensive programme of public works. Not all the money was well spent. Roads were built that were not needed, ghost towns were constructed, factories that were unprofitable were kept open. And with fewer good bets to back in the real economy, investors awash with cash discovered the joys of asset speculation. They have developed a penchant for western brands. In the UK Chinese investors have snapped up prestige names including Sunseeker motor yachts, Hamleys and House of Fraser store groups and the Odeon cinema chain. In recent days they have agreed to hand over ?97m for the loss-making Aquascutum label and earlier this month a Chinese government-backed investment group, Sinofortone, bought the Plough at Cadsden 每 the Buckinghamshire pub where David Cameron once shared a pint with China＊s president, Xi Jinping.Four Midlands football clubs are already owned by Chinese investors 每 West Brom, Wolves, Birmingham City and Aston Villa 每 while Sinofortone has been linked with a possible bid for Liverpool FC.By 2013, the limits of China＊s ※expansion at any cost§ approach had been reached. Beijing started to restrict credit growth and the focus shifted towards the need for slower but better-balanced growth.But since then, policy has zigzagged as policy makers have tried to get the balance right. Laura Eaton, an economist at the consultancy Fathom, said that earlier this year the authorities ※threw in the towel§ when the economy slowed by more than expected and reverted to stimulus.But the policy shift was relatively short-lived because Beijing is worried by the risks associated with another boom. Bank lending growth has peaked, the property market has slowed, and fiscal policy has become less supportive. Andrew Kenningham of Capital  says this should result in economic growth slowing from around 6% in late 2016 to an average of nearer 5% in 2017 but he doesn＊t expect a ※hard landing§.Joshi＊s analysis suggests that Premier League managers should not worry too much about a mass exodus of their star players, pointing out that Beijing＊s balancing act cannot go on for ever. ※Admittedly, the ability of the Chinese authorities to ＆extend and pretend＊ is probably greater than elsewhere in the world, and this might prevent another violent tipping point.※Irrespective, the debt super cycle is over when the cost of malinvestment and misallocation of capital outweighs the benefit of good credit creation. With private sector indebtedness (including state owned enterprises) now at, or beyond, the level where every other credit boom peaked,  appears to be approaching this point.§"															
"o far, so good. That sums up the performance of the UK economy in the first three months after the referendum in June.In normal times, a quarterly growth rate of 0.6% would be wholly unexceptional for Britain and hardly worthy of comment. The economy has tended to expand by about 2.0% to 2.5% a year, so 0.6% over three months is about par for the course.These, though, were not normal times. The expectation of the , , and the was that a vote to leave the EU would result in instant economic carnage. Threadneedle Street predicted that the economy would barely grow in the third quarter. George Osborne talked about a year-long DIY recession.As it happens, the . Not only was there no recession, there was no slowdown either.By and large it was business as usual, with the economy displaying all its traditional strengths and weaknesses. Consumers carried on spending as if nothing had happened and imports were sucked in as a result, leading to a deterioration in the balance of payments. Manufacturing performed badly but financial and business services did well. In the circumstances, the small rise in business investment was both surprising and encouraging.The signs are that the final three months of 2016 will see more of the same. Retail sales have remained strong, the service sector continues to expand while industry struggles. Between 2015 and 2016 the economy will grow by about 2%.A number of conclusions can be drawn from this data. One is that the economy would probably have grown even faster had it not been for the referendum. Instead of cutting interest rates, the Bank would probably have raised them by now.A second is that there is no guarantee that the solid performance in the second half of the year will continue. Inflation is poised to rise sharply early in 2017 and that will lead to a slowdown in consumer spending.Finally, any satisfaction to be gleaned from the economy outperforming the expectations of the IMF, the Treasury et al has to be tempered by the fact that the UK is still running a quarterly balance of payments deficit of 5% of gross domestic product. That＊s far too high for comfort."															
"he chancellor brings the air of an undertaker to the despatch box. His suits are dark, his expression glum and his sense of humour, although unexpectedly sharp, is deployed only sparingly. This is a chancellor for hard times, and in his unshowy way, hard times are what he predicted.This chancellor is the antithesis of his predecessor George Osborne and so was his autumn statement. The only rabbit pulled from Philip Hammond＊s topper was that the number of opportunities for rabbit pulling 每 what the Treasury calls fiscal events 每 is to be cut from two to one. This was Hammond＊s first autumn statement, and it is to be his last. Hammond is a new chancellor in a new government working in a wholly new context. Leaving the EU, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)＊s newly released  - which are based on Brexit happening in April 2019 - will mean sharply declining growth and falling revenues. The OBR expects rising inflation and squeezed household incomes as the value of the pound continues to decline in a less trade-intensive economy.The slower growth and  illustrate one of the most profound ironies of the referendum result. Many of those who voted to leave, the ※just about managing§ people that  on the steps of Downing Street, are exactly the ones who will bear the brunt of Brexit under the chancellor＊s plans.There has been a  this week that would never have happened in the Cameron-Osborne years when the prime minister marched in lockstep with his chancellor, who doubled as political strategist. Stories have been circulating all week that No 10 was pressing the chancellor next door for a handout to the Jams, the brand new acronym for a familiar but freshly defined . The Jams appear to owe their origin to the Resolution Foundation, a thinktank now chaired by the former Tory minister David Willetts, whose director is Torsten Bell, a former aide to Ed Miliband. Resolution  to coincide with the Conservative party conference in October that provided the evidence to underpin May＊s description of just managing families in July.Resolution estimates that there are about 6 million Jams living in households where at least one member is working, based away from metropolitan centres in smaller towns from Lancashire to Devon, probably not in professional jobs, most likely not college educated and whose life choices are restricted by low pay that has not significantly increased since the crash in 2008, while house prices have soared out of control. In the hands of the former chancellor,  每 even modest ones 每 would have been the cue for headline-grabbing initiatives. In Hammond＊s  the surprise was that there was no surprise. The small concessions that were made were already in the pipeline. Tax thresholds will rise, as Osborne set out, and the national living wage will go up from ?7.20 to ?7.50 an hour in April next year 每 slightly less than the rise needed to increase it by regular increments to 60% of median earnings by 2020. Fuel duty is frozen for the seventh year in a row. Insurance premiums are meant to come down through legislation to restrict compensation for whiplash injuries, but insurance premium tax will rise. Agents＊ letting fees will be banned.There are also some large and consequential decisions that will make the next four years hard indeed. Weeks of Tory backbench pressure on Hammond to soften Osborne＊s cuts to universal credit have been rebuffed. Instead the work allowance, beyond which it starts to be withdrawn, was left unchanged. Though the rate at which it tapers off as earnings increase is very slightly slowed from 65p to 63p in the pound, according to House of Commons figures, that means a working family with two children could be ?800 instead of ?1,100 a year worse off,. A lone parent in work with two children could be ?2,300 a year instead of ?2,500 worse off.Childcare for three and four year-olds is being extended from 15 to 30 hours a week from next September, but Osborne＊s decision to limit universal credit to two children from next April still stands. The Child Poverty Action Group predicts that working families will be worse off, and more children will grow up in poverty.This is scant comfort for May＊s Jams. Hammond has put his ambition of a ※match-fit§ economy ahead of their needs. The match in question is the world after Brexit. So the best hope for the Jams is in the wider and longer-term plans to try to ease the metropolitan-market town split that was revealed by the result of June＊s referendum. The chancellor promised a further attempt to rebalance the economy away from London through measures such as the allocation of ?1.8bn from the Local Growth Fund to local enterprise partnerships in the English regions. There is to be an extra ?1bn for local transport networks, and ?2.3bn will be invested in infrastructure that new housing developments need. But this is slow-burn stuff. Meanwhile there was nothing to divert the looming catastrophe in social care that has left a million elderly people without adequate support in their homes, and hospitals struggling with patients stuck in hospital because there is no safe place for them to go. Councils had pinned their hopes on more from the Better Care Fund, the pot of money that is supposed to be joining up hospital and social care, but they were not even given permission for a further increase in the precept they can levy to meet the cost of the paying the national living wage. Instead the chancellor was adamant that the NHS had had the extra money it asked for, a view disputed by the Tory chair of the Commons health committee, the King＊s Fund and every expert on health spending. He dismissed projections of a deficit in NHS England trusts of ?680m as a mere drop in the context of a budget of more than ?100bn a year. He spoke sharply about the size of the NHS＊s contingency fund. This was a continuity autumn statement. Hammond is even more concerned about borrowing and fiscal rebalancing than Osborne was. His anxieties have outweighed May＊s pledges to the Jams. This is the first guess at tailoring Conservative economic consequences to the prospect of of Brexit from a chancellor operating even more in the dark than his predecessors. The pace of leaving, the impact on trade, investment, growth and borrowing are all even more uncertain than when an earlier chancellor, Denis Healey, denounced the  每 which he introduced 每 as ※an extrapolation from a partially known past through an unknown present to an unknowable future, according to theories about the causal relationships between certain economic variables which are hotly disputed by academic economists§.

"※The first challenge is to increase our productivity. Britain today is some 20% less productive than our main competitors and has been for years.§Not the words of Philip Hammond in his  but those of Gordon Brown in his pre-Budget report 19 years ago. ※The productivity gap is well known, but shocking nonetheless,§ Hammond said on Wednesday. ※It takes a German worker four days to produce what we make in five, which means, in turn, that too many British workers work longer hours for lower pay than their counterparts.§His comments, and their symmetry with Brown＊s despite two decades between them, show the problem of productivity is an enduring one.Productivity is the rate of output per unit of input, or in other words the value of products made or sold by a worker in an hour of work. As Brown＊s comment shows, lacklustre productivity has hung over the UK for years. It has become more pronounced since the financial crisis, however, with an expansion of the workforce and a fall in unemployment not met with a proportionate growth in GDP.The government＊s autumn statement document states that improving productivity is the ※central long-term economic challenge§ for the UK and pivotal to increasing wages and living standards.Hammond has identified better infrastructure, technology and skills as the foundations for doing so, which is why he  in his autumn statement. Economists, however, said the government needed to do more than fund new infrastructure projects. Yael Selfin, the head of macroeconomics at KPMG, said: ※It is a pity that there was not more focus on education. ※If the government intends to make the UK less reliant on non-UK workers post-Brexit, the readiness of the local labour force will need to improve.§Poor management costs the UK economy ?84bn a year, said Ann Francke , the chief executive of the Chartered  Institute.※Our businesses are operating in a period of great uncertainty. This makes it difficult to plan ahead and affects how we resource and develop our employees,§ she said. ※It＊s tough to attract and retain skilled managers, and we need 2 million more by 2024. So we know that building management capability is critical for growth in the UK and we hope that the welcome focus on productivity will include the need to improve our management structures.§"															
															
"Households are being told to brace for more price rises on fuel, food and other essentials in 2017 after the new year started with petrol at a two-year high.The AA says motorists in the UK are paying 15p a litre, or an average of ?8.25 a tank, more than a year ago, and economists say a higher oil price and weak pound will probably push prices up further this year.Planned  by Opec members and non-Opec countries have pushed the oil price higher in recent weeks, though the price of Brent crude fell back slightly in Tuesday trading.That has led to , and the AA said petrol over the weekend averaged 117.90p a litre compared with 102.69p at the same time last year. The price is now the highest since December 2014. Diesel rose to 120.35p a litre compared with 105.99p a year ago.※Drivers have had a bad start to 2017, seeing 1p, 2p and even 3p ticking up on the fuel price boards over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. Petrol is back to where it was in December 2014 and diesel at a level last seen in July 2015,§ a spokesman said.Households are also facing higher food costs, according to a separate report suggesting UK grocery prices rose between November and December. A basket of 35 commonly bought items cost ?83.33 last month, up from ?83.18 in November, according to the website mySupermarket. It was, however, still 3% cheaper than in December 2015.The increases follow signs from official data suggesting higher prices are starting to affect the way people spend. November retail sales figures showed that after fuel prices rose, .Inflation in the UK remains relatively low, at , but economists say it could rise to 3% by the end of the year as the oil price increases and the pound＊s weakness since the Brexit vote inflates the cost of imports to the UK such as metals and food ingredients. The import price effect is already being seen in , and companies are expected to pass at least some of that on to consumers.The British Retail Consortium said shop prices were still falling year-on-year but that the pace of deflation eased last month to 1.4% from 1.7% in November. It said the general trend for prices this year would be upwards but that competition between retailers would limit how much they could increase prices.Its latest figures show that non-food deflation decelerated to 1.9% in December, down from 2.3% in the previous month and the weakest deflation rate since June 2015. Food deflation decelerated marginally to 0.7% in December from a rate of 0.8% in November. Helen Dickinson, the BRC＊s chief executive, said the majority of the categories it monitored had seen month-on-month increases even though prices were down on a year ago overall. Clothing and footwear saw month-on-month inflation for the first time in nearly two years.※We＊ve said for some time that we expect to see underlying inflationary pressures, notably from the post-referendum fall in the value of the pound, feed through into shop prices,§ she said. ※It＊s too early to confirm that this is what we＊re seeing in December＊s figures: timings of seasonal discounts can cause monthly fluctuations at this time of year and retailers have continued to find ways to mitigate the impact on consumers.§※However, we expect the general trend in inflation to be upwards over 2017. The magnitude of the exchange rate movement and commodity price rises combined with the increasing costs of doing business means that retailers will have little choice other than to pass on some of these rising costs into prices but the effect will be lessened by the intensity of competition.§"															
"he costs and benefits of the UK＊s membership of the single market were widely debated before the referendum. However, the customs union was hardly mentioned. Yet it is the customs union that permits goods to circulate freely within the EU (and beyond, to a few other countries including, for the most part, Turkey) and which means the EU negotiates trade agreements with non-EU countries as a single entity.So does  mean leaving the customs union? It seems obvious that it would 每 what＊s the point of leaving the EU if we leave the EU in charge of UK trade policy? On the other hand, the Treasury is now taking a good hard look at the costs and logistical implications of having to reinstate at least some border checks for goods flowing between Dover and Calais, or Felixstowe and the continent (not to mention the thorny issue of the Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland border).There are no simple answers here 每 while there are undoubtedly short-term costs to leaving, it is perfectly reasonable to argue that if the UK is to make a success of Brexit over the longer term we need the flexibility to formulate our own, independent trade policy. To make an objective assessment of the costs and benefits, you might even want to ask some experts ＃What you definitely don＊t want to do is to listen to anyone who claims that leaving the customs union has no costs, only benefits. But that＊s precisely what Change Britain did when  that leaving the customs union 每 and concluding new free trade deals with countries ranging from India to Korea 每 could ※create 400,000 new jobs§, because of the projected increase in UK exports.Let＊s leave aside the fact that India has made it  that it＊s not interested in a trade deal with the UK as long as we continue to go out of our way to make skilled workers and students from India unwelcome. Let＊s even brush over the fact that the EU already has a . Since this has been broadly in force since 2011 每 and would not necessarily continue post-Brexit, although it may well do so 每 this is a potential cost of leaving the customs union, not a benefit. Even more fundamental is the obvious point that the impact of free trade deals 每 if they are successful 每 is to increase both exports and imports.Claiming that free trade deals would create British jobs because our exports would go up, but ignoring the fact that our imports would also increase, is either deeply ignorant or deliberately misleading. In fact, almost any economist 每 regardless of their views of the economics of Brexit 每 would tell you that over time the impact of trade deals . As with , Change Britain seems to be doing its best to crowd out serious debate on the costs and benefits of leaving the customs union.Meanwhile, back in reality, the Financial Times＊ annual survey found that the vast majority of economists remain of the view that Brexit will be a drag on UK growth over the medium to long term. Of course, economists, like others, should not just be asked what they think will happen next, but be held to account for what they predicted in the past.  Brexit would have relatively little impact on the economy in the short term (that is, in 2016) but that it would be significant medium-term costs; we will see how that turns out.Less definitively, I also said that the UK could survive and indeed prosper outside of the EU, but there are obvious and serious risks. The current framing of the Brexit debate, across the political spectrum 每 that we are somehow ※trading off§ the economic benefits of the single market against the downsides of free movement 每 illustrates those risks. Restricting trade, capital flows and immigration 每 reducing the openness of the UK economy 每 all have negative economic impacts.It is these big choices about the UK＊s economic future 每 not fictional numbers made up for a cheap headline or to support the political agenda of one faction or another 每 that we should be focusing on as we approach the start of the Brexit process."															
"Economists have disputed claims from a pro-Brexit campaign group that leaving the customs union and new free trade deals could create 400,000 jobs, arguing it takes no account of the risks to exports.Analysis by the Change Britain campaign group suggests that hard , where Britain leaves both the single market and the customs union, could ultimately be beneficial for the UK, citing reports that the US, India, the South American Mercosur group, China, Canada and South Korea have all expressed an interest in trade deals.Agreements with these countries would create almost a quarter of a million jobs, a figure that could rise to just under 400,000 if deals were struck with Japan and the Asean group of states that includes Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, the group＊s analysis said.But Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and senior fellow at the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, called the report＊s figures ※entirely fictional statistics§ and said they did not take into account possible .※Successful free trade deals would increase both exports and imports,§ he said. ※Calculating, as Change Britain does, a speculative figure for the number of jobs created by additional exports while ignoring the jobs lost as a result of additional imports is either deeply ignorant or deliberately misleading.§Portes said he also believed it was misleading for the report to cite extra benefits including free trade agreements with countries such as . ※The report scores the impact of the EU-Korea FTA as a benefit from Brexit,§ he said. ※Since this has been in force since 2011 每 and would not necessarily continue post-Brexit, although it may well do so 每 this is a potential cost, not a benefit. Whatever your view on the economics of Brexit, Change Britain are again doing their best to distort the debate.§A Change Britain spokesman said that though the South Korea FTA had been provisionally applied for a number of years, all tariffs only formally disappeared from 2016. ※The European commission has said that many benefits would not be clear for at least 10 years 每 that＊s why we are including these benefits in our calculations,§ the spokesman said.※We have used the same methodology as used by the EU commission in its papers on the benefits of free trade. This is the very institution that Portes is still campaigning in favour of.§Change Britain＊s spokesman said it was ※a shame that experts like Portes continue to talk Britain down§.Simon Tilford, the deputy director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank, said Change Britain ※seem to assume that leaving the deepest and biggest customs union and free trade agreement in the world, the EU, with which we do half of our trade, will not have any negative economic implications and will not cost employment 每 that＊s an unserious proposition§.Change Britain, which developed out of the official Vote Leave campaign, is chaired by Labour MP and leave supporter Gisela Stuart and has backing from prominent MPs including Michael Gove and Dominic Raab as well as former chancellor Nigel Lawson.The report＊s figures are calculated using a European commission study from 2012 that estimated 16,700 jobs would be created for each billion euros of extra-EU exports.※This means that the number of UK jobs that will be created from trade deals with these countries can be calculated by simply dividing 16,700 by the UK＊s proportion of extra-EU exports 每 14.99% in 2015,§ the report says. ※This process produces a new figure of 2,503 new UK jobs for each 1bn of extra-EU exports.§Sam Bowman, the executive director of the neoliberal Adam Smith Institute, wrote  that the numbers were ※basically junk§ and said the heavyweight backers of Vote Leave ※can do better than this§.※The extra exports figures come from using EU projections about the benefits of trade deals with countries and blocs like India, China and Mercosur, and dividing by Britain＊s share of extra-EU trade (15%),§ he wrote. ※This is fairly misleading, because it assumes that the UK could get the same terms as the EU, which is unlikely, since the UK is a much smaller economic bloc than the EU, so other countries will be less willing to give us what we want to get access to our market. It＊s very much back-of-the-fag-packet stuff.§ The pro-single market campaign group Open Britain, the continuity arm of Stronger In, called the report ※misleading, fantasy figures§ that undermined the case for leaving the customs union.The Labour MP Phil Wilson, an Open Britain supporter, said: ※The EU helps increase the UK＊s global trade links, giving our economy access to over 50 other global markets. We should be looking at ways to protect these benefits, not sacrificing them on the basis of made-up, misleading numbers by anti-EU ideologues.§Open Britain said one key issue was that the report factors in a trade deal with India, which the Indian government  would be reliant on an increase in student visas, incompatible with Change Britain＊s desire to cut migration.Tilford said the UK was likely to find it hard to broker deep free trade agreements with countries such as India unless it was prepared to offer visa liberalisation. ※Britain was one of the biggest obstacles to an EU-India free trade agreement and the reasons for that was that the UK did not want to give greater access to Indian IT specialists,§ he said. ※We＊ve left the EU, so why Britain would immediately do a volte-face on that is not clear. Britain alone would have to concede much more to get access to the Indian market.§Announcing the report, the Change Britain founding supporter and former CBI director-general, Lord Jones of Birmingham, said: ※The UK has a rich history as a great trading nation. It is therefore no surprise that a number of major economies have already expressed an interest in striking free trade agreements with us.※The only way we can make the most of these huge opportunities is to leave the EU＊s customs union and take back control of our trade policy. This will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in a range of industries right across the UK. We can then take our place as one of the global champions of free trade.§The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said Jones was ※competing for the Booker prize for fiction§ with the report＊s conclusions. ※Leaving the customs union would at a stroke deny us access to the economies of 50 countries. It would gamble British jobs on foreign trade agreements that are years from being struck,§ he said. A Department for International Trade spokesman said: ※It＊s right to take time to work out the best options for the UK＊s trading relationship after we leave the . As we have said before, those decisions have yet to be made.§"															
"hen Mark Carney insisted in  at Liverpool John Moores University that the conditions through which we are now living are ※exactly the same§ as those that British citizens endured during the ※lost decade§ of the 1860s, he was taking a bit of rhetorical licence. The past is never simply the present dressed up in funny clothes, and the analogy between today＊s painful realities and those of 150 years ago doesn＊t quite hold. And yet, the governor of the Bank of England had a point.When , it undid once and for all the sense that, give or take a few individual misfortunes, capitalism was a moral force that rewarded skill and hard work. Toppling under a mountain of unsecured debt, the joint stock bank dragged down 200 businesses and a broad tranche of private investors with it, from courtiers to grocers. As with the Northern Rock crisis in 2007, there were queues of panicky investors lining the streets. More profoundly, now came a dawning realisation that bad things could happen to good people. Thanks to the publication of Charles Darwin＊s Origin of Species in 1859, the universe increasingly seemed not only godless but, what was perhaps even worse, indifferent to the sufferings of ordinary folk.The shock of 1866 was doubly hard because, for the previous 15 years, Britain had been sailing on a sea of prosperity and confidence. In 1851,  had showcased the nation＊s position as ※the workshop of the world§, the great exporter of industrial goods and technological know-how to the four corners of the globe. Business was thriving, the social discontent of the ※hungry§ 1840s had receded, and this was, to use the coinage of the historian WL Burn, the ※age of equipoise§, a serene and sunny upland of prosperity and social cohesion.Increasingly, though, there were worrying signs that Britain could not hold on to its trading pre-eminence for much longer. Germany and the United States were playing industrial catch-up, and would soon be making everything from saucepans to spanners more cheaply and better than we ever could. What＊s more, with global transport systems stretching further as each year passed, Britain＊s grain, and even its dairy and meat produce, would soon be supplied from as far away as Australia and Canada. Domestic farming was about to go into a decline from which, some historians suggest, it has never recovered.This sense that 1860s Britain had entered a post-industrial landscape of environmental exhaustion and terminal moral decay was there in the literature too. Charles Dickens＊  (1864-5) tells the story of ※the golden dustman§, Mr Boffin, who has amassed a great fortune from the heaps of refuse that now ring London＊s smarter residential areas. Inside those houses, meanwhile, families such as Mr and Mrs Veneering do nothing but surround themselves with the shiny surfaces of their brand new furniture, as if setting the scene for an endless series of selfies.If the economic underpinnings of Britain＊s ※equipoise§ were under strain in the 1860s, then so too was its political status quo. Everywhere, working men were campaigning for the vote. The problem was that no one knew how all those Manchester factory hands and Barrow steelworkers would behave at the ballot box. Their economic interests and cultural ambitions lay so far from those of the metropolitan elite that, according to the prime minister Lord Derby, the , extending the franchise to working-class men, would be nothing less than ※a leap in the dark§. Yet far from swinging Britain wildly towards radical liberalism, which had been the terror, the effect was to strengthen popular Conservatism.Still, if Carney is serious about his comparison between us and the people of 1860s, he might want to delve deeper and find some reasons to be cheerful. The 1860s, after all, saw the beginning of a new wave of feminism. Bank failures such as Overend Gurney had left women more financially vulnerable than ever: with professional men going down like ninepins, their wives and daughters needed new ways to take care of themselves.Initiatives in education meant that young women were finding new ways of entering the skilled employment market as clerks and commercial artists as well as qualified teachers. In 1870, the  allowed women to hang on to their own financial resources rather than see them pass to their husband to squander. There had even been a serious suggestion that the 1867 reform bill should extend the vote to women on the same terms as men. The fact that this didn＊t come to pass for another 50 years makes you realise that, within the detritus of that first ※lost§ decade, were the seedlings of important new beginnings. When economists refer to a lost decade, they are usually counting each year＊s growth and concluding that 10 years of effort have left the country pretty much where it started.Mark Carney meant something slightly different when he used the phrase to refer to the years since the collapse of Northern Rock in 2008. The  governor was pointing more specifically to wage growth 每 not the stagnation of all activity in the economy as a whole, measured by gross domestic product (GDP).On that measure, the comparison with the 1860s is correct. A graph documenting the last 150 years shows that wages slumped around 1860 before recovering to leave workers no better off by 1870. But the similarities stop there, as Threadneedle Street points out in its  [PDF] of the troubles that befell the largest and most famous discount broker in Britain at the time.Overend Gurney, which collapsed with huge debts in 1866, was an isolated case. Or as the Bank puts it: ※The idiosyncratic failure of a bank ＃ rather than a systemic crisis with a common cause.§ It was allowed to go bust by officials who believed it rotten to the core. Other institutions were saved from contagion by a flood of central bank loans.One result was the destruction of some middle-class wealth. Yet annual wages were more likely affected by the American civil war (1861-65), which denied the Lancashire cotton mills of vital raw materials and forced huge numbers of workers to accept pay cuts or lose their jobs altogether.Sir Roderick Floud, an eminent economic historian and an editor of the Cambridge Economic History of Modern Britain, says the US was already a powerful trading partner and that a blockade of the secessionist south took its toll on Britain, ※which is another one-off event and really not applicable to today§.The only decade that resulted in stagnant GDP was the 1920s, which saw violent swings from year to year that resulted in zero progress. The 1930s, contrary to popular belief, was a period of growth, though mostly spurred by public-sector spending on housing and Britain＊s rearmament programme."															
"The first evidence has emerged that the era of record-low fixed-rate mortgages may be coming to an end after HSBC withdrew its ※cheapest-ever§ deal and increased rates on other products.HSBC had been offering a mortgage that allowed customers to lock in for two years at a rate of 0.99%, but this deal has been pulled with immediate effect. The bank＊s new mortgage offers are coming in at up to 0.5% higher.The move follows warnings from mortgage brokers that a number of factors, including Donald Trump＊s US election win, .David Hollingworth at broker London & Country  said: ※The bottom of the market may have been hit. This [announcement] and the broader changes from HSBC, which has been very aggressively priced in the fixed-rate market, could spell the end of the sub-1% fixed rate, but also signals a potential turning point for fixed mortgage rates.§HSBC＊s 0.99% deal was  and was the cheapest on the market, as well as the lowest ever recorded by financial information firm Moneyfacts. The deal emerged at a time when competition among lenders had been hotting up, reflecting the fact that the cost of borrowing for banks and building societies had fallen to new lows.A HSBC spokesman said: ※When the cost of funding comes down we are always quick to pass on the benefit to customers, and we have been able to do that for almost six months with our 0.99% rate mortgage. The cost of funding has gone up over the last month or so and we have had to reflect that in our recent pricing review. ※We regularly review our rates, and while they still provide good value for those looking to move on to or up the housing ladder, should the cost of funding come back down you can be sure we will reflect that with some great deals.§Last month, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said home loan affordability had  for both first-time buyers and home movers. It added that in September, first-time buyers spent an average of just 17.8% of their monthly household income on mortgage repayments 每 partly reflecting August＊s interest rate cut from 0.5% to 0.25%. Meanwhile, according to Moneyfacts, the average five-year fix fell below 3% for the first time on record.But more recently swap rates 每 what the banks pay to borrow from one other, which play a large part in determining the pricing of fixed-rate mortgages 每 have increased sharply, a trend which accelerated in the days following Trump＊s win.Economists believe the president-elect＊s promises of tax cuts and a $550bn boost to infrastructure spending will force the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to  than had been expected. In recent weeks, UK mortgage brokers have warned that this was translating into upwards pressure on fixed-rate mortgage pricing.HSBC has now announced it is ※increasing the rates of all fixed-rate products by between 0.1%-0.5%§, and is removing the 0.99% ※special rate§. Its two-year fixed-rates now start at 1.29%. However, no changes are being made to variable rates.Hollingworth said: ※The 0.99% fixed-rate has been something of a poster boy for the record low rates that borrowers have been enjoying. Borrowers that have held off hoping that rates could fall further may not want to delay much more ＃ Higher swap rates could result in rates drifting up, though the good news is that the competition in the market continues to offer some sharp rates.§Challenger bank Atom has just launched in the mortgage market, its two-year fixed-rates reportedly starting at 1.19%.

"There has been a rise in the number of young people in the UK who are not in education, employment or training, known as Neets. show an increase in the number of 16- to 24-year-olds classed as economically inactive over July to September, lifting the number of Neets to 857,000. That was an increase of 14,000 from the previous three months and up 3,000 from a year earlier.The proportion of young people not in education, work or training edged up to 11.9% from 11.7% in the previous quarter. It is still down significantly from 16.9% five years ago but the change in trend in the latest quarter will fan fears that young people＊s opportunities will suffer if Brexit uncertainty weakens the jobs market.Marc Bolland, chairman of Movement to Work and a former chief executive of Marks & Spencer, said the increase in Neets was striking. The announcement that the number of young people who are not in education, employment or training has risen by 14,000 to 857,000 is a clear call to employers that more needs to be done to support our young people,§ he added.Movement to Work was established three years ago as a voluntary collaboration of UK employers aimed at tackling youth unemployment and helping Neets to get training and work. It includes big name employers including M&S, the NHS, BT, WPP, and Tesco and more than 50,000 young people have taken part in the scheme.The rise in Neets is a blow to government hopes of improving , something the chancellor, Philip Hammond, placed at the centre of his autumn statement this week. Ministers have  to help tackle both youth unemployment and skills shortages. But critics say those plans are off track and .Commenting on the latest Neet figures, Steve Hill at the Open University said the UK must ※urgently consider more high-quality, work-based training options, which tailor skills provision to the world of work§.※The UK has long suffered from the so-called productivity puzzle, which sees us lag behind our G7 counterparts in terms of output per worker. The Neets problem is another facet of the fact that the skills needs of businesses up and down the country are not being met, and is of course a tragedy for a generation of young people as well,§ said Hill, external engagement director at the Open University.The Office for National Statistics said nearly half, or 43%, of all young people in the UK who were Neet were looking for work and available for work and therefore classified as unemployed. The remainder were either not looking for work or not available for work and therefore classified as economically inactive. That category includes the long-term sick and those caring for children or other relatives.In the latest quarter, the number of unemployed young people fell by 21,000 to 369,000. But the number of economically inactive young people rose by 35,000 to 489,000.Labour market expert John Philpott noted the figures followed news last week of a .※These latest figures for Neets provide a worrying sign that the recent slowdown in the overall pace of UK employment growth is hitting the youth job market relatively hard,§ said Philpott, director of the consultancy .※As the Neet figures confirm a large number of these jobless youths simply stopped looking for work rather than entering education or undertaking training as an alternative. If as these figures suggest the jobs tide is again turning against Britain＊s youth, priority action is needed by government to ensure that Job Centres and providers of employment programmes are able to respond. We shouldn＊t allow the policy fashion for helping ＆just about managing＊ families to obscure the fact that many of our young people simply aren＊t managing at all.§Bolland said that one of the challenges of tackling Neets was that many of the most disadvantaged young people had disappeared off the radar altogether.He said: ※We are not waiting for them, we are actively looking around communities for people that we can reach out to. People need to be found, they＊re not always registered.§ Movement to Work is helped by charitable organisations, including the Prince＊s Trust, to identify possible candidates."

They need to know what rules they will be working by and how they can still secure access to skilled workers and labour, where shortages already exist.§The group has identified six business priorities for the post  economy, including a barrier-free relationship with the EU, a clear path for regulation, and a migration system that allows businesses to access skills and labour from abroad.Fairbairn added: ※The CBI will work closely with the government to deliver an outcome that helps to meet the needs of firms throughout the UK, building a post-Brexit economy that spreads prosperity to all.§"

"The West Midlands has become an employment blackspot and is badly trailing behind other parts of the UK on job creation and living standards, a leading think tank has warned. These considerations pushed the region into voting to leave the European Union, said the Resolution Foundation.The West Midlands now has the lowest employment rate of any other big city region 每 64.5% compared with an average of 70.9% 每 and lags behind the UK average on growth, pay and income.The thinktank called on government to do more to help Birmingham and the surrounding area and said the new metro mayor for the West Midlands, who will be elected next May, must prioritise creating high-quality jobs, improving productivity, and tackling a long-standing skills shortages.The West Midlands delivered the strongest vote to leave the EU of any region in the UK once characteristics such as age and income were discounted. Walsall, Sandwell and Dudley particularly supported Brexit. Resolution said there were strong links between  and the employment problems, which stretch back to before the 2008 global financial crisis.Conor D＊Arcy, author of the report and a policy analyst at Resolution, said: ※The West Midlands＊ terrible record on job creation has created a huge employment blackspot and was a key factor behind its overwhelming vote to leave the EU.※Turning the city region＊s economic prospects around will be a huge task facing the new mayor, and they should have the full backing of central government too. Whitehall should recalibrate its flagship Midlands engine project to supporting the new mayor in overseeing a long overdue jobs boom across the West Midlands.§The region, which has a population of 4 million and encompasses Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton, entered the downturn with the lowest employment rate of any city region. Employment prospects have only improved at a ※glacial pace§ since, Resolution said, despite success stories such as the revival of Jaguar Land Rover.The region＊s employment rate had grown by about half the average for city regions in the UK. If the West Midlands had kept pace with the average, an additional 114,000 people would now have a job.D＊Arcy added: ※For years the West Midlands has been ignored as previous governments have focused on making London the financial capital of the world and Manchester a ＆northern powerhouse＊. It＊s high time Birmingham and the Black Country are brought out of the shadows and made the focus of a national renaissance for Britain＊s major cities.§The report found one of the fastest growth areas for employment had been work via agencies,  for its failure to provide a decent living or economic security to workers.※In contrast to trends across the UK and its cities, managers now make up a smaller proportion of the workforce than they did in 2008 while the share of professionals has remained flat against rapid increases elsewhere,§ Resolution said.The researchers also found that employment problems spread across the region. Solihull was the only local authority to have a higher employment rate than the UK＊s city region average. Birmingham was the worst performing part of the West Midlands, followed by Walsall.The report highlighted three groups experiencing particular troubles finding work: young people, BAME workers 每 black, Asian or minority ethnic 每 and low-qualified workers. It noted that barely half of all young people aged 16-29 were in work and urged policymakers to prioritise support for those disadvantaged groups with back-to-work programmes and other schemes. Despite its gloomy findings, the thinktank said there were still grounds for optimism that things could change under the the new mayor, who will have responsibility for transport, adult skills and planning, and .One area where policymakers could make big progress, it said, was .

"Britain＊s car industry reported record exports in the first 11 months of the year as a combination of the low pound and open access to Europe＊s single market boosted sales.UK car exports jumped to 1.25m, the highest ever, after factories put on more shifts and increased overtime to meet the demand for British-made vehicles.The low pound has widely been cited by car makers as a reason for increased demand abroad while others have stressed  and harmonised regulations to aid the steady flow of parts and finished vehicles across Europe., which employs 7,000 workers at its plant in Sunderland and exports more than 80% of its vehicles, warned that it would be forced to reconsider expanding production in the UK should it face higher shipment costs or restrictions on the supply of vital parts.Mike Hawes, chief executive of UK car industry trade body SMMT, said the car industry＊s success could be jeopardised without the current arrangements staying in place.※Made in Britain is a badge coveted by car buyers worldwide, and these latest figures highlight not just that international appeal but the fact that the UK is a globally competitive place to make cars,§ he said.※These latest results are the product of significant investments made over the past few years, but which will continue only if we can maintain the competitive trading conditions that have enabled the UK to become an automotive success story.§The UK car industry＊s total production was also strong, reaching a level not seen since 1999 after it climbed 9.6% in the first 11 months to more than 1.6m units.

"Knocked off the front pages by Brexit and Donald Trump, Greece is back on the agenda. The country＊s two most important creditors will meet in Berlin on Wednesday when the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, hosts the head of the International Monetary Fund, .It could be a fateful meeting. Europe and the IMF have been at loggerheads for months over whether Greece will ever be able to repay its debts 每 a disagreement that has stopped the Washington-based fund from signing up to a 86bn-bailout programme . Merkel and other European leaders, who face elections, are anxious to bring the IMF on board, to persuade sceptical voters the bailout is credible.Now signs of a compromise are emerging. This week eurozone leaders echoed the IMF in talking of the end of austerity, increasing the chances the fund will join the Greek bailout. Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic affairs, reported that 19 finance ministers of the single currency agreed that the Greek people needed to see ※light at the end of the tunnel of austerity§. But while the bailout chiefs are poised to agree on a route map, the journey for the Greek people seems no less long and arduous. The crux of the dispute between the IMF and EU is a European demand for  to maintain a budget surplus of 3.5% for a decade from 2018, a feat few governments in the world have managed, much less one in a country with a 23% unemployment rate.The IMF has been arguing for months that Greece cannot meet this target. ※Greece does not need more austerity at this time,§ two senior IMF officials , adding that the target for a primary budget surplus 每 the gap between government income and spending, excluding interest payments and national debt 每 would generate ※a degree of austerity that could prevent the nascent recovery from taking hold§.The EU maintains that the 3.5% target is achievable. But after a meeting of eurozone ministers on Monday, European creditors edged closer to the IMF view that more focus is needed on economic reforms, less on austerity. To deliver these ※deep reforms§, all sides agreed that  soon to discuss an overhaul of Greece＊s tax and pension systems, as well as labour market reforms.In Athens commentators have been desperately trying to decode the Eurogroup agreement.It was not lost on many that what was being billed as an ※agreement to agree§ 每 the key to allowing bailout auditors to finally return to Greece and resume stalled talks 每 had been struck exactly two years to the day after a similar accord by the country＊s leftist-led government. Then, the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, had signed up to a temporary deal that allowed ※fiscal breathing space§ before embarking on six months of nail-biting negotiations that eventually led to Athens accepting the harshest terms attached to a bailout since the crisis began.Despite the change in tone 每 and talk of a new policy mix 每 the consensus was that Monday＊s agreement of ※common understanding§ amounted to much of the same with reforms becoming the new byword for further cuts. After vowing not to undertake more austerity, Tsipras＊ fragile two-party coalition found itself on the back foot, accused across the board of crossing its own red lines. ※The government is trying to save its image claiming that the policy mix is supposedly changing,§ the Greek daily Ta Nea proclaimed from its front page. ※But the only thing it has achieved is the pre-legislation of harsh measures that the troika [European commission, European Central Bank and IMF] will approve when it returns.§※What we are seeing is a war of propaganda, a lot of doublespeak,§ Dimitris Tsiodras, spokesman of the centrist Potami party told the Guardian. ※The only thing that has been attained, in reality, is the return of the troika.§How Tsipras will sell the concessions to his compatriots, including increasingly disillusioned members of his own Syriza party, will play a central role in whether Greece now plunges into renewed political turmoil. Addressing reporters, the government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos ratcheted up the rhetoric, calling on Germany to see sense now that all sides had made concessions.※We expect the German finance ministry to take back its unreasonable demand for [Greece to achieve] primary surpluses of 3.5% for a decade and to adopt a more constructive stance so that a reduction of the Greek debt over the medium term can be agreed.§Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform, a thinktank, said he believed the IMF and eurozone would find a compromise, whereby the fund signed up to the 3.5% target for a limited period of time, as the price of stabilising the eurozone in an election year. ※My feeling is they will largely settle for a fig leaf. It will be made to look as if the pace of austerity has been eased, ie that the eurozone will agree that the size of the primary budget surplus will be reassessed at some specified point in the future.§※All we are going to see us another round of extend and pretend.§ He added that this would not do anything ※significant to alleviate the pressure we see on Greece§.He pointed out that even a primary budget surplus of 1.5% (favoured by the IMF) ※would still mean ongoing austerity in Greece§.The IMF＊s reforms may also prove politically difficult to sell to a population reeling from nearly eight years in the EU＊s bailout regime. One of the IMF＊s key demands is an overhaul of the Greek tax system to ensure more middle-class professionals pay their dues. More than 50% of Greek wage earners do not pay income tax, compared with 8% in the rest of the eurozone. But the low tax take partly reflects the economic collapse that has pushed down wages and squeezed people out of regular work.Reforming pensions, another IMF priority, may also run into trouble. The fund wants to rein in ※extremely generous§ Greek pensions that absorb 11% of national income. But Greek pensions have already been slashed since 2010, with 43% of pensioners living on 660 a month, compared with an average annual income of 20,000 for over-65s in other eurozone countries, according to government figures. Many Greek pensioners are also supporting unemployed children and grandchildren, as other benefits have been cut.With these politically tough reforms ahead, the light at the end of tunnel looks dim and distant. ※Greeks are facing ongoing austerity into the foreseeable future,§ Tilford says.

"he financial crisis was a great time for startups,§ says Vikas Shah, a professor of entrepreneurship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, and adviser to the UK government.The crash of 2007-08 created economic upheaval and political ramifications, but it also necessitated innovation. Shah adds: ※Many of our brightest young people, who previously would have defaulted to highly paid corporate and banking careers, were now more open to consider options outside that, simply because of a lack of jobs.§ He calls recessions a ※filtering mechanism§ for startups, weeding out the weak and ensuring only the strong survive.It would seem that post-crash more people have made the first step to starting a business. According to Companies House , the number of new businesses in the UK has risen every year since 2008 每 a  608,110 were set up in 2015. The link between fast growing startups and a tough economic climate is not limited to the last recession. Shah cites companies such as Microsoft, General Electric, FedEx, Revlon, Hyatt and IBM as high profile examples of businesses that were born in, or close to, an economic crash.Indeed a number of exciting UK startups emerged in and around the 2008 crash such as Crunch Accounting (founded in 2007, in 2016 its turnover was more than ?6.6m), Pure Gym (set up in 2008, in 2015 its sales reached nearly ?100m) and MVF (founded in 2009, its revenues were ?39m in 2016). During and after the recession,  was tight. For some, such as Luke Lang and Darren Westlake, founders of equity crowdfunding platform , which went live in 2011 (although was registered in 2009), this created an opportunity. ※We first began work on Crowdcube right in the middle of the crash. Many people were incredulous that we wanted to start a business that would help to finance high-risk business,§ says Lang. But Crowdcube survived: the platform has raised over ?211m through 481 deals and employs 70 staff. Lang say the credit crunch made it easier. ※[It] increased the challenges startups faced, making our disruptive model even more valuable, and its potential impact even greater,§ says Lang.Gideon Hyde, co-founder of , also took advantage of the climate, setting up the design consultancy business with Peter Sayburn in 2009. The company rapidly recruited, bringing in 15 staff in its first two years.※A recession is a great time for finding talent,§ says Hyde. ※We hired people at about two thirds of the market [salary] rate but we have a profit share model among the team, which appeals to people with an ambitious mindset. There were a lot of people in their mid-twenties who had worked for some good companies but, through no fault of their own, had found themselves out of work.§Market Gravity works with large companies such as Barclays and Boots, helping them to launch new, technology-focused products and services. Hyde says the financial crash provided an impetus for technology uptake among corporates 每 Market Gravity＊s first client was British Gas. There was a growing understanding [due to the recession] in big companies that they needed to innovate, says Hyde. ※There was a shift from using technology as a marketing tool to running your business with it.§ The crash coincided with a boom in smartphones and apps. Figures from  show that in 2007 the Apple Store had just 800 apps, but by 2015 there were over 1.5m with business apps the second biggest category. Many of these were created by bright young programmers at universities. Chris Haley, head of startups and new technology research at innovation foundation and charity Nesta, says there has been a substantial increase in university startups since the financial crash. Higher Education Statistics Agency research shows that new student startups increased by 132% between and .※There＊s been a big increase in student startups since the recession,§ notes Haley. ※Not all continue in the long term as entrepreneurs. But the benefit of this is that many take those skills and experiences into the workplace with them.§ Mark Hammond is the founder and CEO of , a programme that specialises in very early-stage funding and coaching science-focused entrepreneurs. Previously, he worked at Imperial College, heading up the university＊s entrepreneurship and incubator programmes. He witnessed a big rise in student entrepreneurship. He says the lack of government or corporate funding for scientific research after the financial crash meant that, for many science graduates, a startup was the only option. During his time at Imperial, Hammond worked with a range of successful startups, including clinical task management company , aimed at those working in the medical or clinical profession (later sold to Google), and VR company  (acquired by Oculus Rift). Hammond, who worked at Imperial from 2011 to 2016, says the recession coincided with a change in attitudes. ※The millennial generation wants to make a difference in the world. The economic climate meant options such as working for a bank or a corporate just weren＊t there. But also, many were asking ＆does working for a bank even matter?＊.§Talia Baccino was studying marketing at John Moores University when the financial crash occurred. After graduating in 2008, she and her sister Kayleigh expected to start careers in marketing, but the economic situation led them to start their own company. ※We both wanted to set up a business but, initially, it was our goal to get jobs and careers. But when the recession hit, that was really hard 每 there wasn＊t much available at all,§ Baccino says.Instead the sisters launched Trendy Vend, an accessories vending machine business, selling items such as lip gloss and deodorant to the nightclub crowd in women＊s toilets. The Trendy Vend machine also featured LED screens, providing a second revenue stream through the sale of advertising. Initially, the business did well, gaining angel investment to roll out the concept nationally. However, the advertising side of the business ran into trouble as public sector marketing budgets were cut and clients such as the NHS stopped spending. Eventually, the sisters quit the business in 2014 and the company ceased trading. Recessions can create great businesses, but they can also break them.However, entrepreneurs are resilient, and now the Baccinos are back in business, with Pasta Cosa, an Italian cafe in Liverpool. Talia says her experience of building a business is being brought to bear in her new company. ※It gave us some great skills and experience as well as an income for several years. Hopefully, our new business will be the one to make us millions.§ "

The New Materialism also offers solutions to key economic challenges such as the need to generate ample, good-quality jobs, rebuild hollowed-out economies and communities 每 and make everyday goods and services available in ways that escape the consumer-debt trap.Far from eschewing materialism, a deeper understanding of humankind＊s place in a living world of materials suggests the need and opportunity for a different kind of love affair with ※stuff§ 每 a long-term relationship of appreciation, slow pleasures, care and respect. Instead of abstinence and austerity, embracing the New Materialism could have profoundly positive effects. Inverting classic expectations of productivity in which fewer people produce more stuff for consumption, the New Materialism points to an economy in which, in effect, more people produce less stuff for consumption.The American sociologist Charles Wright Mills, , recognised the value of skilled work and the broader implications of losing it: ※The laborer with a sense of craft becomes engaged in the work in and for itself; the satisfactions of working are their own reward; the details of daily labor are connected in the worker＊s mind to the end product; the worker can control his or her own actions at work; skill develops within the work process; work is connected to the freedom to experiment; finally, family, community and politics are measured by the standards of inner satisfaction, coherence and experiment in craft labor.§Work with a sense of craft delivers the benefits at the heart of the false promise of consumerism. In classic economic theory, we maximise our ※utility§ through what we buy. But in reality, what we do brings the greatest satisfaction. Lifelong learning 每 a natural part of a society in which we make and repair more 每 has multiple benefits: enhancing self-esteem, encouraging real social networks and supporting a more active and engaged life.Makers are sometimes accused of retreating from the modern world 每 but the opposite is true. As the silversmith Mona Nasseri explains: ※The maker begins by connecting with the material, through engagement they enter into relationship with it experiencing a sense of flow. Beyond that, the maker remakes themselves. We come to know ourselves better through the process of collaboration with materials.§This kind of engagement better satisfies our fundamental need for novelty. Far from the passive consumer version (where we are presented with finished products we have no relationship with) the novelty provided by engaging with materials is constantly evolving and active. Making makes us more adaptable, better able to respond to changing circumstances and better at solving problems. By cultivating haptic 每 touch 每 skills, we are more resilient and more self-sufficient. and , of the University of Dundee, have found more benefits. Exploring , they found not only that teams working in three dimensions created more imaginative solutions than those working on paper or screen, but the process created stronger, healthier teams. This social connection through making is something that the French writer  understood: ※The greatness of craft consists firstly in how it brings comradeship.§ When we lose collective workspaces where objects are made, we lose the community that comes from making and the rich web of connections that make places feel like home.The good news is that this New Materialism is already emerging. Everywhere people are beginning to make, do, share and get involved. The popularity of TV programmes from The Great British Bake Off to The Great British Pottery Throw Down represents more than another successful reality TV format. This is not a case of the media leading, but of the media following a deeper shift in the zeitgeist away from passive consumer culture and towards a world in which we are much more in control of the things we have and use.Shared makerspaces such as  show the employment potential of an expansion of making.  does the same for potters. Make Works  and  allows people with ideas to connect with the makers, material suppliers and workshop facilities that can help make their ideas manifest. While politicians fumble, people are getting on and making their own futures; enlightened leaders would do much more to support them. As , explained, the biggest challenge was ※standing our ground and articulating a dynamic concept to an inflexible system§.There are other steps we can take to accelerate this healthier relationship with stuff: a minimum 10-year guarantee would help end the scourge of built-in obsolescence.  reconnects communities with the people who grow food. The same approach could be applied to more of the objects we use: Community-supported potteries could deliver tableware, gradually, by subscription. The same could apply to clothing and furniture. A culture of repair and re-imagining would create ample skilled employment; high street making and mending hubs could bring life back to the hearts of our towns and cities.This New Materialism unlocks people＊s capacity, imagination and skills: this is the real insulation from recession, and the way we can build a better future. It is a better, more direct answer to regaining control over our lives. By creating better quality jobs where people live, we can reduce inequality, and rebalance the UK economy away from finance, and away from London. More than anything, the New Materialism provides a richer and more appealing answer to the question: ※How do we want to live?§"															
"Australia＊s union movement has set itself on a collision course with the federal Labor party, calling for a rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement which Labor supports in principle.The Australian Council of Trade Unions appeared before the joint standing committee on treaties on Monday, which is reviewing the TPP.It called on the Turnbull government to reject the TPP, claiming independent economic analyses showed the trade deal could destroy 39,000 direct jobs in Australia by 2025.The TPP is the biggest global trade deal in 20 years, involving 12 countries in the Pacific region that collectively represent more than 40% of world gross domestic product.It involves Australia, the US, New Zealand and Japan, among other countries, and will ensure the US＊s influence in the region in the face of a growing  每 if ratified.Belinda Tkalcevic, the ACTU＊s director of policy, told members of the committee the World Bank had found the economic benefits of the TPP would be ※negligible§.She said recent research from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development also showed the TPP would increase economic inequality. She said the ACTU did not support the deal, just like it did not support the China-Australia free-trade deal.※The TPP puts globalisation before Australian workers, threatens the fundamentals of our democracy and drives up health costs,§ Tkalcevic said. ※By destroying thousands of Australian jobs and driving down wages we believe the TPP will lead to higher levels of inequality.※The TPP is a toxic combination of more power to multinationals ahead of democracy and globalisation ahead of Australian workers.§The ACTU is the peak body for Australian unions, made up of 46 affiliated unions and representing more than 1.6m workers.However, Labor has said it does not support the inclusion of the investor state dispute settlement provision in the TPP, marking a sticking point with the government.Jason Clare, the shadow minister for trade, made this distinction clear on Monday.※Labor recognises the potential benefits for Australia from the TPP, including increased market access for our goods and services,§ he told Guardian Australia.※The TPP could be a stepping stone to closer economic engagement across the Asia-Pacific 每 a goal Labor has pursued from establishing Apec to releasing the Australia in the Asian Century white paper.※[But] Labor has insisted that no element of the TPP should affect the cost and availability of medicines for Australians. ※Labor [also] does not support the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions in any trade agreement, including the TPP.§In June this year, Labor said if it won the election it would try to remove  clauses from every trade agreement, and every bilateral investment treaty, that Australia has signed.It meant Labor would have reviewed three major trade agreements concluded by the Abbott-Turnbull governments 每 with China, South Korea and the  每 that have ISDS provisions."															
"The UK economy is on course for a solid finish to the year after activity in the services sector picked up and consumer spending continued to rise last month. But there were fresh signs of concern about inflation as the weak pound raises the cost of fuel and other imports.A closely watched survey of firms in Britain＊s dominant services sector, which spans banking to hotels, showed they enjoyed the fastest growth since January as they continued to recover from a short, sharp downturn following the Brexit vote. The  [pdf] report chimed with other indicators suggesting businesses and consumers for now.The survey＊s compilers, Markit, said the economy was on course to grow 0.5% in the final three months of the year based on the service sector report and its polls of the smaller  and  last week. That would match  and defy economists＊ post-referendum warnings of a sharp slowdown this year.Separate figures from Barclaycard released on Tuesday showed consumer spending grew 5.1% in November, the second highest year-on-year increase since it started publishing data five years ago. That followed . The increase reflected an ongoing trend for people to spend money on meals out and cinema trips as well as the fact they had to pay more for essentials in November. Fuel prices were a big part of that, with spending on petrol up 11.7% on a year ago as a litre of unleaded petrol cost 116p, compared with 108p at this point in 2015.The figures chime with warnings from economists and the Bank of England that higher inflation and  will squeeze living standards next year and could hit an economy that has so far proved resilient to the Brexit vote.Commenting on the Barclaycard figures, its managing director, Paul Lockstone, said there had been a noticeable rise in the amount households were spending on necessities. ※Though there is little visible evidence of households yet being forced to decide between filling up the car or eating out with friends, the narrowing gap between essential and non-essential spend growth means they may need to look more carefully at how they allocate their cash once Christmas is out of the way,§ said Lockstone.The has raised the cost of imports to the UK and services companies were also feeling the pressure of higher fuel prices last month as well as more expensive food imports and pricier business travel. Markit＊s poll of services companies showed those inflationary pressures combined with political uncertainty knocked business sentiment last month. It weakened for the first time since July, with companies also citing Donald Trump＊s victory in the race for the US presidency as a fresh source of uncertainty.But for now, companies in the sector are enjoying strong growth, with the weak pound helping to boost overseas demand. The headline reading on the services survey rose to 55.2 in November from 54.5 the month before. That beat economists＊ forecasts for it to ease to 54.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. The index has now been above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for four months.Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, commented: ※The further upturn in the vast services sector shows that the pace of UK economic growth remains resiliently robust in the fourth quarter, despite ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit.§Retailers reported that the Black Friday sales event had also boosted sales for part of November. Figures from the British Retail Consortium showed non-food sales were about 40% higher in the week including Black Friday than in other weeks during the month.Overall, like-for-like retail sales were up 0.6% in November on a year ago. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson commented: ※Consumer spending remains stable, although very much value-driven with a focus towards products on promotion.§"															
" has been found guilty of negligence in approving a massive payout of taxpayers＊ money to controversial French businessman Bernard Tapie but avoided a jail sentence.A French court convicted the head of the International Monetary Fund and former government minister, who had faced a 15,000 (?12,600) fine and up to a year in prison. But it decided she should not be punished and that the conviction would not constitute a criminal record. On Monday evening the IMF gave her its full support.The verdict came as a surprise as even the  during a five-day trial last week. Jean-Claude Marin told the court Lagarde＊s actions fell into the category of politics and not criminality and called for her to be acquitted.Lagarde, who has always argued she did nothing wrong and acted ※in the public interest§, was not present for the judgment. Her lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve said she had flown back to Washington DC, where the IMF is based.Within hours of the court＊s decision, the IMF＊s 24-member board convened a meeting to discuss Lagarde＊s future. On Monday evening the IMF＊s Washington-based executive board gave Lagarde its full support.※The executive board looks forward to continuing to work with the managing director to address the difficult challenges facing the global economy,§ the board said in a statement.The IMF＊s shareholders were aware of the pending court proceedings when they appointed Lagarde to a  and were weighing up whether she 每 and the IMF 每 had suffered lasting reputational damage. The decision not to impose any penalty despite the guilty verdict was seen by some observers as enhancing the chances of the IMF＊s managing director holding on to her job.Support for Lagarde came from the former US Treasury secretary, Larry Summers, who said it was a ※sorry day for French justice§. Lagarde was the ※best thing§ to happen to the IMF in a long time, Summers added.Lagarde had appeared before theCour de Justice de la R谷publique, a special tribunal set up to judge ministers and public officials for alleged crimes committed while in office. It is made up of three professional judges and 12 politicians from the French houses of parliament.It was only the fifth time the court had sat and its judgments cannot be appealed against.Lagarde＊s lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve told journalists after the judgment: ※We would have preferred an acquittal, but it should be remembered that the court has not imposed any sentence whatsoever.§The Tapie case has rumbled on since 1993 when the businessman sold his majority share in the sportswear company Adidas to Cr谷dit Lyonnais, a bank then part-owned by the French state, to avoid a conflict of interest when he took up a government post. Tapie accused the bank, which later sold the shares at a higher price, of defrauding him by undervaluing his investment.Lagarde was the finance minister under Nicolas Sarkozy between 2007 and 2011, when she became head of the IMF 每 replacing her disgraced compatriot Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who had been put on trial for attacking a New York hotel maid. She referred the case to a private arbitration panel, which. She was accused of ※negligence with public money§ for having paid up and not contested the award, which experts had advised against.She denied any wrongdoing and claimed she had not seen all documents suggesting the payout should not be made. Six others, including her former chief of staff St谷phane Richard, now head of telecoms giant Orange, are being investigated for fraud. All have denied acting illegally.Tapie has since been ordered to pay back the 400m but is appealing against the decision.Detectives have spent years trying to establish if the award was given to Tapie under Sarkozy＊s orders in return for the businessman＊s support in his successful 2007 presidential campaign.The IMF has 24 voting board members who represent 189 countries. It recently voted to give her a second term. Lagarde won the first time despite widespread criticism that the organisation has failed to appoint a non-European leader in its 72-year history. Lagarde had the backing of then US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner whose support denied the job to Agust赤n Carstens, current governor of the Bank of Mexico, who will be a strong candidate to replace Lagarde if she is made to go. Carstens is set to become general manager at the International Bank of Settlements in Basel, Switzerland next year."															
"The UK should not be ※frightened to death§ of the trade tariffs that could be introduced after  as they may not prove to be a disaster, the head of the Scottish fishing industry has said.Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fisherman＊s Federation, told the Commons Brexit select committee that the fishing sector stood to see a doubling or more of its catch when Britain took back control of its waters.He said the World Trade Organisation tariff on fish was between 5% and 10%, while the pound had dropped by almost 20% against the euro after the EU referendum. ※Let us not be frightened to death of tariffs at all: they may be consumed in the noise of currency fluctuation and some small tariff may not be disaster,§ he said. ※We must very much change the rhetoric of ＆we must be in the single market, we must be in the single market.＊ We don＊t need a single market, we need an adequate market.§Last week a House of Lords EU committee said fishing communities, who campaigned vigorously for a leave vote,  of reducing foreign fleets operating in British waters. In Aberdeen on Monday, the Commons committee heard that almost 60% of all fish removed from British waters was removed by other EU countries. ※More than half of our natural resource goes elsewhere 每 that is unthinkable for another coastal state. Taking that back is not an act of regression, it＊s an act of normality,§ Armstrong told the committee. He said the EU common fisheries policy was an act of tremendous generosity by the UK to other countries, and the ※monstrous§ imbalance had to be redressed. The Tory MP Michael Gove put it to him that if it was correct that Norway landed three times as much fish as Britain, there was potential for Britain＊s catch to ※at least double§ post Brexit. ※That＊s entirely possible,§ replied Armstrong. In an earlier evidence, Prof Michael Keating, a constitutional expert and chair in  at the University of Aberdeen, said he found the notion that Scotland could stay in the single market while the rest of the UK exited ※extremely difficult§.Nicola Sturgeon is due to publish detailed proposals on the matter on Tuesday.※We＊ll know tomorrow but the suggestion is that Scotland could stay in the single market if the rest of the UK came out, and I find that extremely difficult to imagine because if you＊ve got the rest of the UK out of the single market and Scotland in along Norwegian lines, you would have a single market border between England and  and that would cause problems for trade within the UK,§ Keating said.※It would not only require barriers between Scotland and the rest of the UK but also require the evolution of all single market powers to the Scottish parliament, so we could transpose the European directives.§He said ※technically that could be done§ but it was the most complicated of all potential settlements, and one neither the UK or the EU were likely to support. Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of Oil and Gas UK, told the committee that the key challenge facing her industry was lack of investment, which pre-dated the Brexit vote. However, she said the uncertainty and unpredictability created by the decision to leave the EU created an additional risk for the industry, and called for the government to offer clarity on a number of issues, including the internal energy market.※We need to ensure that the government doesn＊t get distracted by Brexit,§ she said. ※We want to stay part of the internal energy market, and it＊s very important that we are clear how we are going to manage that, as well as what kind of tariff barriers are imposed.§Both Michie and the fishing sector witnesses said one of the biggest challenges was the future of migrant workers, who made up significant parts of the workforces in the lower end of the skills ladder in fishing and the higher end in exploration. ※We are a global industry and thrive on the diversity of people and skills. In terms of some specialised skills, sourcing from  has been very important, for example sub-sea engineering expertise,§ said Michie.Michael Bates, development officer for the Scottish Seafood Association, said the fishing industry would have to make itself more attractive to local workers if it suddenly found itself without an EU workforce.

"very month there are new headlines about the ＊s wrongdoing. The chief executive, Ross McEwan, , but his bank is still failing; most recently it failed the . Trying to privatise the bank hasn＊t worked and state ownership hasn＊t been a rip-roaring success either; but worse, its very size and dominance means together with the other big banks it is stifling competition. Now is the right moment for a different approach.Together as taxpayers we saved the  每 now we should each be allowed to own it. It should become a people＊s bank, which every tax-paying British citizen would have the right to become a part-owner of.The Royal Building Society of Scotland, with an iron lock on its assets, would be a final, decisive break with the . It would conserve the strength and credibility of one of our major financial global players while injecting a much needed dose of competition and diversity into British banking.More than  have been injected into the Royal Bank of Scotland. This was the right thing to do, but neither keeping it as a state bank nor a fully privatised bank offer the same advantages as turning it into a mutual. Its sheer size means it risks being captured again by narrow shareholder interests or those of its senior executives, or both.Turning it into a mutual with its assets protected from the  who championed  would substantively change the culture at RBS and, crucially, make banking more competitive. In strong mutuals it is member expectations rather than shareholder interests that help to ensure more competitive products and services are prioritised by managers.Despite new entrants to the banking market and the many reforms to regulation, the structural problem in Britain＊s banking market 每 a lack of competition 每 is as bad now as it was at the time of the , and is arguably worse following the banking mergers that the crash precipitated.Anyone tempted to think that banking is now a wholly reformed and properly functioning market would find the Competition and Markets Authority , published in August, disturbing reading.The CMA described the personal banking market as being concentrated, that concentration levels have increased since the crisis, and that competition is not working well.It went on to note that for lending to small and medium-sized businesses, the four largest providers, RBS, Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC, together had a combined market share of over 80%. They underlined the adverse effects on competition in personal banking, basic current accounts and  caused by the combination of persistent concentration in the market and barriers to entry and expansion.Full private ownership of all the big banks, the stated aim of both the last two governments, is only likely to exacerbate the lack of competition.In 2014, of the top 10 banking groups by market share for personal current accounts, only two could reasonably be described as mutual, and only one had a market share of 5% or higher.State ownership of RBS has steadied a sinking ship, but it has not changed the critical weakness in British banking: the lack of competition between different types of banks or building societies.Across Europe, the United States and Australia, mutual banks play a critical role in challenging traditional shareholder-owned banks in financial services markets. Rabobank is a Dutch co-op bank 每 one of the world＊s top 30 banks. Navy Federal is a $50bn mutual bank serving the American military and Cr谷dit Mutuel is one of the biggest French banks.Indeed, part of the reason for the lack of competition in British banking is that many of the biggest building societies in the 1990s demutualised and were gradually bought up by the big banking groups.The suspension of the sale and reprivatisation of shares in RBS offers a new opportunity to put in place an alternative to either state or private ownership. No one thinks the government will get its money back from the sale of RBS shares in full for the foreseeable future. Indeed, the small number of RBS shares that were sold resulted in a .It＊s time to return RBS to the people who saved it, and create a competitor to the traditional shareholder-led bank. Indeed, it is the only sustainable way to inject a serious dose of competition into arguably Britain＊s most important industry."															
"It＊s 11 o＊clock, and Laxman Chauhan still hasn＊t sold any fish. His stall in the central market in the west Indian city of Panjim has been open for three hours, but none of his usual clients have come today. He checks his watch, and then takes a walk to see if other vendors have had any customers. ※Sold anything yet?§ he asks Ramila Pujjar, who has set her stall up with a glistening display of the morning＊s catch. She hasn＊t either.※I＊m losing 2,000-3,000 rupees (?23-?35) a day,§ says Chauhan. ※I＊m throwing fish away every day.§The low footfall at Panjim＊s fish market is unusual; fish is a staple in Goan cuisine but, for the past month, since the prime minister, , business has suffered. ※I＊m losing money because of the government,§ says Pujjar. ※The government only takes care of the rich, the poor will always be poor.§Modi＊s surprise announcement wiped out 86% of the nation＊s currency overnight, leaving the vendors at Panjim＊s fish market to suffer heavy losses. ※Nobody has cash, so they＊re not buying fish.§Panjim is no different to the rest of . Long queues wind around banks and ATMs in every city as people scramble to exchange their high-value banknotes. The cash crisis has hit millions of traders, as people tighten purse strings and save up precious banknotes.But now, this sleepy tourist town is going to become the laboratory for a radical new experiment. From January, Goa＊s government has announced that the city will go ※cashless§, meaning every street vendor, rickshaw driver and shopkeeper must offer their customers the option to pay using a debit card or mobile phone. The cash-free drive will attempt to close down India＊s thriving parallel economy of untaxed cash transactions.A government circular at the beginning of the month instructed traders: ※Goa is likely to become the state in India to go for cashless transactions from 31?December. Even though cash transactions are not being banned, it is in the interest of the government to encourage cashless transactions.§The policy, announced by India＊s defence minister, Manohar Parrikar, is in line with Modi＊s vision for a cash-free India. Last week, the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, announced a series of discounts on digital transactions for petrol, railway tickets and insurance policies. Modi has urged young people to support his ※less cash§ economy in a radio broadcast: ※I need the help of young people in India ＃ There are many people in your families or neighbourhoods who may not know how to use technologies such as e-wallets and payments through mobiles. I urge you to spend some time ＃ to teach this technology to at least 10 families who may not know it,§ he said.For the last two years, Modi has been encouraging digital transactions through his flagship digital India and smart cities schemes, but the de-monetisation fumble has resulted in a new emphasis on card and mobile payments, as government mints fail to keep pace with demand for new currency. Digital payments, he says, will prevent the use of illegal, untaxed ※black money§, which fuels crime, corruption and terror.In the last 50 years, since debit-card transactions were first introduced by banks, they have overtaken cash in much of the western world. But digital payments are also spreading in unexpected places, such as in Kenya, where 25% of its gross national product flows through a mobile payment service called , and Zimbabwe, where debit-card machines are increasingly ubiquitous after devastating hyperinflation made banknotes worthless.Speaking to the , Siddharth Kuncolienkar, a member of Goa＊s legislative assembly and the incumbent Bhartiya Janata party, said the move towards a cash-free Goa would have long-term benefits for its citizens: ※This is bold move by the government. Goa will be a model state and now we are all working in the direction to make that happen. No society can be 100% cashless, but what we want is that the facility to make cashless payments should be provided by every single vendor.§The push to make Goa go digital comes before state elections, which will be held early next year. Government officials said last week that Goa was well equipped to be India＊s first cashless state because the majority of Goans had bank accounts. But in the city＊s central market, where most traders only accept cash, this seems a faraway dream. ※I don＊t have a mobile phone,§ says Pujjar. ※There are eight people in my family, and we have one phone between us. It is not a smartphone. How am I going to take payments? They want me to use a card machine?§ she says, making a swiping gesture with her hands, signalling the absurdity of the idea. ※I don＊t know how to do all that. Who buys fish with a credit card?§Chauhan says: ※We are poor people. I am not educated, I don＊t know how to use all these machines. Tomorrow, if the government says you have to use this card reader, I＊m going to be fooled. Someone else who knows how to use the machine will punch in the wrong amount for the transaction. How will I know whether they＊ve paid me the right amount?§To help Goa go cashless, state-wide programmes are being rolled out to help people learn to use digital systems. ※Groups of people are learning how to use card readers and mobile payments in classrooms,§ said Revati Mazumdar, chief executive of Goa Electronics, who is overseeing the drive. ※Government officials are going with bank employees to all the main places in the city to teach people how to make digital payments. Already we have set up 40 kiosks,§ she said.Last week, the government＊s plan to go cash free hit a roadblock, after Aires Rodrigues, an anti-corruption activist and lawyer, filed a petition with the state＊s human rights commission saying the move was unconstitutional. ※The state government does not have the jurisdiction to do this. They cannot tell vendors they have to accept digital payments. And Goa does not have the infrastructure to make digital transactions work. Power failures are routine, and phone signal is very weak in many places. You can＊t make debit card payments without signal.§Rodrigues argues the vague wording on the government＊s circular indicates that officials will be able to penalise vendors who do not offer digital payments. ※Our defence minister has crazy ideas and this is one of his crazy ideas. Cashless is impossible in India. It can never happen,§ he said.Goa＊s chief minister, Laxmikant Parsekar, said that vendors would not face penalties if they failed to offer digital payments, and that the 31 December deadline might be extended. But Kuncolienkar said that the government was still pressing on with its cash-free policy by the new year deadline, and that officials would make spot checks in markets to ensure vendors were offering cashless payments to their clients.※Why not?§ he said. ※Cashless is better for everyone. We have already done training with the auto-rickshaw union and the motor pilot association.§But Faiz Ahmed, the head of Panjim＊s motor pilot association, said no training had been given to his union members yet. Kuncolienkar has promised that by January people will be able to buy fish with a debit card. The vendors at Panjim market are less certain. ※It＊s impossible,§ says Chauhan. ※Look, I＊m with the government. I support Modi. I want what＊s best for our country. But I can＊t use those machines. I just can＊t.§"															
"After a week of intense scrutiny of  arrangements, this Saturday＊s observance of Human Rights Day provides a welcome pause to reflect on the role the UK should play on the international stage. This is especially important when we consider how global businesses based in the UK or listed on the London Stock Exchange impact on the world＊s poorest people. There are real examples of UK leadership on human rights, from support for the UN＊s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to the Modern Slavery Act 2015. However, the government must follow through on its commitments and ensure that its leadership in these areas is not jeopardised by falling short elsewhere.Legal changes have made it harder for communities affected by British companies＊ actions overseas to seek justice in the UK. It is also concerning that some government departments have regarded international standards as optional, rather than essential protections to ensure that business operations do not harm society＊s most vulnerable.We must ensure post-Brexit trade deals benefit both businesses and the communities in which they operate.

"he truth is stranger than fiction. Rising out of the chaos of stand two opposing visions of Britain＊s future. There is Britain as the 19th-century free-trade, low-tax warrior, the world＊s banker, insurer, and lawyer.Facts get in the way of visions. In the 19th-century free trade was about strong countries undermining the sovereignty of others. Not the best model for Britain today. Britannia no longer has the world＊s most powerful navy to blockade Latin American ports until the locals pay City of London bondholders or push opium onto the Chinese.Opposite this free trade myth is ... nothing. ※Remainers§ are so pinning their hopes on the cavalry arriving at the last minute to rescue them that they have invested little thought on a post-Brexit future. There is a progressive alternative that is not all aspiration. There are practical policy measures, for instance, that would help to transform our financial sector into one focused on financing the long-term investments necessary to build an economically efficient and socially just alternative to Victoriana. One of these is a regulatory change made possible by Brexit. Another is the modernisation of an old English tax on the churning of assets. When our entrepreneurs look at a car manufacturer or clothes chain, they see a real estate or pension play. Our business elites live for the clever flip that allows them to buy the superyacht. A certain amount of trading and speculation in the background is useful. It helps us to value things. But when the background becomes the foreground we end up with illusions of value. Our financial markets are bigger in turnover than before, but under stress, they are proving thinner and more vulnerable to flash crashes. Today＊s economic model mirrors the banking model. Bankers view loans as opportunities to earn fees for originating, securitising, trading, settling and clearing. They have shifted the risk of holding the loan to others. They boast that accelerating the speed through which securities circulate reduces costs to consumers and is a measure of their immense contribution to the economy which, they argue, must be preserved post-Brexit, at all costs. But when Thomas Philippon added up the fees paid by the non-financial sector to the financial sector, he found that at 2.0% of finance raised, costs had in recent decades returned to where they were in 1880. All of the efficiency gains since the steam age, as a result of new technologies, innovation and globalisation have recently been captured by those who run the industry and not shared with consumers. It is one of the largest contributors to worsening income inequality over the past 30 years. Equally important, when the financial sector makes more money from churning than investing, they will do less investing, contributing to a secular stagnation. The current economic and banking model is vulnerable to two policy changes. We can amend European regulation (Solvency II) that through capital adequacy requirements not commensurate with the risks faced by long-term savers, incentivises them to invest in short-term government bonds and not make long-term investments. We can modernise and extend the UK＊s existing tax on churning 每 the stamp tax on share transactions. This tax currently raises ?3bn a year primarily from foreign owners of UK shares who have not found a way of avoiding it after 322 years of its existence. According to an IMF report, similar taxes collect billions or more from 30 countries.  This is not a tax on where a trade takes place, as an unsuccessful Swedish tax in the 1980s, but on the transfer of the ownership of the security. New tax information agreements and disclosure requirements on beneficial ownership following the global financial crisis make it possible to extend this tax for the first time to derivatives and other securities without fear of relocation of trades. Instead, the UK finance industry has chipped away at this tax over the years to the point where the government loses ?1bn a year of potential revenues through exemptions that cover high-frequency traders and hedge funds. In , I set out the case for extensions and the closing of loopholes that would raise ?25bn over the life of a parliament. The money will come in handy. The big prize is the transformation of the economy to where investing trumps trading and finance is the servant of industry, not its master. "															
"Official figures this week are expected to provide fresh evidence that the UK economy remained resilient in the face of Brexit uncertainty at the close of 2016 but economists warn Britain is headed for a sharp slowdown this year.After confounding most economic forecasters with , the economy is expected to have grown 0.5% in the final quarter of last year, according to a Reuters poll of economists.Chris Hare, economist at the bank Investec was among those predicting the GDP figures on Thursday would show a strong finish to the year.※The UK economy has held up remarkably well after last June＊s vote to leave the EU. Businesses and households have largely shrugged off the political and economic uncertainties relating to Brexit, keeping the economy running at a decent pace,§ he said. Hopes of solid growth have been buoyed by largely upbeat surveys of businesses and consumers. In particular, the Markit/CIPS purchasing managers＊ indices (PMIs) showed  and pointed to 0.5% GDP growth in the final quarter. is expected to have provided the main momentum behind the UK＊s continued growth, helping to make it the top performer among the G7 group of advanced economies last year. With  and expected to rise further, that support from spending will be harder to maintain, experts warn. The Bank of England , squeezing their spending power. The latest retail sales figures suggested price rises were already affecting shoppers in December as .Hare continued: ※Looking forward, we do anticipate a slowdown in economic growth, principally because we see the post-referendum fall in the pound pushing up on import prices, in turn raising the CPI inflation rate to more than 3% later this year. That will squeeze household spending power.§Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy, Pantheon Macroeconomics echoed that.※The Brexit vote has done little to dampen GDP growth, so far. Output likely increased by about 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter, only slightly less than in the third quarter. But labour market and tax receipt data show the economy is starting to struggle,§ he said.※Growth in household spending will slow decisively in 2017 ... surveys continue to point to only slight increases in employment and sluggish wage gains. As such, real disposable income looks set to stagnate for two years.§If fourth-quarter GDP growth is confirmed at 0.5% in Thursday＊s figures, it will be a markedly better outcome than economists had pencilled in at the time of the referendum. Both before and after the June vote, forecasters at the Bank and elsewhere said the decision to leave the EU would bring growth to a near-standstill by the end of the year.But as , the  amid criticism that the Bank and others had overdone their pessimism. Responding to such attacks this month, the Bank＊s chief economist, Andy Haldane, said it was , having failed to foresee the 2008 financial crash and misjudged the impact of the Brexit vote.The  as the impact of the weak pound and shaken business confidence begin to bite. In its November forecasts the Bank said GDP growth would slow to 1.4% this year from 2.2% in 2016. The International Monetary Fund is , with growth at 1.5% this year. The fund had previously predicted an even sharper slowdown but was forced to concede the British economy had so far beaten its expectations since the June referendum.Against the backdrop of slower growth and as Brexit negotiations kick off in earnest, interest rates are widely expected to remain on hold at their record low of 0.25% for some time.In a new economic outlook published on Monday, the forecasting group EY ITEM Club predicts GDP will grow 1.3% this year, marking an upgrade from its October forecast for 0.8% growth. It expects growth to slow further in 2018, to just 1%.The group warns that with household incomes under pressure, the UK economy will be forced to become less reliant on consumer spending. It notes a silver lining in the weaker pound for exporters, because the currency＊s fall makes their goods more competitive overseas. The group forecasts exports will rise 3.3% this year and 5.2% in 2018.※We now expect the impact of Brexit on the UK economy to be shallower, but more prolonged than we did in October,§ said Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club.※However, there is a sea change coming over the next three years. The fall in the pound will force the economy to be less reliant on consumer spending, leaving growth heavily dependent upon trade performance.§"															
															
"Banking leaders from Goldman Sachs and HSBC were among those who met the chancellor and the Brexit secretary to discuss how to keep financial services in the UK after leaving the .Philip Hammond and David Davis hosted a gathering at the Shard tower in central London on Monday, amid concern among many banks about  and the potential shock of Brexit if there is no transitional deal to cushion the impact of leaving the EU.Almost 5,500 UK financial firms rely on corporate ※passports§ to conduct business across the EU, with banks warning that loss of the rights could mean companies and jobs move to other European countries. The government said the meeting was about the ※opportunities offered by the UK＊s decision to leave the EU§, with ministers saying they would feed back the insights given by City chiefs into their analysis of options for .Attendees included Barclays and Santander banks as well as insurers such as Lloyd＊s of London and .A source close to the meeting said the government appeared to be in ※listening mode§ without revealing any detail about how Brexit would be carried out. A number of company representatives expressed concerns about keeping financial services and insurance in London competitive while the UK goes through the process of leaving the EU.Ministers have previously given , the carmaker, that the whole automobile sector in the UK would be competitive following Brexit, enabling it to pledge a major investment in Sunderland. But the announcement  for similar pledges that the government would ensure they remain competitive.

"n New Year＊s Day in 2002, Italians gathered in Rome to throw their lire into the Trevi fountain. There were celebrations as Italians took possession of the new euro notes and coins that became legal tender as the clocks struck midnight.But hopes that the advent of the single currency would provide a fresh start for Italy＊s economy were misplaced. The growth performance of the eurozone as a whole has been poor, but Italy＊s has been dismal. Greece and Spain at least had booms before their painful busts; Germany and France have managed to claw back the ground lost in the deep recession of 2008-09.But national output per head in Italy is only 4% higher than it was 15 years ago. The economy is still smaller than it was in 2008. , labour market participation is low, and in 2014 was the lowest since the modern Italian state was founded in 1861. If there was a contest for the unwanted title of the sick man of Europe in the 21st century, Italy would walk it.The eurozone＊s third biggest economy has one central problem: the goods and services it produces are more expensive than those of its rivals. This lack of competitiveness means that it has suffered the biggest drop in export market share of any developed country.There are three reasons for this. Firstly, Italy＊s manufacturing sector has traditionally been dominated by small companies, many of them family-owned. These businesses have been reluctant to invest, poor at innovation, and were slow to take advantage of the the new information technology when it came on stream in the 1990s. Productivity has increased less rapidly than in Germany or France.Secondly,  has tended to specialise in low-cost manufactured goods, a segment of the global economy that has been dominated by China since it gained membership of the World Trade Organisation in 2001.Italy＊s competitiveness problem is not new. Since the second world war, it has tended to have higher costs and higher inflation than rival countries. But up until it joined the euro, Italy was able to restore competitiveness by devaluing the lire, which made exports cheaper. With that option no longer available, Matteo Renzi has been trying a different approach: structural reforms of Italy＊s labour market.These, though, have proved unpopular, and explain why Renzi＊s constitutional changes were heavily defeated in the referendum."															
"A rescue deal for the world＊s oldest bank 每  每 hung in the balance on Monday after Italian voters rejected constitutional changes and plunged the government into crisis.Shares in MPS, which was founded in 1472 , fell amid fears  will affect its attempts to clinch a 5bn (?4.2bn) lifeline from investors. The shares plunged 10% initially before ending the day 4% lower while shares in other major Italian lenders were also lower amid speculation that the Italian government might have to prop up MPS.As the news emerged of Renzi＊s defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform, there was a sharp drop in the euro and a rise in the cost of borrowing for Italian government. But after the initial reaction the euro recovered to touch its highest level against the dollar since November and Italian bond yields were also little changed.The Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, arriving in Brussels for a meeting of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, called for calm.※Italy is a large economy, one of the largest in , it has strong institutions. You can see that market reaction so far has been moderate,§ said Dijsselbloem.The market＊s focus was largely on MPS, which is also Italy＊s third largest bank, where concerns were raised . The bank was ranked as the weakest of the 51 European institutions subjected to the annual assessment.A consortium led by the Wall Street bank JP Morgan was meeting to discuss the fundraising but unlikely to make any formal decision for a few days to test the political backdrop after Renzi＊s resignation. There were also reports that MSP bank officials are meeting representatives from the Qatar Investment Authority 每 the gulf state＊s sovereign wealth fund 每 to try to secure backing.Even so, there are expectations that the Italian government will need to step in, despite new EU rules which prevent state aid unless bondholders have been forced to take losses.Alberto Chiandetti, a manager at the Fidelity European Opportunities and Fidelity Funds  investment funds, said: ※The focus is on whether an anchor investor will materialise or not. If not, Monte Paschi needs a plan B and in that scenario, bank shares are likely to suffer most. We should know [on Monday] whether such an anchor investor exists for Monte Paschi.§The prospects of a capital injection for MPS being found entirely from private investors appeared to be receding, analysts said. ※I think a precautionary recapitalisation is ultimately still probable as a private sector-only solution is now highly unlikely to work,§ said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of consultancy Eurasia Group.Renzi has been credited with helping to create a  每 for a banking industry that has 360bn of bad debts and is highly fragmented with more than 500 lenders.Technically, the state can intervene only once bondholders 每 which in the case of Italy would include savers - have taken losses. However, in uncertain circumstances the government can step in. There are also suggestions that a compensation scheme could be set up for retail bondholders forced to take losses.Markets are also looking to next week when Italy＊s largest bank, UniCredit, is scheduled to meet investors in London to discuss its strategy. The meeting on 13 December has prompted speculation it is readying a multibillion-euro cash call. Chiandetti said: ※Currently rumoured to be around 10bn to 13bn, the amount should be disclosed at the UniCredit capital market day. A difficult environment for Italian banks will no doubt weigh on this upcoming deal and put pressure on UniCredit shares.§"															
"ill Donald Trump as president be good or bad for stock markets? Should investors run for the hills in fear of 1930s-style protectionist policies that may damage global trade? Or should they hang around to enjoy the possible fruits of promised tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending in the US?The debate rages fiercely and daily. Each twitch in the stock market is taken as support for one side of the argument or the other. The Dow Jones industrial average in the US has  because it is anticipating goodies in store; alternatively, it hasn＊t moved terribly far since mid December. Both statements are accurate. Meanwhile, it is almost obligatory for economists and pundits to be confident about what lies ahead for investors. If there is a rough consensus, it＊s that a big fiscal stimulus in the US would eventually encounter the stiff breezes of a strong dollar and higher interest rates, and there is a risk of a bust one day if Trumpist protectionism becomes truly heavy. That extremely loose working theory seems as good as any.But here＊s a sharper take on the great guessing game from Terry Smith, whose ?9bn Fundsmith equity fund has performed strongly since its launch in 2010 (disclosure: I am an investor). This is Smith＊s shortlist of macro factors that could affect companies and markets in the near future: Brexit, China, ※demonetisation§ in India, the French presidential election, the German election, interest rates, Korea, Trump, quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, Syria and the oil price.Smith＊s point is that even if you could read developments vaguely well and get your timing right, there is a second-order problem. ※To usefully employ your predictions, you would not only have to make mostly correct predictions, but you would also need to gauge what the markets expected to occur in order to predict how they would react. Good luck with that,§ he says.Well, quite. One way or another, Trump＊s policies 每 not just the economic ones 每 will have a profound effect on financial markets. So will some or all of Smith＊s other factors. It could hardly be otherwise. But there should be no shame in saying the investment implications are currently as clear as mud.Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman of GlaxoSmithKline and former chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, offered an excellent argument the other day for why .Senior businessmen and women tend to be showered with so much money that it would be better to reserve the honours system for those who don＊t get to collect big bucks. ※I think to get both financial rewards and other recognition is just a bit too easy,§ said Hampton (who, it should be pointed out, got his gong for public service).Well said. Hampton could have added a second argument. Business careers can only be judged properly when they are over, and often some time after that. This is the Fred Goodwin problem. The former chief executive of RBS (before Hampton＊s time) was a hero until the bank sank. . James Crosby, former chief executive of HBOS, the other great British banking disaster,  before he could suffer a similar fate.Sir Philip Green still has a gong (for now), but even if the Topshop owner eventually coughs up a few hundred million quid , it＊s hard to imagine it would be awarded today. Labour is also calling for Sir John Rose, the former chief executive of Rolls-Royce,  after the engine manufacturing company admitted to bribery and corruption during his period at the top.Handing out mid-career gongs is like awarding medals for a marathon while the race is still in progress. Most directors＊ contracts at FTSE 100 companies these days acknowledge the point as it applies to bonuses, by including clawback clauses. A knighthood that could be routinely clawed back would be a nonsense 每 the Goodwin case caused a huge kerfuffle, remember. Better just to drop the gongs for corporate business leaders.Shares in  were overcooked at 700p a year ago. Now they＊re 300p, and the 13% decline on Wednesday indicates investors＊ loss of appetite. You can＊t blame them. The chief executive, Andy McCue, recruited to revitalise a group that includes Garfunkel＊s and Frankie & Benny＊s, is impressed by ※my colleagues＊ passion§, but little else, it seems. The only things wrong are the prices, the menus and the service. In the restaurant game, that＊s all you＊re offering. ※Significant change§ is required. You bet."															
"The  industrial average finally broke through the 20,000 barrier on Wednesday morning 每 a historic high for the leading stock market index and one it has been close to breaching since Christmas.The Dow, which first nearly topped 20,000 on 13 December and again on 6 January, when it came within 0.37 points of the landmark, finally broke through after the opening bell was rung on Wall Street by Ashton Poole, CEO of lender Triangle Capital. When the closing bell was rung by executives from InBev, brewers of Stella Artois, traders whooped and cheered a new milestone in the index, which closed at a record high of 20,068.The market had rallied sharply in the wake of Donald Trump＊s presidential victory but seemed to lose steam ahead of his first day in office. It broke the barrier on Wednesday morning after infrastructure stocks rose sharply ahead of the market＊s opening, boosted by Trump＊s renewed pledge to along the Mexican border and talks of massive infrastructure investment. A rise in Boeing＊s shares, which reported better than expected results on Wednesday, and the continued rally in the financial sector that has accompanied Trump＊s win also helped push the Dow over the line.The Dow record comes as the S&P 500 index, tech-heavy Nasdaq and London＊s FTSE 100 stock market index have all hit record highs in recent weeks.The Dow, which has risen about 9% since Trump＊s victory, is probably the best-known US stock indicator although its limited measure is not the one favoured by most market professionals. It measures the performance of 30 of the largest publicly owned companies based in the United States, including Apple, ExxonMobil and Goldman Sachs. While it has inched over the 20,000 mark, overall its latest rise has been sudden.  for the first time just 42 days ago 每 two days before the Thanksgiving holiday and has risen 5.6% since then. Similar sharp rises in the index have been followed by sharp falls.The last time the Dow added 1,000 points so quickly was in May 1999. The index passed 10,000 in that same year, the height of the dotcom bubble, only to lose much of those gains in the coming crash. But market watchers said they believed this rally was on a more solid footing.The recent rapid rise has been driven in part by expectations that Trump will introduce policies that will boost growth and cut regulatory pressures on US companies. Trump has pledged to roll back the Dodd-Frank regulations brought in to more tightly control financial institutions in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown. Banks and other financial companies have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the recent share-price rise.But the rise comes against a strong upward trend in the Dow that stretches back to the end of the recession in 2009 and the decision of the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates, making shares a more attractive investment. Few on Wall Street seemed overexcited by the news. When the Dow hit 10,000, Richard Grasso, then chairman of the New York stock exchange, closed the day＊s trading with Rudy Giuliani, New York＊s mayor. They threw ※Dow 10,000§ caps to a cheering crowd of traders.The reaction was more muted this time, in part because so much trading has moved online since 1999 and also because the new level comes after an eight-year run of rises.Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said given the overall health of the  he would have expected a broadly similar rise had Hillary Clinton won the election. Any changes to regulation Trump has planned could take years to pass and implement, he said, and investors were more interested in shorter-term trends. ※I would hesitate to call it a Trump rally,§ he said. ※I＊d say 80% of where we are now is down to fundamentals and probably another 20% is post-election enthusiasm.§Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Financial Group, called the news ※psychologically important§ but said it was unlikely to set a new benchmark for the index, and that the Dow would probably dip above and below the 20,000 level for some time.※The surge in financials is probably one of the biggest fuel sources for this rise,§ said Ablin. ※It＊s hard to know if it＊s sustainable; there is a lot of expectation not only that these new policies will be passed but also that they will work.§Rapid rises in the Dow have been followed by equally rapid falls. The Dow peaked at 11,722.98 in January 2000. After the dotcom bubble burst it took more than seven years for the Dow to hit its next milestone of 12,000, in October 2006.The Dow topped 14,000 in July 2007 每 the height of the housing bubble and less than three months after passing 13,000. After the crash it took the Dow six years to return to that level.But Wren predicted 2017 would be a relatively stable year for US stock markets. ※I don＊t think 20,000 is a sign of overenthusiasm or froth,§ said Wren. The Dow hit its record high after a new poll showed consumer confidence surged in December. The Conference Board＊s consumer confidence index rose to 113.7, up from 109.4 in November. Its ※expectations index§, which measures consumers＊ confidence about the future, increased sharply from 94.4 to 105.5, a 13-year high. Older consumers, however, were markedly more optimistic than younger ones.※The post-election surge in optimism for the economy, jobs and income prospects, as well as for stock prices, which reached a 13-year high, was most pronounced among older consumers,§ said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. ※Looking ahead to 2017, consumers＊ continued optimism will depend on whether or not their expectations are realized.§"															
"Markets don＊t like surprises. The pound has been responsive to the May government＊s many self-inflicted wounds. The  was widely anticipated so was not much of a surprise and so the pound didn＊t move much. The pound moves down . It strengthens on the possibility that the economic Neanderthals are not going to have their way. As I have said frequently, the markets prevent Theresa May and her government from saying and doing stupid stuff. The courts now seem to be doing the same.The weakening of the pound has already had a big impact on prices in the shops. , pushed up by airfares, food prices and fuel, it was the fastest pace of price rises for two-and-a-half years. Prices paid by factories for materials and energy rose by 15.8% in December on a year ago, the biggest jump since September 2011. The rise in prices, which is going to continue, will begin to catch up with the growth rate of wages and overtake it, which means workers＊ real spending power will start falling again. Real wages are still 3.5% below their levels in 2008. So living standards are set to fall again. It also looks like the UK＊s much-vaunted job-generating machine is slowing to a halt.Economists expect higher costs for firms to continue filtering through to shop prices. The really bad news in December was that , the sharpest fall for more than four years and far worse than economists＊ forecasts for a 0.1% dip. Spending is expected to slow further as rising inflation eats into pay packets.There were  in the latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. A net balance of 24% of surveyors saw house prices increase rather than decrease in December, a slowdown from 29% in November. That was the first drop in the main measure since the aftermath of the referendum.For economists this has been the crisis that keeps on giving. For ordinary people it has been a crisis that keeps on hurting. That is why there were votes for Trump and .The basic picture of the UK economy has not changed over the past month. Even though , taking the last three months of 2016 together, the volume of high street and internet sales was still 5.6% up on a year ago. Taking 2016 as a whole, retail sales volumes grew by nearly 5%, the strongest year for over a decade. The consumer was therefore supporting growth quite strongly in the final quarter of last year.At the same time, the world economy appears to be picking up. One indicator I watch closely is the growth of global air traffic, which is very well correlated with growth across the world economy. When people are flying more for business and leisure, it is a good indicator of higher confidence and economic growth. The International Air Transport Association reports that , with healthy growth in all the three main regions of the world economy 每 North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. This is in tune with other positive global growth indicators such as the purchasing managers＊ surveys, and positive employment indicators from the US and Europe.So for now, consumer spending and strong global growth are supporting the UK economy 每 and we have yet to see the negative impact on investment which many forecasters are expecting in 2017. However, there are two important straws in the wind that do point to slower growth. First, , narrowing the gap between wage increases and consumer price inflation and squeezing the increase in disposable income, despite a slight pick-up in average earnings. A further rise in inflation to about 3% should be expected this year as import price increases come through the pipeline 每 adding to the squeeze on the real spending power of consumers.The second straw in the wind is a slowdown in jobs growth. The employment growth trend 每 which has been in place for four to five years now 每 , according to the latest labour market figures. Unemployment has not increased because the number of people available for work has also levelled out. But the signals from the labour market are consistent with slower economic growth this year driven by heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote. In 2017 and 2018, we should expect to see economic growth of close to 1.5%, below the 2% which the UK has achieved over the seven years of recovery so far."															
"The Federal Reserve could wait until at least next summer before raising interest rates again, according to Wall Street economists . Expectations that  would be followed by three more next year were played down by the 31 economists surveyed, who predicted only two rises were likely.The New York Dow Jones index soared last week to within 160 points of a record 20,000 amid forecasts that a huge stimulus package in the first year of Donald Trump＊s presidency would trigger an economic boom.While Trump has promised to cut taxes affecting middle-income earners and pump funds into major infrastructure projects, many economists are wary that Congress could delay or block the moves, fearing a steep rise in the government＊s budget deficit.※Global growth will improve next year but remain under its long-term trend,§ Gregory Daco, an economist with Oxford , told the newspaper. ※Trump＊s policies, and the expectation of them, will be pivotal to global developments.§The strengthening of the dollar is also likely to hit exports and increase the price of imports, increasing the US balance of payments deficit.The value of companies in the Dow Jones index has almost doubled since the 11,500 it recorded at the height of the tech boom in 1999, while the  at only slightly above 1999＊s 6,950 at 7011."															
"The Brexit blow to the pound coupled with commodity price hikes is squeezing Britons＊  spending power this year.A typical household spends an extra ?500 in December but the pound＊s dramatic tumble since the 23 June referendum means the festive fund is being stretched as the price of everything from Christmas puddings to selection boxes and the latest tech comes under pressure.British firms are having to pay a lot more for imports, from food ingredients to fuel, with manufacturers＊ costs up 13% over the last year 每 the steepest rise for five years. Some of those higher costs are already being passed on to consumers, and experts have warned households to expect a brisker pace of inflation next year.※Generally the drivers of food inflation are what＊s happening in global commodity markets and recent movements in sterling,§ said the Retail  analyst Richard Lim. ※This side of Christmas retailers are holding back some of the inflationary pressure they are feeling from suppliers and manufacturers because it is a fiercely competitive environment. Next year we expect food inflation to rise fairly steeply because of sterling.§For now it seems importers and retailers are taking a hit to their own margins rather than choosing to charge more in the shops, but according to the Guardian＊s analysis Christmas will give shoppers a taste of higher inflation ahead.Not everything is more expensive 每 official figures show food prices in shops are still lower overall than a year ago. A supermarket price war and the rise of discounters such as Lidl and Aldi have helped keep grocery prices low.

"The top 10% of highest paid workers in Europe together earn almost as much as the bottom 50%, according to a report from the  that calls on governments and companies to do more to ensure the fruits of economic growth are shared out.The UN agency used its latest  to examine earnings inequality between different earners within firms and between firms. It also found startling discrepancies between men and women＊s salaries at senior level in Europe with a gender pay gap of more than 50% for chief executives.The report builds on a . Speaking after Donald Trump won the US election on an anti-globalisation ticket and the UK voted for Brexit, Ryder said people felt they were getting a ※raw deal§ from the current economic system.The ILO＊s Global Wage Report provided fresh evidence of the inequality that has played a role in the rise of anti-establishment parties. One of its key findings was significant gaps between executives and workers on the shop floor in European companies.※Wage inequality within enterprises, particularly the large ones, has become very substantial as the top 1% in those enterprises leave others increasingly far behind,§ said Ryder, writing in the report.By comparing the wages of individuals in Europe to the average wage of the firms where they work, the ILO＊s researchers found that about 80% are paid less than the average for the firm 每 because the average is skewed upwards by the big payouts to its highest earners.In the 1% of firms with the highest average wages, the bottom 1% of workers were paid on average 7.10 per hour while the top 1% earned an average 844 per hour, or 118 times more. ※The payment of extremely high wages by a few enterprises to a few individuals leads to a ＆pyramid＊ of highly unequally distributed wages,§ the report explained.Some of the earnings inequality between workers in a country is driven by the types of firms people work for, because some industries pay better than others. But Patrick Belser, author of the report and the ILO＊s senior wages expert, said practices within firms were also playing a big role in wage inequality.※In Europe, inequality within enterprises accounts for almost half of wage inequality. That tells you just having minimum wages is not going to solve wage inequality,§ he said.In addition to minimum wage rates and collective bargaining, inequality could also be cut by firms self-regulating, said Belser. Governments should help with tougher requirements on how firms report pay gaps between both genders and different levels of seniority. ※In the medium term, if there is no self-regulation, people might get fed up with high executive pay,§ he added.He also called for more countries to adopt rules like those coming in the UK next year that . The ILO＊s wage report showed the overall hourly gender pay gap for Europe was about 20%. The gap was found to be higher at the top, and for the highest 1% of wage earners it reached about 45%. Among men and women chief executives the gender pay gap was above 50%. ※In the very best paying enterprises almost all CEOs are men,§ said Belser."															
"London＊s economic output per person is more than double the average across the rest of the UK, according to new figures that underscore the challenge facing ministers as they vow to tackle the UK＊s entrenched regional inequality. showed gross value added (GVA) per head 每 a measure of what is generated by economic activity in an area 每 was higher in London than any other region in 2015 at ?43,629. That dwarfed the figure for the lowest region, Wales, at ?18,002 and was also doublethe level of ?21,638 for the UK without London.The figures from the Office for National Statistics also showed the gap between the capital and the rest of the UK had grown over the last decade. Responding to the latest sign of regional imbalances in the UK, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) called on the government to urgently step in with support, including investment in infrastructure projects like housebuilding, rail improvements, roads and clean energy.※People in every part of Britain need a strong local economy, generating good jobs and improving living standards. But there is a huge gap between London and other parts of the UK,§ said TUC general secretary, Frances O＊Grady.※For decades now, successive governments have failed to invest enough outside of the capital. We urgently need a proper industrial strategy that reaches every community. With Brexit on the horizon, it＊s all the more important that we speed ahead with the investment needed to give every part of Britain decent jobs and strong industry.§O＊Grady said help ※must be targeted at communities that have been abandoned after the loss of traditional industries, and where too many jobs are insecure and low paid§.The Resolution Foundation thinktank, which , said the latest data highlighted the challenge facing Britain＊s new metro mayors due to be elected in some areas next year under devolution plans.It noted that all cities bar London were still worse off than they were before the financial crisis, based on the GVA figures. The thinktank＊s analysis showed London was on average ?1,270 better off, the rest of the UK city regions were ?900 worse off and the country as a whole was ?450 worse off. Cardiff and Belfast were furthest from their pre-crisis GVA levels.But the thinktank also saw some reasons to be hopeful that the gap with London would narrow in some places, as the 2015 figures showed big cities enjoyed relatively strong growth in economic output last year, particularly in the North West.Analysing big city regions, Resolution said the Liverpool city region was the top performer in terms of growth in GVA per head last year, with a rise of 3% 每 almost double London＊s growth of 1.6%.※This strong growth provides a good building block for their new city mayors to build on next year,§ said Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation.※ Closing the economic output gap between the capital and Britain＊s other major cities will play a central role in delivering economic growth throughout the UK over the next decade.§"															
"Wonderful news that Rob Wilson, the junior minister responsible for libraries, has recognised that libraries provide a vital public service to communities and has made an extra ?4m available (, 2 December).Here in Suffolk, our Industrial Provident Society (IPS) has been incredibly successful in managing its reducing budget for the county libraries. However, this is likely to change in the light of proposed cuts. Suffolk  IPS will have to save a further ?230,000 in the next financial year (2017/2018). This is on top of the previous year＊s cut of ?350,000. Over the past five years the total budget will have shrunk from almost ?9m to a little over ?5m if these latest cuts go ahead.So far these savings have been achieved without closures or significant reductions in services and opening hours. All this looks set to change unless Rob Wilson＊s extra funding can, in part, find its way to Suffolk. The consequences of such cuts will not just be felt by the book-borrowing public. Libraries are more than a place to borrow a book. They provide the school library service to schools throughout Suffolk and have become centres for information, learning and entertainment. Most worrying is the threat to mobile libraries.The goodwill of friends＊ groups and volunteers, which support all of our libraries, can only be stretched so far before it breaks. The vital service that libraries provided to a community can be summed up in one simple concept: the provision of good reading. That ※libraries should be about far more than books§ according to Rob Wilson, far from being much of a help, is a put-down to that simple, single vital social function. Reference libraries already provide comprehensive information services, so there is nothing bright and new about that, nor any special need to develop it.All recent research has shown that reading is the single most important factor in educational and occupational attainment. It is particularly relevant to contemporary society, where the development of emotional intelligence is increasingly important in every walk of life. Research shows that readers of literary fiction in particular demonstrate much greater empathy than?non-readers of literary fiction.There can be no doubt that the decent library book services of the recent past contributed enormously to the economic and cultural health of communities. The availability of well-printed hardback books in libraries was an important boost to publishing good quality literature rather than the commercial-minded money-spinners we hear too much of today. Good and serious writers and publishers were able to survive while the library system guaranteed basic sales of their books. The economic and cultural pay-off to writers, publishers and library users was incomparable.The ?4m investment should be channelled into the encouragement of good books in libraries and the culture of reading good books in our communities. Otherwise we are becoming an increasingly philistine society. It is my hope that Jeremy Corbyn＊s Labour party will have better polices that both support the existence of public libraries and oppose this whittling away of reading and culture in the name of the profit motive.  For me, in the 1950s, Sheffield central library meant ※the Ref§ (the reference library) (, 6 December). It offered a large desk, warmth, quiet and books presided over by the redoubtable Mary Walton. Upstairs were the pictures. Outside the Peace Gardens for the sandwich. The tram ride cost pence. If this sounds like the famous Python sketch, then best wishes to Michael Palin and the petitioners. It is heartbreaking."															
"nvestors＊ ability to look on the bright side on political turmoil is remarkable. In the case of Italy, the departure of , the market-friendly centre-left prime minister, was followed quickly by the thought that the crisis in the country＊s banking system may, counterintuitively, become easier to address.That wasn＊t last week＊s theory, of course. Back then, Renzi＊s survival was seen as critical to encouraging private sector investors to cough up billions of euros of new capital  and UniCredit.This week＊s silver lining theory holds that a political vacuum isn＊t so bad if it prods the European Central Bank and the eurozone authorities to take a flexible approach to Italy＊s banking mess. Ireland＊s finance minister, Michael Noonan, captured the new mood: ※The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, is Italian and I can＊t envisage a situation in which the ECB under Mario Draghi will let the Italian banks get into difficulty.§He＊s probably right. It seems quite possible that, if MPS struggles to get its required 5bn (?4.2bn) from big private sector investors such as Qatar＊s sovereign wealth fund, the bank could be nationalised with ways found to compensate ordinary savers who hold bonds that would be wiped out.A wipeout of senior bondholders is meant to be an essential requirement of state bailouts in the eurozone these days. It causes problems in  because so many bondholders are retail savers. But the eurozone＊s capacity to bend its own rules is legendary: compensation for some bondholders, even if that is supposed to be a no-no, might be deemed a price worth paying after Renzi＊s exit.Yet would that really be a cause for celebration? Only if the health of the Italian banking system is addressed once and for all. But it seems far more likely that a weak Italian government and reluctant eurozone authorities will serve up only half a solution 每 one big enough to get through the current crisis but insufficient to allow a proper cleansing of the bad loans in the system, which are estimated to stand at 360bn.If that＊s the script, there will little reason to cheer. Italy＊s banks would continue to be a drag on the country＊s economy and the eurozone authorities＊ credibility in a crisis would suffer another knock.From Royal Bank of Scotland＊s point of view, almost any legal settlement counts as good business these days.  also looks craftily pitched.The terms on offer to the complainants 每 about 41p for every share bought for about 200p 每 present the two remaining groups of hold-outs with a choice. They can accept an offer the others deem acceptable; or they can take their chances with litigation that could take half a decade.Public statements on Monday suggest a willingness to fight on, but we＊ll see if that spirit survives the prospect of a lengthy court battle. One suspects cool heads will prevail eventually and that the hold-outs will choose certainty, which would allow RBS to draw a line under the saga at a cost of ?800m, roughly in line with the size of its provision.Such an outcome would be sensible but also disappointing. We would all be deprived of the opportunity of seeing former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin and former chairman Sir Tom McKillop in court to defend their portrait of RBS＊s financial health in April 2008. RBS has recorded losses every single year since then and the tally stands at more than ?50bn. The testimony would be fascinating.Back in January 2013, Sports Direct and Merrill Lynch, the sportswear chain＊s corporate broker, were said to have parted ways by mutual consent. That wasn＊t true, , who used to be an adviser to the company but is now suing founder Mike Ashley for a ?14m bonus he says he was promised. Blue alleges that Merrill Lynch resigned earlier, in autumn 2012, because it was worried that share purchases by the company＊s employee benefit trust could breach financial regulations.The court can unpick the detail of the claims; Sports Direct didn＊t comment on Monday. But the discrepancy over timings should make City regulators think. Corporate brokers play an important role in City life, acting as intermediaries between a company and its shareholders. If one quits 每 for whatever reason 每 there ought to be an obligation to announce the fact promptly."															
"Rocketing UK fuel prices mean that two-car families are now spending almost ?40 a month more on petrol than a year ago.Crude oil prices have risen 20% since the  at the end of November, from $46.50 (?37) a barrel to about $56 now. This has pushed petrol prices in the UK higher, exacerbated by the pound＊s slide against the dollar, as oil is traded in the US currency.The UK＊s average petrol price rose to 120.11p a litre this week, up 0.63p from mid-January, according to the AA. Diesel is now 122.32p a litre, 0.34p more expensive than this time last month.Compared with a year ago, petrol drivers are paying 18.16p a litre more (101.95p), while diesel drivers are 21.30p a litre (101.02p) worse off. Filling a typical petrol tank costs ?9.99 more, while a transit-size fuel tank costs ?17.04 more to refuel.This means a family with two petrol cars is now spending ?240.22 on petrol each month, compared with ?203.90 in February 2016. when an oil glut pushed the cost of crude below $27 a barrel. .AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said someone with a fixed budget of ?30 a week, spent on five days＊ driving to and from work, might now find that amount only covered four days＊ driving. ※This means raiding some other part of the family budget. It＊s becoming quite a tight squeeze.§Edmund King, the AA＊s president, said motorists should shop around: ※Drivers need to keep their ears and eyes open to locate lower pump prices.

Higher oil costs can also push up household energy bills as wholesale gas prices tend to track the price of crude.As higher inflation eats into people＊s pockets, they are expected to rein in spending. Consumer spending has been surprisingly strong since the Brexit vote and has kept , but City economists warn this could change in coming months. "															
"The chancellor, , has been described as ※economically illiterate§ by the head of a group of economists lobbying for the UK to ditch tariffs and embrace free trade after Brexit.Patrick Minford, an economics professor at Cardiff University, said Hammond and other politicians risked setting the UK on a course of serious self harm if they pushed for a trade deal with the EU that put customs charges on goods and services imported to the country.Minford was speaking as his previous group, Economists for , relaunched on Thursday itself as Economists for Free Trade. He argued that if the UK removed all import tariffs, even if the EU did not reciprocate, GDP would rise, government receipts would be boosted and retail prices paid by British consumers would fall.Hammond and others have warned that such . Asked how he would shift the present chancellor＊s view, Minford replied: ※Well this is just economic illiteracy. I don＊t know how one deals with an economic illiterate other than say ＆come to my lectures＊ or something.§It is not the first time Minford has taken aim at a UK chancellor. Campaigning for Brexit ahead of last year＊s referendum, the economist turned on George Osborne, who had insisted that those campaigning to leave the EU were  ※Osborne is the one who is economically illiterate here,§ .A source close to Hammond said: ※To suggest that two successive chancellors don＊t know what they are doing but if they had listened to Mr Minford the world would be at rights, is preposterous. Mr Minford does not appear to understand the challenges that the UK economy will have to navigate as it exits the EU, nor the full potential of the opportunities that await.§Minford＊s panel comprises 15 economists and has an advisory group that includes the MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, as well as John Longworth, co-chair of Leave Means Leave and former head of the British Chambers of Commerce who . One of the panel＊s reasons for wanting to drop tariffs on imports to the UK is the potential benefit to consumers from lower prices. They say that currently the EU customs union raises prices through protection and business regulation, to the benefit of producers and at the expense of consumers.Roger Bootle, another member of Economists for Free Trade, said it was a ※battle§ to get the idea of zero import tariffs across to people. But he highlighted Theresa May＊s recent assertion that the UK would leave the Europe＊s single market when it left the union.※Think of where we have come from already. I don＊t know how long in the run-up to the Brexit referendum I would keep hearing how vital it was to stay in the single market ... we have come an awful long way from there ... So I wouldn＊t give up on Philip Hammond, I think we can convince him,§ said Bootle.In her speech on Brexit, in January, the prime minister said that instead of membership of the single market Britain would seek ※the greatest possible access to it through a new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement§.Setting out free-trade supporters＊ views ahead of those negotiations, Minford said there was a risk the UK would end up in a ※tit-for-tat§ battle with an un-cooperative EU if it maintained tariffs. ※Any strategy that involves the UK putting up tariffs against the EU will cause significant self harm, which is entirely avoidable.§"															
"onald Trump did not assume the US presidency as a committed multilateralist. On that, partisans of all political persuasions can agree. Among his most controversial campaign statements were some suggesting that Nato was obsolete,  to other multilateral organisations and alliances.Last week, however, Trump stepped back, reassuring an audience at US Central Command in Tampa, Florida (the headquarters for US forces that operate in the Middle East). ※We strongly support Nato,§ he , explaining that his ※issue§ with the alliance was one of full and proper financial contributions from all members, not fundamental security arrangements.This more nuanced view presumably reflects a new appreciation, whether because of security briefings or the sobering fact of actually occupying the Oval Office, that the world is a dangerous place. Even a president committed to putting ※America first§ now seems to recognise that a framework through which countries can pursue shared goals is not a bad thing.The question now is whether what is true for Nato is also true for the International Monetary Fund, , and the Basel committee on banking supervision. Trump＊s record on the campaign trail and Twitter is not heartening. Back in 2012, he  of the World Bank for ※tying poverty to ＆climate change＊§ (his quotation marks). ※And we wonder why international organisations are ineffective,§ he complained.Likewise, last July, he mooted the possibility that the United States might withdraw from the WTO if it constrained his ability to impose tariffs. And he vowed repeatedly during the presidential campaign to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. But the evolution of Trump＊s position on  suggests he may yet see merit to working through these organisations as he comes to recognise that the world economy, too, is a dangerous place.Following the election, . His position seemed less to deny the existence of global warming than to insist that policies mitigating climate change should not impose an unreasonable burden on American companies.The way to limit the competitive burden on US producers is, of course, by ensuring that other countries also require their companies to take steps to mitigate climate change, thereby keeping the playing field level. And this is precisely what the Paris agreement is about.The same can be said of the Basel committee＊s standards for capital adequacy. Holding more capital is not costless for US banks, as advisers like Gary Cohn, formerly of Goldman Sachs and now the head of Trump＊s National Economic Council, presumably tell the president morning, noon, and night. Levelling the playing field in this area means requiring foreign banks also to hold more capital, which is precisely the point of the Basel process.Trump may similarly come to appreciate the advantages of working through the IMF when a crisis erupts in Venezuela, or in Mexico as a result of his own policies. In 1995, the US Treasury extended financial assistance to Mexico through the Exchange Stabilisation Fund. In 2008, the Federal Reserve provided Brazil with a $30bn swap line to help it navigate the global financial crisis. But imagine the outrage with which Trump＊s supporters would greet a ※taxpayer bailout§ of a foreign country or Mexican officials＊ anger over having to secure assistance from the same Trump administration responsible for their country＊s ills. Both sides would surely prefer working through the IMF.Trump can＊t be pleased that the Obama administration rushed to push through the reappointment of its chosen World Bank president, . But he clearly  the benefits of development aid. While he has said the US should ※stop sending foreign aid to countries that hate us,§ he has also observed that failure to help poor countries can foment instability.This would appear to be an area where Trump will favour bilateral action, which would enable him to assuage his conservative critics by insisting that no US funds go towards family planning, while taking credit for any and all assistance. At the same time, minimising the role of the US in the World Bank would create a vacuum to be filled by China, Trump＊s , both in that institution and through the activities of the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.The real test of Trump＊s stance on multilateralism will be how he approaches the . Persuading the US Congress to agree on corporate and personal income-tax reform, a $1tn infrastructure initiative, and a replacement for Obama＊s signature health-care reform won＊t be easy, to say the least. Doing so will require patience, which is not Trump＊s strong suit. This suggests that he will feel pressured to do what he can unilaterally.One thing he can do unilaterally is slap duties on imports, potentially in violation of WTO rules. We＊ll soon find out whether those rules will deter him."															
"The  started the moment Andrew Puzder emerged from behind the fat fryer as Donald Trump＊s pick for labor secretary.The labor department＊s mandate is to ※promote and develop the welfare of working people, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment§. Was the chief executive of the CKE fast-food chain that owns Carl＊s Jr and Hardee＊s really the man for the job? Democrats, fast food workers and advocates for low-wage employees chorused: ※NO.§His appointment was an example of ※anti-worker extremism§ said Service Employees International Union (SEIU) head Mary Kay Henry. New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said that under Puzder＊s leadership, CKE had stolen from low-wage workers and called the appointment ※a  decision by President-elect Trump§.None of this mattered to Trump or the Republican party, or so it seemed. ※Andy will fight to make American workers safer and more prosperous by enforcing fair occupational safety standards and ensuring workers receive the benefits they deserve, and he will save small businesses from the crushing burdens of unnecessary regulations that are stunting job growth and suppressing wages,§ Trump said, .Only yesterday, the Republican national committee sent out a press release citing a Wall Street Journal  that highlighted ※the bogus charges§ Democrats and ※their union machine§ were lobbing at Puzder in ※a desperate attempt to block his confirmation at all costs. Puzder＊s record ※as a proven job creator and business leader makes him the perfect candidate to stand up for American workers.§But while Trump and his intimates were immune to the anti-Puzder campaign, other Republicans were not. At least four Republican senators 每 Susan Collins (Maine), Johnny Isakson (Georgia), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Tim Scott (South Carolina) 每 looked set to vote against him, ending his chances of nomination. Rumor had it more knives were ready to be plunged in Puzder＊s back.The fast-food boss＊s fall shows another flaw emerging in Trump＊s presidency. Having been seen off by the judiciary over his immigration ban, Trump is now learning that while he may love to give the middle finger to (supposedly) liberal public opinion, there are Republicans who will not join in. And without them, his plans can come undone.If Trump wants someone to blame, he could start with Barack Obama. The Obama administration led the most dramatic turnaround in employment in living memory. Unemployment peaked at 10% after the recession Obama inherited from George W Bush. It was less than 5% when he vacated the White House. But wages have stagnated and many of those new jobs have been created in service industries such as fast food.Out of this conundrum has emerged a vocal, organized and union-backed movement fighting for a higher minimum wage and more worker rights, Fight for $15. When Trump appointed Puzder, the well-oiled machine that won some major concessions from McDonald＊s, WalMart and others under Obama saw its chance. Protests across the country highlighted Puzder＊s record 每 and it was not a good one.Alongside street protests, pressure groups including National Employment Law Project and Jobs With Justice targeted anti-Puzder op-eds in over 30 newspapers across the country. They coordinated tens of thousands of calls to key Senate players. Fight for $15＊s #NotOurLaborSec hashtag reached 28 million people on Twitter.Here was a man who talked gleefully about dumping staff for robots: ※They＊re always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there＊s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex or race discrimination case,§ he told  last year.He told  his firm was hiring ※the best of the worst. It＊s kind of the bottom of the pool.§ And in his first memo to Hardee＊s managers, he wrote: ※No more people behind the counter unless they have all their teeth.§His company, famous for racy 每 or sexist, depending on your views 每 ads reported  of sexual harassment, according to a recent report.Unsurprisingly, those workers felt little loyalty to their former boss. Darin Brooks, a Hardee＊s worker and a member of Raise Up $15, the Fight for $15 chapter in Durham, North Carolina, said: ※When Donald Trump first tapped Andy Puzder to be labor secretary, fast food workers told the president that if he sided with fast food CEOs instead of fast-food workers, he＊d be on the wrong side of history. ※We rallied outside Puzder＊s stores nationwide and showed America how his burger empire was built on low pay, wage theft, sexual harassment and intimidation. And today, we are on the right side of history. This is a major victory for the Fight for $15, but we can＊t and won＊t back down until the  gives us a real labor secretary who will put working people over corporate profits.§While activism certainly played a major part in turning public opinion, it seems that Trump did little or no vetting of their smart-mouthed labor pick. Puzder＊s downfall also dragged up allegations, denied by both sides, of spousal abuse and comments made by his ex-wife on Oprah Winfrey＊s show. In 1990 America＊s most popular media mogul filmed Lisa Fierstein, Puzder＊s ex-wife, for an episode titled High Class Battered Women.Using the name ※Ann§ and appearing in disguise in wig and dark glasses Fierstein, who was married to the the fast food boss for 14 years, told the show that Puzder had threatened her and said: ※He vowed revenge. I will see you in the gutter. This will never be over. You will pay for this,§ , which reviewed a copy of the show all of media had been hoping to score. ※Most men who are in positions like that don＊t leave marks. The damage that I sustained, you can＊t see. It＊s permanent damage but there＊s no mark. And there never was. They don＊t hit you in the face. They are too smart,§ she says over the closing credits.Fierstein has since retracted her allegations of domestic abuse and told the Guardian, and others, that the allegations were a tactic to gain leverage in her divorce.Nevertheless a tape of the show was turned over to the senators on the health, education, labor and pensions committee, which was to hold Puzder＊s confirmation hearing, by the Oprah Winfrey Network. Now that committee can stand down. The fast food boss has left them with nothing but a bad taste in their mouth and Trump with another headache. "															
"s the nation＊s shoppers turn their thoughts to Christmas, a dark cloud looms. Could it be that rising inflation will spoil the party? Only a few weeks ago, Theresa May, Philip Hammond and the rest of the cabinet could have been forgiven for worrying about the impact of inflation after most . And, worse, more of the same is expected next year, with rising prices eating into disposable incomes to more than halve Britain＊s GDP growth rate.In recent days the news has been better. Comments by Hammond and  towards the European Union have pushed up the value of sterling against the dollar and euro and cut the chances of a much more expensive festive period.Of course, a higher pound could snuff out a welcome recovery in manufacturing output since August. But voters shop much more than they work in manufacturing. So from the narrow perspective of a government attempting to keep the population on side during a potentially turbulent pre-article?50 negotiation period, during which migration data shows record numbers of continental Europeans rocking up on British shores, a lack of inflation will be good news.This situation is unlikely to hold. Davis＊s comments that Britain might find a way to pay for access to the single market was simply another way of saying that all options were open. Hammond was also repeating himself: more importantly, he is well known as being a soft Brexiter, a breed vastly outnumbered around the cabinet table.Next week the theme could be hard Brexit 每 a change directed as much by the EU＊s tough-talking negotiators as by a wild comment from Boris Johnson 每 pushing sterling down again.The difficulty in predicting inflation while the Brexit conflict continues lies behind the divergence between various forecasts, with  by the end of 2017, while others believe prices will grow by little more than 2%.Unfortunately for the forecasters, the pound is not the only influence on prices. There is also the impact that comes from demand for goods and services. At the moment, businesses and the government are sucking demand out of the economy.In the autumn statement, the chancellor extended austerity into a third parliament, with cuts to disability payments and tax credits. His message was that a boost to infrastructure spending would compensate by creating thousands of well-paid jobs in areas such as engineering, science and construction.Last week Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), took a sword to this narrative and killed it stone dead. He said Hammond＊s plans to boost infrastructure spending with a ?23bn ※national productivity investment fund§ failed to move the dial on its .※This is not the near-term fiscal stimulus package that some people either expected or feared or wanted,§ Chote said in testimony to the Treasury select committee. ※It＊s a relatively small, gradually phased increase.§ He added that it minimised one of the main boasts for infrastructure spending 每 a ※multiplier effect§ that sends out ripples of extra work to suppliers and services companies that in turn increase investment and employment.An example of how feeble the infrastructure package is likely to prove was given last week by the tax adviser George Bull of accountant RSM. He was talking of Hammond＊s planned 100% capital allowance for companies investing in electric car charging points, and investment of ?80m to expand the charging infrastructure.Bull, who describes the move to increase the number of electric vehicles on UK roads as ※gloriously inconsistent§ with the government＊s reduction last year in subsidies for renewable electricity generators, asked who would benefit from this extra tax relief and how much it would be worth.HMRC＊s answer was: ※In practice it [the new tax relief] impacts only on those businesses with qualifying plant and machinery expenditure above the level of the annual investment allowance of ?200,000.§※In other words,§ said Bull, ※very few businesses. And the cost to the exchequer, according to HMRC, is negligible.※So here we have a new tax relief which can＊t be used by many businesses, which will hardly cost the exchequer a penny, but which seems inconsistent with the government＊s broader policy on renewable energy.§The Institute for Fiscal Studies looked at another autumn statement initiative 每 the government plan to extend free childcare for three- and four-year-olds in England from 15 to 30 hours a week 每 and asked whether it was likely to boost parental employment.The answer was: ※Only slightly.§ So it would leave demand in the economy little changed.Demand can also be affected by business investment growth, which the OBR expects will falter as the Brexit vote debate gets into full swing.It all makes for a bleak picture when low inflation expectations rely on weak consumer spending, low business investment, an autumn statement that can only be described as a non-event and the odd ministerial comment hinting at a softer Brexit."															
"By any measure, it has been a bad week for hard Brexiters and Theresa May＊s government. Problem is, the two have become all but synonymous. Thursday＊s shock  showed that the pro-Europe convictions of nearly half the country＊s voters cannot wisely be ignored. Conservative supporters were alienated by May＊s ※pandering§ to hardline party zealots and  fellow travellers, the victorious Liberal Democrats claimed. ※One of the things that concerns a great deal of people in this constituency is＃ the Conservative government seems to be shifting very rapidly towards the right,§ said Sarah Olney, the unashamedly Europhile winning candidate.There is a widely shared perception that May, far from reuniting the country in the wake of the EU referendum, as she promised, is cementing and entrenching divisions. It would be wrong to see in the byelection outcome definitive proof that the national mood has radically shifted in the past six months. Most Richmond voters favoured Remain in June. But the scale of Tory defections suggests deep unhappiness with May＊s subsequent, lopsided approach. It is as though she and her ministers have wholly dismissed the views of the , just as they arrogantly rejected last month＊s impartial, legally sound  that parliament must be consulted prior to the triggering of article 50.May＊s political positioning seems designed, first and foremost, to keep the parliamentary Tory party together, not the country. Even so, her slim majority is now further reduced. A second consideration, which also has nothing to do with the national interest, is to woo traditionally Labour voters who favoured Leave. This is not leadership. It is partisan opportunism. Yet worse still, from May＊s point of view, it is not working. Every day brings more evidence that a hard  is not supported by most voters 每 Leave and Remain 每 and that it would be unworkable and massively damaging.Ministers may belatedly be coming to understand this latter point. The confusion within government ranks is palpable. David Davis, Brexit tsar, has moved from initially implying that Britain will willingly quit the single market to admitting, last week,  每 a stunning reversal. Having refused to offer up-front guarantees on the rights of EU citizens living in Britain, May is now reportedly affronted that her proposal to do exactly that, in exchange for similar guarantees for Britons living in the EU, was  by Angela Merkel, Germany＊s chancellor.Ministers are likewise all over the place on freedom of movement, which, with single market access, is the key Brexit negotiating issue. Using sophistry, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who cynically misled voters by dangling the spectre of millions of Turks descending on Britain, now says he ※personally§  每 and champions Turkey＊s EU membership. This volte-face was described by one European diplomat as typical of the government＊s ※shambolic§ diplomacy. Johnson is a very unfunny disgrace. He plainly has no idea what he is doing or what he believes from one day to the next.All this flailing and flip-flopping is the direct result of an unyielding European stance. The past few days have seen a significant hardening of opinion in reaction to the hard Tory Brexiters＊ chaotic and high-handed behaviour. There is also , that May and her allies seem incapable of grasping that when the EU leaders, singly and collectively, say there can and will be no compromise on the union＊s four founding principles 每 freedom of movement of goods, services, people and capital 每 they really mean it. Even , the normally unflappable, anglophile president of the European council, lost his cool last week when Tory MPs accused Brussels of obstruction.Michael Gove, Iain Duncan Smith and other backbench Little Englanders really should get out more. There is no option to have one＊s cake and eat it, as a Brexit departmental aide＊s notes optimistically suggested. When Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, says the UK＊s Brexit demands are ※intellectually impossible and politically unavailable§, he speak for all of Europe. When , Manfred Weber, chair of the largest centre-right group in the European parliament, and , all say there will be no fudging matters of principle and , either, they must be taken very seriously indeed.From Europe＊s perspective, these are the immoveable rocks on which the credibility of the hard Brexiters＊ case is foundering. Yet, if May keeps blindly steering in her current direction, a super-hard Brexit pile-up 每 meaning a total, sudden, economically unstructured, financially calamitous and politically acrimonious divorce from the EU in 2018 每 may become unavoidable. From a domestic perspective, May＊s populist policy, unless swiftly rethought, will mean deepening national divisions, more revolts such as Richmond, more and worsening damage to investment, jobs and living standards, more of the vicious bullying and public name-calling of which the  has become chief exemplar and more constitutional chaos.This is a fraught moment for Britain and Europe as a whole. Tomorrow, the supreme court will start to hear the government＊s appeal against the high court＊s article 50 ruling. A repeat of last month＊s crude attempts to intimidate the judges is already under way. Already, the legitimacy of their eventual ruling is being placed in doubt. Already, the mob is baying, denouncing the ※enemies of the people§. In Italy and Austria, meanwhile, the forces of an ugly nativism are again on the march. Last week was a bad week for Brexiters. This week may be rocky for us all."															
"Europe＊s politicians believe a trade deal with the UK could take up to a decade or more and could still fail in the final stages, Downing Street has been warned by the UK＊s ambassador to the EU.Sir Ivan Rogers, who conducted David Cameron＊s  with the EU before the referendum, is reported to have told Theresa May that European politicians expect that a deal will not be finalised until the early to mid-2020s, according to the BBC. That deal could still be rejected by any of the 27 national parliaments during the ratification process.It is understood Rogers was reporting back conversations he had had with European politicians, rather than giving his own advice to the British government.※It is wrong to suggest this is advice from our ambassador to the EU,§ a No 10 spokesman said. ※Like all ambassadors, part of his role is to report the views of others.§The former Tory minister Dominic Raab, a leave campaigner, said it was ※reasonable to set out a worst-case scenario of five to 10 years to iron out all the detail of a trade deal§.He told BBC Radio 4＊s Today programme on Thursday: ※The crucial question is whether we maintain barrier-free trade in the meantime, in which case there＊s no real problem. I have to say it＊s very unlikely in the interim that the EU would want to erect trade barriers.§Speaking later in the House of Commons, Mark Garnier, a trade minister, said Rogers had been reporting the views of ※interlocutors§. He admitted it was incredibly difficult to know how long it would take to complete a trade deal but pointed out that one between the US and Jordan had taken just four months.The assessment of the long road ahead by one of Britain＊s top diplomats will come as no surprise to those in Brussels. In the run-up to the referendum, Donald Tusk, president of the European council, warned that Britain could , with no guarantee of success. British government officials have told ministers it could take a decade to extricate the UK from EU law, with the domestic legislative agenda likely to be dominated by unwinding EU membership for years to come.But the reports come after the Brexit secretary, David Davis, told a select committee hearing that ※§ within a year and a half of the formal article 50 notification in March. The deal would then take about six months to be agreed by European leaders, the European parliament and the British parliament.While Davis is optimistic, May declined to respond to questions on the Brexit timetable as she arrived in Brussels for an EU summit at which leaders of the other 27 member states will draw up plans to be ※battle ready§ for Brexit at a dinner from which the .However, she welcomed the fact that other EU leaders were discussing  without her, saying: ※It is right that other leaders prepare for those negotiations as we have been preparing.§Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said  were clearly in favour of striking a transitional deal with the EU to smooth the Brexit process but Downing Street has so far refused to confirm it will seek this.Speaking at the hearing, Davis said the UK was not opposed to transitional arrangements if they amounted to a Brexit ※implementation phase§ but only if it was really necessary and after the deal had been nailed down.※Whatever the transitional arrangement is, we need to know where we＊re going before we decide on the transition,§ he said. ※It seems to me that it will be perfectly possible to know what the endgame will be in two years.§Davis made clear that the UK would seek a trade deal at the same time as negotiations over exiting under article 50, but that preventing non-tariff barriers to services was probably more important than stopping the imposition of tariffs on goods.The Tory MP Neil Carmichael, a supporter of , said: ※The government should bring forward their substantive plans in a white paper, which David Davis himself suggested before he joined the cabinet.※There is a mandate to leave the EU but there is no mandate for a hard, destructive Brexit. The terms on which we leave should be subject to rigorous debate and scrutiny 每 in parliament and the country.§ EU leaders will reaffirm their now familiar red lines on Brexit over dinner in Brussels: no negotiations until notification of article 50, and no compromise on the idea that single market membership means accepting free movement of people.Since these principles were , the EU has not budged.※The heads of state or government of 27 member states reconfirmed their ,§ states a draft communique to be released after dinner on Thursday. ※They reiterated that they stand ready to start negotiations with the UK as soon as the UK has notified under article 50.§Before the dinner May and the other EU27 leaders will discuss the , ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine and plans to boost EU defence capabilities. After the formal talks, the 27 will discuss Brexit without May.Over a three-course dinner, they are expected to rubber-stamp a series of procedural points: the former French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, will be formally appointed as lead Brexit negotiator 每 an outcome never really in doubt, as he has access to scores of technical staff at the European commission. But leaders will stress they are in charge of talks with the British: the European council ※will remain permanently seized§ on Brexit, the draft states, and will set up a working group of technical experts to follow the negotiations.The European parliament＊s status as the junior player is confirmed: MEPs will be invited to join EU27 diplomats merely ※for an exchange of views§ at the start of crucial Brexit preparatory meetings. The parliament＊s smaller role means that any promises by MEPs on special status for British citizens should be taken with a pinch of salt.MEPs reacted furiously after learning they would not have a central role in the EU Brexit process. Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, said he was disappointed with proposals to give MEPs a secondary role. He warned that ※if we are not adequately involved, we may not be able to give our assent§ - meaning ※the UK would face the hardest Brexit possible§.Schulz was speaking at his last EU summit as MEP leader, as he prepares to . The EU treaties state that the European parliament must give its consent to Britain＊s EU exit deal, but are silent on any negotiating role for MEPs.Sorting out the EU＊s institutional machinery is intended to send a message that  is ready to start talks, amid continuing uncertainty about the kind of Brexit London wants. The EU needs to be ※battle ready§, said one senior diplomat, so no time is lost once May triggers article 50. "															
"he geeks fight back. Experts may have had a bit of a kicking over the last six months but it＊s looking like they are going to have the last laugh. Or at least chuckle. Laughing may be a social skill too far for an economist.Having had a night to go through the chancellor＊s autumn statement, the Institute for Fiscal studies, the UK＊s leading independent economic thinktank, had convened in an airless basement 每 daylight and the IFS are not on speaking terms 每 off London＊s Tottenham Court Road to deliver their verdict.When an economist looks jolly, then you know there＊s bad news on the way. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, looked positively ecstatic as he began his presentation. ※Let＊s start with something the government has got right,§ he said briskly. This wasn＊t going to take long. ※Getting rid of the autumn statement is a good thing.§ One less budget a year is one less opportunity for a government to screw things up with bad policy.With the positive 每 there was no need for a plural 每 out the way, Johnson turned his attention to the content of the chancellor＊s statement. Every household was going to be ?1,000 worse off in 2021 and if you thought the government was really bothered about those ※just about managing§ then think about it again. He had been up all night looking for some measure, any measure, that might help them out and he had drawn a blank. It would be the least well off who would be taking the biggest hit. Thanks Lurch (aka Mr Hammond). Thanks .※The thing is,§ he bounced onwards, ※the Office for Budget Responsibility＊s economic forecasts are noticeably more upbeat than anyone else＊s.§ Johnson sounded puzzled about this. ※Noticeably more upbeat§ in IFS parlance means delusional. Someone must have been shooting up the OBR with liquid valium for them to come up with this doggybollox.Over in the Treasury, Lurch started sticking pins into effigies of Johnson and his team. Only that morning, he had been happy for the Brexit heavies to rubbish the OBR for being wilfully pessimistic. Now it turned out they had been overly cautious. Bloody experts. They had no business going round sticking their noses into their own business.Johnson felt untouchable. He had waited a long time for his revenge on this government and was going to eke out every precious moment. There was no chance Lurch would be able to give any more money to the NHS in this parliament so the Brexiters would have to find their ?350m a week from somewhere else. Growth was terrible, tax receipts had fallen off a cliff and everyone was going to be broke. Apart from the well off. Now he came to think of it, the country would have been a lot better off under ＊ economic plans. Yes. Things really were that bad.Having indulged his personal gestalt therapy session, Johnson handed over to his troglodytic colleagues. First up was a blinking Thomas Pope who declared that Brexit was going to cost the country an extra ?290m a week, but it was the deputy director, Carl Emmerson, who delivered the coup de grace to Lurch＊s autumn statement. Whatever private pain Johnson had been going through was nothing compared with the hell that Emmerson had endured at the hands of the Brexiters.The pain spilled out in torrents. He had seen countless fiscal rules come and go and they were all equally worthless. ※The  have broken three of their own in the last 12 months,§ he spat with more venom than he had intended. ※What＊s more, the chancellor has said that compliance with his three new rules can only be assessed every five years, starting after the next election.§ He left the futility of those rules hanging in the air.※Borrowing-to-public sector debt is at its highest level since the second world war and the Napoleonic wars,§ Emmerson continued. ※The government has only a one in three chance of meeting its targets. Let＊s just hope we get a positive shock to the economy or further austerity will be needed.§ Emmerson didn＊t mean that. Bring on Brexit. Bring on austerity. The figures didn＊t lie. Even the ones subject to statistical variation. God stand up for spreadsheets. Johnson and Emmerson locked arms and punched the air. Geeks 5: government 0."															
"Workers in Britain face the longest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as Brexit knocks wage growth and stokes inflation, a leading thinktank has said.Picking over Philip Hammond＊s first autumn statement, the  said that by 2021, real wages in the UK 每 pay adjusted for inflation 每 will still not have recovered to their 2008 level before the global financial crisis hit.Paul Johnson, the thinktank＊s director, said: ※One cannot stress how extraordinary and dreadful that is, more than a decade without real earnings growth. We have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years and quite possibly the last 100.§Young people have been worst affected by a squeeze on wages since the crisis, and the effects of the Brexit vote look set to prolong that pain well into a second decade, on . Pensioners, on the other hand, would be largely protected from an expected sharp pickup in inflation on the back of a weaker pound.The thinktank also said  to put ※more money in people＊s pockets§ despite government pledges to help  or Jams. In fact, the impact of rising costs and a benefits freeze announced by George Osborne in 2015 would leave working households worse off.※Given the choice between jam today in the form of more money in people＊s pockets and jam tomorrow in the form of potential economic returns from greater investment, he went for jam tomorrow,§ it said.The IFS analysis follow signs that the pound＊s sharp fall since the referendum result is hiking the cost of UK imports and could soon be passed on to consumers. Pricing rows over products such as Marmite and Walkers crisps have put shoppers on alert for rising weekly bills.At the same time, experts say pay growth will stall as companies curb spending while they grapple with political and economic uncertainty.The government＊s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said on Wednesday that , with .Those forecasts were picked up in a  from the Resolution Foundation thinktank showing that families faced a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake of the financial crisis.Its  suggested average earnings were set to grow only half as rapidly as in the austerity years after the economic crisis. At the same time, living standards would be undermined by higher inflation and ongoing welfare cuts.The foundation＊s director, Torsten Bell, said: ※The combination of lower growth, higher inflation and the government＊s decision to press ahead with big welfare cuts means that households risk experiencing even slower income growth in this parliament than they saw in the aftermath of the financial crisis.※But unlike the last parliament, it will be low and middle-income households who feel the tightest squeeze this time round.§The IFS also highlighted a stark contrast in the prospects of young and old as the Brexit process unfolds and exacerbates existing divisions between age groups. It said most people would face similar changes in costs as inflation picks up, but what varied by age group was the extent to which income could keep pace with those costs.Some forms of income, such as pensions, are protected from inflation because they rise to offset higher prices. Others, however, are not, including working-age benefits, which were frozen in Osborne＊s 2015 post-election budget. At the same time, younger people see their income from work squeezed by inflation if pay rises fail to keep pace with living costs.Campaigners said the likely blow to younger people exposed the unfairness of the the government＊s triple-lock system, which has seen pensions rise every year since 2010 by the rate of inflation, average earnings or a minimum of 2.5%, whichever is higher.Ashley Seager, the co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, said: ※The government must stop caving in to the old-age lobby and say enough is enough. It cannot be right that 2 million wealthy oldies who need help the least are universally protected, while the young, who need help the most, are left to pick up the bill. The triple lock must go.§The government has also faced criticism for presenting a partial reversal of planned cuts to universal credit as a boost to working households when in reality the giveaways will be more than offset by other cuts announced in 2015. Hammond said in his autumn statement that 3m households would be better off as as result of , which he described as a ※targeted tax cut worth ?700m from 2021-22§. Frank Field, the Labour chair of the commons work and pensions committee, said only a small fraction of the 3m households would benefit in the short term.※The ?700m value of the taper change by 2021-22 only goes a small way towards offsetting the ?3bn hit to working families caused by previously announced cuts to universal credit work allowances,§ he said.The IFS presented its outlook for living standards as the Treasury and eurosceptic MPs rowed over . In response to , the IFS noted the watchdog＊s growth forecasts were ※noticeably more upbeat than the Bank of England＊s§.※Overall, despite some of the headlines, I think we can count the OBR as having been modestly upbeat relative to some other forecasters,§ said Johnson. ※Even so, the outlook for living standards and for the public finances has deteriorated pretty sharply over the last nine months. Mr Hammond has responded by increasing capital spending and hence increasing borrowing further.§Hammond also defended the OBR on Thursday, saying the government would be wrong to ignore its forecasts and that ※economic forecasting is not a precise science§."															
"The German economy expanded less than expected in the final three months of 2016, dragging down growth in the 19-nation eurozone.Europe＊s largest economy expanded by 0.4% between October and December, according to the . This was lower than the 0.5% forecast by economists.

Despite uncertainty caused by the  vote,  has stayed strong in Britain, although it is expected to slow in coming months as .In Germany, growth in the fourth quarter was driven by government spending, while household consumption increased slightly. Business investment also improved, especially in the construction sector. But growth was held back by trade for the second quarter in a row, with imports outstripping exports.Italy also disappointed, trailing other major European economies with just 0.2% growth and rising unemployment rates. France grew by 0.4% in the fourth quarter while the Netherlands expanded by 0.5%, a slower pace than before. The bright spot among the large economies was Spain with 0.7% growth.At the other end of the growth scale, the Greek economy contracted by 0.4%, while Finland shrank 0.5%, as years of austerity and the sanctions imposed on neighbouring Russia took their toll.Jessica Hinds, European economist at the research consultancy , said: ※Rising energy prices and concerns about euro breakup are likely to cause GDP growth to slow this year.§ She noted that the closely watched German ZEW investor survey dropped markedly in February due to political uncertainty surrounding Brexit, US economic policy and European elections.Several economists are expecting the eurozone＊s 0.4% growth rate to be achieved again in the first quarter of this year but the outlook could darken after that.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at economic data firm , said: ※There are clearly many risks to the outlook further ahead, notably including elections in the Netherlands, France, Germany and possibly Italy, as well as Brexit and Italy＊s banking problems, all of which have the potential to create additional economic uncertainty and subdue growth.※It therefore seems likely that the eurozone will struggle to see 2017 GDP growth match the 1.7% expansion recorded in 2016.§Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING, struck a more positive note: Strengthening domestic demand seems to be the overarching story for the eurozone recovery in recent months as employment growth has accelerated, confidence is well above long-term averages and the housing market is recovering in all eurozone economies. These factors are currently outweighing geopolitical uncertainties, but that does not mean that caution among consumers and businesses becomes stronger in the months ahead as elections come closer.§The Dutch  next month is the first test for Europe＊s populists.

" has told the world＊s biggest companies they need to start paying their taxes and treat their workers more fairly in order to address the concerns of those who feel left behind by globalisation.In a keynote speech to the , the prime minister said governments could not rely on international market forces to deliver prosperity for everyone and action was needed to address the ※deeply felt sense of economic inequality that has emerged in recent years§.May＊s warning that businesses needed to address the issue of executive pay and that market forces alone would not ensure the spread of prosperity to all ensured her first appearance in  was met with only lukewarm applause from her well-heeled audience.The prime minister said that ※across , parties of the far left and the far right§ were seeking to exploit the sense among people on modest incomes that globalisation was not working for them.※I want to set out a manifesto for change that responds to these concerns and shows that the politics of the mainstream can deliver the change people need,§ May said.※Because talk of greater globalisation can make people fearful. For many, it means their jobs being outsourced and wages undercut. It means having to sit back as they watch their communities change around them.§Following the and Donald Trump＊s victory in the US presidential election, responding to growing populist pressures has been a feature of this year＊s Davos. May said both governments and business had to do more to address the concerns of those who felt that ※those who prosper seem to play by a different set of rules§.May said: ※If you＊re just getting by, you don＊t want a government that gets out of the way, you want one that will help you.§Business had to do more to spread the benefits of free trade and globalisation to more people. ※It means playing by the same rules as everyone else when it comes to tax and behaviour,§ she said, ※because in the UK trust in business runs at just 35% among those in the lowest income brackets. And it means putting aside short-term considerations and investing in people and communities for the long term. ※It means businesses paying their fair share of tax, recognising their obligations and duties to their employees and supply chains, and trading in the right way; companies genuinely investing in 每 and becoming part of 每 the communities and nations in which they operate, and abiding by the responsibilities that implies; and all of us taking steps towards addressing executive pay and accountability to shareholders.§May said she rejected the prevailing orthodoxy that the best thing government could do was to get out of the way. Problems would not just solve themselves if business was left to get on with the job.Outlining the government＊s rationale for a more interventionist approach, she said: ※Our strategy is not about propping up failing industries or picking winners, but creating the conditions where winners can emerge and grow. It is about backing those winners all the way to encourage them to invest in the long-term future of Britain.§May said her aim was to deliver jobs and economic growth to every community and corner of the country. ※We can＊t leave all this to international market forces alone, or just rely on an increase in overall prosperity. ※Instead, we have to be practical and proactive 每 in other words, we have to step up and take control 每 to ensure free trade and globalisation work for everyone.§Two days after outlining her approach to , the prime minister adopted an emollient tone towards Britain＊s EU partners, saying that it was ※overwhelmingly and compellingly§ in Britain＊s interests for Europe to succeed.She said Britain had voted with ※determination and quiet resolve§ to leave the EU. ※Let us not underestimate the magnitude of that decision,§ she said. ※Britain must face up to a period of momentous change. It means we must go through a tough negotiation and forge a new role for ourselves in the world. It means accepting that the road ahead will be uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for our country＊s children, and grandchildren too.※We are going to be a confident country that is in control of its destiny once again.§She said Britain was a racially diverse nation, welcomed inward investment and played a leading role in the UN and other global institutions.※By instinct we are a great trading nation,§ May said. ※We seek the freedom to strike trade deals with old friends and new allies around the world.§ The prime minister said talks had already started with Australia, New Zealand and India. But Sir Angus Deaton, the Scottish-born Nobel prize winner, said he was surprised that May didn＊t talk about the customs union, in which EU member states currently impose the same import duties, with no tariffs between them.※That＊s a big deal. Free trade and custom unions are not the same thing, and I think that will hurt Britain,§ Deaton said.※So I haven＊t changed my expectation that in the long run Britain would be a lot better off in the EU than out.§The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the UK must ensure ※privileged access§ to the single market after it leaves the EU.※There＊s got to be a recognition that so-called hard Brexit benefits no one, in relation to London, the UK, or Europe,§ said Khan, who has been meeting business leaders and politicians in Davos.※Businesses that leave London aren＊t going to Paris, Brussels, Madrid, or Frankfurt, they＊re going to New York, Singapore, and Hong Kong.§Dr Paul Sheard, chief global economist at Standard & Poor＊s, says May was making a pitch for Britain to be the ＆lead supporting voice for globalisation＊.※A lot of people have seen Brexit as anti-globalisation, a return to nationalism. She＊s pivoting to saying ＆no, this is about Britain being very global＊,§ Sheard said."															
"The UK is already discussing informal trade deals with at least 12 countries, despite being notionally prevented from striking deals while still a member of the EU, according to Liam Fox＊s international trade department.Fox said ministers, who had visited 55 countries, were ※discussing the possible shape of new agreements once we have left the EU§ and the department was conducting trade audits of key markets in order to identify potential pitfalls.※We need maximum freedom to achieve this, which is why the prime minister was right to rule out full membership of the EU customs union,§ Fox said. ※We have taken our first steps to establishing ourselves as the champions of free trade and taking our place, once again, as one of the greatest open trading nations in the world.In his piece for the Telegraph, Fox said ※dozens of countries§ were preparing to expand their trading links to the UK. ※As the foreign secretary discovered when he visited the United States, the UK is no longer ＆at the back of the queue＊ with our largest single trading partner,§ he wrote.The Telegraph named New Zealand and the Gulf Co-operation Council as two potential new trade alliances being informally investigated. New Zealand＊s prime minister, Bill English, visited the UK last week, and Theresa May recently addressed a meeting of the GCC in Bahrain, attended by all six Gulf nations. On Wednesday, Prof Ted Malloch, tipped to be Donald Trump＊s ambassador to the EU, said he believed a trade deal could be done ※with the right people at the right level, within 90 days§. Malloch told the Guardian he did not think the formal prohibition on a trade deal being sealed until the end of the two-year article 50 process would make a difference to that. ※There＊s nothing to stop a group of people going to a resort in Virginia and hammering this out, which isn＊t a public affair,§ he said. ※We are talking politics here.§In his article, Fox said he was concerned about what he called ※a dangerous tide of protectionism§, an implicit reference to the forthcoming Trump administration in the US. ※Since joining the EU, trade as a percentage of GDP has stagnated in the UK. That is why it is time for Britain to get out into the world and rediscover its role as a great, global, trading nation.§On Thursday, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, repeated warnings that the UK could not expect to have as preferential a trade deal with the EU as a non-member.※Brexit means  and it is not the same to be in or out, and it cannot be better,§ he told BBC Radio 4＊s Today programme. ※We need to reinvent a new kind of relationship, which I hope to be close, balanced and positive but that＊s the outcome, not the start of the negotiations. Nobody can speculate, we need to move step by step.§In the 24 hours since the prime minister＊s speech, where May confirmed the UK would not seek to remain a full member of the single market, key Brussels negotiators told the prime minister she was being over-optimistic in her hope to achieve a quick, clean break from the EU with a trade deal within two years.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission, predicted that §, because Britain would be considered a foreign country to the rest of the EU.Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament＊s Brexit negotiator, said it was an ※illusion to suggest that the UK will be permitted to leave the , but then be free to opt back into the best parts of the European project, for example by asking for zero tariffs from the single market, without accepting the obligations that come with it§."															
"he world is getting smaller. That is the unbidden meme of our generation, thanks to the juggernaut of growth unleashed by an outpouring of global bodies, free trade agreements, technology and international capital. Every business and person now has a global reach and audience. Today＊s paradigm is globalisation and free trade is its evangelical mantra.  But this narrative has become worn and no longer fits the facts. In recent months, there has been a backlash, accompanied by emotive talk about the reversal of globalisation and the battle for society＊s future. .Donald Trump and Theresa May are not flagbearers in the distance, they are catapults battering at the walls. underlines the new reality we inhabit, as does the European Union＊s recent troubles closing a trade agreement with Canada thanks to  obstinance. Today, we have a new meme 每 deglobalisation 每 as people turn their backs on an interconnected world economy and societies turn iconoclastic.  It is not for the first time.  may be defined as when trade across nations is growing faster than GDP. People interact more, transact more and create more wealth. Deglobalisation is the alternate state where trade grows less than GDP. Countries focus inwards, trade declines as a proportion of GDP and growth shrinks. A clear cycle of the two emerges over history. This is more than a sense of ennui. Global trade today is  每 hardly a barometer of rude global health. After their peak in January 2015, global exports fell -1.6% by the end of August 2016. The blame lies not with commodity price falls, but shifts in trade policy. . Restrictive trade measures have outstripped liberalising measures three to one this year and increased by almost five times since 2009, as policymakers try to circumvent the WTO. Meanwhile, the  over recent years has hit global lending, as banks retreat from peripheral to core domestic activities, cutting vital credit flows through key arteries.  All of this preceded the populist deluge of 2016 and, indeed, contributed as policymakers myopically prioritised stability over social cohesion, ignoring the lessons of the past.  But globally, politicians are now fast realigning to shifting public moods. A year ago, to imagine a world where the major western leaders included Trump, the Brexit brigade and Marine Le Pen was the province of satire. Today, we are two-thirds there. Their ascendancy has shifted the political debate towards nativism in a hauntingly familiar nationalist narrative, as others follow suit.  Our new politics are not leftwing or rightwing, merely whether you are in this world or out of it. Even defenders of globalisation are falling into the same trap. By demonising those that voted against and not providing alternative options, they cling tighter to those that confirm and affirm their beliefs. That is still nativism of a different sort and still the politics of division, not unity.  This is Deglobalisation 2.0.  Monetary policies such as quantitative easing and its newborn sibling, fiscal easing, cannot change this dynamic. Absent structural change, their cumulative corrosive impact on savings and fillip to global debt ensure a limited runway and only inflame the rhetoric of disenfranchisement. Meanwhile, divorces are turning ugly as emotions override reason, viz the talk of Brexit fees and anti-dumping levies, the metaphorical Kristallnacht of populist victors like May and Trump as they struggle for coherence, and emerging divisions between central banks and politicians, to name but a few. Democracy is fast turning to kakistocracy 每 government by the least qualified leaders. Globalisation is transmuting to nationalism. The effects are well documented in history 每 autarky, economic naivety, protectionism and a rush to grab what remains of the pie, only to trample it underfoot.  Me first always ends in me last. The world is still getting smaller, but just in our minds and horizons now, and thoughtless we risk becoming all the poorer for it. "															
															
"Retailers have been enjoying their strongest sales growth in more than a year amid signs from Britain＊s leading employers＊ organisation of a pre-Christmas consumer spending spree.The latest health check of high street and online activity from the  found that sales so far in December beat expectations, were above average for the time of year, and led to retailers beefing up their orders to suppliers.But the CBI＊s distributive trades survey also found that retailers expect the pace of growth to slacken in early 2017 when the  pushes up inflation and reduces living standards.The survey of 112 retailers reported 51% as saying sales were higher than a year ago while 16% said they were lower. The resulting balance of +35 points was up on the +26 points recorded in November and the highest since September 2015.After plunging in the immediate aftermath of the referendum in June, the CBI survey has rebounded strongly from October onwards. The employers＊ organisation said sales growth had been broadly based, with clothes stores and supermarkets performing especially strongly.Ben Jones, CBI principal economist, said: ※It＊s encouraging to see retailers reporting another month of healthy sales growth leading up to the festive season, which rounds off a fairly solid quarter.※While we still expect to see decent growth in the near term, the pressures on retail activity are likely to increase during 2017, as the impact of sterling＊s depreciation feeds through.※With higher inflation beginning to weigh on households＊ purchasing power, consumption patterns are likely to shift, creating winners and losers across the retail landscape.§James Knightley, senior economist at ING, said the CBI suggested ※consumer spending will again make a big contribution to 4Q GDP growth. It also again highlights the resilience of the UK economy despite the Brexit uncertainty.§Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the survey covered a three-week period including Black Friday in November, a day when many retailers offered bargains to encourage early Christmas shopping, and the first two weeks of December.Noting the caution expressed about the outlook for 2017, Archer added: ※Retailers will certainly be hoping that consumers＊ willingness to spend holds up over the final part of the vital Christmas shopping period and into the new year.§"															
"The Italian government is laying the groundwork for a potential 20bn rescue of the country＊s most troubled banks, including Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS).A government statement issued late on Monday night said that the prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, had convened a cabinet meeting to request the funds from parliament.The statement said: ※[It] could be necessary to adopt measures with the aim of protecting savers if there were risks in the financial sector§. The vote in parliament could happen as soon as Wednesday, according to the Italian news agency Ansa.The news signals that a multi-billion euro refinancing of MPS could occur within days. Seven other banks that are struggling under the weight of bad loans amounting to billions of euros may also require government recapitalisation.The cabinet meeting was convened just hours after MPS, the world＊s oldest bank, formally launched a desperate attempt to stave off government rescue and raise 5bn (?4.2bn) from private investors. It has less than 10 days to secure private funding before the government intervenes.The bank＊s shares fell 8.5% on Monday as it launched a share offering to institutional and retail investors. This measure runs alongside a plan to ask bondholders to swap their investments for shares, and a restructuring of 28bn of bad loans to clean up its balance sheet.However, with the clock ticking on wooing private-sector investors to support the fundraising, one of the key backers of the bank＊s planexpressed doubts.MPS announced that Quaestio, which manages the government-orchestrated bailout fund Altante, is concerned about the terms of a loan to support the parcelling-off of bad debts.The move could jeopardise the entire capital-bolstering exercise, which must be completed by the end of the year because of a deadline imposed by the European Central Bank  每 a financial health check 每 in results published in July. MPS said: ※If it is not possible for the bank to reach an agreement with Quaestio to resolve the issues that it has raised, the transaction would not be able to be completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the authorisation of the European Central Bank which provides for the transaction to be completed by 31 December 2016.§The bank has become the focus of fears about the Italian banking system, which is saddled with 360bn of bad debts amassed in recent years during a period of economic weakness. UniCredit, Italy＊s biggest bank, and axe 11% of the workforce.Those concerns have mounted after Italy＊s referendum on constitutional reform earlier this month led to , creating fresh political turmoil in the midst of MPS＊s attempts to attract major investors to its fundraising.This fuelled fears that the Italian government would have to step in to help save the country＊s third biggest bank in a move that could force thousands of private investors, who hold 2.1bn worth of bonds, to take losses. New EU rules intended to protect taxpayers from bailing out banks mean that bondholders must take a hit before government money can be used.The  act as backstop to MPS, although last week Rome insisted the bank would be able to raise the funds through the markets.The announcement that Quaestio had concerns came just hours after the cash call on shareholders was announced. MPS said the body had, on 17 December, ※expressed strong reservations in relation to the term sheet§ of the loan. MPS said it was in talks with Quaestio 每 which runs the 4.25bn Atlante backstop fund named after the Titan in Greek mythology who was condemned to hold up the sky 每 to try to resolve the matter.Atlante is backed by the Italian banking system: Unicredit pumped in 1bn to the fund, as did Intesa Sanpaola. Carlo Messina, chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, was quoted as saying that the MPS deal should go ahead and that a decision would be reached by Tuesday at the latest.In the meantime, the share offer for institutional investors closes on Thursday, while retail investors have to decide whether to buy shares by Wednesday. The Thursday deadline has sparked speculation that the Italian government might step in before the end of the week if it emerges that investors have failed to buy shares.If the Italian government had to stump up cash it would constitute a ※precautionary recapitalisation§ because the bank holds enough capital to meet current regulatory minimums."															
"f Tony Blair is the answer, then the question is high on illicit substances. He is reported to be  to examine why the ※centre left§ has been overwhelmed by the forces of populism. It＊s as though he＊s a spectator, a passive commentator, a bystander, rather than a leading contributor to this age of political calamity. Someone who should be in the dock is electing himself chief prosecutor.Just consider this. In July,  for his role in a war that cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of human beings, including 179 British service personnel, and which contributed to the rise of fanatical Islamist terrorism. That＊s before we even mention Blair＊s . If normal rules applied to men of power, he would retire from active political life in disgrace. And yet, less than five months later, here he is, plotting a return to the frontline of politics. His career is like the T-1000 at the end of Terminator 2: it just will not die. If Blair wants material for his vanity project 每 ※why are people so disillusioned with establishment politics?§ 每 then how about starting with politicians who face no penalties for their colossal misdeeds, and continue to exert huge power and influence without any apparent shame or even penitence?Tony Blair is one of the most loathed politicians in Britain. His small but determined fanclub might not like this, they might believe it is unfair and the British public are all suffering from some form of mass delusion or false consciousness that prevents them from seeing his greatness, but there it is anyway. Even before the Chilcot report was published,  said they would never forgive him. ※And the reason this country＊s full of people who are so cynical about politicians is down to Tony Blair,§ as  tell focus groups.When Blair became prime minister in 1997, social democratic parties under ※centrist§ leadership such as Lionel Jospin in France and Gerhard Schr?der in Germany were on the march across western Europe. The Clintons were in the White House. This was a different era, and it is gone. This form of politics had its last hurrah earlier this month when it was defeated by an unhinged proto-fascist in the United States. Its USP was electability: you may trade some principles, but at least you＊ll get elected. Donald Trump saw that off. Hillary Clinton was the only bulwark against the calamity of his presidency, but her establishment ※centrism§, in part, doomed her.Perhaps Blair thinks that the plight of Europe＊s centre-left parties can be explained by their abandonment of his form of politics. Why, then, does  still leave it one of the best-polling social democratic parties in Europe? Why are the German Social Democrats 每 whose leader espouses , Blairite-type politics 每 ?I am not one of those who overlooks the achievements of the 1997-2010 Labour governments such as the minimum wage, public investment, and LGBT rights. But nobody can explain Britain＊s current political situation without referring back to other aspects of Blairism. First, the  war, without which Jeremy Corbyn would almost certainly not be Labour leader, and which provoked fury across the political spectrum. Second, a pact with Lucifer, otherwise known as an improperly regulated financial sector, which left Britain exposed to a financial calamity that still defines political life. Third, mass immigration without making the case for it, and without addressing economic grievances such as the lack of housing or secure jobs. Fourth, the failure to reverse the economic damage suffered by many former industrial areas, many of which decisively voted for Brexit.Yes, the new left in the US and across Europe has serious questions to answer. But while I＊m more than willing to ask , there is still precious little evidence that proponents of ※centrism§ have any interest in self-reflection. They believe they are in the political wasteland not because of their own faults, but because . And so they wheel out one of the most loathed men in British politics to try to save themselves. It is baffling, disturbing, and more than a little bit sad."															
"he US president-elect, , campaigned in part on a proposal to cut taxes dramatically for those with high incomes, a group whose members often have elite educations as well. And yet his most enthusiastic support tended to come from those with average and stagnating incomes and low levels of education. What gives?Trump＊s victory clearly appears to stem from a sense of economic powerlessness, or a fear of losing power, among his supporters. To them, his simple slogan, ※make America great again,§ sounds like ※make  great again§. Economic power will be given to the multitudes, without taking anything away from the already successful.Those on the downside of rising economic inequality generally do not want government policies that look like handouts. They typically do not want the government to make the tax system more progressive, to impose punishing taxes on the rich, in order to give the money to them. Redistribution feels demeaning. It feels like being labeled a failure. It feels unstable. It feels like being trapped in a relationship of dependency, one that might collapse at any moment.The desperately poor may accept handouts, because they feel they have to. For those who consider themselves at least middle class, however, anything that smacks of a handout is not desired. Instead, they . They want to be in control of their economic lives.In the 20th century, communists politicised economic inequality, but they made sure their agenda could in no way be interpreted as creating alms or charity for the less successful. It was fundamentally important that communists take power by a revolution, in which workers unite, take action and feel empowered.Trump supporters call his triumph a revolution, too, though the violence 每 at least by the campaign itself 每 was limited to name-calling and insults. It was still nasty enough, apparently, to inspire those of his supporters who interpret aggressiveness as evidence of power.It is certainly not just in the US that people desire a sense of vocational accomplishment, rather than simply money to live on. In no country does it feel generally right to respond to rising economic inequality by imposing heavy taxes on the rich and transferring the money to others. That feels like changing the rules of the game after it has been played.In their recent book , Kenneth Scheve of Stanford and David Stasavage of New York University use two centuries of data on tax rates and on income inequality to examine outcomes in 20 countries. They found that there was little or no tendency for governments to make taxes more progressive when pretax inequality increased.Katherine Cramer, author of , gained some insight into this outcome in Wisconsin, where, like Trump, the state＊s governor, Scott Walker, has been popular among working-class voters. After he was elected in 2010, Walker cut taxes on higher incomes, refused to raise the state minimum wage above the federally-mandated minimum, and rejected the insurance exchanges created by Barack Obama＊s signature 2010 healthcare reform, which would benefit lower-income people. Instead, Walker promised measures that would take power away from labor unions, actions that usually are perceived as likely to lower working-class incomes.Cramer interviewed rural working-class voters in Wisconsin, trying to understand why they supported Walker. Her interviewees stressed their rural values and commitment to hard work, which have been a source of personal pride and identity. But they also stressed their sense of powerlessness against those perceived as unfairly advantaged. She concluded that their support for Walker, amid evidence of economic decline, reflected their extreme anger and resentment toward privileged people in big cities, who, before Walker, had ignored them, except to tax them. And their taxes went, in part, to pay for government employees＊ health insurance and pension plans, benefits that they themselves often could not afford. They wanted power and recognition, which Walker seemed to offer them.Such voters are also almost certainly anxious about the effect of rapidly rising information technology on jobs and incomes. Economically successful people today tend to be those who are technologically savvy, not those living in rural Wisconsin or rural anywhere. These working-class voters feel a loss of economic optimism, but admiring their own people and upholding their values, they want to stay where they are.Trump speaks these voters＊ language; but his proposals to date do not seem to address the underlying shift in power. He stresses cutting domestic taxes, which he asserts will unleash a new flurry of entrepreneurism, and renegotiating trade deals in a protectionist direction to keep jobs in the US. Such policies, however, are unlikely to shift economic power to those who have been relatively less successful. On the contrary, entrepreneurs may develop even more clever ways to replace jobs with computers and robots, and protectionism may generate retaliation by trading partners, political instability and ultimately possibly even hot wars.To satisfy his voters, Trump must find ways to redistribute power over income, not just income itself, and not just by taxing and spending. He has expressed only limited ideas here, like subsidising school choice to improve education. But powerful economic forces such as technological innovation and lower global transportation costs have been the main drivers of increasing inequality in many countries. Trump can＊t change this fact.If those who lack the skills that today＊s economy demands refuse redistribution, it is hard to see how Trump will make them better off. The Trump revolution, as it has been presented so far, seems highly unlikely to deliver what his : an increase in workers＊ economic power."															
"he first duty of an MP is to do what he [or she] thinks ＃ is right and necessary for the honour and safety of Great Britain. His second duty is to his constituents, of whom he is the representative but not the delegate.§These are the wise words of Sir Winston Churchill, ignored by the majority of our elected representatives in last week＊s vote on the  bill.In his magnificent contribution to the debate 每 a speech of which Churchill himself would have been proud 每 the veteran Conservative statesman Kenneth Clarke stated that, in opposing Brexit, his conscience was clear, but ※when we see what unfolds after we leave the EU, I hope the consciences of other members of parliament remain equally content§.He did not go as far as to quote Hamlet 每 ※thus conscience does make cowards of us all§ 每 but I could not help thinking that, if not cowardice, the word ※pusillanimity§ might not have been far from his mind with regard to the position of his colleagues.Consider: it is widely acknowledged in Westminster that the vast majority of members of both houses of parliament regard Brexit as little short of national madness. Yet only one Tory 每 namely Clarke himself 每 52 Labour MPs and a small band of Liberals had the guts to vote against triggering article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. : ※I have never seen anything as mad or chaotic as this.§In another memorable observation, the : ※What sane country would sever its ties to its most important trading partners and its strategic position in its continental councils over a feeling that its own government agrees is erroneous?§ The feeling being the mistaken belief that parliament has not been sovereign throughout our membership of the EU, which it has and still is, as last week＊s potentially catastrophic vote reminds us.Alas, the mistaken belief that parliament had sacrificed sovereignty to Brussels when we joined the EU was undoubtedly one of the key factors that influenced the outcome of the referendum 每 midsummer madness on midsummer＊s eve.It is bad enough that MPs representing constituencies that voted Leave opted to be delegates, and not representatives exercising their own judgment. Bad enough but understandable up to a point. What seems inexcusable is the way that so many MPs representing strong Remain constituencies also voted to trigger article 50.The lame excuse propounded by Remain MPs signing up for Brexit is, essentially, that ※the people have spoken, and it would be undemocratic to ignore the will of the people§. But the truth is that they are ignoring the will of half of the people on the official count and a majority of the people when you consider that only 37% of the electorate actually voted for Brexit.The philosopher AC Grayling has  that there was an ※artificially restricted franchise ※on 23 June for what was, in any case, supposed to be an ※advisory§ referendum: unlike the case with the Scottish referendum, ※we know that 16-17-year-olds were denied a vote, that a large class of expatriates was denied a vote, and that EU citizens living, working and paying their taxes in the UK were denied a vote§.Theresa May has made a Faustian pact with the devil of Ukip, under which she is evidently prepared to aggravate the already serious problems of our economy 每 low productivity, austerity, and pressures on the NHS, to name but three 每 by leaving the customs union and the single market in order to pay lip service to control of immigration.I say lip service because there was not much sign that she was very successful in this regard when she had sovereignty over immigration during her long years as home secretary. Nor is there any convincing evidence that reducing immigration from the rest of the EU will calm the ※protest voters§ who were the swing element behind the narrow victory for the Leave campaign. On the contrary: making the country poorer is a funny way of going about assuaging such anger.Moreover, not only are our overstretched hospitals vitally dependent on migrant staff in order to function at all: so are our manufacturers and services. Thus, as Jeremy Goring, one of our leading hoteliers, recently said: ※We never turn away British people for jobs. It doesn＊t happen. It＊s a cheap headline that is simply not true. Restricting foreigners will not mean more jobs for locals.§ Again, Nick Houghton, managing director of a Nottingham food manufacturing company, said: ※There isn＊t a pool of unemployed workers sitting there waiting for the EU workers to go back, ready and able to take up these jobs.§That the economy has performed somewhat better than expected since the referendum is irrelevant: Brexit hasn＊t happened yet. And it is all very well saying there should be another vote when the terms of departure are known, but much of the damage, in the shape of cancelled investment and diversion of economic activity to continental Europe, will already have been done.I am told that when those two old Bullingdon Club playmates met on neutral ground after the referendum, the foreign secretary said to David Cameron: ※I ****** up, didn＊t I?§Given his popularity at the time, Boris Johnson might well have swung the result the other way. As it is, after spending years trying to join the EU in order to arrest our nation＊s relative economic decline, unless our rulers experience a Damascene conversion, we are all set to throw away membership of one of the world＊s major markets in order to resume our relative economic decline."															
															
"Donald Trump＊s presidency poses a risk to the global economy, a leading credit ratings agency has warned, highlighting his unpredictability, his administration＊s aggressive tone and his break with established ※norms§ in international relations.Less than a month into a presidency characterised by frequent Twitter tirades and , Fitch said Trump posed a threat to global economic conditions. is one of three big ratings agencies that assign credit scores to governments based on their perceived ability to repay debts. It said in Friday＊s strongly worded statement that the new US administration could damage those scores, known as sovereign ratings.※The Trump administration represents a risk to international economic conditions and global sovereign credit fundamentals,§ it said.※US policy predictability has diminished, with established international communication channels and relationship norms being set aside and raising the prospect of sudden, unanticipated changes in US policies with potential global implications.§Key risks, from Fitch＊s perspective, included possible disruptions to trade relations, limits on migration that affect the amount of money foreign workers in the US send home, and ※confrontational exchanges§ between policymakers that could spark swings in currencies and other financial markets.※The materialisation of these risks would provide an unfavourable backdrop for economic growth, putting pressure on public finances that may have rating implications for some sovereigns,§ the ratings agency added.It joined other commentators in  from Trump＊s planned infrastructure spending, his plans to cut red tape and promised tax cuts. Outlining a brighter scenario, Fitch said: ※One interpretation of current events is that, after an early flurry of disruptive change to establish a fundamental reorientation of policy direction and intent, the administration will settle in, embracing a consistent business- and trade-friendly framework that leverages these aspects of its economic programme, with favourable international spillovers.§But it went on to play down that prospect. ※In Fitch＊s view, the present balance of risks points toward a less benign global outcome. The administration has abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, confirmed a pending renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, rebuked US companies that invest abroad, while threatening financial penalties for companies that do so, and accused a number of countries of manipulating exchange rates to the US＊s disadvantage.§The full impact of those moves would not be known for some time and things could yet change, it conceded. ※But the aggressive tone of some administration rhetoric does not portend an easy period of negotiation ahead, nor does it suggest there is much scope for compromise.§The countries whose credit ratings were most at risk were those with close economic and financial ties with the US which Trump＊s administration felt had some kind of unfair advantage, Fitch said.※Canada, China, Germany, Japan and Mexico have been identified explicitly by the administration as having trade arrangements or exchange rate policies that warrant attention, but the list is unlikely to end there,§ it said.Fitch also highlighted that the US had the world＊s largest immigrant population and said tighter controls and possible deportations, therefore, risked having wide economic repercussions. Fitch＊s concerns centre on the issue of ※remittance flows§, the money foreign workers send to individuals in their home countries, which in the US include Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua.The agency also warned of risks to countries that have benefited from investment by US firms and where some of the money has helped fund industries in those countries that export back to America. Fitch felt those countries could get singled out by the Trump administration for punitive trade measures. It signalled the UK was one such country, including it on a list of those with the highest stock of US investment in manufacturing along with Canada, Germany and Mexico.Fitch＊s intervention comes after warnings from the leading thinktank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that , stoking inflation and harming living standards."															
															
"s  fills his cabinet, what have we learned about the likely direction and impact of his administration＊s economic policy?To be sure, enormous uncertainties remain. As in many other areas, Trump＊s promises and statements on economic policy have been inconsistent. While he routinely accuses others of lying, many of his economic assertions and promises 每 indeed, his entire view of governance 每 seem worthy of Nazi Germany＊s ※big lie§ propagandists.Trump will take charge of an economy on a strongly upward trend, with  growing at an impressive annual rate of 3.2% and  at 4.6% in November. By contrast, when Barack Obama took over in 2009, he inherited from George W Bush an economy sinking into a deep recession. And, like Bush, Trump is yet another Republican president who will assume office despite losing the popular vote, only to pretend that he has a mandate to undertake extremist policies.The only way Trump will square his promises of higher infrastructure and defence spending with large tax cuts and deficit reduction is a heavy dose of what used to be called voodoo economics. Decades of ※cutting the fat§ in government has left little to cut:  as a percentage of the population is lower today than it was in the era of small government under Ronald Reagan about 30 years ago.With so many former military officers serving in Trump＊s cabinet or as advisers, even as Trump cozies up to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and anchors an informal alliance of dictators and authoritarians around the world, it is likely that the US will spend more money on weapons that don＊t work to use against enemies that don＊t exist. If Trump＊s health secretary succeeds in undoing the careful balancing act that underlies Obamacare, either costs will rise or services will deteriorate 每 most likely both.During the campaign, Trump promised to get tough on executives who outsource American jobs. He is now holding up the news that the home heating and air-conditioning manufacturer Carrier will keep around 800 jobs in my home state of Indiana as proof that his approach works. Yet the deal will cost taxpayers $7m, and still allow Carrier to outsource 1,300 jobs to Mexico. This is not a sound industrial or economic policy, and it will do nothing to help raise wages or create good jobs across the country. It is an open invitation for a shakedown of the government by corporate executives seeking handouts.Similarly, the increase in infrastructure spending is likely to be accomplished through tax credits, which will help hedge funds, but not America＊s balance sheet: such programmes＊ long track record shows that they deliver little value for money. The cost to the public will be especially high in an era when the government can borrow at near-zero interest rates. If these private-public partnerships are like those elsewhere, the government will assume the risks, and the hedge funds will assume the profits.The debate just eight years ago about ※shovel-ready§ infrastructure seems to be a distant memory. If Trump chooses shovel-ready projects, the long-term impact on productivity will be minimal; if he chooses real infrastructure, the short-term impact on economic growth will be minimal. And back-loaded stimulus has its own problems, unless it is managed extremely carefully.If Trump＊s pick for US treasury secretary, , is like others from his industry, the expertise he will bring to the job will be in tax avoidance, not constructing a well-designed tax system. The ※good§ news is that tax reform was inevitable, and was likely to be undertaken by Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and his staff 每 giving the rich the less progressive, more capital-friendly tax system that Republicans have long sought. With the abolition of the estate tax, the Republicans would finally realise their long-held ambition of creating a dynastic plutocracy 每 a far cry from the ※equality of opportunity§ maxim the party once trumpeted.Large tax cuts and large expenditure increases inevitably lead to large deficits. Reconciling this with Trump＊s promise to reduce the deficit will probably entail a return to Reagan-era magical thinking: despite decades of proof to the contrary, time the stimulus to the economy brought by tax cuts for the rich will be so large that tax revenues will actually increase.This story doesn＊t end well for Trump＊s angry, displaced Rust Belt voters. Unhinged budgetary policies will induce the US Federal Reserve to normalise interest rates faster. Some see incipient inflation (given the low unemployment rate); some believe the long period of ultra-low interest rates has distorted capital markets; and some want to ※replenish their ammunition§, so that the Fed can lower interest rates should the economy slow down again.Trump has argued that the Fed should raise interest rates. The Fed, which took the first step toward normalisation in early December, will almost certainly deliver 每 and Trump will soon regret what he wished for. There＊s a good chance that the monetary contraction will outweigh the fiscal stimulus, curbing the Obama growth spurt currently underway. Higher interest rates will undercut construction jobs and increase the value of the dollar, leading to larger trade deficits and fewer manufacturing jobs 每 just the opposite of what Trump promised. Meanwhile, his tax policies will be of limited benefit to middle-class and working families 每 and will be more than offset by cutbacks in health care, education, and social programmes.If Trump starts a trade war 每 by, say, following through on his vow to impose a 45% tariff on imports from China and to build a wall on the US border with Mexico 每 the economic impact will be even more severe. Trump＊s cabinet of billionaires could continue to buy their Gucci handbags and $10,000 Ivanka bracelets, but ordinary Americans＊ cost of living would increase substantially; and without components from Mexico and elsewhere, manufacturing jobs would become even scarcer.To be sure, a few new jobs will be created, mainly in the lobbying shops along K Street in Washington, DC, as Trump refills the swamp that he promised to drain. Indeed, America＊s bog of legal corruption is likely to reach a depth not seen since Warren Harding＊s administration in the 1920s.And there really is no silver lining to the cloud that now hangs over the US and the world. As bad as his administration will be for America＊s economy and workers, its policies on climate change, human rights, the media, and ensuring peace and security are likely to be no less damaging for everyone else."															
"The US  on Wednesday raised interest rates for the first time in a year, and only the second time since the 2008 financial crisis. The US central bank also predicted three further rates increase in 2017, up from previous expectations of two rate hikes.Janet Yellen, the  chairwoman, said ※growth is a touch stronger, unemployment is a shade lower§ as she announced a 0.25% increase in the benchmark rate to 0.50-0.75%.It is the first time rates have been raised since December 2015 when the benchmark rate was lifted from near-zero for seven years since the crisis. ※My colleagues and I are recognizing the considerable progress the economy has made towards our dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability,§ Yellen said. ※We expect that the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further, and inflation rising to 2% over the next couple of years.§Yellen also set out a path of faster pace of rate increases next year than previously expected. The rate setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said it expected to raise short-term rates by another 0.75% percentage points next year 每 probably in three separate quarter-point moves 每 up from a previously predicted 2017 increase of 0.5%. ※The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2% inflation,§ the FOMC . The unanimous decision to raise rates, the first time in months that the 10 members of FOMC had all agreed on policy, came at the end of the committee＊s first rate-setting meeting since the election of Donald Trump as America＊s next president. The statement made no mention of the effect of Trump＊s policies on the country＊s economic prospects. But experts have said Trump＊s plans for  and huge infrastructure investment could spur the economic recovery. US stock markets, which soared to record highs following Trump＊s victory, fell slightly following the decision, which had been widely expected by traders and economists. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was hovering at 19,954 points 每 a more than 9% increase since the 8 November election. Trump has repeatedly criticised Yellen for not raising interest rates fast enough, which he said had created a ※false economy§ and delayed the recovery, and called for her to be replaced. In September, he said Yellen ※should be ashamed of herself§. ※I used to hope that the Fed was independent,§ he said. ※And the Fed is obviously not independent. It＊s obviously not even close to being independent.§Trump had said he is unlikely to nominate Yellen to continue as Fed chief when her term expires in early 2018. Yellen has refused to leave before the end of her term. Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING, said: ※The big takeaway from this meeting was the increase in the pace of tightening signaled for 2017. Where two rate hikes of 25bp were signaled in the previous guidance, there are now three hikes signaled. ※Despite this, the other forecast variables are little changed. Probably most noteworthy is the small 0.1 percentage point increase in 2017 GDP growth, now expected to be 2.1%, but no further increase is expected in 2018, which is unchanged at 2.0%. The 2019 GDP forecast is also only slightly higher at 1.9% (1.8% previously). There is not much concession in these growth forecasts to expectations of big fiscal stimulus from a Trump administration and our own forecasts are considerably higher 每 closer to 3% in both years.§Jeremy Cook, chief economist at international payments company World First, said: ※The Federal Reserve found enough strength in the  to hike 25 basis points for the first time this year. This means basically nothing.§※What matters is that the expectations shown in the dot plot charts show a Federal Reserve that is supremely uncertain as to the path of US economy moves into 2017. They＊ve noted the strength in inflation and the jobs market but this is a central bank eager to know what kind of administration they will have to work with. Until then there was little chance of them basing policy on the pronouncements of someone who has a casual relationship with consistency.§※Our eyes now move back to the politics in the United States and the rebuttal of the Fed＊s decision from the president-elect via his Twitter account.§Rates had been expected to be raised earlier this year, but the decision was delayed by concerns about a slowdown in the Chinese economy, Brexit and the unpredictable US presidential election. The Fed predicted economic growth reaching 1.9% this year, slightly above its forecast in September. However, it kept its long-term estimate for economic growth at 1.8%, far below the 4% pace that Trump promises to deliver via a program of deregulation, tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The committee expects little improvement in the unemployment rate from the current rate of 4.6%. The rate hike was widely expected with all 120 economists polled by Reuters expecting an interest rates increase. "															
"he year 2017 will mark the 40th anniversary of the publication of John Kenneth Galbraith＊s . Forty years is a long time, but it is worth looking back and reminding ourselves of how much he and his readers had to be uncertain about.In 1977, as Galbraith was writing, the world was still reeling from the effects of the first Opec oil-price shock and wondering whether another one was in the pipeline (as it were). The US was confronting slowing growth and accelerating inflation, or stagflation, a novel problem that raised questions about policymakers＊ competence and the adequacy of their economic models. Meanwhile, efforts to rebuild the Bretton Woods international monetary system had collapsed, casting a shadow over prospects for international trade and global economic growth.For all these reasons, the golden age of stability and predictability that was the third quarter of the 20th century seemed to have abruptly drawn to a close, to be succeeded by a period of greatly heightened uncertainty.That＊s how things looked in 1977, anyway. Viewed from the perspective of 2017, however, the uncertainty of 1977 seems almost enviable. In 1977, there was no President-elect Donald Trump. Jimmy Carter may not go down in history as one of the best US presidents, but he did not threaten actions that placed the entire global system at risk. He did not turn his back on America＊s international commitments such as Nato and the World Trade Organisation.Nor did Carter go to war with the Federal Reserve or pack its board with sympathetic appointees willing to sacrifice sound money to his re-election prospects. On the contrary, he appointed Paul Volcker, a towering pillar of monetary stability, as chairman of the board of governors. And although Carter did not succeed in balancing the federal budget, he didn＊t blow it up, either.Whether Trump slaps a tariff on Chinese goods, repudiates Nafta, packs the Federal Reserve board, or undermines fiscal sustainability remains to be seen. Conceivable outcomes range from mildly reassuring to utterly catastrophic. Who knows what will happen? By today＊s standards, Carter was the embodiment of predictability.In 1977, moreover, the prospects for European integration were rosy. Denmark, Ireland, and, most notably, the UK had recently joined a rapidly growing European Community. The EC was attracting members, not losing them. It was a club that countries sought to join precisely in order to achieve faster economic growth.Moreover, to buttress its common market, the EC had just established a regional monetary system, the suggestively named . While this was far from a perfect monetary system, it had one very positive attribute: countries could leave in hard economic times, and rejoin if and when the outlook brightened.In 2017, in contrast,  will continue to cast a dark cloud of uncertainty over the EU. How those negotiations will proceed and how long they will take are anyone＊s guess. Moreover, the main questions raised by Britain＊s decision to leave 每 whether other countries will follow and, indeed, whether the EU itself has a future 每 remain far from resolved.Meanwhile, Europe＊s monetary house remains half built. The eurozone is neither appealing enough to attract additional members nor flexible enough to grant troubled incumbents a temporary holiday, in the manner of the currency snake. The euro will likely survive the year, inertia being what it is. Beyond that, it is difficult to say.In 1977, uncertainties emanating from emerging markets were not on commentators＊ radar. Developing countries in Latin America and east Asia were growing, although they depended increasingly on a drip feed of foreign loans from money-centre banks. China, still largely cut off from the world, did not figure in this discussion. And even if something went wrong in the developing world, the countries were simply too small to drag down the global economy.The situation today couldn＊t be more different. What happens in China, Brazil or Turkey doesn＊t stay in China, Brazil or Turkey. On the contrary, developments in these countries have first-order implications for the world economy, given how emerging markets have accounted for the majority of  in recent years. China has an unmanageable corporate-debt problem and a government whose commitment to restructuring the economy is uncertain. Turkey has a massive , an erratic president and an unstable geopolitical neighbourhood. And if political scandals were export goods, Brazil would have a clear comparative advantage.Although The Age of Uncertainty was about much more than the year 1977, it captured the tenor of the times. But if Galbraith were writing the same book in 2017, he probably would call the 1970s The Age of Assurance."															
"So, Kitchen Disco, the children＊s book by David Cameron＊s former speechwriter Clare Foges, with Al Murphy, was written ※in a day during a holiday in Gambia after ＆a lovely daydream about fruit jumping out of the bowl and dancing in a nightclub＊§ (, Review, 19 November). While I am glad that this engaging book has been given to thousands of reception-age children by BookTrust for their enjoyment, it is naive to claim that ※every child has a kitchen, so it is an inclusive story§. The austerity agenda of Foges＊ former employer continues to create poverty and homelessness on a scale meaning that thousands of children living in hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation do not have their own kitchens, or fruit, or holidays. That is a story worth telling."															
"Theresa May＊s attempt to reclaim control of UK borders after  could reduce annual migration from the EU by just 50,000 每 one-sixth of the current overall annual figure, according to new research.The projection of a ※vanishingly small reduction§ is one of the first attempts to estimate how likely labour market demand, and the government＊s planned new controls, could reduce the number of migrants coming to the UK. Reduction in immigrant numbers has been repeatedly cited in polls as the chief reason voters backed leaving the .The report by a new thinktank, Global Future, shows total net immigration, which at the latest official estimate was 335,000 in the year to June 2016, could be expected to fall by no more than 15%, to 285,000 a year. Future free trade deals with non-EU countries suggests even this reduction could be wiped out. Liam Fox, the international trade minister, accepted last week he did not know of any new free trade deal that did not also include liberalisation of migration rules between the two countries signing such agreements.  and India have already indicated they will seek preferential access for their workers as part of a free trade deal. The government has so far refused to produce its own estimate of the cut in migration from Brexit, or precisely how new controls will operate. But the report＊s estimates, which were formulated by breaking down the different elements of net migration from the EU and examining government commitments to retain skilled labour, students and some seasonal work, represents one of most thorough projections to date. The report argues: ※While ending freedom of movement is psychologically appealing to those who want a sense of control of our borders, the reality is such a move would create more the illusion of control. People looking for substantial reductions are likely to be disappointed with the eventual figure of 50,000 or less.§The thinktank has won the backing of the Sainsbury＊s chief executive Mike Coupe, as well as Liberal Democrat leader .Its director, Gurnek Bains, said: ※The extent to which this impact is worth the myriad of economic and political problems that pulling out of free movement would create needs to be reflected upon. In addition, promising more than can be delivered on migration risks creating a firestorm in the future.§ Farron said: ※In return for this self-inflicted wound it is unlikely that the Conservative Brexit government will be able to deliver its promise of dramatically reduced immigration.§The report starts with the premise that the current true net immigration figure from Europe is 182,700 annually, representing the maximum amount of reduction possible from leaving the EU out of a total immigration figure of 335,000. The estimates suggest net migration of EU students will be unchanged post-Brexit, even though the mix of EU and non-EU students may shift. It also suggests the currently small number of EU citizens coming mainly for family or marriage reasons will remain constant at 25,000. This route will become one of the most attractive way of entering the UK, the report points out. In the biggest category, the number of workers coming in from the EU, the report projects a fall from 204,000 to 125,000, citing government indications that it would have to exempt key professional staff and ensure employers continued to have a ready supply of labour. Even this modest decrease, however, is likely to be offset by EU citizens already in the UK being less likely to leave Britain and the prospect of restrictions on UK citizens moving to other countries in the EU. The report points out 22% of EU migrants are in professional jobs, 22% in skilled occupations and 56% doing unskilled jobs. The UK has already said it will need to keep the professional route open, so the report assumes 50% of existing flow professional workers will still be required.Ministers have also said they will , 90% of whom come from the EU. The report then looks at the large proportion of workers in the key industries such as hospitality, transport and building. ※Complete closure of the skilled and unskilled categories is simply not feasible without catastrophic consequences for a range of UK sectors,§ it warns. The thinktank points out that in its recent , the government itself also conceded that the supply of skilled and unskilled workers cannot be switched off without serious disruption to key industries. It has promised to work closely with business leaders to ensure adequate supply of labour for key industries. The report also looks at the number of the EU citizens in the UK returning to the EU, saying the number will fall from 95,000 to 58,000, partly due to fears they will be unable to return to the UK. It also expects the current small net outflow of UK citizens to Europe will fall to zero, partly due to changes to residency requirements, access to healthcare and taxation for the estimated 1.2 million UK citizens who live in Europe. Critics will say the thinktank set up to break down cultural barriers has had to make too many assumptions and does not take into account the public＊s support for the principle of controlling borders."

"Gyrations in the oil market meant it was . This time last year the price of crude was crashing, which put strong downward pressure on the cost of living. The annual inflation rate is the sum of price movements in the latest 12 months, so last year＊s price falls are gradually dropping out. As they do, inflation automatically goes up.This trend is, however, is being amplified by two other factors. The first is that oil prices are not just holding steady: as a result of the to curb production they are going up. A year ago, it was possible to find unleaded petrol at around ?1 a litre; this Christmas it will be ?1.20 a litre.The second factor is the 15% depreciation of the pound since the EU referendum in June. Although sterling has been edging higher for the past month, the lagged effect of its drop during the summer and early autumn is making imports dearer. A pick-up in 每 the cost of goods leaving factory gates 每 is early evidence of this effect.At 1.2%, inflation remains below the government＊s 2% target but it will not remain there for long. Prices fell by 0.8% in January 2016 and unless that fall is replicated next month (which it won＊t be), inflation will rise. It is likely to hit 2% by the spring and 3% by the end of the year, unless the price-fixing deal for oil falls apart and the cost of crude comes crashing down again.Historically, an inflation rate of 2% to 3% is relatively modest for the UK. It will still be enough, however, to put a pronounced squeeze on living standards next year, because prices are going to rise faster than wages."															
"Airbnb says it is a solution to the problem of growing middle-class inequality that Donald Trump campaigned on,  local governments around the world of what it has to offer.Chris Lehane, head of global policy, told media in Sydney on Tuesday that a struggling middle class was a concern for both the Democrats and the Republican party in the recent presidential election campaign.But, he said, opportunities presented by the sharing economy were helping to mitigate the blows dealt by the financial crisis in 2008.※President-elect Trump talked a lot about quote-unquote the ＆dwindling＊ middle class and, on the left, Democrats talked a lot about economic inequality. ※We certainly believe 每 and the data supports it 每 that the  platform is a platform for the middle class. For everyday families, it is generating that supplemental income.§Lehane said most Airbnb hosts were middle-class homeowners renting out rooms in their primary residence ※on an amateur basis§ for supplemental income. The fastest-growing cohort is senior women, who are motivated by social interaction as much as they are disposable income. He said the typical senior host earned US$8,350 from Airbnb each year.※Wherever I go and in particular when I am meeting elected officials ... I do genuinely ask, ＆are there any programs here that are generating the types of economics that this program is generating for the middle class?＊※I＊m yet to see someone come up with something that is producing what this [Airbnb] does in fact produce.※I want to be clear, I don＊t think we are the solution for economic inequality, we most certainly are not, but are part of the solution to it? Yes.§The US president-elect is meeting with tech executives 每 reportedly including Elon Musk, Apple＊s Tim Cook, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel 每 on Wednesday. Brian Chesky, Airbnb＊s chief executive and cofounder, had been invited to the meeting but declined due to a family commitment outside of the US, said Lehane. He understood that though Airbnb put forward other representatives to attend, ※the invite was nontransferable. It was for CEOs§.Asked if Airbnb had concerns about a hotel magnate in the White House, Lehane said Airbnb felt ※pretty good about [its] value proposition§ to Trump, ※someone who＊s talked about how you help the middle class out there§.He added that most regulation of Airbnb in the US took place at a city level, not state or federal level. It was mostly the same in Europe; in Australia and Latin America, it occurred at a state level.The challenge for the service globally, Lehane said, was persuading policymakers of its benefits.Last Wednesday, Airbnb , presenting local governments with options for how they can benefit from home sharing. It followed legislation passed in New Orleans that directed a portion of tax revenue to the construction of affordable housing. Philadelphia and San Jose, as well as some European cities, have introduced a ※two-track§ regulatory structure that distinguishes between renting out primary residences and secondary ones.Earlier this month,  with London and Amsterdam that it would cap the number of days a full unit could be let per year, at 90 days and 60 respectively.The cap, said Lehane, reflected the period at which it ※would make more sense for the property to be put on the long-term market§. In both cases Airbnb had agreed to enforce the cap because of barriers posed to local authorities by laws relating to privacy and information-sharing. With similar agreements in the US, Lehane said Airbnb had cooperated with cities on a registration system to enable them to oversee enforcement themselves.Lehane said Airbnb wished to partner with cities, not shirk its responsibilities.※Ultimately, we＊re willing to go in either direction, depending on how those cities want to handle it. ※There are a bunch of tools that we can put into place, working very closely with the government, so that they＊re able to meet the objectives that they want 每 benefiting the middle class, getting the benefits for tourism, but also making sure that they＊re doing right by the housing market.§Not every market has welcomed Airbnb＊s disruption. It had been pushing back on a law introduced in New York City in October that imposes penalties on people who post short-term apartment rentals.Last week Airbnb  if regulators pursue hosts, not the platform.Linda Rosenthal, the Manhattan state assembly member who had led the effort against Airbnb, said the settlement was an ※astounding about-face§ by the company. Lehane said resistance from New York City had ※stood out as a bit of an aberration§.※New York is a classic example of cities defaulting back to horse and buggy when the car has shown up.§Nine of the US＊s 10 biggest cities will have agreements in place in the coming months, and 19 of the top 20 over the course of 2017, he said."															
"Interest rates in the world＊s biggest economy are going up before Christmas. That was the clear message from the latest set of US  measuring job creation in November. 每 the bellwether of demand for labour in the US 每 rose by 178,000, almost bang in line with what Wall Street was expecting. This was solid rather than spectacular, but good enough to trigger a move from the Federal Reserve, America＊s central bank, when it meets later this month., the Fed has repeatedly found reasons to delay another increase in the cost of borrowing. But, after a slow start to the year, the pace of growth has quickened and unemployment has continued to fall, dropping from 4.9% to 4.6% last month.True, this chunky drop in the jobless rate overstates the strength of the labour market because many Americans have given up looking for jobs and have dropped out of the workforce altogether. The US employment rate is below where it was when the financial crisis broke nine years ago and wage growth remains extremely sluggish. Hourly wage rates actually fell slightly last month.But this will not be enough to stay the Fed＊s hand. It has been signalling for some time that a December rate rise is in prospect: the November jobs＊ report was the last piece of the jigsaw. When , the Fed＊s chairwoman, announces the increase she is also likely to suggest that policy will be tightened slowly and steadily throughout 2017.Some may see this as Yellen, a Democrat and a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, getting in her retaliation before Donald Trump arrives in the White House. This argument doesn＊t really stand up. Relations between Trump and Yellen are unlikely to be cordial, but US rates would have been going up this month even if Clinton had won. "															
"ight years after the banking crisis,  its annual health check. If this were a medical before getting life insurance, it would be like a doctor telling the patient to get fit; it is not notice of sudden death.So the bailed-out bank 每 already being kept alive by a  每 is taking another dose of medicine to try to get itself into better shape. The prescription involves pulling back from riskier activities, and cutting costs. Next year it could get more difficult when the , is expected to embark on a fresh round of cost-cutting. That may well mean more jobs are on the line.The failure, though, is important. It illustrates the battle McEwan faces in getting the bank into a good enough shape so that the government stands a chance of selling off the . As the Bank of England put it: ※RBS remains susceptible to financial and economic stress.§Why? The lending spree it embarked on before the 2008 crisis has left the bank with customers who find it difficult to make repayments when times get tough. Some 60% of its loans in Ireland are at risk of not being repaid. The bailout in 2008 was regarded by Brussels as state aid and one of the conditions attached was that . That is proving troublesome (and any hope of a profit on the sale seems to be long gone). Low interest rates are making it harder to generate profits that can be used to help bolster its financial position.Crucially, it is still confessing its sins from the past. A key reason its health check went badly is that the Bank of England asked it to fess up about how much it might face in fines and legal costs in the year ahead. The figure has not been made public but analysts have calculated that the US Department of Justice could demand up to . The Bank of England said it had included ※stressed projections of misconduct costs§.In one way, though, the results of the so-called stress tests can be used to demonstrate that this is not the RBS of the past. The hypothetical scenario that the Bank of England subjected the main lenders to was the toughest yet 每 and not too dissimilar to the backdrop of the 2008 crisis. The test included a contraction in the global economy of almost 2%, a plunge in oil prices and nose-diving UK house prices.In 2008 a key measure of its financial strength 每 its capital ratio 每 stood at 4%. RBS went into this assessment with a  每 the highest of any of the seven lenders tested, apart from Nationwide.Even so, there is little to cheer for taxpayers. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has already admitted he has abandoned any immediate hope of selling any more of the stake. The Office for Budget Responsibility is no longer factoring in any sales during the lifetime of this parliament. In March it had expected ?21.5bn of sales of RBS shares 每 although given the stake is currently worth around ?16bn, this projection would have been revised down.For savers, the picture is the same as before:  每 as it is for all UK banks 每 by the financial services compensation scheme.With the sell-off heading further into the distance, the questions about whether a new prescription is needed may start to get louder. The New Economics Foundation, for instance, thinks a better medicine would be the more radical option of turning it into a . Ideas in the past have included carving out a bad bank or giving away the shares to the public. RBS will be hoping that its own medicine will be enough to get it fit for next year＊s assessment."															
"nderstanding the political success of the US president-elect, Donald Trump, is not easy. There have been many glib comparisons to populist politicians of the past, from  to. But the most revealing comparison may be with a historical figure from another country: the British nativist firebrand Enoch Powell in the late 1960s and early 1970s.At first glance, the comparison might seem peculiar. Powell came from a lower-middle-class family. He was a classical scholar of true erudition and a man of principle. He was also a political insider, having served as an MP since 1950 and as the junior minister for housing in Anthony Eden＊s government in 1955.Still, the parallels with Trump are undeniable. In his notorious 1968  speech, Powell, a skilled orator, broke decisively with the political mainstream. He decried immigration and denounced the Race Relations Act of 1968, which prohibited discrimination in housing, employment and lending. The passage giving his controversial speech its name alluded to inner-city riots in the US and invoked Virgil: ※Like the Roman, I seem to see ＆the River Tiber foaming with much blood.＊§Powell＊s equivalent of Trump＊s Mexican bogeyman was Indian and Pakistani immigration, which he portrayed as threatening the British way of life. ※Ordinary people,§ he asserted, knew that the true number of immigrants was larger than official government figures showed. Powell went on to advocate large-scale repatriation of immigrants to their country of origin.The Rivers of Blood speech was denounced as evil by no less than The Times. But it won Powell a dedicated following among working-class voters experiencing hard economic times, discomforted by the ※invasion§ of their neighbourhoods by Asian and Caribbean immigrants, and prone to conflate the two phenomena.Moreover, the parallels with Trump extend beyond hostility to immigration. Powell was fervently pro-business. He was a committed nationalist who rejected any and all foreign alliances that threatened Britain＊s policy independence. He implacably opposed joining the European Union (then the European Economic Community) on the grounds that doing so would compromise British identity and sovereignty. He left the Conservative party over the issue in 1974.Curiously, Powell, like Trump, was also pro-Russia. Notwithstanding his free-market principles, he appreciated the Soviet Union for its second world war sacrifices, its prideful nationalism and as a counterbalance to other self-interested foreign powers (read: the US).The apex of Powell＊s influence was bracketed by the Rivers of Blood, which made him a national figure, and his defection from the Tories. Quitting the party left him a political outcast. Although Powell quit the House of Commons once and for all only in 1987, his political influence was increasingly marginal.Why, then, did Powell 每 unlike Trump 每 fail to scale the higher reaches of power? And what does his failure tell us about the Trump phenomenon and the prospects for its repetition in other countries?First, there were limits on Powell＊s ability to mobilise public opinion. He was able to attract attention mainly by delivering speeches and encouraging his followers to circulate the text. With the exception of two tabloids, coverage by the establishment press of his Rivers of Blood speech ranged from sceptical to outright hostile. And the establishment press was all there was. The 1960s and 1970s, recall, were when the BBC ruled the airwaves. Powell had no equivalent of Twitter to spread the word, and there was no Fox News or Breitbart to create an ideological echo chamber.Second, Powell fundamentally believed in the British parliamentary system, having grown up in it. He was reluctant to harness his followers＊ nativism and economic insecurity to build an anti-system movement that might weaken the foundations of the country＊s parliamentary democracy.Third, public dissatisfaction with British politics in Powell＊s heyday was more limited than Americans＊ political dissatisfaction in the age of Trump. Even in the economically disastrous 1970s, British voters were not prepared to reject the political status quo. Discontent and disillusion were not ※accompanied by a basic questioning of British political institutions§, in the words of Powell＊s biographer, Douglas Schoen.Finally, the structure of the political system worked against a maverick such as Powell. In Britain, MPs, not the electorate, choose the prime minister. Only in a full-blown crisis can popular opinion effectively determine who becomes leader. This institutional arrangement creates a high barrier to populist outsiders.Maybe, then, the ultimate lesson of the Powell-Trump comparison is that a presidential system of government, like that in the US, is not superior in terms of the checks it imposes on political extremists. On the contrary, the opposite may be true."															
"ext week will see protectionism take centre stage globally as the , and the Twitter protectionist Donald Trump becomes US president.Yet there is a left, green alternative that could effectively challenge the rise of the extreme right, while giving voters hope for a better future. In my new book , I detail why progressives should endorse the controlling of borders to people, capital, goods and services, but not as occurred in the 1930s, when governments attempted to protect domestic jobs while still wanting to compete and export globally at the expense of others.Progressive Protectionism, by contrast, aims to nurture and rebuild local economies in a way that permanently reduces the amount of international trade in goods, money and services and enables nation states to control the level of migration that their citizens desire. This approach can return a sense of optimism to the majority through championing policies geared to achieving more job security, a decrease in inequality and protection of the environment worldwide.Jeremy Corbyn could play a key role here. His first tremulous steps towards  are, of course, welcome. However, his fantasy that the UK can prosper out of the EU and protect domestic industry ignores how vulnerable a go-it-alone UK will be. Big business will threaten relocation and investment strikes should the government have the temerity to try to significantly improve social, employment and environmental conditions.Instead Corbyn should use next month＊s London meeting of European socialist parties to discuss how all EU member states can cooperate to reverse the present political, social and economic instability that haunts the whole continent. This should prioritise the protection and rebuilding of local economies and so provide a positive answer to voters＊ concerns. To achieve this, a debate needs to be started about why Europe needs a progressive protectionism to replace the increasingly discredited  with a ※Treaty of Home Europe-wide§. Cross-border issues such as responding to non-European migration, climate change, pollution, crime and military security would still of course require intra-European cooperation.This might sound far fetched, but such an approach by Europe＊s left would belatedly allow them to play catch up with the extreme right and Trump. The latter at present has the political monopoly on policies for curbing high migration and protecting local jobs from imports. Given the key elections looming this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany, addressing immigration and insecurity is something the left will have no choice but to do anyway.For this huge transition towards the protection of local economies to be achieved would also need a large scale, coordinated campaign by those who will eventually benefit from such changes. This will involve the constant reiteration of how the ※Treaty of Home§ will benefit domestic economic activity and services as compared with the present adverse effects of the four so called freedoms. These have included foreign steel and other imports hurting manufacturing, overseas companies snapping up domestic ones, foreign landlords leaving investment homes empty, the gig economy increasing job insecurity and inadequately controlled immigration growing alarmingly.Under pressure from angry, disadvantaged citizens and extreme right parties, European Governments of every political hue are increasingly being forced to take border controls seriously. Those of us who last June voted for remain, but to reform Europe, were frequently told that the political elite would never change direction. However as the complexity, long timetable and costs of Brexit become clearer, once controlling the free movement of people across Europe is on the table, then a second referendum, or a parliamentary vote on the Brexit on offer, could lead to a very different result. It could unite the huge numbers of remainers and Brexiters who want both controls on immigration and a mutually beneficial relationship with our European neighbours. Huge changes are coming in 2017. The successes achieved by Trump and Nigel Farage, the gains expected for Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders, and the crumbling lead of Angela Merkel will make those who still claim that globalisation and large scale immigration are irreversible appear as quaintly pass谷 as those who once asserted that the sun would never set on the empire.

" is one of those rare books that seem to exude brilliance, power and polemical passion from the opening page, propelled by the urgency and consequence of the subject. Unlike some other rhetorical classics in this list, it executes its argument with a rapier not a blunderbuss, using the clinical ferocity of hammered steel not wild, explosive irruptions of outrage.Reading Keynes in 2017, nearly a hundred years after first publication, you don＊t have to know the diplomatic minutiae of the Versailles peace treaty, a notorious historical disaster, to appreciate that here is a brilliant writer (who would subsequently become a great economist) flexing his intellectual muscles for the first time on the world stage. Uniquely, too, this is a book whose subject is economics but whose message is geopolitical. It＊s a book, moreover, suffused with a deep and compelling sense of imminent catastrophe: ※In Paris, where those connected with the Supreme Economic Council received almost hourly the reports of the misery, disorder and decaying organisation of all central and eastern Europe, allied and enemy alike, and learned from the lips of the financial representatives of Germany and Austria unanswerable evidence of the terrible exhaustion of their countries, an occasional visit to the hot, dry room in the president＊s house, where the Four fulfilled their destinies in empty and arid intrigue, only added to the sense of nightmare.§At the time,  created an instant controversy. Keynes was the official representative of the British Treasury at the negotiations in Paris. He was in the room during all the crucial discussions about ※making Germany pay§, saw the protagonists of the treaty (Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau) in action at first hand, and was able to witness for himself the making of an international catastrophe: ※My ＃ most vivid impression is of ＃ the president [Wilson] and the prime minister [Lloyd George] as the centre of a surging mob and a babel of sound, a welter of eager, impromptu compromises and counter-compromises, all sound and fury signifying nothing, on what was an unreal question anyhow, the great issues of the morning＊s meeting forgotten and neglected; and Clemenceau silent and aloof on the outskirts＃§Keynes＊s arguments for a more generous settlement were prescient. Above all, he saw with unique clarity the geopolitical tenor and perspective expressed by the Big Four, a combination of grandeur, vanity and vengeance that would shape Europe after the great war and send it spiralling towards an even bigger catastrophe.Keynes was so disturbed by what he saw that ultimately he resigned out of the conviction that the great powers were hell-bent on drafting an unjust settlement with immeasurably terrible consequences.Keynes, who was also a member of the Bloomsbury group, wrote  in the months after his resignation, developing a devastating argument to show that the treaty was not only unfair but potentially dehumanising in its effects. The reparation measures of the Versailles treaty, he demonstrates with clinical clarity, would wreck the German economy, impoverish the German people and undermine all future hopes for peace and reconciliation. Scholars will argue about the extent to which the great German inflation of the 1920s, the first step in the rise of fascism, was a by-product of the treaty＊s provisions, but what Keynes brilliantly identified was the necessary interaction of sound economic policy across Europe in the maintenance of international peace among nations. This is a book that some Brexiters might do well to reread.Keynes＊s essay immediately became a worldwide bestseller. It rapidly became the source of conventional left-liberal wisdom on the treaty. In its mature form, this was the widespread opinion that the final document imposed on the defeated Germans at Versailles on 28 June 1919 (exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand) was a recklessly punitive, ※Carthaginian§ settlement.Another international consequence of Keynes＊s work was that his book helped to consolidate American public opinion against the treaty. Woodrow Wilson never got the treaty ratified by Congress, and the failure of his vision for a new world soured the rest of his presidency, and possibly contributed to his stroke. As a result, America＊s commitment to, and involvement in, the League of Nations was never more than half-hearted. In a real sense this would shape the allies＊ interwar response to a resurgent Germany under the Nazis. In turn, the perception among the British public that Germany had been treated unfairly would fuel the 1930s policy of ※appeasement§, a policy that would, in the end, lead to the outbreak of the second world war. made JM Keynes internationally famous, and established his reputation as a provocative and leading economist, a reputation that would be consolidated by the publication of his masterpiece,  (1936).And yet, for the general reader who wants to engage with the mind of Keynes at its most accessible, and entertaining,  makes perfect reading. Moreover, it is one of those very rare titles whose influence lasted long into the future. After the end of the second world war, when Keynes became a key player in establishing the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944, he remembered the lessons from Versailles as well as the depression of the 1930s. As is often pointed out, it was the Marshall plan of 1945 that came most closely to resemble the ideas of systematic reconciliation first proposed by Keynes in .※A sense of impending catastrophe overhung the frivolous scene; the futility and smallness of man before the great events confronting him; the mingled significance and unreality of the decisions; levity, blindness, insolence, confused cries from without 每 all the elements of ancient tragedy were there.§Harold Nicolson:  (1933) JM Keynes:  (1936) Robert Skidelsky:  (2004)"

That is a marked deceleration and has been particularly pronounced in the private sector. For the moment, the figures chime with business surveys and suggest that employers are adopting a wait-and-see approach, rather than resorting to major layoff programmes. The more timely but less comprehensive claimant count measure of unemployment showed a small rise of 2,400 in November, but this was lower than the market consensus of 6,500.

"Richard Layard is promoting the idea that better provision of mental health services is more important than reducing social inequalities in promoting human happiness (, theguardian.com, 12 December). This is a false dichotomy. Evidence suggests that austerity damages our collective health. Deepening economic and social divides, bullying, abuse, misogyny, racism, dehumanisation and consequent insecurity, trauma, social exclusion, neglect and despair underpin the current tsunami of desolation in the UK and beyond, especially in our children. These are largely economic and political matters, requiring cultural, social and political solutions. Psychological therapies, humanely delivered to those who want them, have a part to play in ameliorating human suffering, and we do need more flexible, kind and supportive services. But we must not pathologise those who are damaged by the injustices they experience. Degradation by the benefits system is now devastating many with long-term illnesses in the UK. To imagine that therapy, rather than social transformation, can address or prevent the conditions that lead to despair is to be wilfully blind.                 Workplace happiness is not about the trivial (, 12 December). Micromanagement, being told what to do and blame cultures are the kind of things that make people unhappy at work. Instead, enable people to do work they are good at, give them the trust and freedom to do it well, have managers who coach rather than tell, and create a no-blame environment. The result will be happier staff and more productive organisations."															
"Welcome to Jamland. Formerly known as the United Kingdom, Jamland is where the Jams live.They were once known as the squeezed middle. They have also been dubbed the people who just get on with it. Now, courtesy of Theresa May, there is a new moniker for those who are struggling to get by 每 the families who are ※just about managing§.The prime minister minted the phrase that has become Whitehall＊s favourite new acronym in her . She pledged to strive for a country that worked for everyone, empathising with those in precarious jobs, struggling to pay the mortgage, worried about the cost of living or anxious about getting their children into a good school.Politicians have known about the Jams and vied for their allegiance for years. and George Osborne donned a hard hit and a hi-vis jacket to praise and rub shoulders with those who uncomplainingly ※got on with it§.Philip Hammond, who has the responsibility of making good on the prime minister＊s promises, explained who the Jams were on his visit to  ※They are the people who work hard and don＊t feel they are sharing in the prosperity that economic growth is bringing to the country,§ the chancellor said. Or, to put it more concisely, the ones who voted for .The referendum was a seminal moment, because the Jams turned out in their millions to vote for leave. Their living standards are lower than they were in the mid 2000s. Twenty years ago, a just managing family was twice as likely to own their own home as to rent. Today the reverse it true. Two-thirds of children in poverty live in homes where at least one adult is working. On 23 June, the Jams were on one side, the Darts 每 doing all right thanks 每 were on the other. The Jams live in a country that is just about managing. Courtesy of record-low interest rates, the Bank of England is just about managing to keep the economy going. Despite repeatedly missing its targets, the government is just about managing to convince the financial markets that the public finances are under control. Exports of services mean the UK is just about managing to disguise the fact that there has been a deficit in manufactured goods every year since 1982. The NHS is just about managing to cope with increased patient demand and the toughest run of financial settlements since it was founded in 1948.Fair play to the government. It has identified all the right problems. There are, indeed, far too many just about managing households. The reason is that Jamland is a country that invests too little, where productivity is poor and where Osborne＊s promised rebalancing of the economy towards manufacturing and exports simply has not happened. Jamland specialises in creating low-skill, low-pay, insecure jobs.May and her team have talked about the need for an industrial strategy, of the desirability of having workers and consumer representatives on company boards, of a budgetary ※re-set§ that will soften austerity and 每 most notably 每 of helping those who are just about managing.So far it has been just that. Talk. Wednesday, however, is when the talking stops. Hammond has the task both of bringing some short-term relief to the Jams while at the same time tackling the deep-seated problems of the economy so there are fewer Jams in the future. That is not going to be easy. For one thing, there are a lot of Jams out there spread thickly across the country. The estimates that there are 6 million working-age households on low to middle incomes concentrated in areas as diverse as Pendle in Lancashire, Sandwell in the West Midlands and North Devon. And there＊s more. Money is tight and will remain so. The government＊s target date for balancing the books continues to be pushed back. Hammond  and will announce on Wednesday that there will still be a chunky deficit in 2020. The economy has performed much more strongly since the EU referendum than many feared, but the deficit in the current financial year is still likely to be at least ?10bn to ?15bn higher than the ?55bn Osborne pencilled at his 2016 budget. The Office for Budget Responsibility, which compiles the government＊s economic and fiscal forecasts, will say on Wednesday that the uncertainty  is causing will put additional strain on the public finances.Osborne＊s plan to run a budget surplus required big cuts in the welfare budget. One way of saving money was to freeze working-age benefits such as tax credits for the duration of the parliament, which meant their value would be eroded by inflation. The fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote means inflation is now going to be higher than expected, with the Bank of England predicting it will hit 3% by early 2018. The Jams rely on tax credits to top up their wages, so they could do with some help from the chancellor. He gave little indication, however, on the Marr show that he had much to offer.Noting that the economy was likely to slow next year, he talked about the ※eye-watering level of debt§, the need to maintain ※credibility§ and his desire to make the economy ※match fit§ for the challenges and the opportunities ahead. The challenges were highlighted last week by the left-leaning  thinktank, which announced a two-year commission designed to come up with solutions to Britain＊s structural economic weaknesses. Six were identified 每 under-investment, a chronic trade deficit, poor public finances, too many Jams, the concentration of income and wealth in the south-east, and the failure to hit carbon reduction targets.※Brexit forces us to face up to the diagnosis,§ the IPPR said. ※We have an economy that is not delivering what it should for the British people. The paradox of the Brexit vote 每 a mandate for change that may make change harder to achieve 每 requires a far-reaching response.§It has taken decades for Britain to become Jamland. A cash-strapped Hammond is not going to come up with all the answers. Freezes to fuel duties, more generous childcare subsidies and money for road improvements represent tinkering rather than a fundamental shift in policy.What does that mean? It means the scope for disappointment is high. The prime minister may wake up on Thursday morning to find herself portrayed as the White Queen in Alice through the looking glass 每 ."															
"By voting for , Americans have chosen the candidate with the more radical programme for the economy. Hillary Clinton＊s proposals were cautious, costed and conservative. By contrast, the president-elect is gambling that he can shift the US out of its post-financial crisis torpor through a mixture of tax cuts and spending increases even though they run the risk of higher inflation and a bigger budget deficit.Although Trump campaigned as an outsider, his policies have been tried before. Ronald Reagan said his tax cuts and extra spending for the Pentagon would generate higher revenues and balance the budget. It didn＊t. sent the deficit rocketing.Similarly, George W Bush, said his tax cuts and war on terror were compatible with fiscal prudence. They weren＊t.Trump＊s package is a mixture of Reagan and Bush, with a bit of Dwight Eisenhower thrown in. He has pledged a $500bn (?400bn) programme of infrastructure spending to renew the roads, tunnels and bridges built in the 1950s and has promised to increase defence spending.The plan is also to  for both individuals and companies. America＊s corporation tax is one of the highest in the developed world at 35%. Trump plans to cut it to 15%. Income tax will be simplified and cut across the board, but with the better off set to be the biggest gainers.History suggests that this combination will result in faster growth. Economists at Deutsche Bank said it could double from its current rate of around 2%. History also suggests it will come at cost of higher inflation and of a much bigger budget deficit. Luca Paolini, the chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, predicts it could average 6% of US GDP over the next decade, up from a current 3.1%.Trump has said his spending commitments will be matched by savings elsewhere, although again history suggests that this is easier said than done. Congress is, for example, unlikely to allow the new president to repeal Barack Obama＊s Affordable Health Care for America Act unless there is something to replace it.The problem of getting tax and spending plans passed on Capitol Hill has not disappeared simply because the Republicans are in control of both houses of Congress as well as the White House. It will take all Trump＊s marketing skills to persuade some of the fiscal conservatives in the Republican party that his sums add up.A looser fiscal policy that leads to stronger growth and higher inflation is also certain to elicit a response from the . The uncertainty caused by Trump＊s victory could result in the Fed delaying the increase in the cost of borrowing it had been pencilling in for December, but the respite will be short-lived. Interest rates under Trump will end up being higher than they would have been under Clinton. If things don＊t go according to plan, the US will suffer from higher inflation just at the time that trade and migration curbs result in weaker activity.But for the time being, all Wall Street can see is higher growth and bigger corporate profits. That＊s why share prices have been going up."															
"After a long and bitter campaign for the US presidency, Donald Trump has triumphed over Hillary Clinton and the . For Trump＊s supporters he represents a chance to shake up a system that many Americans feel has increased inequality and squeezed living standards. For less complacent investors, there are worries Trump＊s anti-globalisation mantra will spread protectionism around the world, put up trade barriers and curb global economic growth. Furthermore, markets do not like unknowns and with Trump going to the White House they are dealing with a complete newcomer to politics. His administration is widely expected to mark a departure from the policies of his own Republican party as well as the outgoing Democrats.So what do we know about Trump＊s economic policies? We look at the key areas:Tapping into economic discontent Trump has argued for protectionism and asserted that decades of free-trade policies were responsible for the collapse of the American manufacturing industry. He has been feeding on the , for example, by bringing cheap consumer goods into the country, costing domestic jobs and depressing wages. Outsourcing of jobs to cheaper markets has also been a concern. Against that backdrop, Trump＊s stance on trade is perhaps the clearest of his economic policies. The billionaire Republican wants to renegotiate, or possibly even scrap, the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nafta lowers trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico and was negotiated by George HW Bush and enacted in the 1990s by Bill Clinton. The incoming president wants Nafta to offer a better deal for Americans and has rejected claims by his opponents that the deal has helped the US economy by opening up export markets.The protectionism with regard to Mexico does not stop there. One of Trump＊s most notorious pledges in the presidential campaign was to build a multibillion-dollar wall along the US southern border and . On the markets on Wednesday fears over the blow to Mthe Mexican economy from Trump＊s victory have . Other global trade deals are also now very much in doubt, notably the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), between 12 countries around the Pacific rim, excluding China, and the agreement being negotiated between the US and Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).Philip Shaw, an economist at the bank Investec, says: ※While we are minded to disregard some of Mr Trump＊s wilder pre-election rhetoric, we consider that there is a tangible risk that a Trump presidency could fuel anti-globalisation momentum and spark a wave of protectionist policies around the globe. In terms of trade deals, both TTIP and the TPP now look dead in the water.§, arguing that since China joined the World Trade Organisation, Americans have witnessed the closure of more than 50,000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs. He wants the US government to label China a ※currency manipulator§ and has lambasted the rapidly growing Asian economy for ※unfair subsidy behaviour§.Here again, Trump has played into frustrations among many Americans over their sense of financial insecurity, inequality and squeezed incomes. Trump, who has faced fierce criticism for , promised tax cuts for all income groups.He has pledged ※a massive tax reduction§ for working and middle-income Americans and has vowed to eliminate income taxes for individuals who earn less than $25,000 annually, or $50,000 for a married couple. He has also said he would ※ensure the rich pay their fair share§. But analysis by the  has found Trump＊s tax plan would disproportionately help the richest Americans, saving them millions.Trump has also supported lower corporate taxes, proposing to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15%. He wants to close special interest tax loopholes and to restrict companies from moving money out of the country. He has also proposed a corporate tax repatriation plan 每 to encourage US companies which hoard cash overseas to avoid paying the 35% tax to bring that cash back to the US. According to Capital  this cash hoard is now $2.5tn. A tax holiday 每 so the tax due would be only 10% for a period 每 could encourage corporations to bring back cash to invest or distribute to shareholdersAll those tax cuts mean less coming in to government coffers, at least in the near-term. There is an argument that the potential boost to businesses and to household spending power would lift the economy enough to improve government finances. But, for now, economists expect that Trump＊s plans for tax cuts across the board will mean the US taking on more debt as its deficit 每 the gap between spending and income 每 swells.Kevin Logan, the chief US economist at the bank HSBC, says: ※Reducing the budget deficits, while cutting tax rates at the same time, will be difficult without sizable cutbacks in federal spending. If a Trump administration manages to push through tax cuts with matching spending cuts, federal budget deficits, which are already trending higher, will probably increase substantially, in our view.§, introduced under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with his own, cheaper plan for tax-free health savings accounts (HSAs). On the campaign trail, Trump called Obamacare an expensive ※disaster§.About  have insurance thanks to the ACA but  because it relies on competition between insurers to provide affordable coverage, and that competition has dwindled. The most high-profile Trump plan on immigration is for a wall along the Mexican border. He also said he would deport 11 million undocumented migrants, something opponents say is physically impossible. He wants immigrants to be selected on the basis of ※their likelihood of success in the US and their ability to be financially self-sufficient§. in the US has dropped below 5%, a good record on the surface for Obama. But during his campaign, Trump has focused on those parts of the economy and country where the recovery since the financial crash has not being felt, gaining traction with those Americans who have seen their industries diminish and their wages stagnate.On the campaign trail, Trump chose the once booming industrial centre of Detroit to set out his economic plan.  in a speech that played on widespread worries about the decline of US manufacturing.Trump has said his protectionist policies will keep ※jobs and wealth inside the United States§ . He has promised to increase employment, saying his plans for lower taxes, trade barriers and tighter immigration rules would lead to stronger economic growth. As with the deficit, many economists warn his plans could make things worse not better, hindering economic growth and thereby employers＊ ability to create new jobs.Trump has bemoaned the deteriorating conditions of American infrastructure but has provided little detail on what big spending projects he would undertake. In his victory speech he said: ※We are going to fix our inner cities, and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We＊re going to rebuild our infrastructure ... and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.§This is not strictly an area for the government, given interest rates are set by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, widely referred to as the Fed. But there were  and the position of its chairwoman, Janet Yellen. The president-elect has previously accused the Fed of keeping borrowing costs low to help president Obama and has said the central bank＊s policies have .In April he said . In an interview with Fortune magazine, Trump also said he ※absolutely§ backed efforts to diminish the Fed＊s power. Yellen began a four-year term as Fed chairwoman under Obama in February 2014.Fed policymakers had hinted at another rate rise in December, part of the slow process of bringing policy back to more normal levels after drastic measures to shore up the US economy during the global financial crisis. But investors now think a move next month is off the table given the shock to markets from Trump＊s victory and the economic uncertainty that lies ahead. In the longer-term, more spending and tax cuts from the government 每 in other words looser fiscal policy 每 could usher in tighter monetary policy with a more interest rate hikes from the Fed.Trump＊s victory has sparked alarm and dismay among environmentalists fearful he will reverse many of the green measures introduced under Obama. Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the UK＊s Green party, described the Republican＊s win as ※a hammer blow for the fight against climate change§. In the past the real estate mogul has dismissed global warming as an ※expensive hoax§. Now his election to the US presidency has  just days after it . Trump has threatened to to withdraw the US from the deal to cut greenhouse gases, which took 20 years to negotiate.By contrast, Trump has indicated he would promote coal, shale gas and oil and there are worries he will curb investment into renewable energy sources as well as funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. He has pledged to scrap regulations for America＊s coal industry, a stance that won him the beleaguered sector＊s support. It gave around $223,000 in support of Trump, compared with none for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters analysis."															
" by . The Mexican peso was down 12% at one point. The US dollar fell 2.5% against the yen. Markets have been hedging a Trump win with gold, which was up by $40 an ounce, or 3.2%. Uncertainty is in the air.It must be said that this has been a disastrous decade for professional forecasters of the economic and political varieties. Donald Trump was behind in the  every one of the past 95 days and won. On Monday 7 November, of the 10 national polls that were issued, nine had Trump behind. A couple of polling organisations did have it right but were ignored. It turns out that a Trump victory wasn＊t a total surprise. The IBD/TIPP tracking poll, which was the most accurate in the previous three elections, 2004, 2008 and 2012, . The LA Times tracking poll had Trump consistently ahead since the end of October and . The biggest difference apparently involved weighting 每 that is, the process of adjusting a poll＊s data to make sure it properly represents the diversity of the population. Twenty-seven years ago to the day, the Berlin Wall fell. The field of international relations failed to spot it. In 2008, the advanced countries all fell into a recession that the field of economics, and every government and central bank, had failed to anticipate. It is clear from the minutes of its meeting of 16 September, two days after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the Federal Reserve still had not spotted that the  had entered a major recession nine months earlier in December 2007.The inflation report by the Bank of England＊s monetary policy committee in August 2008 did not even contain the word ※recession§. As the Queen said at the London School of Economics in November 2009,  Ex-Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean in . We all should actually. If you can＊t spot the big one why should the British people pay the salaries of the hundreds of economists employed at the Bank of England? The country would have been better off if, instead, all these economists had been employed delivering pizza. The Fed has continued to argue that the US economy is close to full employment and it is time to raise rates. At its last meeting a week ago members suggested that there would also be at least a couple more rate rises in 2017. The markets until Tuesday expected a rate rise in December but no more for another year. The Fed mistakenly raised rates in December 2015 with an expectation it would raise four times in 2016 but it hasn＊t. At the time, I called the decision ※fingers crossed and hoping economics§ and predicted the next move would be a cut as it has been at every other central bank that raised rates since 2009. More people are coming round to that view 每 indeed, on a lighter note, since September I have a $5 bet with  that a cut is coming. A few hours ago he sent me this message: ※Good morning. It looks like you will win your Fed rate bet.§ The future of Fed chair Janet Yellen now looks seriously in doubt. The Obama administration and Fed officials kept insisting that the US was close to full employment, but I for one didn＊t believe them. There remains lots of labour market slack in the US labour market. Blue-collar workers who voted for Trump in droves in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin apparently didn＊t believe them either. The chart above, which plots the employment rate, ie the proportion of the 16+ population in jobs, shows why. At the onset of recession in December 2007 62.7% were employed; in October 2016 only 59.7% were. If the old rate applied now the number of jobs would be 7.6 million higher. Real weekly earnings in the US are only 8% higher than they were a decade ago. Trump promised to fix all that, by ※making America great again§, creating lots of good jobs 每 and voters bought it.Trump＊s stunning victory and the Brexit vote in the UK are the inevitable responses to the weak recovery from recession. The one positive take for me is that in both countries austerity is dead and buried. Keynes was right. Fiscal stimulus here we come. No wonder experts have been getting such a hard time."															
"s US President  proceeds to destabilise the postwar global economic order, much of the world is collectively holding its breath. Commentators search for words to describe his assault on conventional norms of leadership and tolerance in a modern liberal democracy. The mainstream media, faced with a president who might sometimes be badly uninformed and yet really believes what he is saying, hesitate to label conspicuously false statements as lies.But some would argue that beneath the chaos and bluster, there is an economic rationale to the Trump administration＊s disorderly retreat from globalisation. According to this view, the US has been duped into enabling China＊s ascendency, and one day Americans will come to regret it. We economists tend to view abdication of US world leadership as a historic mistake.It is important to acknowledge that the roots of the anti-globalisation movement in the United States run much deeper than disenfranchised blue-collar workers. For example, some economists opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (a 12-country trade deal that would have covered 40% of the global economy) on the questionable grounds that it would have harmed American workers. It fact, the TPP would have opened Japan far more than it would have affected the US. Rejecting it only opens the door to Chinese economic dominance across the Pacific.US populists, , seem unimpressed by the fact that globalisation has lifted hundreds of millions of desperately poor people in China and India into the global middle class. The liberal view of Asia＊s rise is that it makes the world a fairer and more just place, where a person＊s economic fate does not depend quite so much on where they happen to have been born.But a more cynical view permeates populist logic, namely that in its excessive adherence to globalism, the US has sown the seeds of its own political and economic destruction. Trumpism taps into this sense of national mortality; here is someone who thinks he can do something about it. The aim is not just to ※bring home§ American jobs, but to create a system that will extend US dominance.※We should focus on our own§ is the mantra of Trump and others. Unfortunately, with this attitude, it is hard to see how America can maintain the world order that has benefited it so much for so many decades. And make no mistake: America has been the big winner. No other large country is nearly as rich, and the US middle class is still very well off by global standards.Yes, Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was right that Denmark is a great place to live and does many things right. He might have mentioned, however, that Denmark is a relatively homogeneous country of 5.6 million people with a very low tolerance for immigration.For better or for worse, the globalisation train has long since left the station, and the idea that one can turn it back is utterly naive. Whatever might have been done differently before US President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972 is no longer possible. The fate of China, and its role in the world, is now in the hands of the Chinese and their leaders. If the Trump administration thinks it can reset the clock by starting a trade war with , it is as likely to accelerate China＊s economic and military development as it is to slow it down.So far, the Trump administration has only sparred with China, concentrating its early anti-trade rhetoric on Mexico. Although the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which Trump reviles, has likely had only modest effects on US trade and jobs, he has attempted to humiliate Mexicans insisting that they pay for his border wall, as if Mexico were a US colony.The US is ill-advised to destabilise its Latin American neighbours. In the near term, Mexican institutions should prove quite robust; but in the long run, Trumpism, by encouraging anti-American sentiment, will undermine leaders otherwise sympathetic to US interests.If the Trump administration tries such crude tactics with China, it will be in for a rude surprise. China has financial weapons, including trillions of dollars of US debt. A disruption of trade with China could lead to massive price increases in the low-cost stores 每 for example, Wal-Mart and Target 每 on which many Americans rely.Moreover, huge swaths of Asia, from Taiwan to India, are vulnerable to Chinese aggression. For the moment, China＊s military is relatively weak and would likely lose a conventional war with the US; but this situation is rapidly evolving, and China may soon have its own aircraft carriers and other more advanced military capabilities.The US cannot ※win§ a trade war with China,  The US needs to negotiate hard with China to protect its friends in Asia and deal with the rogue state of North Korea. And the best way to get the good deals Trump says he seeks is to pursue a more open trade policy with China, not a destructive trade war."															
"Your article on the government＊s housing white paper (, 8 February) highlights many of the issues and hurdles we must overcome if we are to fix the ※broken§ housing market. But?the omission of analysis of the impact of our ageing population ignores a fundamental reason why the market needs to be fixed. And while the white paper referenced some of the changes necessary, a significant amount of further work needs to be done. We know that over the next 25 years, the proportion of households where the oldest person is 85 or over will grow faster than any other age group, and homes that meet the needs of older people will be in greater demand.Further understanding on housing options available and insight on what people themselves want to do should inform any measures that incentivise ※downsizing§. There need to be appropriate and diverse housing options for people to move to, within the area they want to live and across all tenures. This?includes new housing stock that is accessible, adaptable and affordable.The white paper also addresses the need to change the private rental market, but does not take into account the specific needs of people in later life. There are an increasing number of older private renters 每 200,000 older adults joined the rental market in the past four years, and it＊s estimated that a third of over-60s could be living in private rental property by 2040. They could face non-regulated rents, loose landlord regulations, short-term tenancies, and houses in disrepair and not adapted for their needs. All?these issues need to be addressed if the housing market is to meet the changing needs of our ageing population. Home ownership: you pay your mortgage off by the end of your working life. The result is that your much-reduced income in retirement is copeable. You?also have an asset to help with your?old-age care.Long-term renting: you retire but your market rent remains payable for ever out?of your much-reduced income. So,?either you become destitute or (if society doesn＊t want that) the taxpayer acquires a huge burden to pay by way of benefits. You also have no asset to help with your old-age care, again putting a?burden on the taxpayer.This is all down the road, but it will come unless the ※long-term renting§ concept is squashed now. So, if such a future worries you, make your views known to your MP and go to the ※How to Respond§ section on page 69 of .  Broken indeed (, Editorial, 8 February). A paradigm shift is needed to solve the housing crisis. Building a quarter of a million new homes a year is not a sustainable solution. This is a small island. Instead, why don＊t we intensify the use of the existing building stock, half of which sits empty at any one time? Tax breaks could encourage the elderly to share large family homes with lodgers, simultaneously reducing loneliness and the need for care. And championing home-based work would result in fewer people going out to work, and therefore reduce the need for workspace. Excess light industrial and commercial space could then be converted into desperately needed housing.  You are right to highlight the importance of housing demand, as well as need. For decades governments of all parties have stoked house prices. It is the way to win elections. Long-term undersupply is one cause of house price inflation, but far from the only cause.However, your editorial is wrong to suggest that higher density developments must be small and poky. It is perfectly possible to build beautiful, spacious homes and apartments at high density, often with gardens: visit the Georgian terraces and squares of Bath or Kensington and Chelsea, or almost any city on the continent.A theme of the housing white paper is that housebuilders need to raise their game. This applies not only to how many homes they build but also to their quality and design.  According to its white paper, our government now claims the housing market is ※broken§. This is mystifying: demand has greatly exceeded supply; prices have risen rapidly 每 is this not precisely what markets are expected to do? Can we hope that instead it is the previously unshakeable conservative belief in utility of markets that might be broken? Probably not. The government persists in relying on ※the market§ for the provision of something ※the market§ does not want to provide: economic housing. The simplest strategy, and one that would also bring down the cost of housing generally, would be to empower local authorities, again, to build and let houses and flats on modern leases, paid for with long-term finance. Council houses built nearly 100 years ago are still returning an income. ※Buy to let§ is part of the problem, not the answer. Repeatedly doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome is a sign of insanity.  At a briefing meeting for peers on the housing white paper, I asked the secretary of state what proportion of the targeted number of homes to be built by 2020 would he expect to be built by councils and housing associations for affordable renting. Answer came there none.A further question referring to the massive impact on the ability of councils and housing associations to invest in maintaining and improving the stock caused by the government＊s imposition of rent reductions in the social housing sector merely elicited confirmation of the policy.The modest proposals in the white paper will do little to address the housing crisis which has grown exponentially in the last few years. One may not be surprised to realise that our current crisis in affordable housing is not new. In the early 1970s, shortly after writing Small is Beautiful, Ernst Schumacher wrote a pamphlet, Think About Land (originally published by the Catholic  Aid Society), in which he suggests a mechanism of land registration based on current, carefully estimated, values (allowing for zoning restrictions etc) and updated regularly using an agreed inflation index. In this way the impetus for ※land developers§ to buy cheap, possibly hoard, and sell dear in a market of by definition limited size, is minimised. No land can be sold privately at above this figure. If sold at a lower price this becomes the new ※registered value§. He envisages the local authority as honest broker. He arrives at this solution after discounting the other, more radical, idea of taking all available land into public ownership (too expensive 每 or revolutionary). Intriguingly he calls this ※a middle way§. Will anyone take up this idea?"															
"ords matter. The process of understanding why is now heading for the White House starts with the correct description of what has happened in the eight years since Barack Obama became president.Some economists call the turbulent period that followed the collapse of the Great Recession. Others say the US along with other developed nations is experiencing secular stagnation. Anything, it seems, to avoid using the D word: depression.The is a sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity, which sums up precisely what has occurred since 2008. Growth rates globally have remained low despite colossal amounts of stimulus. Living standards have barely risen and the threat of deflation has loomed large. The depression since 2008 has not been as severe as that of the 1930s but there are echoes of it all the same: in the food banks that are the new soup kitchens; in the mass movements of migrants in search of a better life who are the modern equivalent of the Okies in the Grapes of Wrath; and in Trump, who has tapped into anger that has been bubbling away quietly for decades.The turning point for the average American worker came in the mid-1970s because for the first 30 years after the second world war the gains from rising prosperity were evenly shared. But this trend was broken around the time of Watergate and the end of the Vietnam war. Since 1975, productivity in the US has more than doubled, but average hourly compensation has increased by only 50%. The fruits of growth have been captured by the few, not the many.This tendency was especially pronounced in the years immediately after 2008, when lower interest rates and quantitative easing fed through into rising asset prices rather than into higher wages. Between 2009-2012, more than 90% of US growth went to the richest 1%, which included the financiers who had caused the crisis in the first place.It is not just that workers have been struggling to get a decent pay rise. Jobs have become harder to find in the last decade, with many Americans dropping out of the labour market altogether. The participation rate among prime-age males (25- to 54-year-olds) fell at the time of the crash and has never recovered.As in the UK, the outlook for working people in the US has improved over the past couple of years because the collapse of energy prices has led to lower inflation and higher real incomes. But it has not been enough to counter the feeling that the system is rigged.Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, provided a useful breakdown of voting patterns in last Tuesday＊s presidential election. Taken at face value, the results seem to show that Hillary Clinton did well among those voters on the lowest incomes. She led 53%-41% among those earning less than $30,000 a year and by 51%-42% among those earning between $30,000 and $50,000.But these statistics are misleading. There was actually a 16-point net swing to the Republicans between the 2012 and 2016 elections among those earning less than $30,000 a year and a 6-point swing among those earning $30,000 to $50,000. By contrast, there was a swing to the  among those on higher incomes, and this was particularly pronounced among those earning more than $100,000 a year.One interpretation of these numbers would be that Americans on average or below average incomes voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 because they expected fundamental change from which they would benefit. They were still waiting for the change to come in 2016 and thought Trump was more likely to provide it than Clinton. The better off, who have being doing just fine out of business as usual, supported Clinton as the candidate of the status quo. For Wall Street and Silicon Valley she was the safer choice. As in other western countries, the party ostensibly of the left had nothing to say that its traditional base wanted to hear.There have been three stages to this process of political estrangement. When the postwar era began, parties of the left focused exclusively on economic issues. The emphasis was on curing the ills of the 1930s: unemployment, poverty and slum housing. Governments were committed to full employment and redistribution and were prepared to use controls 每 on money, goods and people 每 to deliver those goals. Conversely, there was little appetite for fighting cultural wars. Neither Harry Truman in the US nor Clement Attlee in Britain could be described as a social liberal.The second phase came in the 1960s, when the parties of the left backed both economic and social reform. In the US, it was the era of civil rights legislation and Lyndon Johnson＊s Great Society programmes to tackle poverty. In Britain, the  government had its National Plan for the economy but also gave a fair wind to changes Attlee never delivered: the abolition of capital punishment, the decriminalisation of homosexuality, legal abortions, easier divorce and the relaxation of censorship laws.The third and final phase of this process began in the mid-1970s. Parties of the left gradually accepted defeat in the economic war and devoted their energies to winning the cultural war instead. It was taken as a given that the focus of macro-economic policy should be control of inflation rather than full employment. It was accepted that there should be as few impediments to free markets as possible, with government intervention limited to tackling any short-term problems that might arise. Curbs on trade unions introduced by parties of the right were not rolled back. Globalisation was seen as an unstoppable force that ruled out the interventionist policies of the past. Instead, the Democrats in the US and Labour in the UK limited themselves to topping up poverty wages and argued that the answer to jobs being shipped overseas was for the newly unemployed to get better qualifications.As a result, parties of the left had nothing to say when the financial crisis of 2008 exposed the weaknesses of globalised finance, debt-fuelled growth and trickle-down economics. They could point to some notable victories in the culture wars 每 reforms that have made the US and the UK much more tolerant countries than they were three or four decades ago. But under depression conditions that has not been enough. The failure to articulate an alternative economic strategy has led to the erosion of political support in their old heartlands, where disenchanted voters feel ignored and despised.What that means is that the political divide is now not really between left and right but between liberals who believe in free trade and free movement of people and populists who believe in the nation state and controls on the movement of goods, people and capital. That, too, has echoes of the 1930s."															
"onald Trump＊s surprise election as the 45th president of the US has spawned a cottage industry of election postmortems and predictions in the US and abroad. Some correlate Trump＊s victory with a broader trend toward , and, in particular, , exemplified by the UK＊s vote in June to leave the European Union. Others focus on Trump＊s appeal as an outsider, capable of disrupting the political system in a way that his opponent, the former secretary of state and consummate insider Hillary Clinton never could. There may be something to these explanations, particularly the latter. But there is more to the story.In the months preceding the election, the mainstream media, pundits and pollsters kept repeating that Trump had an extremely narrow path to victory. What they failed to recognize was the extent of economic anxiety felt by working-class families in key states, owing to the dislocations caused by technology and globalization.But, as I  two months before the election, those frustrations were far-reaching, as was the sense of being ignored and left behind 每 and it was Trump who finally made that group feel seen. That is why I recognized the possibility of a Trump upset, despite Clinton＊s significant lead in the polls (five points, just before the election).And an upset is what happened. Trump narrowly won states that Republicans had not won in decades (Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania), and won big in usually closely contested Ohio.In fact, Republicans secured a broad victory. The party retained control of the Senate, even though more than twice as many Republican seats were up for re-election than Democratic seats, and it lost just a handful of House seats, far fewer than the 20 predicted. Moreover, the Republicans now control 33 governorships, compared with 16 for the Democrats, and have expanded their already large majorities in state legislatures. Now talk has turned from the impending implosion of the Republican party to the repudiation, disarray and bleak future prospects of the Democrats.Since the election, Trump has moved quickly to assert himself. Republicans, even those who opposed Trump during the campaign, have coalesced behind him. Meanwhile, the Democrats in government 每 most notably Barack Obama 每 have largely echoed Clinton＊s gracious  that Trump should be given an opportunity to lead.The US election＊s unexpected outcome holds four key lessons, applicable to all advanced democracies.First, growth beats redistribution. Clinton＊s barely discussed economic plan was to expand Obama＊s left-leaning agenda, so that it looked more like the socialism of her opponent in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders. Higher taxes for the wealthy, together with more ※free§ (taxpayer-paid) services, was, she argued, the best route to combating inequality.Trump, by contrast, hammered home messages about jobs and incomes. Though the media almost exclusively covered his most hyperbolic and controversial statements, it was largely his economic message that won him support. People want hope for a better future 每 and that comes from rising incomes, not from an extra government-issued slice of the pie.The second lesson concerns the risk of dismissing, let alone condescending to, voters. From the start, Clinton was not broadly liked. Revelations during the campaign 每 for example, that, in a , she had said that ※deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs, and structural biases have to be changed§ to secure women＊s reproductive and other rights 每 reinforced fears that she would push too progressive a social agenda.Recognizing these shortcomings, Clinton tried to win the election by making Trump unacceptable. But her  that half of Trump＊s supporters belonged to a ※basket of deplorables§ 每 that they were racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic 每 reinforced the impression that she and her party looked down on Trump voters as morally contemptible and even stupid. Such statements could well have pushed some undecided voters to decide against Clinton.The third lesson is that a society＊s capacity to absorb rapid change is limited. When technological progress and globalization, not to mention social and cultural change, outpace people＊s ability to adapt, they become too jarring, disruptive and overwhelming. Many voters 每 not just in America 每 also fret over terrorism and immigration, especially in combination with these rapid changes.Add to that concerns about America＊s growing opioid epidemic and a tedious and intolerant form of political correctness, and, for many, change did not look like progress. If democratic political systems do not find ways to ease transitions, provide shock absorbers, and accept heterodox attitudes and values without condemnation, voters will push back.The final lesson relates to the danger of the ideological echo chamber. The repeated claim by shocked Clinton voters that no one they knew voted for Trump reveals the extent to which too many people 每 Republicans as well as Democrats 每 live in social, economic, informational, cultural and communication bubbles.Falling trust in national media, combined with a proliferation of internet communication, has created a world where the news people read is often created with the goal of ※going viral§, not informing the public; the result can barely be called news at all. Moreover, the information people see is often filtered, so that they are exposed only to ideas that reflect or reinforce their own. (The corollary with this online world is that, as Trump and Clinton discovered, we are all just one hack away from YouTube or WikiLeaks, cable news or talk radio, fame or infamy.)These developments undermine people＊s capacity to engage in informed, rational discussions, let alone debates, with those who have different perspectives, values or economic interests. Even universities, which are supposed to foster knowledge-sharing and spirited debate, are now suppressing it, for example by spinelessly rescinding speaking invitations to almost anyone that some group or another considers objectionable. When we fail to engage in such debates 每 when people choose ※safe spaces§ over tough discussions 每 we lose our best chance of building consensus on how to solve at least some of our societies＊ pressing problems.

"Tomorrow, Silicon Valley leaders will sit down for a summit with Donald Trump. Larry Page, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, and Sheryl Sandberg are all  to attend. The agenda is unknown, but the mood is likely to be tense. After all, tech executives overwhelmingly  Hillary Clinton and loudly  against the dangers posed by a Trump presidency. And Trump regularly lashed out at Silicon Valley on the campaign trail, bashing the industry for  hardware overseas and  foreign engineers.But tech has little to fear from Trump. If his cabinet appointments are any indication, he seems keen to govern as a free-market fundamentalist, cutting taxes and regulations to the bone. Trump＊s elevation of ultra-hawkish ex-generals to key cabinet posts also suggests that he will aggressively expand the sprawling surveillance state inherited from Obama. This is excellent news for companies like Palantir, which sell data analytics tools to the CIA, the NSA and other agencies. Palantir was co-founded by Peter Thiel, the billionaire who  to embrace Trump. Thiel now sits on the transition team, and has begun  a select circle of tech industry allies into Trump＊s orbit. He and his friends are likely to make lots of money. And that＊s only the low-hanging fruit. Depending on Trump＊s appetite for domestic repression, Silicon Valley may benefit from even bigger market opportunities. Building a registry of all Muslims in the United States, for instance, would require a fair bit of technical expertise and infrastructure. When The Intercept  nine big tech companies whether they would help create such a registry, only Twitter said no. The righteous indignation has receded, it seems.But there＊s another, deeper reason that tech and Trump will prove highly compatible. It＊s not merely that tech CEOs will thrive under Trump. It＊s that Trump embodies a particularly extreme version of the worldview that Silicon Valleyepitomizes.This worldview can be summarized in a single word: neoliberalism. Neoliberalism can mean many things, including an economic program, a political project, and a phase of capitalism dating from the 1970s. At its root, however, neoliberalism is the  that everything should be run as a business 每 that market metaphors, metrics, and practices should permeate all fields of human life. No industry has played a larger role in evangelizing the neoliberal faith than . Its entrepreneurs are constantly coming up with new ways to make more of our lives into markets. A couple of decades ago, staying in touch with friends wasn＊t a source of economic value 每 now it＊s the basis for a $350bn company. Our photo albums, dating preferences, porn habits, and most random and banal thoughts have all become profitable data sets, mined for advertising revenue. We are encouraged to see ourselves as pieces of human capital that must ceaselessly enhance our value 每 optimizing our feeds and profiles, hustling for follows and likes and swipes.If Silicon Valley is turning our personal lives into a business, then Trump hopes to turn our government into one. Like all of Trump＊s ideas, this isn＊t especially original. For decades, neoliberal politicians of both parties have promoted the notion that government should not only serve business, but operate like one. They＊ve argued that public services should be privatized, or at least model the ※efficiency§ of the private sector. They＊ve claimed that business is the highest form of human endeavor, and that the role of the state is to empower and emulate it.Indeed, these neoliberal ideas have become so dominant over the past four decades that they are shared by nearly all mainstream politicians. But no one has ever pushed them further than Trump. The basic recipe of Trumpism involves taking a coded or qualified political sentiment and making it as loud and unambiguous as possible. What other politicians express with a wink and a whisper, Trump yells at the top of his lungs. He turns subtext into text, makes explicit what was previously implied. Racism, misogyny, and Islamophobic fearmongering were all fixtures of American political life before Trump came along, but he articulated them with a bluntness seldom seen in conventional politics. Similarly, the neoliberal assumption that government should resemble business is widely held across the political spectrum. Yet Trump has taken it to an extreme, applying the logic of neoliberalism so literally as to be almost parody.Trump built his campaign around the premise that his chief qualification for the presidency was his success as a businessman. He promised to make America great again by bringing business discipline and dynamism to government. It＊s true that he often denounced the depredations of corporate America, lobbing populist salvos at free trade, outsourcing, and Wall Street for hurting working people. But his principal solution to these sins of business was always more business: he would cut deals with CEOs and foreign leaders, drawing on his talents as a negotiator to get American workers better terms. Since his victory, Trump has begun turning his campaign rhetoric into reality. He is making government look more like a business than ever before. He has created the  cabinet in history. He has selected  for secretary of labor, a  for secretary of treasury, and the  for secretary of state. He is also preparing to personally profit from the presidency,  to cut ties with his corporate empire. Trump will run government not merely like a business, but asa business.Liberals are quick to condemn these moves as further evidence that Trump is far outside the mainstream. They portray him as fundamentally foreign, a ※banana republic§ strongman whose rise to power was the result of a Russian plot. But the truth is that Trump is deeply, maximally American. He didn＊t import his politics from abroad, but simply followed the governing logic of American society through to its radical conclusion. The reason that 62 million Americans were prepared to entrust the presidency to a billionaire best known for playing a businessman on television is because they＊ve been absorbing the tenets of market absolutism their whole lives. Trump may have campaigned as an outsider, but his appeal was radically mainstream.Yet if Trump personifies neoliberal ideas, his victory also reflects a revolt against neoliberal policies. The uncaged capitalism fostered by neoliberalism has produced an era of spiraling inequality,  wages,  life expectancy, and an increasingly  political system that is more or less openly oligarchic. These things make people angry, and Trump used that anger to get himself elected. The irony is that Trump will only intensify the crisis that put him in power. His cure for the social catastrophe of neoliberalism is a stronger strain of neoliberalism. Trump is like a lunatic doctor who, after a treatment has nearly killed his patient, decides to double the dose in the hopes of a better result. Whether we survive depends on the political struggle ahead: not only in the streets and statehouses, but at the level of ideas. Defeating neoliberalism will require not just the creation of a movement, but the creation of a new common sense. At its heart must be the belief that democracy is a better way to organize society than markets 每 that some things are not for sale."															
"Italians are voting in a referendum on 4 December that is causing concern across Europe after the UK＊s vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump＊s US presidential election victory. The vote , the prime minister. However, the fallout from a no vote on Sunday could be economic and financial as well as political.Italy＊s vote is seen as the biggest threat to Europe since the . The fear is that a vote against the government could trigger a chain of events that might see Italy 每 a member of the EU since its inception 每 spiral out of the single currency.It is and it isn＊t. The referendum is about constitutional changes but is also seen as a vote of confidence in Renzi. The proposed changes to parliament are part of his attempts to modernise Italy, both politically and economically. Markets like Renzi＊s technocratic approach; they think he is needed to sort out the deep-seated problems of Italy＊s banks 每 the weakest in the eurozone 每 and are worried because he has .Markets fear that defeat for Renzi would trigger a general election that could result in power shifting to the . An anti-establishment party formed by former standup comedian , it has suggested it would call a referendum on membership of the EU.※With a wave of elections in  in 2017, such a shift in sentiment would undermine political integration and increase demand for national sovereignty,§ said analysts at Jefferies.Pretty much everything.  has an unemployment rate of 11% and living standards have barely grown since the country became a founder member of the single currency 15 years ago.Nine years after the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, output remains 8% down on its pre-crash level. Shweta Singh, of Lombard Street Research, said Italy＊s weakness since the turn of the millennium was the result of three factors: a slow takeup of new information technology; the inability of the government to devalue the currency to restore competitiveness; and the challenge posed by China in many of the markets where Italy has traditionally been strong. ※Italy＊s share of global exports has plummeted,§ Singh said. ※Since the turn of the century, Italy has lost more market share than most developed countries, including those in the euro area.§They are in ※terrible shape§, according to Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index. The country＊s banking system is fragmented, with more branches than restaurants dotted across its high streets. They are weighed down by 360bn (?305bn) of bad debts. The industry took too long to tackle the mountain of bad debts and by the time the regulators wanted action a change in EU rules meant it was difficult to set up a ※bad bank§. Renzi is credited with helping devise a solution, creating a  fund 每 known as Atlante 每 for the industry. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the world＊s oldest bank, is also one of European weakest after  showed its financial strength would be sapped if markets came under strain. A bailout plan is in train.The anxiety is that the banks will crumble. Brooks said: ※If [Renzi] loses the referendum and resigns, then the big question for traders will be if the bailout plan still stands. If not, then eight of Italy＊s lenders could be at risk of collapse. ※Due to the interconnectedness of the global banking system, and the weakness of some other European lenders , a collapse in Italy＊s banking system could lead to intense pressure on global financial stocks in the aftermath of a no vote.§Almost certainly. The ECB buys 80bn of eurozone bonds each month and in the short term would make buying Italian bonds a priority. That might limit the upward movement in bond yields 每 the interest paid on government debt. The European commission would also be under pressure to soften rules that put restrictions on individual governments bailing out their banks.Almost certainly not. There might be a relief rally and the shares of Unicredit and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena could bounce after recent selling, but the problems of the Italian economy and the country＊s banking system will remain. The key issue of whether Italy can live with the pressures of eurozone membership will be unresolved."															
"Katie Allen poses three crucial questions on how to improve Britain＊s productivity (, 28 November). Namely how it links in with low pay, how it interacts with working hours, and what it tells us about the importance of staff taking ownership of their work.I have put a proposal to the government that sets out to cover each of these points. I have proposed a network of public employment services, driven locally by Jobcentre Plus and sustained by City Deal funding, with the specific aim of helping low-paid workers to climb the earnings ladder and craft their jobs to match their skills and circumstances.Its main benefit to workers would be the provision by a dedicated caseworker of information, advice and guidance, as part of a clear and agreed contract which is aimed at helping them earn more money and improve their working lives 每 be it through altering their hours, negotiating a pay increase, taking advantage of local childcare services or discounts on public transport, gaining specialist skills, or finding work elsewhere for which their circumstances are better suited.The government＊s own in-work service is currently being piloted among a limited group of universal credit claimants only. To help solve the productivity puzzle in which our country finds itself, a more comprehensive offer is required to help change the nature of low-paid work.  that in the real world a German worker takes four days to make what we make in five. This is a heavy burden to put on to a metric that is just one big number (GDP) divided by another (workers). It is like saying that people have on average 1.99 legs, ie technically true perhaps, but quite hard to find an example and not very helpful.Given the same tools and the same task, I＊m sure a British worker is just as productive as a German one. What brings our average productivity down is a higher proportion of people in low-paid work, and a long-term failure to invest in capital equipment. Proper sectoral analysis is required, not eye-catching headlines which just make us feel inadequate to the?modern world.Whether it is right to reward the worker for making more widgets by using a better machine is a different question 每 perhaps the return on capital should go to the business owner. But while you can always mothball an underperforming factory, at a national level you can＊t just mothball a workforce. Even Henry Ford knew he needed paying customers to buy his cars. Productivity in the UK car industry matches or exceeds the best elsewhere in Europe. Productivity while selecting parcels in a warehouse would be much lower due to the large number of people employed on zero-hours contracts, which will still have to be taken into account when calculating productivity. Crudely average the two and you have a misleading view of the UK economy. Only by analysing the economy sector by sector will we identify where attention is needed, either by better training or legislation to outlaw poor employment practices.  Gaby Hinsliff is wrong (, 25 November). Many retired people wonder how they ever had time for work. I recall that, over 30 years ago, predictions of a ※leisured age§ led to the view that society should prepare for a reduced working week. Recent articles (eg , Aditya Chakrabortty, 22 November) and diminishing opportunities for even skilled work suggest, in respect of work, the predictions were correct. Yet there is increased necessity for employment. Both partners in a family work to make ends meet, pension age is increasing, people resort to spurious ※self-employment§, and graduates undertake unpaid internships. What went wrong?The cause is concentration of the benefit from automation into the hands of the elite. Business heads＊ rewards are disproportionate to their workforce.Shared more equally, the need for full-time work should diminish. Equalisation in pay levels, coupled with redistributive taxes, could allow provision of a basic income sufficient to permit a shorter working week. The old-age pension could disappear. Anyone could continue working at occupations they enjoy, or which are their own rewards, but financial reward should not be the principal stimulus for any undertaking. Pay differentials and ※capitalist§ methods of earning could remain, but rewards would be appropriately taxed so that no one was?forced into full-time employment. What creativity might be unleashed.Utopian? Perhaps, but to avoid the conflict predicted by George Monbiot (, 23?November) we must reverse the present ※survival of the richest§ and reduce the need to work in order to live. In the 1970s there was considerable discussion about what society should do to cater for all the ※leisure time§ that would arise when repetitive processes were automated and made more efficient. However, in that age of the welfare state and fairer taxation it was assumed that the benefits of automation would be to a significant extent shared.However, along came Thatcher and Reagan with authoritarian monetarist economics (which in an Orwellian misuse of language is now referred to as ※liberal economics§), and in particular the tax race to the bottom so that, as technological advance means we have become much more efficient at producing the goods and food we need, the benefits have been retained by an ever decreasing minority, while the incomes of the majority have stagnated, or even regressed, for the last 40 years.With an ever smaller workforce required to produce the products we need, unless we can reverse the trend back to redistributive taxation, and accept that not everyone can contribute directly to material wealth creation (but still want and need a good share of that wealth), I think George Monbiot＊s prediction that we are heading towards major conflict is almost inevitable. If there is going to be less employment in those areas where robots will replace manpower, can someone explain our governments＊ arguments for more immigrants to do ※the jobs we don＊t want to do§. There is a contradiction here. If this doomsday theory is right, encouraging the arrival of immigrants from other parts of the world can only lead to a nightmare scenario of more people turning to extremist parties, social problems and social unrest when jobs and homes go."															
"Donald Trump has nominated Steven Mnuchin, a  banker-turned-Hollywood movie financier with no government experience, as US Treasury secretary.Mnuchin, a multimillionaire who was dubbed a ※foreclosure king§ for buying up distressed mortgages and evicting thousands of homeowners during the financial crisis, immediately announced he would oversee ※the largest tax change since Reagan§ and said his ※No 1 priority is tax reform§. As well as cutting personal taxes, Mnuchin said the US corporate tax rate would be reduced from 35% to 15%. ※By cutting corporate taxes, we＊re going to create huge economic growth and we＊ll have huge personal income,§ he said in an  with CNBC. ※We＊re going to get to 15% and bring a lot of cash back into the US.§Mnuchin said ※taxes are way too complicated§ and people spend ※way too much time worrying about ways to get them lower§. He claimed that the proposed tax cuts would allow the  to achieve an annual growth rate of 3% to 4%.Independent experts have said Trump＊s proposed tax changes will , while having little benefit, if any, for up to 8 million of the poorest families in the US.Trump described Mnuchin as a ※world-class financier, banker and businessman§ who would have a ※key role in developing our plan to build a dynamic, booming economy that will create millions of jobs§.The appointment of Mnuchin appears to fly in the face of Trump＊s campaign message chastising members of the business elite for causing the US＊s ills and attacking Hillary Clinton for .Mnuchin, 53, will replace the current Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, who spent most of his career in government or academia. Mnuchin will become the first career banker to take on the high-powered post since former Goldman chief executive Hank Paulson was appointed by George W Bush in 2006 and ran the US Treasury during the 2007-08 financial crisis.He is worth an estimated $40m (?32m) and was in charge of raising funds for Trump＊s successful election campaign. He was selected in preference to contenders including Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the house financial services committee, Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, and David McCormick, the president of asset management company Bridgewater Associates. The appointment must be confirmed by the Senate. Mnuchin is the second Goldman alumnus appointed to a top position in Trump＊s White House. Steve Bannon, the chairman of ※alt-right§ ( a far-right movement in the US) website Breitbart News, who ran Trump＊s campaign, . He had previously worked as a mergers and acquisitions banker for Goldman.During the campaign,  that portrayed the Goldman chairman and chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, as the personification of the global elite, saying he had ※robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities§.Trump could be about to add a third Goldman banker to his top team, with Gary Cohn, the bank＊s president, being reportedly considered for the post of director of the Office of Management and Budget, in which role he would prepare the federal budget. Cohn, who has long been seen as heir apparent to Blankfein as Goldman CEO, met the president-elect at Trump Tower on Tuesday. Several sources told DC blog  that the pair discussed a potential role for Cohn in the administration, including as OMB director. Adam Hodge, the communications director at the Democratic National Committee, said: ※So much for draining the swamp. [Mnuchin] preyed on homeowners struggling during the recession.§He said Mnuchin＊s appointment was ※a slap in the face to voters who hoped he [Trump] would shake up Washington§.Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts democratic senator, called Mnuchin ※the Forrest Gump of the financial crisis§ because he ※managed to participate in all the worst practices on Wall Street§ during his lengthy career.※His selection as Treasury secretary should send shivers down the spine of every American who got hit hard by the financial crisis, and is the latest sign that  has no intention of draining the swamp and every intention of running Washington to benefit himself and his rich buddies,§ she said.Mnuchin had been nicknamed the ※foreclosure king§ after buying up the remains of IndyMac, a California-based mortgage lender that collapsed in 2008, and evicting people who had trouble keeping up with their mortgage repayments.

The younger Mnuchin worked at Goldman for 17 years, rising to become a partner before leaving to launch film financing company Dune Capital Management, which has invested in several of Rupert Murdoch＊s 21st Century Foxblockbusters, including Avatar.

Ross has also plunged into holdings of textiles and coal, at one time controlling 1.2bn tons of US coal reserves.Trump also selected Todd Ricketts, a billionaire and co-owner of the Chicago Cubs, for deputy secretary of commerce.

" will deliver his spring budget against the backdrop of a weak pound, rising inflation and growing worries about a squeeze on households.The chancellor is expected to unveil a brighter outlook for growth than at the time of his autumn statement in November. The public finances are also looking in better shape. But with the UK poised to trigger article 50, Hammond has indicated he  to help weather Brexit uncertainties. Here are six key charts to consider before he delivers his budget at about 12.30pm.The economy defied people who had predicted a downturn in the wake of the Brexit vote and instead ended 2016 with . That is likely to put Hammond in the welcome position of announcing a brighter outlook for 2017 growth when he unveils the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in his budget speech. In November, the OBR forecast the economy would grow 1.4% in 2017 and economists say it could nudge that up to reflect the strong momentum at the end of last year.The UK＊s economy was one of the fastest growing in the G7 group of leading industrial countries in 2016. But economic forecasters say rising inflation and Brexit uncertainty are expected to dent growth this year, knocking the UK down the rankings.  from the leading thinktank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) see UK growth slowing to just 1% in 2018. That would be the weakest performance since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009. Note:  when not adjusting for the number of working days.

"In your report on IPPR＊s analysis of the challenges facing Britain in the 2020s you rightly highlight some of the more alarming trends (). But the report＊s argument is that these trends are likely, but not inevitable. As a society there is little we can do about an ageing population or the growth of Asian economies, but there is everything we can do about rising inequality, pressures on health and social care services and the loss of jobs from automation. There are public policies which can meet these challenges if our democracy can summon the imagination and ambition to choose?them.Over the next two years the IPPR Commission on Economic Justice will be seeking to show how this can be done. Larry Elliott, your Economics Editor, suggests that one explanation for the UK＊s deterioration in productivity is the shrinkage of the financial sector (). I contend that the financialisation of our economy is a root cause of our productivity malaise. Consider, for example, that the UK has some 586,000 members of the major accounting bodies, more than the rest of the European Union put together (France and Germany each have roughly 34,000). My imagination has failed me in identifying how bean-counting to such a degree benefits productivity. Suggestions welcomed."															
"I began studying economics at night school in Leeds in the 1950s and continued, at various institutions, as an external student of London University. Our courses were broadly, but not uncritically, Keynesian. We abjured fancy equations and sprinkled our essays with phrases like ※a tendency to§ and ※pressure towards§ this or that as a consequence of some other event. As a teacher I have tried to keep reasonably up to date, and learned in the early 70s, for example, to regard most monetarist nonsense as the fantasies of ※Friedmaniacs§.With this background, and aware of the influence on our leaders of Oxford＊s PPE (philosophy, politics and economics) course, I have often wondered what on earth they taught them. Andy Beckett＊s article (, 23 February) gives the answer. PPE graduates are ※intellectually flexible§. Or, to put it another way, they sway with the wind. And the winds of monetarism and arrogant attempts to make human behaviours as subject to mathematical predictions as the laws of physics, have captured economics academia for the past 40 years. Conservative, Labour and, to our eternal shame, Liberal Democrats have been equally culpable, as the damage done to the bottom 20% in this country, and to 80% of the population of Greece, so clearly demonstrates.Those who wish to know what＊s really going on in our economy, and how to put things right, could study my own humble blog , or the more authoritative writings of  (Bristol) and the  blog of Simon Wren-Lewis (Cambridge). I used to believe that PPE ran Britain until I came up to study at Oxford. After milling around at socials held by the Oxford Union and all the political party societies, I found that a vast array of subjects were represented among the politicians, lawyers and hedge fund managers of tomorrow. Historians and classicists can be just as machiavellian as any PPEist.I＊d argue that the people who have damaged politics today are the following: a classicist from Balliol (Boris Johnson), an English student from Lady Margaret Hall (Michael Gove), and a linguist (Alastair Campbell), like myself. However, the reason for the linguist＊s misdeeds must lie in the fact that he went to Cambridge. In Thomas Hardy＊s 1895 novel Jude the Obscure, the master of Biblioll College writes to the ambitious stonemason: ※I venture to think that you will have a much better chance of success in life by remaining in your own sphere and sticking to your trade.§ But Blair＊s , keen on middle-class appeal, distanced itself, so there was no intake of working-class MPs, according to Geoff Evans on Newsnight. But, he also said, voters prefer politicians with a point of social contact with themselves. So another difficult inheritance for Jeremy Corbyn. It＊s worth noting that PPE graduates have failed to run a UK economy to benefit everybody. Fortunately, John McDonnell has a union background, is working class and didn＊t do PPE at Oxford. Britain is run by PPE graduates. That is why they sign up for PPE. But the most popular optional courses when I retired 每 international relations in the era of the cold war; politics in the Middle East; politics in sub-Saharan Africa 每 appear to fall below the radar of ambitious political elites. As a PPE tutor between 1975 and 2010, I escaped teaching any of the numerous graduates listed, though Andrew Glyn and I once combined lectures on Marx＊s Capital. As a 1967 Balliol dropout from the PPE degree, I have a thought to add to Andy Beckett＊s immense list of critiques. That course tended to repress anything to do with emotion. The approach to politics was hyper-rational with a materialist focus. How people felt and how that might influence political behaviour was totally absent. Imagination and creativity were despised as ※arty-farty§. Hence the political emotions were for the dons. As for the philosophy, the accent was strongly on logic (analytical philosophy, I mean). Nowadays, there is still a struggle to recognise that issues of meaning, purpose, individuation and the psyche constitute the political. As for me, I am now a Jungian psychoanalyst in practice who also writes about citizenship and the inner life. Reacting against something can often be quite creative. Oh, and I＊m also a professor 每 dropping back in. ※The degree that runs Britain§. Surely there is an ※I§ missing in that headline. It＊s not PPE 每 Miliband, Balls, Jenkins 每 that＊s the problem.

It was fuelled by domestic demand as government and consumer spending rose.Germany proved the International Monetary Fund wrong, after . Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said the economies of both countries had turned out a decent performance last year, and pointed out that UK growth of 0.7% had outpaced Germany in the fourth quarter. He said: ※UK economic growth in 2016 was fractionally below that of Germany 每 no longer the fastest growing in the G7. In the big scheme of things 0.1 percentage points between friends isn＊t something that anyone is going to notice. And if anyone wanted to pick a fight, you are only as good as your last game and the UK scored 0.7% growth in the fourth quarter. Both economies are doing pretty well and survey indicators for [each] suggest more good news early 2017.§Germany＊s statistics office, Destatis, described the country＊s economy as ※solid and steady§. The figures suggested German consumers had so far shrugged off the uncertainty created by .In the final quarter, government spending in Germany rose 0.8%, and household spending increased by 0.3%. Trade was a drag on GDP however, as the 3.1% growth in imports outpaced exports growth of 1.8%.Economists said growth in 2017 was likely to be slower than the 1.9% achieved in 2016. The German government is forecasting growth of 1.4% this year.Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital , said: ※German GDP was growing at a healthy pace at the end of last year, driven mainly by consumer spending. While business surveys suggest that growth will accelerate further in the near term, March＊s dip in consumer confidence may be an early sign of a slowdown in spending to come. In all, the German economy remains in good health. But we doubt that it will go from strength to strength.§A strong economic backdrop has helped Germany post a record budget surplus of 23.7bn in 2017, fuelled by higher tax revenues, rising employment and low debt costs. It was the highest budget surplus since reunification in 1990 and the third successive year the government has had a budget surplus. Olga Tschekassin, an economist at Barclays, said government and state spending would continue to be the main drivers of growth in the coming quarters. ※However, external factors such as Brexit and US trade policy, and a series of upcoming elections in the euro area, will likely increase uncertainty and could harm investment.§"															
															
"The government of near-bankrupt  faces the threat of a forced devaluation of the country＊s currency and an end to fuel subsidies, in a move that could spark a wave of popular anger and the fall of the teetering UN-backed administration in Tripoli.The credibility of Fayez al-Serraj＊s government of national accord (GNA) is waning despite the support of the US, France, Italy and the UK, and its leadership has been unable to unite the country.Over the weekend the Libyan dinar collapsed 7% against the US dollar and for the first time was trading at six to the dollar on the black market. The official rate is 1.4 dinars to the dollar (1.74 to the pound).Western leaders and financial institutions including the  intervened directlyintervene directly in Libyan economic decision-making this month, bringing politicians and technocrats to meetings in Europe to hammer out an agreement., it was agreed that a Libyan economic plan for 2017 would be published by 1 December. It is likely to include as yet unspecified measures on the currency and the lifting of fuel subsidies.Serraj has been trying to oust the central bank governor, Saddek al-Kabir, who has resisted Serraj＊s demands to release funds to help fund his government and public services. The Tripoli-based central bank has derided Serraj for having no policy to fix the economy, and defended its duty to protect the currency. Kabir argues for the restoration of oil production and exports, the source of 95% of the government＊s revenues.Western pressure forced the central bank to release $6bn (?4.9bn) to the government to pay salaries, and to fund electricity credits and the national oil corporation. A flow chart has been agreed setting out the steps the government has to take to receive funds and where they will be spent.Bank queues, lack of medical supplies and electricity blackouts have become daily features of life in Libya. Three years ago, foreign exchange reserves were above $100bn, but they are expected to be $43bn by the end of this year.Oil production has crept up to 600,000 barrels a day, but the ongoing civil war and competition to control pipelines, production facilities and terminals mean plans to raise production to 1.1m barrels next year are fragile.Libya＊s cumulative GDP losses since 2011 are at calculated to have been more than $200bn, arguably making the country the worst-hit from the political upheavals caused by the Arab spring.Serraj has said a devaluation of the dinar is inevitable and argued it is necessary to reduce the deficit, increase the value of oil reserves and ensure a much needed flow of funds into the banks. He understands, however, that the measure would be unpopular because it would raise the cost of imports, and that he may not have the political capital to force it through.In the wake of his arrival in Tripoli in March 2016, Serraj＊s authority, never strong outside the capital, has dwindled. ※Trying to get the economy to move more smoothly is an absolute requirement in terms of the credibility of this government,§ said one western diplomat who has been working for months to persuade Libya＊s house of representatives to endorse Serraj＊s leadership team.Powerful factions in the east of the country, led by the Egyptian-backed general Khalifa Haftar, commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army, have resisted working with the Serraj government. He has won control of the Libyan oil crescent and driven out islamists from Benghazi, suggesting his claim to be a major player is strengthening.The UK remains committed to Serraj. ※He is a good man trying to do a very difficult job,§ said one British source. ※He is an architect thrust into one of the most difficult political jobs in the world. ※A fundamental obstacle in Libya is there is very little sense of national identity. The concept of negotiating and compromising for the greater good of the country is not something that comes naturally to people. The majority of the Libyans want the GNA to work.§The source said the state of the Libyan economy and the political impasse were feeding off each other.Kabir, a classic central bank governor, is reluctant to release funds to the government because of its lack of an economic plan. Until last week it had no finance minister. Given that the elected parliament has also refused to endorse the government, the central bank has argued it would be technically illegal under Libyan law to provide it with funds.The infighting has direct implications for the west. An estimated 4,600 refugees have died this year trying to reach Europe across the Mediterranean. More than 340 died last week when boats capsized after leaving Libya. The EU mission in Libya, , has not been given access to Libyan coastal waters, and is instead training a coastguard.Western diplomats say tens of thousands of refugees are being incarcerated in both government and smuggler camps, largely in desperate conditions to which diplomats have no real access. Islamic State fighters have largely been driven out of the coastal town of Sirte, but western sources say the complete absence of a Libyan intelligence service means no one has a clear idea of their current whereabouts."															
"Michael Gove＊s inspiration for including Tennyson＊s  in the new English GCSE syllabus is becoming clearer every day.Gove, one of Vote Leave＊s architects, understands the spirit running through British history that can result in episodes like Lord Cardigan＊s fatal Crimean attack, or the evacuation of Dunkirk in the second world war, being lauded as great episodes in history.In the last few days, everyone from Labour＊s John McDonnell to the president of the CBI have readied themselves to join the Tory Brexiters and charge into the cannon that lie in wait across the channel. They know ※someone had blunder＊d,§ and yet theirs is not to reason why: theirs is to stampede onwards.McDonnell, to the dismay of shadow Brexit minister Keir Starmer, urged his party last week to support the Tories on the European battleground to maximise the spoils from . CBI president Paul Drechsler says the only barrier to him and his members joining the surge to independence is an assurance from the government that transitional arrangements to whatever lies ahead will be put in place.Reading the poem, today＊s 15-year-olds might perhaps glean a deeper understanding of the psychology that lay behind the EU vote and the bloody-mindedness that meant so many Remainers joined the campaign. Gove can take some satisfaction in that.?Which brings us to the autumn statement this week, and what Philip Hammond will do to offset the worst effects of the uncertainty in the first instance, and the long-term damage thereafter, of leaving the EU.His focus must be helping low- and middle-income families to cope with rising prices. No 10 has impressed on the chancellor he must make life easier for those ※just about managing§.Hammond is likely to address this audience. He is expected to allow tax credits to rise in line with inflation and ease the rules that restrict the number of families who can make a claim.It＊s not his focus, though. He will want to talk about the bigger picture, and in particular how productivity increases are the basis for a thriving economy. He will say that the challenge given to him by the Brexit vote is to rebuild an economy that has come to depend too much on cheap labour and not enough on long-term investment.Official figures show that the level of output per person per hour increased by just 0.2% in the three month to the end of September, or less than 1% a year. In the same period, average wages increased from 2.3% to 2.4%. If productivity increases pay for wage rises, as most economists agree, then employers are now spending money that should be invested in new equipment on excessive wages.Over the longer term, productivity must increase if companies are not to shed jobs or go bust shelling out more on pay than they can afford.A study last week by the TUC, based on figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), showed that Britain ranks 20th out of 21 developed countries in spending on IT systems, 34th out of 34 for spending on transport equipment and 23rd out of 27 for investment in other types of machinery.Productivity gains are going to be thin on the ground when tech spending is so low, and when what there is largely restricted to the tech sector and the financial services industry.Hammond could spur some investment by widening the criteria used in the R&D tax credit to include the development of new processes and not just new equipment. These days much of the innovation that increases productivity comes wrapped in a data file that shows a different way of manufacturing a product or offering a service.Apprenticeships will also get more than just a mention. He will talk about the new levy on employers that will raise ?3bn a year for additional training programmes. But it is less clear how his money can be spent when many of those groups offering places on high-grade schemes say they cannot recruit enough candidates.This is not a foreign worker problem, but an education problem. Here＊s an example. The Engineering Employers Federation, which represents hundreds of manufacturers, has its own apprenticeship scheme in Birmingham for 350 16- to-17-year-olds. This year it had 8,500 applications, but was only able to offer 330 a place.Most failed to make the grade once their failure to score an A to C in either English or maths was recorded. Tim Thomas, then the EEF＊s director of employment, said the difficulties faced by firms can be seen in the maths re-sit figures, which show a two-thirds failure rate at A to C.This means that 152,000 students, who had just failed their maths GCSE, sat the test again and almost 114,000 couldn＊t get into the category that employers consider a pass. School failed them twice. The education department says it is on the case, but this has been going on for years. And with Further Education colleges shutting or merging under some of the most severe cuts planned for the next four years, another avenue for these children is fast closing.Most likely, their parents voted for Brexit: blaming immigrants when their target should have been a myopic government."

Key said the US was an important partner in the region but China would fill the void if a Trump administration backed away from free trade.The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, pledged at the Lima summit to pursue further economic openness regardless of Trump＊s policies. The Republican, who will take over from Barack Obama has attacked China for taking away US business and jobs.※China will not shut its door to the outside world but open more,§ Xi said in a keynote address. ※We＊re going to ＃ make sure the fruits of development are shared.§Following a meeting with Barack Obama in Lima, Xi said Beijing＊s relationship with Washington was at a ※hinge moment§ and called for a smooth transition.Obama has championed the TPP as a way to counter China＊s rise but has stopped trying to win congressional approval for the deal signed by 12 economies in the Americas and Asia-Pacific, excluding China. Without US approval, the current agreement cannot be implemented.Xi has been selling an alternate vision for regional trade by promoting the Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which as it stands excludes the Americas.With the , China＊s talks on RCEP, which include Australia, India and more than a dozen other countries, are seen as perhaps the only path to the broader Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) that Apec aspires to. The Obama administration has warned that the RCEP would not include strong protections for workers, the environment or intellectual property.The Australian prime minister, , told reporters of RCEP: ※It＊s a more traditional trade deal, reducing tariffs on goods and services. It＊s not as far-reaching as the TPP§.But ※the more access we can get to more markets for our exports, the better§, Turnbull said. Despite China＊s overtures, some Apec members were determined to press on with TPP and held out hopes the United States would still show leadership on trade. ※Our geopolitical position is with the United States, obviously,§ said the Mexican president, Enrique Pe?a Nieto. ※That＊s where our eyes are set and that＊s what we are working for.§Several Apec members said it was too soon to write off support from Trump on TPP. ※Barack Obama was not a supporter of the TPP when he became elected and he＊s leaving office as one of its greatest advocates,§ Turnbull said."															
"Will Hutton argues passionately and (for me) convincingly that free trade makes for greater wealth creation and protectionism will cause growth to slow down (, Comment). He＊s obviously right; the move towards increasing global trade has created wealth, especially in China, and we should be glad that it has raised millions of people out of poverty.However, he doesn＊t acknowledge the problem of distributing the wealth thus created. The world is awash with money but it has been very unequally distributed. Possession of so much money by people and institutions who can＊t possibly use it has created serious instability.We need to reform institutions in ways that prevent the unhealthy accumulation of wealth by minorities. Otherwise, we will see more catastrophes such as 2008 as the rich cast around for risky ways to use their wealth and more and more  and Trump votes as resentful populations seek to find somebody to blame for their diminished share of prosperity.  proposed one simple remedy; the  is another, as is international co-operation against tax havens and tax avoidance. So far, the political will to do any of these things is not strong and our government is sturdily in the anti-reform corner.ExeterWhile I would not argue with Will Hutton＊s assertion that trade is the lifeblood of humanity, or that automation and robotisation will not be prevented by protectionism, he fails to present a rational alternative. Put simply, where are the jobs coming from to pay the living expenses of that section of the population that depends on employment? The misconception made by the proponents of globalisation has been that the discarded can be disregarded. Taking away a man＊s job, before you take away his vote, is every bit as dangerous as taking away both at the same time.Trade agreements might well have benefited many, but the notion that more trade agreements will somehow benefit those already marginalised by previous agreements, is a horse without a jockey. It is the failure of neoliberalism, and of the financialisation of global trade that funded trade imbalances, which caused austerity.Remember, the  might have been enacted in America, but the consequences hit the fan in Germany. Today, Trump is a willing harbinger of coming conflicts.HenllanDenbighshireFew rational people would disagree with Will Hutton＊s assertion that ※exchange between countries brings prosperity and progress§. There is, however, a huge difference between unfettered free trade and fair trade.It would be wrong for Britain or the US to impose blanket trade tariffs that inhibit innovation in other countries or for us to protect our industries from competition with more efficient foreign producers.However, Hutton cannot be allowed to get away with suggesting globalisation has created ※prosperity and progress§ for all. In most cases, so-called free trade has simply involved a race to the bottom in pay rates across the world. That may be free trade, but it certainly isn＊t fair trade. A tiny proportion of the world＊s population have got ludicrously rich, while former manufacturing communities have declined into despair. We have sacrificed manufacturing jobs for cheap jeans and washing machines, made by people (often children) earning pittances with which we cannot fairly compete.Donald Trump＊s racism and misogyny are appalling. On the single issue of free trade, he is basically correct. What people on the left and centre-left should be asking is: how did two deeply rightwing, privileged mavericks on either side of the Atlantic become the ones to benefit from working-class anger? The left＊s support for measured trade tariffs that promote genuine competition, while protecting jobs from unfair competition, would be a welcome, if belated start.Norwich"															
" will be a cautious chancellor: that much is becoming clear. Not for him the fireworks that became a familiar sight whenever George Osborne presented a budget 每 some of which went off in his face.Hammond will be less concerned with manufacturing tricks designed to cheer his backbench colleagues than with the fate of . In this respect, he is the Conservative party＊s answer to Alistair Darling 每 an unflappable curator of the public finances, steering the economy through choppy waters.This means that on both sides of the house, MPs are braced for one of the dullest chancellorships in their lifetimes. They only have to look at Hammond＊s forgettable time as foreign secretary to know that the highs and lows could be indistinguishable.When he stands up to deliver his first autumn statement, on 23?November, Hammond will report that  through the Brexit turmoil, so the need for government action was limited.All the signs are that he will announce a smattering of relatively inexpensive infrastructure projects, mostly with repackaged money, and talk about some longer-range business tax reforms. He＊ll be keeping his powder dry until the March 2017 budget.By then, the Treasury will be in a better position to judge the impact of imported inflation 每 from higher costs for petrol, mobile phones, food and cars 每 and how well or badly the economy is responding.Inflation is the threat to living standards that lurks inside every economic model at the moment. It is the referendum-induced strychnine sent to poison family incomes.So far, the major forecasters vary in their verdict on the extent to which the low pound will push up prices in the shops. The National Institute for Economic & Social Research (NIESR) believes it will be a quick and dirty affair, with inflation rising rapidly to 4% before dropping back by 2019 to the Bank of England＊s 2% target.Threadneedle Street has outlined a smoother path, limiting inflation to 3% next year, but easing it back over the next three years and keeping it above the 2% target until at least 2020.Whichever path inflation follows, it will eat into wages and cut households＊ disposable incomes. , which is the first drop in household spending power for four years and would take the UK back to a time when this was an unhappy country.If wage rises stick at around 2% for the rest of the parliament, the Bank of England＊s forecast means there will be effectively no pay increase for the average worker until 2020.Hammond will not have forgotten that it was only in 2011 that several British cities experienced . He has pledged to loosen Osborne＊s spending restrictions, but the suspicion must be that, just like with his tentative support for the economy, households will be forced to manage on a few crumbs.There will be some extra money to top up universal credit payments. And government departments will get some extra cash to prevent their services from falling over.However,  is going to be his main concern. This forecast, from the Resolution Foundation thinktank, represents the widening gap between the Office for Budget Responsibility＊s March forecast and the likely outcome, and assumes a hard Brexit, soft austerity outcome.Such a shortfall will leave the budget deficit ?23bn shy of where Osborne expected it to be in 2020. So any extra spending will push the deficit even higher, say those urging caution.Last week the boss of NIESR, Jagjit Chadha, said international investors might make a run for the exit, selling UK government securities as they go, should the chancellor appear reckless. The warning, which echoes the post-2008 crash fears that cast Britain as the next Greece, envisages a fall in demand for government bonds and a subsequent increase in the interest rate the Treasury pays on government debt, only adding to the costs of Brexit.But just as in 2008, with the world awash with cash trying to find a safe home, it is difficult to see how the government will face more than a mild jolt to its borrowing costs, especially when Hammond would simply be increasing public investment budgets that were cut so brutally during Osborne＊s reign.Trade minister Liam Fox and his allies want to head off a spending splurge that would cement in the public＊s mind the costs of leaving the EU. ※There＊s no reason to panic,§ he said last week. ※If you go on a spending spree, then people will think there＊s a reason to panic.§But Fox is wrong, as he is about most things. Consumer confidence has started to fall again after a brief recovery in August and September. Sales of private car sales, for so long the engine of the economy, have fallen in every month since April. And this, according to official statisticians, is before higher import costs have fed through to the high street.What will Mr Cautious do about that? Take some sort of bold action?

New counter-establishment parties have emerged in several countries and, as in the UK, people have voted for dramatic change. Meanwhile, there＊s a growing sense in developed economies that workers have yet to benefit from the recovery or rising globalisation.Germany＊s economy has largely outperformed the wider eurozone in recent years. Its unemployment rate is low and youth unemployment is the lowest in EU. But not everyone feels they are getting the benefits of Germany＊s stand-out performance. Wage growth has been relatively modest, and anger has intensified recently over meagre returns on savings as the European Central Bank cut key interest rates into negative territory. That has exacerbated grievances some Germans have long held over the euro, a union they feel benefits poorer countries more than their own.Animosity towards the single currency was behind the . The party has since shifted to the right and enjoyed gains in regional elections by playing on fears over immigration and chancellor Angela Merkel＊s policy on refugees.After a prolonged squeeze on household incomes in the wake of the financial crisis and spending cuts, June＊s  was widely seen as being as much about frustration with the establishment as a decision to leave the EU. Ministers have repeatedly hailed Britain＊s rising employment and relatively strong economic growth, but a quick look behind the headline figures explains why such boasts have been met with disbelief by many. Employment is up, but a significant driver of this gain has been self-employment and other forms of insecure work such as zero-hours contracts, and employers have continued to rely on low-paid labour rather than investing to grow. A recent study by the Trades Union Congress,the umbrella body for British unions, found .Years on from the financial crisis, many French people feel they are not sharing in the recovery.  has come under fire for his handling of the economy and is France＊s . Unemployment remains above 10%, one of the highest rates in the EU. Youth unemployment is higher still, at 24%. The rebound in economic growth has been lacklustre.Many feel that globalisation is bringing more costs than benefits for France.  for Marine Le Pen＊s far-right Front National. Le Pen is seen as likely to reach the run-off in next year＊s presidential elections but, like her father in 2002, is expected to be defeated.Economic growth has been consistently disappointing in Italy and a succession of coalition governments has failed to push through reforms to help adapt the economy to a changing world. The International Monetary Fund warned recently that . Scope for Matteo Renzi＊s centre-left government to use tax cuts or increases in public spending to boost growth has been limited by low productivity, high unemployment and rising national debt.The country goes to the polls next month  that  and his allies argue will make the country easier to govern and reform. Similar to the Brexit vote in the UK, the referendum is being seen as a way for Italians to voice their general discontent with the establishment and the sluggish economy.A defeat for the prime minister could pave the way to a national election, with gains expected for comedian Beppe Grillo＊s anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Another populist force is the rightwing Northern League. It began as a party that argued for a separation of rich northern Italy from the poor south, but its focus has shifted to immigration.Russia＊s economy has been ravaged by recession and it is expected to shrink again this year, returning to only modest growth in 2017. The slump, intensified by western sanctions and low oil prices, has . The .The blow to energy-dependent Russia from global oil prices almost halving has limited the help it can give any part of the economy. But there is a feeling among many workers that their lives have become bleaker as high inflation erodes household incomes, while companies fared better thanks to state support and a weak rouble.This squeeze on the working classes has not manifested itself in the kind of new populist movements seen in EU countries. Russia expert Charles Movit at consultancy IHS  says: ※The media is totally controlled by the state in Russia and the tradition of strong leaders is ingrained. [President Vladimir] Putin himself is very popular, the government less so and the opposition is very weak.§"															
"t＊s not often you go to a conference on agriculture and come away feeling quite scared for the future. But this week＊s  featured a talk on the future of trade that painted a dire picture of trade barriers and nations moving into blocks that engage in trade wars and perhaps more violent conflicts. It was a stark warning to those who value the benefits of trade of the need to also value the concerns of those who miss out on those benefits.In a conference featuring the usual talks on innovation in agriculture and pest management, the Abare conference also featured a speech by  that had me 每 and most in the audience 每 wondering if it was time to start collecting canned food and building a bunker. His speech was on the changing nature of trade relations and how under the Trump presidency things might get rather precarious. While economists love trade, it has extremely political ramifications. And it is politics that in Every＊s view is driving the world back to a 19 century style trade world. A world where after a period of free trade, high tariffs were set up and where trade became a conflict involving domination of one country over another. And the problem is that economic conflict can quickly become real conflict. It was a scary prospect 每 not only would raising trade barriers reduce our standard of living 每 but if the path of the next 10 years follows the path of the late 1800s and early 1900s then the world gets very dangerous very quickly. The biggest difficulty for those selling the idea of free trade is that a soon as you start talking about things such as ※comparative advantage§ people quickly switch off. It＊s much easier to understand trade in what is known as a mercantilist sense 每 the ※domination§ point of view, where the aim is to export more than you import. That is certainly the view of Donald Trump and his trade advisor, Peter Navarro, who has  that because GDP is made up of consumption, government spending, investment and net exports (exports minus imports) reducing the US trade deficit is a good way to grow the US economy. The problem with that view is that in the US 每 as in Australia 每 the size of net exports pales in comparison to consumption, investment and government spending. That doesn＊t mean exports are not important 每 currently exports are a leading driver of Australia＊s GDP growth 每 but if your focus is just on reducing the trade deficit by lowering imports, then you will actually harm the economy because we use imports to produce things. You want net exports to grow because you are producing more exports or getting more tourists or foreign students, not because you are making imports more expensive. The best way to improve economic growth is by increasing the participation of people in the workforce and by having those people be better at producing things 每 i.e. increasing productivity. Trade is actually very good at increasing productivity because it forces local companies to compete with those overseas and also allows them to import items they need at a cheaper cost.And the benefits of trade need not just be about Australia exporting more than another nation. If trade enables a poorer nation to become stronger economically that can help us in the long run because, as we have seen with China, a growing middle class in that nation can be a boon for us. But of course trade is not all about winners. Michael Every gave the example of a parent with two children 每 one who was good at cleaning bookshelves and general dusting, and another who was good at cleaning toilets. An efficient parent would have each child do the chore that they were best at, but clearly the child cleaning the toilets might soon think this unfair. In response the parent might offer other rewards to that child to compensate for doing the less enjoyable work.We don＊t have a world government that can replicate this and so some nations end up with the international trade equivalent of cleaning toilets with no real recompense.But the analogy can also work within individual nations, where the children both end up cleaning the toilets and the parents hire a cleaner to come in and do the dusting. In a real-world sense this is when workers shift to jobs that pay less, or have less permanency, fewer hours, but a greater requirement to work weekends. In an economy-wide sense this can be good. It can see workers being more productive 每 as trade forces local firms to compete with the rest of the world, and also see workers move to industries in which Australia is most productive. But unless workers are receiving the benefits of this greater productivity, the system breaks down and talks of the wonders of trade will get pretty short shrift. Is it any wonder that the US has turned more protectionist when, as  out this week highlighted, the wages of workers since 1980 have not kept up with their productivity improvements?Had the wages of US workers risen in line with productivity, as occurred from the end of the second world war until 1980, an American now earning around $40,000 would instead be on $61,000.The problem has been that those arguing for the benefits of freer trade have too often also been those arguing for the benefits of smaller government, lower welfare and less workplace regulation 每 such as minimum wages and penalty rates. And it is easy to see why 每 free trade has a nice pro-business aspect, and can sucker you into thinking that greater competition and the free market will cure all 每 especially if you look to GDP numbers to validate your position. But as Every noted, trade is as much about politics as it is about economics. The economics of free trade work best at a national GDP level; the politics of free trade is personal and local. Those politicians who wish to avert the high protection and militarily belligerent state of the late 19 century need to focus less on trying to convince voters of the goodness of free trade and more on ensuring the benefits of it are distributed equally. Let us hope it is not too late. "															
"The US Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates next week for only the third time since the financial crisis after the latest job numbers for the world＊s largest economy beat expectations.The closely watched Labor department data for February showed that the number of new jobs soared to 235,000, the best month for job growth  last year, adding to pressure on the central bank to agree the first of three predicted rises this year.Officials meet on Wednesday in the wake of strong employment, manufacturing and consumer data that should persuade the Fed to add further to its December rate rise, which saw the cost of borrowing raised by 0.25% to a range of between 0.5% and 0.75%., covering the first full month of his administration, as a personal victory, despite the momentum clearly springing from the legacy of his predecessor, Barack Obama.Trump  the assessment of conservative outlet the Drudge Report, which was: ※GREAT AGAIN.§ Earlier this week, Trump had welcomed high jobs estimates from the payroll processor ADP as being part of his project to ※make America great again§.※Great news. We are only just beginning. Together, we are going to !§ Trump  on Wednesday, his optimistic tone showing a marked change from last month＊s press conference in which he claimed to have inherited ※many problems across government and across the economy§.Higher interest rates are expected to push up the value of the dollar and suck in foreign funds to the US financial system. Surveys show firms are concerned that the high dollar will dent exports, and Trump has accused China and rival exporting nations of winning trade wars after artificially depressing their currencies.The  is now in its 77th consecutive month of growth. Last month＊s figures were also stronger than expected, with 227,000 jobs added in January. For December, the last full month of Obama＊s term in office, the economy added 178,000 jobs.Economists welcomed the figures, though many warned that wages growth of 2.8% failed to indicate that the economy was overheating.Kathleen Brooks, research director at spreadbetting firm City Index, said: ※While this jobs data is solid enough, it is not too hot to force the Fed to embark on more than three rate hikes this year, which is what the market expects.§ Gus Faucher, chief economist at financial services group PNC,  that the ※underlying trends for the economy now are similar to those in 2016§, when there was consistently strong jobs growth. John Cannally of stockbroker LPL  that the market ※may begin to price in§ the expected rate hikes this year.※Today, the Fed cleared the last small obstacle on its way to a now virtually certain interest rate rise next week,§ , senior economist at consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, takes place 14-15 March.Unemployment was down slightly in the new figures from 4.8% to 4.7%, and the number of people unemployed for longer than 27 weeks declined slightly. Black unemployment was nearly double white unemployment, 8.1% to 4.1%. The latter had decreased; the former had not.The preliminary analysis by ADP celebrated by Trump earlier in the week found that the US economy had grown in key sectors and that many of the jobs added were in well-paid, desirable fields. Its estimated figures are usually high 每 this time they were more than 60,000 jobs north of the actual figures 每 but its breakdown of the statistics is widely respected and caused analysts who had predicted some slowdown to revise figures upward.Trump＊s supporters continue to watch for the president to make good on his promise to bring back US manufacturing jobs, which were up for the month: other drivers of growth were construction, private educational services, manufacturing, healthcare and mining.Also among the less-praised drivers of economic growth is the Affordable Care Act, Obama＊s signature healthcare legislation, which Trump and congressional Republicans aim to repeal, said Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based thinktank. There is ※more voluntary part-time employment because people can now work part-time and get health insurance,§ Gould said, ※and then you also see more people self-employed for the same reasons; they have some of the economic risk moved off them.§Still, there are several pockets of stagnation in the Trump economy, and those, too, stem from the Obama era. ※Public sector employment is still lower now than it was when the recession began,§ Gould observed. ※There was this pursuit of austerity, and that pursuit has put a chokehold on the speed of the recovery. If you look at one of the essential groups of workers in our economy, public school teachers, we have fewer than we did when the recession began. And we know for certain there are more kids.§"															
"he latest US jobs report removes any lingering doubts about whether the will raise interest rates next week.Following news that the world＊s biggest economy generated 235,000 net new non-farm jobs in February, it is a bolt-on certainty that the central bank will push up the cost of borrowing by a quarter of a point.It is now almost 10 years since the start of the financial crisis ushered in a period of ultra-low interest rates and it has been clear for a while that the Fed is anxious to speed up the normalisation process. A healthy labour market is the key to that process and it would have taken a shockingly bad report to stay the bank＊s hand. This was not it.Indeed, the financial markets have already moved on from next week to musing about how many more times the Fed will tighten during the course of 2017. The feeling is that two more rate rises are in prospect.It certainly seems unlikely that next Wednesday＊s rise will be the end of the matter. The report from the showed employment up by more than the 190,000 expected by Wall Street and unemployment at 4.7%. Annual wage growth is running at 2.8%.Policymakers at the Fed will look at this data and conclude that inflationary pressures are building as the economy approaches full employment. With US productivity so weak, the central bank will certainly be tempted to move again if and when earnings growth hits 3%.There was plenty for  to welcome. A mild winter has resulted in a big increase in construction jobs. Manufacturing employment was also up. The only weak spot was retailing.The  but fiscal easing will mean more aggressive tightening from the Fed, which is already starting to fret about the risks of the economy overheating.A couple of things are worth noting. Even after the much-anticipated move next Wednesday official interest rates in the US will still be below the current core inflation rate of 2.3%. Monetary policy will continue to provide a stimulus, just not as big a boost as previously.What＊s more, the normalisation of interest rates doesn＊t mean they are going to return to their pre-crisis level of around 5%. The next peak is likely to be half that level."															
															
															
"Donald Trump＊s administration has put itself on a fresh collision course with the  after the president＊s candidate to be ambassador in Brussels said Greece should leave the euro and predicted the single currency would not survive more than 18 months in its present form.Days after being  towards the EU for publicly declaring that it ※needs a little taming§, Ted Malloch courted fresh controversy by saying Greece should have left the eurozone four years ago when it would have been ※easier and simpler§. Malloch made his comments as financial markets began to take fright at the possibility of a fresh Greek debt crisis later this year. Shares fell and interest rates on Greek debt rose after it emerged that the EU was at loggerheads with the  over whether to give the country more generous debt relief.※Whether the eurozone survives I think is very much a question that is on the agenda,§ he told Greek Skai TV＊s late-night chat show Istories. ※We have had the exit of the UK, there are elections in other European countries, so I think it is something that will be determined over the course of the next year, year and a half.※Why is Greece again on the brink? It seems like a deja vu. Will it ever end? I think this time I would have to say that the odds are higher that  itself will break out of the euro,§ Malloch said.The stridently Brexit-supporting businessman, who has yet to be confirmed as the US president＊s EU ambassador and is seen by Brussels as a provocative nominee for the post, said he wholeheartedly agreed with  saying Greece should return to the drachma, its former currency.※I personally think [Trump] was right. I would also say that this probably should have been instigated four years ago, and probably it would have been easier or simpler to do,§ Malloch said in the interview with the show＊s chief anchor, Alexis Papahelas.Seven years of arduous austerity 每 the price of the international bailout 每 had been so  that it was questionable whether what came next could possibly be worse, Malloch said.In the third bailout in as many years, Greece has lost more than  due to austerity-fuelled recession, the biggest slump of any advanced western economy in modern times. Without further emergency funding from its 86bn (?74bn) rescue programme, Athens  in July when debt repayments of about 7bn to the European Central Bank mature. Concerns on Tuesday over Greece＊s debts  on two-year government bonds to their highest level since last June, reflecting growing anxiety on financial markets over Athens＊s ability to keep up to date with debt repayments.The renewed focus came as the IMF revealed its  over how far spending cuts in the country should go, raising fresh doubts over the IMF＊s participation in rescue plans for the struggling Greek economy. The IMF believes that the budgetary demands being imposed on Greece by Europe are unreasonable and that the country＊s debts will hit 275% of national income by 2060 without fresh assistance.Malloch said: ※I have travelled to Greece, met lots of Greek people, I have academic friends in Greece and they say that these austerity plans are really deeply hurting the Greek people, and that the situation is simply unsustainable. So you might have to ask the question if what comes next could possibly be worse than what＊s happening now.§The biggest unknown was not a euro exit, but the chaos it would likely engender as Greece moved to a new currency, he said.The governance structure of the IMF means the US could block any deal it did not support.※If the [IMF] will not participate in a new bailout that does not include substantial debt relief, and that＊s what they are saying, then that, more or less, ensures a collision course with eurozone creditors,§ Malloch added, saying it was imperative that EU member states forgave a substantial part of Greece＊s mountainous public debt. ※Now we all know that primarily [puts pressure on] Germany, which remains opposed to any such actions, so I think it suggests that Greece might have to sever ties and do Grexit and exit the euro,§ he said. Under bailout programmes financed mostly by Germany, Greece has been given about 336bn in rescue loans, money that Berlin and other lenders are determined to get back. The euro-denominated debt pile would be essentially erased if Greece reverted to the drachma. Malloch＊s latest intervention is unlikely to be greeted enthusiastically by EU officials, who are voicing fears that stalled bailout negotiations with creditors could pave the way for an accidental default in the summer.

"Hopes of bumper pay rises as the economy shrugs off the effects of the Brexit vote appear to be dashed by a  survey that predicts a decline in wages growth this year.A report by the central bank＊s regional agents found that the increase in average pay settlements, far from strengthening in response to higher inflation, will decline from 2.7% to 2.2% this year.The data contrasts with  last week that showed wages growth increasing to 3.5% by the end of the year.The agents, who visited about 700 businesses and received pay information from 341, said employers＊ labour costs were likely to rise after the introduction from April of the government＊s apprenticeship levy. Further rises in minimum wage rates and an expansion of the government＊s occupational pension plan to small employers would also push up the average cost of employment., possibly to offset the extra costs imposed on employers., the agents are described by the Bank as its ※eyes, ears and voice§ in the regions, ※collecting information about trends and developments and explaining the Bank＊s policy decisions to local businesses, industry and labour groups§.Agents＊ views have gained a higher profile inside Threadneedle Street in recent months after  and  accusing central bank staff of ※ivory tower§ policymaking.Critics have accused the Bank governor, Mark Carney, and the nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) of being too pessimistic in their judgment on the impact of the referendum vote. They have also been criticised for being overly optimistic about the return of high wages growth and the need for interest rate increases to combat an overheating economy.Last month the Office for National Statistics said pay growth inched up to 2.7% in the three months to January from 2.6% in the three months to December. and is predicted to rise to almost 3% by the Bank of England and nearer 4% by the National Institute of Economic & Social Research, ending more than two years of inflation-adjusted incomes growth.The agents＊ report said there would be higher pay for staff in industries with skill shortages, but rising labour costs ※would be unlikely to be reflected in higher pay settlements§.It said: ※Indeed, the average pay settlement was expected to ease in 2017 to 2.2% from 2.7% in 2016, with the number of pay awards between 3% and 4% expected to fall significantly. Settlements were expected to moderate in all sectors, with the largest decline anticipated in consumer services, where some companies had made pay awards in 2016 that were beyond those strictly necessary to meet the national living wage at that time.§A section of the inflation report discussed the likely reasons for the failure of wages to soar since the 2008 financial crash as forecasters expected. It relied heavily on the agents＊ report when it said ※some degree of slack in the economy and only modest productivity growth are projected to keep wage growth relatively subdued in the near term§.Nevertheless, it projected a liftoff in wages growth in the second half of the year and through 2018.A spokeswoman for the Bank said the MPC, which sets interest rates, included the agents＊ report as one of several measures of potential wages growth."															
"The government is on course to impose steep cuts in public spending and increase taxes by the end of the decade to their highest level in 30 years to combat the UK＊s persistent budget deficit. and lower than expected tax receipts will still leave the UK with one of the largest shortfalls in public spending in the developed world, .The leading tax and spending thinktank said downgrades in GDP growth over the next four years would strain the public finances, which are already on course to be ?13bn worse off in this financial year than forecast.Low levels of business investment and weak productivity growth were blamed for the economy＊s weaker outlook for the rest of the decade, which will force ministers to raise taxes and cut spending to reduce the deficit.About ?17bn of tax rises are planned over this parliament, pushing the tax share of GDP above 37% of national income for the first time since 1986每87. Ministers are also meant to find further cuts in spending on top of the 10% already sliced from service budgets since 2010.By 2019每20, departmental spending is expected to be 13% lower than it was in 2010 after inflation is taken into account, with cuts of about 40% to the justice, business, culture and environment budgets.Social care, , is another high-profile target for cuts over the next four years alongside schools in England, which were protected with health and pension spending until this year.Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said even without the downturn in the economic outlook after the referendum, Britons were facing three parliaments of austerity.※For all the focus on , the public finances in the next few years look set to be defined by the spending cuts announced by George Osborne,§ Johnson said.※Cuts to day-to-day public service spending are due to accelerate while the tax burden continues to rise. Even so the new chancellor may not find it all that easy to meet his target of eliminating the budget deficit in the next parliament.※Even on central forecasts that is going to require extending  towards the mid-2020s. If the economy does less well than hoped then we may see yet another set of fiscal rules consigned to the dustbin.§, before his first budget next month, the IFS＊s annual assessment of the public finances found that  could blow an even bigger hole in the government budget over the next two parliaments.※Taking into account possible negative effects from lower growth, the government may need to enact further measures worth ?34bn [in 2016-17 terms] in order to eliminate the deficit in the next parliament,§ the report said.A Treasury spokeswoman saidhe government was committed to repairing the public finances so the UK lived within its means. She said: ※That has required some difficult decisions on spending, but we are determined to deliver efficient public services which provide maximum value for every pound of taxpayers＊ money.§Hammond said in the  that he was able to find funds to bolster public investment spending back above pre-crisis levels, with much of the extra cash to be spent on transport infrastructure.The chancellor also said the government still planned to pay for large giveaways in the form of a higher income tax personal allowance at the basic and higher rate. If Hammond maintains freezes on fuel duty, the combined giveaway will total ?4.25bn a year by 2020.The IFS said: ※Public spending, especially on health, pensions and overseas aid will be higher as a share of national income than in 2007-08, while spending on schools, defence and 每 in particular每 public order and safety will be lower.§ The Liberal Democrats＊ Treasury spokeswoman, Susan Kramer, said: ※Cut after cut will be the new normal for this Conservative government, even before the effects of Brexit hit. Failure on the deficit, high taxes and rising prices. It is those on low and middle incomes who will be hit hardest.§"															
" amid renewed insistence from Athens it will not swallow further austerity demands from international lenders.The yields on two-year government bonds jumped to their highest level since last June and  to reflect growing anxiety on financial markets over Greece＊s ability to keep up to date with debt repayments. Yields on 10-year government bonds were also higher at above 7.8%, the highest close since November.The renewed focus on Greece＊s debts came as the International Monetary Fund revealed , raising fresh doubts over its participation in rescue plans for the struggling Greek economy.The Washington-based fund has made repeated warnings that Greece＊s debt burden of about 330bn (?280bn) is unsustainable despite the government pushing through spending cuts and tax increases that have badly hit popularity ratings for the government of .The IMF declined to join other international lenders 每 the European Central Bank and the European Union 每 in funding the country＊s third bailout, agreed in August 2015, and it is currently deciding whether to take part in a new chunk of rescue funds needed by mid-2018. Germany has warned the IMF＊s involvement is crucial if support for  is to continue.News of a split on the IMF board raised new questions over whether Germany will see its wish granted for the fund joining the next rescue. In its latest annual review of the Greek economy, the IMF revealed that its board members were in disagreement over whether Athens should enforce even more austerity to satisfy its lenders.Most of the 24-strong group agreed that  was on track to achieve a primary surplus of 1.5% of GDP, and should not make further cuts. However, another group on the board argued that Athens needed to tighten further to push its surplus up to 3.5% of GDP, the level agreed in its last bailout. A primary surplus refers to a government＊s income exceeding its spending, excluding debt interest payments. In a rare admission of an internal split, the IMF said: ※Most executive directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal while some directors had different views on the fiscal path and debt sustainability.§Those fiscal targets, and varying views over Athens＊ ability to meet them, have been at the centre of .Greece has lost more than 25% of its GDP 每 the biggest downturn to be experienced by an advanced western economy in peacetime 每 since its financial collapse seven years ago. There are worries it will not be able to reach the kind of surplus its lenders want to see without more spending cuts. But responding to the IMF report on Tuesday, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said Greece was not in quite the state the Fund had claimed. Dijsselbloem said the report was outdated and that it failed to account for recent growth in the Greek economy.※It＊s surprising because Greece is already doing better than that report describes,§ he told Dutch television, according to news service Reuters.Dijsselbloem also said that Greece＊s creditors would still be prepared to ease terms of Greece＊s debt further, if the country continues to cooperate on reforms. But he ruled out the prospect of Greek debt being forgiven, or cancelled altogether.The Greek government, which faces more debt repayment deadlines this summer, said it was hoping for a ※positive conclusion§ to the protracted review of its bailout programme. A resolution would help unlock disbursements from the latest bailout that are needed to pay for these debt repayments but may also open the way for Greece＊s bonds to be included in the European Central Bank＊s bond-buying programme, a development that in turn would likely lower Greece＊s high borrowing costs.But Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos also after the bailout scheme ends in 2018.※The government＊s position is clear and it has been expressed categorically ... Our aim is to not yield to illogical demands by the International Monetary Fund, which insists on legislating precautionary (austerity) measures after the programme ends,§ he said."															
"sk Barbara Keeley what keeps her awake at night and Labour＊s shadow cabinet member for mental health and social care will tell you it＊s the stories of people in ※heartrending§ situations whose care is being cut.She cites the case of a man in his 80s who has been told the NHS continuing care he has received for the past six years will stop; the two paid carers will be gone, with the expectation that his wife, also in her 80s, will look after a husband who is completely immobile, incontinent, and cannot communicate or eat or drink without help. Keeley fears that such scenarios are set to increase if the funding  continues because councils and clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) ※can really only get into rationing now§.※If you are a council, if you are a CCG, looking at paying NHS continuing care and you have to make cuts this year 每 quite a lot of councils have to make cuts this year 每 you are going to have to cut the care of people who are already receiving it, and that is tragic.§ Adult social care has risen up the political agenda after years of consecutive  coupled with rising demand for services. Myriad warnings from a slew of organisations have been issued about growing levels of unmet need, struggling social care providers and the additional strain placed on NHS services and informal carers.Last week, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services  of ?1bn for 2017-18 to stabilise a care market on the edge of collapse. The Local Government Association, meanwhile, warned that severe underfunding was putting councils at risk of not being able to provide the help older and disabled people need with basic tasks 每 as stipulated in the 2014 Care Act. Not surprisingly, Keeley says much of her focus since taking up the post five months ago has been on adult social care.The government needs to bring forward ?700m of social care money earmarked for 2019-20 to fund home or residential care, Keeley argues, so that older people aren＊t kept in hospital unnecessarily. ※They＊ve allocated the funding, so they should bring it forward 每 because the crisis is now,§ she says.This doesn＊t sound enough, however, given the scale of the funding shortfall identified by town halls and health charities. Where else could money be found? She points to . A rise in national insurance also springs to mind. Keeley makes no mention, though, of Labour leader  instead.Try to discuss future sources of funding and Keeley will tell you that she and shadow cabinet colleagues are working on this now. But Keeley is clear that she wants  to work out its own long-term solutions, rather than taking a cross-party approach. Corbyn has already promised to take ※failed private care homes§ into public ownership 每 a move Keeley says refers to taking over care homes that go into insolvency to protect capacity. Ultimately, her ambition is to make social care free at the point of delivery.※The current situation just provides a lot of problems,§ says Keeley. ※What we were proposing at the last general election was that certainly end of life care should be free. You shouldn＊t have to get into battles in the last few months of life about NHS continuing care and what＊s paid for and what＊s not. We need to be looking at a situation where if we integrate health and social care, we don＊t get into all these charging issues that we do now.§With councils short of options, Tory-led Surrey last month announced a , blaming cuts and the demand for services. However, on Tuesday - after the proposed referendum had received a huge amount of publicity - , in favour of a 4.99% increase, claiming the government now better understands the funding crisis councils face. Keeley, MP for Worsley and Eccles South in Greater Manchester, believes forcing councils to plug the shortfall through a tax on local property values rather than on the basis of need is not the way to tackle the issue. ※It clearly isn＊t fair to create an even bigger postcode lottery where the level of service you can get depends on where you live,§ she says.Junior health minister  them, just as parents do their children. Keeley retorts that one million ; moreover, three million family members in the UK are already juggling work and caring responsibilities, she says, with the peak age for caring being the 50-64 age bracket. ※If you＊re saying that caring is the responsibility of individuals in families, you have to think through how they are meant to juggle work with that.§She is currently discussing the scope for carers to be included in Labour＊s industrial strategy. Carers＊ leave, for example, would give people flexibility to take time off work at times of crisis.Keeley worked as an adviser to a carers＊ charity after leaving behind a career in systems engineering, and found that family carers did not tend to raise their own needs and concerns.

"The UK could shake off the near-term impact of  to become the fastest-growing economy in the G7 group of rich countries between now and 2050, according to a report that paints a bright outlook for the country＊s prospects outside the EU.Consultants PwC say the UK economy will not escape entirely unscathed from the decision to leave the bloc and that it will dampen growth prospects in the short term. But the brunt of the impact would be felt by 2020 and in the years that follow the UK would outperform its peers thanks to its relatively large working age population and its flexible economy.PwC sets out the UK＊s prospects in its latest report into how the world economy will look in 2050. Using models that analyse population trends, investment, education and technological progress, PwC economists expect six of the seven largest economies by 2050 will be emerging markets, led by .They see the UK economy remaining in the top 10, slipping down one spot from ninth place now to 10th in , which adjusts for price differences between countries to provide a measure of the volume of goods and services produced by an economy. France is forecast to drop out of the top 10, to 12th place in 2050, while  is forecast to fall from fifth place to ninth. Mexico is the only newcomer to the top 10 in 2050.PwC says the UK＊s performance will depend on it setting up strong trading arrangements and remaining open to ※talented workers§ from around the world.※Our relatively positive long-term growth projection for the UK is due to favourable demographic factors and a relatively flexible economy by European standards,§ said John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC.※However, developing successful trade and investment links with faster-growing emerging economies will be critical to achieving this, offsetting probable weaker trade links with the EU after Brexit.§With annual average growth of about 1.9% over the period to 2050, the UK is projected to be the fastest-growing economy of the G7, which comprises it, the US, , France, Germany, Italy and Japan.PwC＊s projections see the world economy doubling in size by 2042, growing at an average annual rate of 2.5% to 2050. But it adds a note of caution that the forecasts are based on some basic assumptions.※We assume broadly growth-friendly (but not perfect) policies and no major civilisation-threatening global catastrophes (eg nuclear war, asteroid collisions) over the period to 2050,§ the report said.In PPP terms, China is already the world＊s largest economy and will continue to be so in 2050, by a significant margin, the report said. Emphasising the role of emerging economies in driving growth and taking an increasing share of the global economy, the report also predicted India could have edged past the US into second place by then, with Indonesia rising to fourth place.But the picture is very different when economies are ranked by GDP per person, which is seen as a better gauge of how growth is translating into changes in living standards.By that measure, the US is still the world＊s leading economy in 2050 followed by Germany, the UK and Canada. But China and India are closing the income gap with those at the top, according to PwC＊s projections.※In 2016, US GDP per capita was almost four times the size of China＊s and almost nine times the size of India＊s. By 2050, these gaps are projected to close to around double China＊s and around three times India＊s, demonstrating long-term income convergence,§ the report said.The consultancy firm＊s long-term optimism about the UK economy is in contrast to its more gloomy near-term forecasts for the effects of a Brexit vote, published with pro-remain business group the CBI before the referendum.Its analysis in March last year warned that leaving the EU would  that could lead to 950,000 job losses and leave the average household ?3,700 worse off by 2020. Since the referendum, most economic outlooks have been shown to be overly pessimistic and forecasters, including the Bank of England, have .Hawksworth conceded that after unexpected events in 2016, it may appear odd to make predictions for as far out as 2050. But he said there was an important role for such long-range forecasting.※After a year of major political shocks with the Brexit vote and the election of President Trump, it might seem brave to opine on economic prospects for 2017, let alone 2050,§ he said.※But a long-term view is crucial for considering areas like pensions, healthcare, energy and climate change, housing, transport and other infrastructure investment. By looking beyond unpredictable short-term economic and political cycles and focusing on fundamentals, long-term growth projections can actually be more reliable than short-term forecasts.§"															
"he UK economy performed surprisingly well in 2016. Indeed, when looking across the OECD economies, it is hard to find a better performer on key metrics such as growth and employment. However, when looking beneath the surface, the UK economy is, in fact, overheating. Already on the rise, the result is going to be the largest surge in  for many years, squeezing household budgets and placing the in a bind largely of its own making.Already weak prior to the surprising referendum result, sterling declined sharply thereafter and has not recovered since. Year over year the pound is down about 20% against both the dollar and the euro. Combined with the sharp 70% rise in prices over the same time frame, UK energy and food costs are set to soar this year. These developments alone will push up UK consumer price index by 1 to 2 percentage points.That may not seem so much, especially when CPI is currently only 1.2% year-over-year. But there is an even more troubling trend: following years of low wage growth, unit labour costs began to rise sharply last year. This is due in part to rising wages but also to persistently weak productivity growth. Labour compensation is the single largest contributor to inflation. Thus while some workers will no doubt enjoy pay rises over the coming year, when combined with the food and energy effects it is unlikely that most will keep up with the rising cost of living.In 2016 the Bank of England found itself persistently on the defensive, including over government claims that its aggressive monetary policies, such as , have exacerbated inequality. While there is evidence to that effect, a sharp rise in the cost of living will only serve to reinforce this perception. The wealthy have ample means to protect their wealth from being eroded by inflation. The middle class and pensioners have little, if any. Anyone living on a salary is in particular trouble unless they receive a commensurate pay rise.And therein lies the greatest potential problem: workers who sense that they are falling behind are going to demand higher wages. Those in government or in industries such as healthcare and transport, in which competition is limited, are likely to see strikes as an increasingly attractive wage negotiation strategy. Although the public is rightly annoyed by the huge inconveniences that strikes can cause, if they take place alongside a palpable rise in the cost of living then striking workers may find some public compassion. The government may thus find that it has less political leverage to de-escalate and settle strikes on its preferred terms.In this context, the  will eventually need to bite the bullet and begin increasing interest rates if it is to keep CPI anywhere near the 2% target. Combined with soaring energy prices, this will place the brakes on growth. While a recession may not be in store in 2017, slower growth almost certainly is.If this unpleasant, ※§ mix of sharply rising prices yet slowing growth sounds a bit like what occurred in the 1970s, that＊s because it is. The fact is the UK has been living on borrowed time and borrowed money ever since the financial crisis struck in 2008. Sterling devalued sharply back then as the Bank slashed rates to zero and began QE. These ※emergency§ measures, now in place for over eight years, have kept the economy on life support by subsidising a huge expansion of debt, public and private, and the associated property bubble. They have not created the necessary conditions for a truly self-sustaining economic recovery. Indeed, the opposite could be argued, that by keeping the monetary spigot open for so long the Bank has encouraged debt-fuelled speculation rather than a salutary economic de-leveraging.As the Bank finally moves to raise rates in response to sharply higher inflation, bond yields are likely to rise and share prices may well decline or, at a minimum, fail to keep pace with the cost of living. The much-maligned British saver, suffering for years from artificially low interest rates, is only going to find things getting worse as portfolio valuations decline. Borrowers, meanwhile, will find they are tapped out.They call economics the ※dismal science§ for good reason. There is no free lunch. With inflation finally on the rise, the QE piper will now need to be paid. "															
" mined deep discontent running through America and struck gold.The political outsider drew derision when he announced his bid for the US presidency. But Trump＊s protectionist, anti-immigration rhetoric and a pledge to be the ※greatest jobs president that God ever created§ struck a chord.Momentum built and nothing could stop the Trump juggernaut, not his open xenophobia, nor claims about his tax payments 每 or lack thereof 每 and not even a sexual harassment scandal.So the electoral upset of the century has happened and for the next four years at least, the reality TV star will be swapping Manhattan＊s Trump Tower for the White House.In the year that the UK voted to leave the EU, Trump＊s triumph over Hillary Clinton was yet another outcome that pundits and pollsters had failed to predict. On financial markets, initial shock gave way to guesswork.In the post-truth world Trump has helped to build, investors are left to puzzle over what he will do once in power. Which of his most outlandish policies will become reality? Will there be a wall along the border to Mexico? Will he really target millions of immigrants for deportation?To get a flavour of the uncertainty, look no further than the stock markets, which have struggled to find a clear direction since Trump＊s victory was declared. Economic forecasters are being coy about whether his effect on growth will be positive or negative.A big-spending, tax-cutting president could well lift GDP. But things could go the other way if Trump follows through on his anti-trade stance and new tariffs raise costs for businesses and consumers.On the campaign trail, Trump made trade a central theme. He played into . For those who saw their wages depressed or their jobs move overseas, the era of free trade did more harm than good.It seems pretty certain that . He wants to renegotiate, or possibly scrap, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which lowers trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico.Other deals in doubt are the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), between 12 countries around the Pacific rim excluding , and a proposed agreement between the US and Europe, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).On Nafta, Trump holds all the cards. Mexico needs the US more than the US needs Mexico. But when it comes to Trump＊s pledge to curb China＊s trading might, it is not so obvious he will have the upper hand. Not only is China one of the biggest economies in the world, it is a big holder of US debt. Any attempt to browbeat China, could well backfire on Trump. Time will tell whether the tycoon wants to risk a trade war with China.Just as hard to predict is what this all means for the UK as it undergoes its own upheaval and potentially breaks away from a market of 500 million people. With Trump, the UK is no longer at the back of the queue for trade deals, as Barack Obama threatened it would be during the EU referendum campaign. The incoming president has talked of his affection for Britain, so perhaps he could go for a bespoke trade deal between the US and UK. But Theresa May and her Brexiter trade minister Liam Fox will have to accept that the vastly bigger US will have the upper hand in any such talks.However, it＊s just as likely that trade deals of any kind will not be a priority for a president who campaigned on a pledge to put up walls. The UK might not be at the back of the queue, but it won＊t feature near the top of Trump＊s to-do list either.As we enter a new era of looking inwards, those who sought power on a protectionist platform should hope that their policies do not end up doing yet more harm.Everything that happens at Marks & Spencer, the 132-year-old high street retailer, causes more drama than its peers. Predictably, the news last week that M&S  and convert 45 others into food-only locations created quite a stir. The retailer＊s shops are the bedrock of high streets in towns and cities across the country, and have been for years, so any change is noticed by the locals.The closures are an admission of defeat: that M&S cannot make its clothing popular enough to justify the amount of space dedicated to selling it across the country. It is a costly admission too: it will cost M&S ?150m to rework its UK shops over the next three years and another ?200m to shut struggling shops abroad.However, it was the right move by Steve Rowe, the M&S chief executive. If anything, he should have been more radical. In an online world where marksandspencer.com is the company＊s biggest shop, it would be foolish for the retailer to stick with a business model from a previous generation. M&S has significantly more stores than rivals John Lewis and Debenhams, and significantly larger ones than rivals that, like M&S, only sell own-brand clothing, such as Zara and H&M. One of the reasons that M&S＊s clothing range can look so dowdy is that there is so much retail space to fill: it can＊t possibly get everything right.In contrast to M&S＊s clothing, its food business has a clear upmarket position. This Christmas, families will flock to M&S for their festive fare. With Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury＊s, Morrisons and Waitrose dramatically cutting back investment, M&S has a glorious opportunity to expand.Having said all this, M&S should not start treating its clothing arm as a secondary consideration within the group. Cutting the amount of the space dedicated to clothing gives the company an opportunity to rethink its approach to fashion. Rowe must surely follow the success of the food business and make M&S clothing more aspirational.There is more in common between Sir Philip Green, Mike Ashley and Donald Trump than their body shapes and wealth. Trump＊s victory has sparked dismay 每 not just at the election of a man recorded making sexist remarks but at how, when coupled with Brexit, it suggests the west has turned its back on trade.The scandals involving BHS and Sports Direct highlight why people may have come to question the benefits of tariff-fee imports and exports.While business leaders like Green and Ashley have filled their boots and expanded empires, the workers who have driven their stores＊ success have not shared their wealth.Green and Ashley are billionaires, but 11,000 BHS workers have lost their jobs and part of their pensions, while Sports Direct staff are stuck on zero-hours contracts.Those who have taken advantage of the freedoms offered by globalisation and the free markets have a lot to answer for in 2016."															
"The  Industrial Average closed at a record high on Thursday, rising more than 200 points as traders continued to absorb Donald Trump＊s victory in the US presidential race.Investors have been warned to brace for more sharp moves on financial markets as uncertainty endures over how Trump＊s campaign rhetoric will translate into policies.But after initially struggling to find direction on Thursday the Dow closed up 218 points at 18807, a rise of 1.17%. The S&P 500 also gained slightly, rising 0.2% but the tech-heavy Nasdaq dipped 0.81%. Trump has clashed with Silicon Valley and threatened Apple, Nasdaq and the world＊s largest company, over privacy and its overseas manufacturing. Apple dropped 2.79% on Thursday.Markets benefitted from a continuing sense of relief over , including those following his meeting with the US president, Barack Obama. However European shares, including London＊s  100 index, could not hold on to their early gains as worries grew over the president-elect＊s coming longer term impact on global growth due to his protectionist policies. The billionaire businessman vowed on the campaign trail to put American jobs first and scrap or renegotiate trade deals.European markets were also hurt by investors moving their money out of shares and into bonds as yields rose on the prospect that the arrival of a big spender in the White House would mean the US had to issue more government debt. A new flurry of bonds coming on to the market would push down the price of bonds, and yields would move inversely to prices.※It has been another interesting day for the FTSE 100, with the index retreating from the morning high, hit by heavy losses for high dividend stocks, which are looking less attractive after the pickup in US bond yields,§ said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at the online trading company IG.The FTSE 100 closed down 1.2% at 6827.98, having gained 1% on Wednesday after Trump＊s presidential victory was confirmed.Analysts said the FTSE＊s change in direction during the day Thursday reflected a sense of confusion over whether Trump would match tough talk during the presidential race with action once in power.※It is perhaps apt that the reaction to Donald Trump＊s victory has been so confused, flipping between bombast and baloney much in the same manner as the soon-to-be president,§ said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at the spread betting firm Spreadex. ※That＊s all well and good for the short-term, especially for those traders looking to benefit from the present volatility; one suspects the seemingly rudderless movements may soon wear thin, however.§There were . His vows to ramp up spending on defence and infrastructure boosted stocks in the defence, construction and commodity sector. The prospect of looser regulation lifted shares in banks. Analysts said more muddled days of trading lay ahead as investors continued to weigh the potential impact of a Trump presidency on different stocks, sectors and regions as well as on the global economy as a whole.※Global growth could be somewhat slower in the years ahead if protectionism takes hold. The additional uncertainty will have a negative impact on equity markets but the extent needs to be kept in perspective,§ said Glyn Owen at Momentum Global Investment Management. ※On balance we believe that markets will drift for a period in the face of the uncertainty and the increased volatility we have seen in recent weeks will be a feature for the year ahead.§On currency markets there was some respite for the pound as it jumped to a six-week high against the euro and rose against the dollar. Traders put the small recovery in the pound 每 which has tumbled since the UK＊s vote to leave the EU 每 down to political worries now shifting to mainland Europe. A series of elections are due in Europe next year with the Dutch, French and Germans going to the polls, and possibly the Italians too if their government loses a key referendum next month. After Trump＊s win there are predictions that  will gain further ground. Against that backdrop the pound was up 1.5% against a flagging euro, to 1.1537 in late trading. The pound was up 1.4% against the dollar to $1.2578. That in turn put further pressure on the FTSE 100. The internationally diverse stock index has benefited from the pound＊s post-referendum weakness because it has flattered the earnings of those component companies that report in dollars."															
"Brazil is poised to implement the most socially regressive austerity package in the world, a senior  official has warned.Despite , President  每 who came to power after engineering the impeachment of his former running mate,  每 is pushing through a 20-year social spending freeze that will be locked into the constitution. Ahead of a final senate vote on the measures next Tuesday, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, took the unusual step of decrying the plan as an attack on the poor 每 and a violation of Brazil＊s obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. ※This is a radical measure, lacking in all nuance and compassion,§ he said in a statement on Friday. ※It is completely inappropriate to freeze only social expenditure and to tie the hands of all future governments for another two decades. If this amendment is adopted it will place  in a socially retrogressive category all of its own.§The constitutional amendment, which is known as PEC55, solidifies fears that Temer＊s rightwing government will jerk Brazil back towards its historical position as one of the most unequal countries on the planet. That reputation had somewhat softened after 13 years of Workers＊ party rule, which saw increased spending on healthcare and education, and modest income distribution measures.But since Temer conspired to eject Rousseff from the presidency, he has  in an effort to restore investor confidence and improve Brazil＊s battered financial ratings. As a result the state will shrink rapidly and a greater share of tax revenues will go to bond holders. PEC55 goes far further than austerity policies in other nations, according to Pedro Paulo Zahluth Bastos, associate professor in economics at the University of Campinas. Bastos notes that only Singapore and Georgia hard-wired cuts into their constitutions 每 and even then not so deeply or for such a duration. Given how inflation is benchmarked, he estimates education spending per child will fall by almost a third, and health outlays per patient will decrease by almost 10%. While social spending declines as a share of GDP, he says the demands will increase because of an ageing society and the forecast addition of 20 million people to the population. Yet interest payments will remain generous: all future gains in taxation will be destined to the payment of public debt. And Brazil will remain one of the only countries in the world without a dividend tax or an income tax for company owners. ※Nothing like this has been executed in any other place in the world,§ Bastos said. ※This is the most contractionist state and at the same time the most beneficial program for the holders of public debt in the history of humanity.§There has been little public debate considering the importance of a measure that will affect the country until 2037. Polls suggest less than half of the population have heard of PEC55. None of them voted for it because Temer was elected vice-president in 2014 on Rousseff＊s coattails and a promise of no austerity. Adding to frustrations, the government remains mired in a corruption scandal with dozens of senior politicians implicated in the ongoing Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation into bribery and kickbacks at the state run oil company Petrobras. Three ministers have resigned from the cabinet of Temer, who is also accused. To public fury, the head of the upper house, Renan Calheiros,  to answer charges earlier this week, and has subsequently struck a deal with other justices that enables him to cling to power. Social tensions are already evident. Police used teargas and rubber bullets when more than 10,000 protesters rallied outside Congress during an earlier stage of voting on the bill. Local government budget cuts and salary delays have also prompted violent demonstrations on other cities. The latest erupted in central Rio de Janeiro on Monday, when office workers and shoppers got caught up in clashes between riot police and striking firemen, police and other state employees. ※We are losing jobs and incomes so we have a right to protest, but the government responds with violence,§ said Pedro Oliveira, as teargas swirled through the city streets. Jorge Darze, the president of the Doctor＊s Union of Rio de Janeiro, said he was worried both by the cuts to an already underfunded health system and the breakdown of dialogue between social organisations and the authorities. ※The situation is very serious,§ he warned. ※It is very difficult to discuss, because the legislative militarises its entrance and the public prosecutors office has turned its back. This austerity package is far from solving the economic crisis, and I think it will worsen the social crisis.§"															
"If you are a female traffic warden or probation officer read on for good news. If you are a female chief executive you may want to look away now.The UK＊s . Almost half a century on from the gender pay act, there is still an 18.1% difference in average pay between men and women. Of course, such average figures for all employees tell a narrow story. They don＊t, for example, account for the fact more women work in lower-paid jobs or sectors.But now people can quickly look up how things stand between the sexes in their particular job with a  from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It also shows how many women and men work in each role.For example, women classed as ※chief executives and senior officials§ are paid 28.7% less than men in that group, at ?34.91 an hour versus ?48.94 an hour for men.  hold 30% of those jobs.It＊s a similar story among bank managers. Women classed as ※financial institution managers and directors§ earn 36% less than men.The ONS＊s own staff might well have been disappointed with the results on ※actuaries, statisticians and economists§ where women are paid 20% less than men.Things look better for cleaners, nurses, bar staff and further education teachers, where the gap is zero.The pay gap goes the other way in some jobs. Female probation officers earn 25% more than men, women in ※parking and civil enforcement occupations§ earn 19% more, while female physiotherapists are paid 16% more.The ONS adds a word of caution to its new tool. The pay gap figures do not reveal differences in rates of pay for comparable jobs. So where there is a gap for your occupation this does not mean men are getting more than women for exactly the same work. As the statisticians point out, the reasons for the pay gap are more complex, and include the fact women are more likely to work part time, which can mean a lower rate of pay. Women are also underrepresented in senior roles, something which may be down to people＊s attitudes to gender roles, lack of flexible working or women taking time to look after their family.The tool was a joint project with the Government Equalities Office and comes ahead of new rules next April that will . The regulations will affect almost 8,000 employers with about 11 million employees.Launching the new pay gap checker, the minister for women and equalities, Justine Greening, noted that the gender pay gap was now the lowest on record and that there were more women in work than ever before.※But if we are to help women to reach their potential and eliminate the gender pay gap, we need to shine a light on our workplaces to see where there is more to do,§ she said.※This tool will empower both men and women to challenge this issue in their profession and help people to make more informed decisions about their career.※Employers must play their part in this too and take action to tackle the gender pay gap in their organisation.§"															
"News of a pick-up in exports has fanned hopes the UK economy will finish the year on a strong note, confounding earlier . showed the UK＊s trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed more than expected in October as exports rose and imports fell. But statisticians said there was little evidence that the weak pound 每 which makes UK goods cheaper overseas 每 was boosting exports. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also  to show the UK＊s trade deficit in the three months following the Brexit vote had ballooned to a near-three-year high rather than narrowed. The revision followed corrections to the way gold trade had been calculated.The deficit on trade in goods was ?9.7bn in October, narrowing by ?4.1bn from September 2016 and beating economists＊ forecasts for ?11.8bn in a Reuters poll. That reflected a ?2.1bn increase in exports and a ?2bn decrease in imports, the ONS said. Economists highlighted a worse picture when using less volatile figures for the three months to October. They showed goods export volumes fell by 2.1%, while imports rose by 4.4%. ※Given the steep fall in sterling, one would have expected this to be the other way round, with exports rising and imports falling,§ said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the consultancy IHS Markit.ONS statistician Hannah Finselbach echoed that: ※Following the EU referendum the UK trade deficit widened in the third quarter of 2016 and then in October it narrowed again,§ she said.※There remains only limited evidence so far that the depreciation of sterling has led to a marked increase in UK exports.§Taking together goods trade and estimates of the UK＊s trade in services such as consultancy and banking, an area where the country runs a surplus, the gap for October was ?2bn, a narrowing of ?3.8bn from September 2016. The revisions made to the third quarter trade figures showed the trade deficit for goods and services was now estimated at ?14.9bn, the biggest since the end 2013 and a widening of ?6.7bn from the second quarter. The ONS had previously said the deficit had narrowed by ?1.7bn in the third quarter.But statisticians said the changes would not affect its estimate that .Economists said the latest trade data pointed to a similar pace of expansion for the final quarter of the year.※While the monthly data are extremely volatile, the narrowing in the trade deficit in October sets a solid base for trade in the fourth quarter,§ said Scott Bowman at the consultancy Capital .※What＊s more, trade should be further supported in the coming months by the fall in sterling seen since the EU referendum, which should improve exporters＊ competitiveness and encourage domestic production at the expense of imports.§ showed construction output, which accounts for around 6% of the economy, fell in October, disappointing expectations of a rise.Output was down 0.6% on the month in October but September＊s performance was better than previously expected with output growth revised up to 0.9% from 0.3%. That left construction output was 0.7% higher over the year.※Overall the data paint a mixed picture of the sector,§ said Kay Daniel Neufeld at the consultancy Centre for Economics and Business Research.※Positive contributions to output growth came from new private house building, while a decrease in infrastructure output exerted a drag on growth. The sector continues to face various challenges ranging from financial constraints to a shortage of skilled labour. ※However, given the announcements in the latest autumn statement, we can be cautiously optimistic that investments in infrastructure and housebuilding will support the industry throughout 2017.§"

If it is not, the UK will face less food choice and higher food prices.§The letter, which is also signed by the heads of the British Beer & Pubs Association, the British Growers Association and the British Soft Drinks Association, claims that some EU workers have already begun to leave the UK in the wake of the Brexit vote which has led to a fall in the value of the pound. ※The government can address this issue directly. It should offer unambiguous reassurance to EU workers throughout our supply chain about their right to remain here,§ it said.Employment agencies have .The Association of Labour Providers (ALP), whose employment agency members supply 70% of the temporary labour used by the food and drink industry, recently said responses to job ads had slumped by up to 70% as workers from the EU 每 who account for 90% of jobs in the sector 每 avoid coming to the UK.The NFU has said farmers have seen a shortfall in EU workers, exacerbated by the drop in the pound against the euro, which has diminished the value of the money they are sending home.Nearly 4 million people are employed in growing, harvesting, producing, packaging, selling and serving food and drink in the UK, a large proportion of whom are EU nationals. Although food prices continue to fall amid heavy competition between the major supermarket chains and fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, rising costs are expected to drive up inflation in the coming months.A string of major food brands have sought increased cost prices from supermarkets as the fall in the pound has driven up the cost of importing ingredients and other essentials, such as packaging. Unilever, which also owns Ben & Jerry＊s and Dove; Typhoo; Birds Eye and Walkers are embroiled in an industry-wide battle over price increases caused by the  and 18% against the dollar since the UK voted to leave the European Union.The lower value of the pound is also expected to increase exports, potentially making it harder for UK companies to source home-grown ingredients. For example, , partly because processors have found exporting easier.Food and drink is the UK＊s biggest export, worth ?18bn, led by Scotch whisky, chocolate, beer and salmon. Despite its relatively low profile, food manufacturing is worth more to the UK economy than the automotive and aerospace sectors combined. "															
"Consumer and business confidence tumbled in November amid concerns the UK economy would struggle to grow after a post-referendum slowdown, two surveys have found.Consumers were ※resolutely gloomy§ and viewed the economy with increasing despondency, while a broad range of businesses said they were worried the economic recovery after the  vote was starting to recede.Conducted before last week＊s autumn statement, the surveys support the chancellor＊s warning that the UK was likely , as inflation eats into disposable incomes and limits consumer spending. The GfK consumer confidence index dropped five points after a two-point fall in October, taking it to minus eight. , the index revealed a sharp nine-point drop in consumer plans for large purchases, spelling bad news for retailers as they gear up for the peak Christmas selling period. Car sales have dropped in recent months, and a further fall is expected as consumers shy away from committing themselves to purchasing major items while the impact of the referendum remains uncertain.Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: ※The fundamentals for consumers seem certain to progressively weaken over the coming months, which will take a significant toll on confidence as well as ability to spend. It looks probable that inflation will move above earnings growth during 2017.※Additionally, we suspect that unemployment will rise over the coming months as economic activity weakens appreciably and business uncertainties are stoked by the government triggering article 50, thereby bringing likely difficult negotiations with the EU to the forefront.§The index, compiled on behalf of the European commission, showed a two-point drop in confidence about respondents＊ personal finances over the past year and a four-point fall for the same measure looking to the year ahead. Questioned about their view of the general economic situation, respondents were disappointed with the last 12 months and circumspect about the next. The index covering most of 2016 dropped six points 每 19 points lower than this time last year 每 and fell five points for the year ahead. Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said: ※The slump across the board this month points to continuing uncertainty about the state of the economy among consumers. ※We are viewing our economy over the past 12 months with increasing despondency. The decreasing score on the economy for the next 12 months also shows we are resolutely gloomy about the outlook despite strong GDP numbers.§He added: ※Many are saying that fears about the British economy have been overstated but time will tell if the pessimism shown in the index is misplaced or not.§ UK business confidence levels decreased by five points in November, according to the business barometer compiled by Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. This came after a six-month high in October. Lloyds said the decrease followed ※a significant decline in economic optimism, which fell 20 points to 14% from 34%, suggesting that the recovery following the EU referendum outcome is starting to recede§.It said firms＊ reported theirown business prospects had improved to the highest level since January. ※This was driven by 55% of firms who said that they expect their business prospects to improve in the coming year, while only 5% reported a weaker outlook,§ the bank said.Consumer services businesses were more optimistic than consumers, with a balance of 36% expecting a brighter year ahead compared with 25% last month.However, the business and other services sector fell by 17 points to 29%."															
"Zoe Williams (, 28November) bases her judgment of Castro on a frighteningly simplistic division of states into democracies, by implication multiparty ones, and dictatorships, by implication any state that is not multiparty. She then makes a blanket assertion that the latter are so inherently bad that their actual record of government is irrelevant. This is to ignore all the complex details of political structures by which a population can be oppressed or empowered. For us, from a practical point of view, the worst danger of such thinking is to exaggerate the benefits of our political system.While Castro may be rightly criticised for executing Batista supporters, even those guilty of torture and multiple murder, it may be salutary to remember that back then, in 1959, Britain executed people accused of a single murder. It was also a time when British forces were imprisoning and torturing Kenyans, and those of the French multiparty democracy were torturing and killing Algerians. Even those crimes pale before the horrors the US multiparty democracy was shortly to unleash on Vietnam.Turning to the present day and the issue of political freedoms, it is fair to condemn  if people are being arrested for oppositional comment but important to bear in mind that the distinction between criticism and treachery is controversial, as illustrated by the fate of Chelsea Manning. It is reasonable to argue that a single-party state lacks effective mechanisms for kicking out an unpopular government, but we should also wonder whether the convergence of mainstream parties behind austerity and the increasingly low turnouts at elections in the UK are a sign that our mechanisms have ceased to be effective.  While UK press coverage of Fidel Castro＊s death has been largely hostile, my own views and memories are mixed, as I was ※our man in Havana§ for Reuters from 1960 to 1962, a period spanning the Bay of Pigs debacle and the Cuban missile crisis.Dictator Castro did have a human side.In July 1962, well after midnight, I, my wife Olivia and  of the Observer were walking near the Hotel Nacional when we saw a large car and a familiar silhouette. Gavin rashly stuck his hand in at the car window, introduced himself and said: ※Come and have a drink with us, Dr Castro.§ He reluctantly agreed to join us ※for a quarter of an hour§.At the nearby Club 21, Castro sat with the three of us for over two hours 每 something of a scoop for us, though he gave little away. At one point he said: ※Se?ora Bland, you have a little boy, yes? Does he receive his milk ration?§ Olivia told him: ※Actually, no.§ Shortly afterwards our son got his regular milk.Two months later, the missile crisis blew up. I drove past a Soviet missile site taking photos of sinister 60-foot-long cylinders under tarpaulins, then was chased off by the secret police, the G2.Two days later they arrested me and took me to G2 headquarters. Reuters gallantly interceded directly with Castro, so I spent only six days in jail and was deported, very conveniently, to Jamaica, where my wife had recently given birth to our second son. The guards＊ treatment was cold but civil; I heard no stories of torture or beatings. Richard Gott (, 28 November) is right to say that Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir were boundless in their admiration for Fidel Castro, at least to begin with, and the two were guests of the revolution from 22 February to 21 March 1960. But in 1971, in part because of the imprisonment of the Cuban poet , both severed links with Castro and the Cuban regime. Sartre died in 1980 and Beauvoir in 1986, and did not return to the Castro fold.  Richard Gott does not explain how  managed to retain power for over half a century. He could have mentioned the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution (CDR), set up to spy on the Cuban populace and identify potential dissidents. Each adult Cuban was expected to belong to the local CDR, which was in turn required to keep a file on each of its members. The CDR network was organised with the friendly assistance of the East German Stasi, and based on the system operating in East Germany. The latter was merely a refinement of the Blockleiter system set up in 1935 to control the population of Nazi Germany. Interestingly, the regimes in Nazi Germany, East Germany and Cuba all believed in elections with only one candidate for each seat, and in securing massive voter turnout. Hitler, Honecker, Castro: it really does seem that great minds think alike. If the people of St Vincent want to honour the memory of Fidel Castro, surely it is appropriate for the representative of their monarchy to respect their wishes without interference from the British (, theguardian.com, 27 November). The attitude of many in Britain has more than a whiff of colonialism. Zoe Williams＊ usually excellent judgment has let her down when she says of Fidel Castro that ※What matters is that he was a dictator§, because she forgets the context of a Latin America in the 1950s dominated by rightwing despots, with every effort to replace them with progressive governments being ended by military force. This would continue well into the 1980s, and even in the last decade we have seen two elected, progressive leaders fall to rightwing coups.How does she think a peaceful transformation from revolution to democracy should be secured? Here in Nicaragua, the 1979 revolution was followed by an election in 1984 which was not recognised by the US because it gave the ※wrong§ result. It was not until 1990, when the electorate correctly chose capitalism, that the US accepted the ballot as valid. It then took 16 years to restore a left-of-centre government, which is now again under threat of US sanctions.Nowhere in Latin America has suffered the baleful influence of US intervention more than Cuba, for reasons of history and geography. The Batista regime was one of the most barbarous in the continent, with its corruption accentuated by the mafia＊s control of Havana＊s main businesses, yet it was unflinchingly supported by successive US governments. Castro had to defend the revolution＊s achievements against the threats both of the US government itself and of the Miami-based terrorist groups who bombed Cuban planes and hotels with impunity, well into the 1990s. Nor has any other country so dependent on US commerce seen its economy strangled by a 50-year embargo, which applies not to just to US firms but to any firm that trades with the US.What was Castro supposed to do, meekly hold elections on terms acceptable to the US, in which millions of dollars would have poured into the country to ensure the ※right§ result? And then see Cuba return to the oligarchs who still control countries like Honduras and Guatemala? He was well aware that even the mildest leftwing government wouldn＊t have been acceptable to the US in a country only 100 miles from its borders. By not acknowledging that, Zoe, you ignore 60 years of US intervention in Central America and the Caribbean. Reference is rightly made to the fine role Cuba played in supporting opposition to apartheid and also in support of liberation struggles in Angola and Mozambique. I＊ve not seen comment on Cuba＊s support for Mengistu Haile Mariam when Ethiopia was invaded by the Somali forces of Siad Barre. What is the judgment? Mengistu eventually ousted (to sanctuary in Zimbabwe), Siad forced out and dead; Somalia in a very sorry state and Ethiopia again in some turmoil after a period of relative contentment. Like Zoe Williams, I too was in Cuba in the 90s. In 1993 I returned for the first time since 1960 when, during the euphoric early days of the revolution, I spent two months with an international work brigade on the construction of a rural residential school. By contrast, 1993 was a truly terrible year for Cuba. Most supposedly informed observers confidently predicted the imminent collapse of the economy and thought that Cuba would follow the USSR and the eastern European states into oblivion.It is inexcusable to deplore the conditions of extreme hardship endured by the Cuban people without referring to their causes. On top of the US economic blockade of Cuba 每 which was accurately described by Noam Chomsky as the harshest in the world (harsher than the sanctions imposed on Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion), and which in 1993 had already been in place for 33 years 每 in 1992 Cuba also had to contend with the collapse of the Soviet Union and the overnight loss of 75% of its foreign trade. No other country has had to endure an economic calamity of such proportions. To not only have survived but to have provided its people with a free education and public health system renowned throughout the world for their excellence is an achievement without parallel.There is nothing comparable to the 57-year-old relentless, punitive hostility with which the greatest superpower has treated a small, poor third-world country.  I didn＊t recognise Zoe Williams＊ caricature of Cuba under Fidel Castro. Yes, Havana may look a little dowdy 每 but what a relief not to be bombarded with advertising, and the painstaking, carefully planned restoration of the old city (hardly likely under capitalism) has earned it Unesco world heritage site status.If Zoe Williams had ventured a little away from the modestly stocked shops 每 unsurprising given the devastating US economic boycott, which has also depleted the ※elegantly appointed§ pharmacies she mocks 每 she would have found a vibrant musical and cultural life savoured by the Cuban people.It＊s true that prostitution 每 virtually eliminated prior to the fall of Soviet communism 每 made a comeback with the need to promote international tourism. But given a choice between a country that values every one of its citizens and nurtures their abilities, and one where food banks and beggars on street corners are in danger of becoming the norm, is there really any contest? We have just returned from Cuba, which we have visited regularly over the last 20 years, and we don＊t recognise the country described by Zoe Williams and by the media generally. Cuba is a third-world country because it has been hammered by over 50 years of the illegal US blockade. Nor do we recognise the label of dictator. Cuba has a democracy. Members of its government do not need to be wealthy. They are farmers and shopkeepers; doctors and taxi drivers. In other words, they are citizens selected and elected by their peers. They choose their ministers, who then choose their leader. This is a very different model of democracy to ours. There are no political parties and no political campaigns. Compare that with the US, where $2.6bn was spent, resulting in the election of Donald Trump!Castro walked the streets of Havana safely despite over 500 attempts on his life by the CIA. He is revered by his people 每 even the BBC in a report on Sunday acknowledged that the young people in Cuba think favourably of him. Perhaps Cuba＊s achievements in the fields of free education and healthcare have some bearing on this. This so-called dictator lived in a relatively humble home on the outskirts of Havana and sought no financial gain for himself, only a better life for his fellow citizens.Castro challenged the western world, and that is why it despised him and why the western media portrayed him in the way that they did. The pity is that so many people believe that Cuba has been, and is being, oppressed by its leaders. Our visit this month confirmed our belief that in Cuba, despite the hardships that the people have to endure, the majority of the population are cheerful, friendly and content with the egalitarian system that Castro introduced. The Castro apologism from many on  (28 November) is shameful. We can discuss US politics, blockades, education, literacy and socialism all we want, but we would be missing the point. It is painfully ironic that those who claim to be progressive are so willing to throw these aims out the window when it comes to brutal dictators who oppress and murder anyone who thinks differently to them. Perhaps it tells us what the left＊s true aims are. Not equality for all but a vicious hatred of the United States. If standing against the US means throwing gay rights under the bus, then so be it. If standing against the US means throwing religious freedom under the bus, then so be it. If standing against the US means supporting a vicious, brutal, uncompromising, murderous dictator then, it seems, so be it.It is about time the left took a long hard look at themselves. The moral hypocrisy and arrogance is breathtaking and disgraceful. I am ashamed and they should be too. "															
"The fallout from the Brexit vote dominated our business coverage in 2016, led by Graeme Wearden and his daily live blog. Six of our 10 most-read articles covered the aftermath of the shock referendum result, from the trillions wiped off global markets to the plummeting pound and the prospect of negative interest rates. There was Donald Trump too, of course, and an apocalyptic warning from economists in January to ※sell everything§ before a new crash. Based on the number of page views, here are our 10 most popular business stories in 2016. With more than 2m page views, our live blog of the aftermath of Trump＊s election victory was the most-read business article of the year. Our teams in New York, London and Sydney tracked the initial panic as it swept through world markets, followed by an extraordinary rally. Shares in private prison groups and gun makers did particularly well on Wall Street. There were warnings of trouble ahead, but traders appeared to pay no heed. Friday 24 June brought shock, horror and sheer panic to trading floors around the world. Wearden and Nick Fletcher covered it all in an 18-hour live blog of the turmoil that greeted Britain＊s decision to leave the EU. It was an extraordinary day＊s trading. More than $2tn was slashed from the value of global markets and sterling suffered its biggest selloff in recent history. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, stepped up with a promise to take any measures necessary, but economists said the Brexit vote had left Britain on the brink of a recession that would reverberate around the world.In January economists at RBS issued an apocalyptic warning that stock markets could crash by 20% and oil prices slump to $16 a barrel. ※Sell everything except high quality bonds,§ they said.China could be the crisis point, they argued. Their numbers were wrong but they were right when they said it would be a ※cataclysmic§ year. Just as well they didn＊t know then about Brexit and Donald Trump.In the turbulent aftermath of the EU referendum result, as the pound hit 31-year lows and shares tumbled again, Britain was stripped of its last AAA credit rating. Standard & Poor＊s downgraded the nation＊s creditworthiness to AA, with a negative outlook. The agency said Brexit would hit growth and had weakened the predictability, stability and effectiveness of policymaking in the UK.Oxfam＊s annual analysis of how global wealth is (not) shared always makes grim reading. Its analysis in 2016 was timed to coincide with the gathering of many of the world＊s superrich at Davos, and the figures laid bare the vast gap between rich and poor.The charity called for urgent action to tackle the growing inequality that saw the wealth of the poorest half of the world＊s population drop by 41% between 2010 and 2015, while the wealth of the planet＊s richest 62 people jumped by $500bn to $1.76tn.The fallout from the Brexit vote continued to reverberate through the markets, as City property funds barred investors from withdrawing their cash and the Bank of England said risks to the financial system had begun to crystallise.The then chancellor, George Osborne, held a summit with the heads of the major high street banks, who pledged to avoid a new credit crisis by making loans available. Shares in London and around the world rebounded in volatile trading after three traumatic days that wiped an unprecedented $3tn off global markets. As he called for a second referendum to be held, the Virgin boss, Sir Richard Branson, said ※thousands and thousands§ of jobs would be lost in Britain as a result of Brexit.The IMF＊s managing director, Christine Lagarde, called for clarity on Britain＊s Brexit plan ※sooner rather than later§. That was two weeks after the referendum. Six months on, we＊re still waiting.The leading economist Mohamed El-Erian, meanwhile, piled on the pain for the battered pound, saying it could slump to parity with the dollar. One sugar ＃ or 25? A shocking report from the campaign group Action on Sugar found that 98% of the 131 hot flavoured drinks found in the big high street chains would carry a red warning if they were forced to label them. Some hot chocolate and other trendy chai drinks contained staggering amounts of sugar, up to 25 teaspoons, in one serving.Nat West bank raised the spectre of negative interest rates, telling its business customers it might have to charge to accept deposits.The bank, which is part of the Royal Bank of Scotland and so owned by the taxpayer, issued its warning in a letter changing the terms and conditions for its 850,000 business customers, which range from self-employed traders to clubs, charities and large corporations."															
"Optimism among Britain＊s top business executives rebounded to an 18-month high at the end of 2016, but they say they are less willing to take risks in 2017 because of uncertainty surrounding .A Deloitte survey of chief financial officers (CFOs) at some of the UK＊s biggest companies suggested that confidence had risen because of the .The fourth-quarter poll, however, also found that CFOs do not believe it is a good time for their firms to take financial risks, with the effects of  topping their list of concerns.Ian Stewart, Deloitte＊s chief economist, said: ※Buoyed by a backdrop of continued UK growth, CFOs have become markedly more positive on the outlook for their businesses and enter 2017 in better spirits than at any time in the last 18 months.※However, rising optimism does not represent a return to business as usual. Uncertainty in the external environment continues to keep a lid on corporate expansion. Risk appetite remains depressed and is well below average levels and corporates remain on a defensive footing, with cost reduction and building up cash as their top priorities.§Immediately after the referendum, optimism plunged to the lowest level since the 2008 crisis as finance bosses grew fearful of the consequences of the shock result. Sentiment started to recover when the economy proved more resilient than expected in the months following the vote, with  matching the rate in the second quarter.In the latest survey, 27% of CFOs said they were more optimistic about prospects for their companies than they were three months ago, while 22% said they were less optimistic. It was the first quarter since the second quarter of 2015 where a net balance of CFOs were more optimistic.Concerns are mounting, however, about the impact Brexit will have in the future. Of the 119 CFOs of FTSE 350 and other large private companies  surveyed, 89% said they were facing high levels of economic and financial uncertainty, up slightly from 88% in the previous quarter but down from 95% in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum.David Sproul, Deloitte chief executive and a senior partner, said: ※2016 has been a tumultuous year, but the optimism seen in this survey does give us some confidence heading in to 2017. Uncertainty is the new normal in business life, but the challenge for corporates is to gauge and mitigate external risks while staying open to opportunities.§"															
															
"he financial crisis of 2008 gave a big boost to the global standard-setters. Suddenly the Basel committee, which sets the standards for international banking supervision) was leading the financial news.Dinner parties in Manhattan and Kensington were consumed with the finer points of Basel II and the evils of procyclical capital requirements. Governments that had been suspicious of international interference were eager for tougher rules to prevent banking crises from spilling across borders and infecting others.The consequences of this enthusiasm were the creation of the , at the G20＊s London summit in April 2009, and inclusion of representatives of all G20 members among the key rule-makers in Basel and elsewhere. The G7＊s domination gave way to the hope that broader membership would produce more comprehensive buy-in and stronger political support for increasing the banking system＊s capital.All this change has worked, up to a point. The  regulations, for example, more than doubled the capital an individual bank should hold, and enhanced the quality of that capital. The system looks somewhat safer as a result. But now there are dangerous signs that the commitment to stronger global standards 每 indeed, to any common standards 每 may be on the wane.Many predicted this trend, but for the wrong reason. Sceptics warned that it would be harder to reach agreement among 20 or more countries than it had been among the dozen pre-crisis Basel committee members (mainly European countries, with only the US, Canada, and Japan representing the world beyond). In practice, that has not turned out to be a major problem. Basel III was agreed far more quickly than  was. Political pressure from finance ministers, expressed through the FSB, proved effective.In fact, recent tensions have been more old-fashioned, pitting the US against the eurozone, with the UK and others stuck in between. The US has been pressing for tighter controls on banks＊ internal models, and for a limit on how much a bank＊s models can reduce its assets on a risk-weighted basis. Agreement on these so-called output floors has so far proved impossible. The Europeans argue that their banks＊ corporate lending is inherently less risky. After all, EU banks lend more to higher-rated, large companies, which access US capital markets, rather than borrowing from banks. They also hold more low-risk mortgages on their balance sheets, in the absence of a European equivalent of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, America＊s two quasi-public mortgage banks, which hoovered up securitised US mortgages.At its meeting in Santiago, Chile, in November, the Basel committee conspicuously failed to agree on a solution, and kicked the issue upstairs to the committee of governors and heads of supervision, which will try again in January.They will probably find a way to thread this particular needle. But the future for global standards looks more uncertain than it has for some time. Since the 2008 crisis, many countries, while ostensibly supporting the development of tighter global rules, have been taking other measures to protect their own financial systems.The collapse of Lehman Brothers and others showed, in the former Bank of England governor Mervyn King＊s memorable phrase, that big banks are ※global in life, but national in death§. In other words, when a global bank crashes, the host-country regulators must pick up the local pieces. That＊s why requirements to establish local subsidiaries, with local capital, have been adopted. Gone are the days when banks could set up branches all over the planet, with support from the parent＊s balance sheet. Subsidiarisation is now the rule.Looking ahead, we can see that the two biggest players in the FSB and Basel have other preoccupations. Donald Trump＊s incoming US administration has already signalled its . Making America great again is not likely to involve new enthusiasm for more intrusive rules made in Basel. Those who advocate rolling back much of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation, in favour of a higher leverage ratio, as  advanced by Representative Jeb Hensarling, envisage a ※Made in the USA§ version of banking regulation. But, while the idea has some merit, it would not sit easily within the current Basel framework.Europe faces other worries. Regulators there are now keenly focused on the implications of Brexit, which will require complex arrangements to manage a new relationship between London and the eurozone. The top priority for the European Central Bank must be to preserve the integrity of the EU banking union, which is under pressure from both Brexit and the .Against this background, it will be a challenge to retain the primacy of global standards and to secure continued buy-in to the Basel process. The Bank for International Settlements＊ new general manager, Agust赤n Carstens, a former governor of Mexico＊s central bank, will have a key role to play, as will whoever replaces  每 the governor of the Bank of England 每 next year as chairman of the FSB. It is likely, too, that there will soon be a new chair of the Basel committee itself. Stefan Ingves of Sweden is due to step down in June.These three new leaders will need all of their diplomatic skills to navigate treacherous political waters. The stakes are high. If the commitment to global standards wanes, everyone will suffer in the long run. Countries will impose incompatible local requirements, which will reduce the efficiency of capital utilisation and make the system less robust in the event of renewed financial instability."															
"A boost in self-assessment tax receipts and a bumper flow of capital gains tax to the exchequer has sent the government＊s borrowing bill to its lowest January level in 17 years.The boost in January＊s tax receipts is expected to put the chancellor, , in a position to ease some of the Treasury＊s planned austerity in the next financial year when he stands up to deliver his first full budget in a fortnight.The rise in tax income generated a surplus of ?9.4bn, the highest January gain since 1999, prompting the Treasury＊s independent forecaster to say the government was on track to undershoot the ?68bn deficit target at the end of the financial year.The Office for  Responsibility said official figures showing the deficit had tumbled to ?49.3bn in the financial year so far and if the sequence of healthy figures continued could put it on course to hit ?56bn by the end of March. The OBR said the estimated ?12bn improvement was likely to give ※a reasonable sense of the extent to which borrowing is undershooting§. But it also warned that tax receipts remained volatile as investors considered how much income to bring forward to avoid higher taxes next year and the banks agreed the size of annual bonus payments.However, the surplus for January 2017 nudged only ?300m higher than the same month last year, which was less than City economists had expected. Yael Selfin, chief UK economist at KPMG, said the stronger January public finances figures could see government net borrowing well below the OBR＊s November figure, though it was unlikely to sink back to the ?55bn level foreseen in March last year.※This gives the chancellor a bit more room for manoeuvre in his final spring budget next month. If the UK economy remains stable over the transition period once article 50 is triggered, Hammond could meet his objective to reduce the budget deficit below 2% GDP by 2020-21, while offering a few small giveaways. ※These could include alleviating the burden on some small businesses impacted by rising business rates, and providing additional support to public services that are under increasing strain, such as the NHS, social care and education.※However, in these uncertain times, the chancellor is likely to hold some ammunition back, in case the economy proves weaker in the run-up to UK＊s departure from the European Union, so more significant policy announcements are not likely before the autumn budget in November.§Suren Thiru, an economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, was also sceptical that Hammond would plan any major giveaways in the next budget.※Over the long term, the task of restoring public finances remains significant. If UK growth becomes more sluggish, as we expect, the UK will find it increasingly challenging to generate the tax receipts needed to deliver real progress in cutting the deficit,§ he said.In November the OBR said the weaker economic outlook since the Brexit vote meant its March 2016 prediction of the public deficit was way off the mark and revised it to ?68bn for the current financial year.But a strong recovery in the months after the referendum put Britain in the front rank of developed world economies and forced many forecasters to revise up their predictions of growth for 2017.The Treasury, which has abandoned former chancellor George Osborne＊s target to create a surplus in the public finances in this parliament, said the deficit would continue to fall.A spokesman said: ※We remain committed to returning the public finances to balance and building on our progress in reducing the deficit from 10% to 4% of GDP over the last six years. Next month the chancellor will deliver his spring budget based on updated forecasts from the OBR.§The public finances were also bolstered by a rise in corporation tax receipts, though the effect was disguised by a switch in the way the ONS accounts for payments by firms.VAT receipts increased by 3.7% in January on the same month last year and corporation tax receipts rose 5%.The Office for National Statistics said self-assessed income tax and capital gains tax receipts increased by ?2bn to ?19.8bn in January compared with January 2016, pushing the total to the highest January since 1999, when records began."															
															
"A surprise leap in retail sales volumes last month has boosted hopes the UK economy will end the year on a high note, as .A rush to buy winter clothes and buoyant Halloween trade for supermarkets helped UK retail sales grow at the fastest annual pace for 14 years in October, according to . Defying  that a vote to leave could spark recession, the figures showed households continued to increase their spending last month and retail sales volumes were up 7.4% on a year earlier. That was the strongest growth since early 2002 and beat forecasts for growth of 5.3% in a Reuters poll of economists.On the month, sales were up by 1.9%, well ahead of forecasts for a 0.4% rise. But economists were quick to warn the growth would be hard to sustain.The Office for National Statistics said there were several factors behind the October improvement.※Cooler temperatures in October boosted clothing sales as shoppers took their cue to purchase winter clothing, while the supermarkets benefited from Halloween. This has also coincided with the strongest growth in internet sales seen for five years,§ said Kate Davies, an ONS senior statistician.The jump in sales on a year ago came as all types of retailers, from grocers to petrol stations, enjoyed some growth. The biggest contribution came from non-store retailing, which includes market stalls and mail order as well as internet-only retailers such as Amazon. Average weekly spending online was ?1bn, an increase of 26.8% compared with October 2015.Separate figures from online retail trade body IMRG showed home goods performed particularly well last month, with spending up 24% on the year. ※This could have been spurred by a deteriorating pound, with people more focused on domestic home improvements rather than spending on holidays abroad 每 which have become a lot more expensive since the Brexit vote,§ IMRG said, in its monthly sales snapshot published with consultancy Capgemini.Economists said the overall rise in retail sales was encouraging for the economy＊s growth prospects in the final quarter of this year, but there were warnings that consumer spending could slow next year.※Clearly, this is a great start to fourth quarter GDP on the spending side,§ said Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London.He said the weak pound may have played a role as it  to the UK looking to . ※It could also be consumers bringing forward spending to today, in anticipation of higher prices tomorrow,§ he added.After official inflation data this week came in weaker than economists expected, showing that  year on year in October, the ONS said retail figures showed there were falls in average prices across all store types last month, except petrol stations. But the drop in average store prices was the smallest for more than two years at 0.7% and will be taken as a further sign the UK＊s long spell of very low inflation is coming to an end. The drop in sterling against other currencies since the Brexit vote has raised import costs to the UK and been  in the prices of .That would make October＊s ※mini-boom§ for retailers hard to repeat, said Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit.※Such strong growth is clearly unsustainable, and cracks are in fact already appearing. Survey data highlight how households are struggling to support existing spending due to weak income growth and rising prices, and how this negative trend is likely to intensify in coming months,§ he said."															
"Sluggish wage growth means the average employee is ?3,500 a year worse off since the Conservatives came to power, according to  analysis of Treasury figures before chancellor Philip Hammond＊s first autumn statement next week.Compared with the average wage growth under Labour, full-time employees are ?67 a week or ?292 a month worse off, the party＊s report found. The analysis compared the average annual percentage change in wages in the six years of the Conservative and coalition governments, which is 1.3%.In contrast, the average growth under the last Labour government was 3.2%, though growth fell significantly post-2008. Labour will use slow wage growth as a key argument against plans to cut universal credit, which Hammond is being urged to reverse in his autumn statement on 23 November.Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, has said the government will not make any more immediate welfare cuts after the UK＊s vote to leave the EU in order to focus on economic recovery, but said cuts already announced would go ahead as planned., the shadow chancellor, said: ※We have known for a long time that the government has failed to make good on its promises to ＆make work pay＊; we have had sluggish wage growth and a failure to return wages to their 2008 peak. That＊s why Labour is calling on the chancellor, in the upcoming autumn statement, to reverse the damaging cuts to universal credit still planned for the remainder of this parliament.§Labour will also focus on the self-employed in the party＊s response to the autumn statement, with the shadow work and pensions secretary, Debbie Abrahams, highlighting the gaps in the national insurance framework for freelancers or small business owners, who make up 15% of the workforce.In a speech on Monday, Abrahams will call for changes to the current system in which self-employed workers are not able to gain access to important elements of the social security system, including sick pay and paternity pay, and for the government to tackle the potential pensions black hole because of lower personal pension savings among the self-employed. ※In so many ways, self-employment is characteristic of both the opportunities and the challenges faced by our society,§ she will say. ※It brings to the individual a combination of great freedom with great risk, an ability to build one＊s own enterprise or to work flexibly around other priorities; it can offer great prosperity for some, but poverty pay for others.§"															
"All right: the egregious Donald Trump＊s victory is, in his words, ※Brexit plus, plus, plus§, and it is far more significantly ominous for the rest of the world than?Brexit.But what Trump＊s triumph also does is to strengthen the case for re-examining the  decision. Europe is now faced with huge geopolitical concerns. It should be pulling together, and resisting the centrifugal forces which the result of the British referendum can only aggravate.Put bluntly, the rest of the  needs Britain, and, as it faces up to the implications of Trump＊s love affair with Putin and manifest isolationist tendencies, the last thing either we or the other 27 need is for Brexit to dominate the next few years.I still meet people who are surprised to learn that, on referendum day, Nigel Farage stated that, if the result were to be 52%-48% in favour of Remain, then it should be followed by another referendum.The very idea that ※the British people have spoken§, and that therefore the vote is irrevocable, does not quite stand the test of history. The British people spoke in 1975, but the likes of Nigel Farage did not like what they said, so in due course we saw the rise of Ukip and the emergence of Farage, conveniently financed personally by a salary from the European parliament 每 a salary which, I understand, he continues to draw. Talk about having it?both ways.Time after time, people change their minds in a parliamentary democracy 每 there was a time in Italy in the 1950s and 1960s when they seemed to have elections every year. The hysteria fomented by the Brexit press, with attacks on the legitimacy of judges, is reminiscent of Germany in the 1930s and the rise of Hitler. We have a prime minister who seems to be obsessed by what the  advises; younger readers may care to study the record of that newspaper with regard to fascism in the 1930s.It is worth repeating that only 37% of the adult population voted for Brexit and many of them were misled by a nasty propaganda campaign from the Leavers, which crossed the boundary from selective use of the facts to outright lies. It is therefore good to see that Professor Bob Watt, an expert in electoral law at the University of Buckingham, that the lies propagated by the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaigns 每 the EU costing ?350m a week which could go to the NHS, ※Turkey joining the EU§, etc 每 contravened electoral law.There is already a bottomless pit of articles and emails on the question of the timing of invoking article 50 of the Lisbon treaty 每 to begin the process, not of negotiation, but of withdrawal from the EU. We now await the judgment of the supreme court early next year on the high court＊s ruling that parliament should be involved.I thought it was pretty shocking in the first place that our prime minister should have tried to bypass the sovereignty of parliament, and she continued to shock when refusing to criticise the vicious,1930s-style attacks on the judges 每 merely saying that she believed in a free press. Don＊t we all 每 but, surely, a free and responsible one.As  reminds us, the  picture of the three high court judges used a headline 每 ※Enemies of the people§ 每 that echoed the vile slogans of Robespierre, Lenin, Chairman Mao and the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher.It is not as if, according to recent reports, she needs to worry. We are told that, although the vast majority of MPs are against Brexit, most of them are intending to ※respect§ the result of the?referendum.This country is heading for a train crash. As one political historian said last week: ※I don＊t think there is any previous example in British history where policymakers were so determined to vote against their true?beliefs.§The problem for those of us who remain unrepentant Remainers is that the economic consequences of 23 June constitute a ※slow burner§. This is the biggest British economic crisis of my long experience, and I have little doubt that when the full extent of the damage to investment becomes apparent, it will become increasingly obvious that the vast majority of the people will regret their decision.As to the crucial point of whether the referendum result can legally be reversed, , Andrew Duff 每 a great expert on all matters European 每 wrote: ※Contrary to the claims made in the English high court, article 50 is indeed revocable. Article 50(2) involves a notification of an intention to withdraw from the union. Intentions can change, especially after a general election and the installation of a new government.§Meanwhile, our new chancellor faces the daunting prospect when preparing his much-hyped autumn statement (due 23 November) of dire economic forecasts from the Institute of Fiscal Studies 每 and doubtless, in due course, from the Office for Budget Responsibility.These will reflect the expected impact on the nation＊s finances of the exodus of financial and other institutions that want to ensure their place in the single market. They have to take serious long-term decisions, and are not impressed by the chaotic non-strategy of the Brexiters."															
"The battered pound has notched up its best two-week performance in eight years after the surprise US election result took investor focus off the UK＊s  challenges.Market concerns shifted to the euro amid fears that Donald Trump＊s victory will trigger a  and political uncertainty throughout Europe.Measured against other currencies, sterling enjoyed its best fortnight since 2008. It remains well below pre-referendum levels, but on Friday managed to . That will soothe concerns over a weak currency pushing up import costs and stoking inflation.While the pound rebounded, the FTSE 100 share index fell by more than 1% for the second day running, erasing all the gains made on the day of Trump＊s win.That cappedThere was also uncertainty over how his campaign trail rhetoric would translate into clampdowns for some sectors, such as technology companies and other internationally focused firms, and into deregulation for others, including energy and banking.Amid all the confusion, the pound was a a clear outperformer. Against the euro it was up 0.75% to 1.1608. Analysts offered various explanations for its rebound this week. ※There may be some hopes that Trump＊s election victory could put the UK at the front of the queue for a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, although at the very least this week＊s events have shifted the focus away from the UK＊s impending departure from the EU,§ said Chris Saint, a senior analyst at the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown.Jasper Lawler, a market analyst at the spread-betting and trading firm CMC Markets, also highlighted hopes of a UK trade deal with the US as well as other factors. ※On the EU side, there is rising concern that upcoming elections, starting with the Italian referendum next month, mean it is the next target for the rise in populism,§ he said.※The British pound as a top foreign-exchanges gainer this week bucks the trend of Brexit-induced weakness seen over the past few months. There＊s an element of simply a shift in focus behind this. The phenomenon of  as US president-elect has put Brexit on the back-burner, allowing the pound to creep higher.§On the FTSE 100 index, the pound＊s recovery put pressure on those companies that report in dollars. They had been bolstered in recent months from sterling＊s slump as it flatters their finances and also increases competitiveness for UK firms that export.On Friday the blue-chip index closed down 1.4%, or 97.6 points lower, at 6,730.43. Firms exposed to emerging markets were among the biggest losers as investors fretted over how Trump＊s anti-trade stance will hurt their prospects. On Wall Street, a Trump-driven rally petered out and after  the Dow Jones industrial average eased back and was bobbing around the unchanged mark during Friday afternoon trading.Banking shares have benefited since the Trump victory as investors reminded themselves of his campaign pledge to tear up  每 post-banking crisis reforms 每 and other regulations.Deutsche Bank was given a fillip on hopes that the Department of Justice would accelerate its talks over a settlement for a decade-old mis-selling scandal but demand less than the initial $14bn. , although on Friday they rose by 4.6% to their highest level since late June. ※The sweeping Republican victories on 9 November mean that some of the Democrat appointments at the US Department of Justice have only a few weeks left before they are replaced. Accelerating litigation settlements with banks may be one way to end a DoJ tenure with a sense of achievement. Swifter resolution would likely result in smaller settlements for the banks, since larger fines could lead to [potentially lengthy] court cases,§ said analysts at Barclays, who said this would help Deutsche and Credit Suisse.But it could be more troublesome for Royal Bank of Scotland, 73% owned by UK taxpayers, which is yet to begin settlement talks over the same mis-selling scandal involving residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS). More broadly, Trump＊s fiscal stimulus policies might also help. ※This comes at a time when the confidence in the efficacy of monetary policy appears to be on the wane in any event ＃ Shifting the focus of the rates debate would undoubtedly be helpful for the revenue outlook at European banks,§ the Barclays analysts said."															
"The construction sector suffered its worst quarter for four years following the vote to leave the EU and, in a blow to government hopes for better housing supply, homebuilding stalled. showed output in the construction sector, which accounts for 6% of the UK economy, slipped by 1.1% in the July to September quarter from the previous quarter. That echoed reports from builders after the Brexit vote that economic uncertainty was hitting their order books. But the figures from the Office for National Statistics on Friday were slightly better than its earlier estimate that construction output had fallen 1.4% in the quarter.Figures for September alone showed a small month-on-month rise in output of 0.3%, beating forecasts for a 0.2% dip in a Reuters poll of economists.The details of the latest report will make disappointing reading for the government as it bids to get housebuilding going to address a chronic shortage of housing in the UK. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to use his  to set out measures to increase housing supply.The ONS said total new housing recorded no growth in the third quarter, following a small dip the previous quarter. ※Given the UK＊s acute housing shortage, the government will be disappointed to see that new house building was only flat quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter,§ said Howard Archer, economist at the consultancy IHS Global Insight. But housebuilder Redrow noted that housing was still up 8.7% when compared with the same period in 2015 as private new housing increased by 10.8% but public new housing 每 a much smaller part of the sector 每 fell 3.1%.John Tutte, chief executive officer at Redrow, said the year-on-year figures painted a ※much-improving picture for housing over the last year§.※This trend chimes with our own recent positive figures which revealed that last year we increased completions on homes by 17%, with our forward order book at record levels,§ said Tutte.※Demand for homes is still incredibly high, a trend even  has failed to dampen in our recent experience, and we have geared up our business for growth in response.§Hammond is also expected to announce more spending on infrastructure as he pares back the previous chancellor George Osborne＊s austerity drive and looks for ways to shore up economic activity as the UK starts negotiations to leave the EU.The latest ONS figures on infrastructure, which includes projects such as road building and railways, showed output increased by 1.2% in July to September. That was the first quarter-on-quarter increase in infrastructure for more than a year. But compared with the same period a year ago there was a fall of 7.7% in output.Commenting on the first full quarter of construction data since the referendum, ONS statistician Kate Davies said small rises in infrastructure and public building work had been offset by large falls in repair and maintenance work, down 3.4% on the quarter. ※Construction output has remained broadly flat in the last year, both before and after the recent referendum,§ she said.The construction sector is still recovering from a deep recession prompted by the global financial crisis. Economists expect the Brexit vote and protracted process of leaving the EU will weigh it down further.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ※The downturn in construction output in the third quarter is shallower than the ONS initially estimated, but the sector still faces severe challenges ahead. ※The construction sector＊s outlook will brighten if the chancellor cancels planned cuts to public sector investment in the autumn statement later this month. But unlike other indicators, firms＊ investment intentions have not recovered since the Brexit vote, so commercial construction still looks set to weaken.※Meanwhile, demand for new homes likely will deteriorate next year as households＊ real incomes are squeezed by high inflation and as lenders reflect the recent sharp rise in funding costs in mortgage rates.§Kay Daniel Neufeld, economist at the consultancy Cebr, said that aside from Brexit uncertainty the sector faces various other challenges, including regulatory hurdles and skills shortages.Looking ahead to the UK outside the EU, he added: ※Stricter immigration controls would further exacerbate the problem for the UK construction sector.§"															
"ow that  has unexpectedly won the US presidency, it is an open question whether he will govern in accordance with his campaign＊s radical populism, or adopt a pragmatic, centrist approach.If Trump governs in accordance with the campaign that got him elected, we can expect market scares in the US and around the world, as well as potentially significant economic damage. But there is good reason to expect that he will govern very differently.A radical populist Trump would scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), repeal the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), and impose high tariffs on Chinese imports. He would also build his promised US-Mexico border wall; deport millions of undocumented workers; restrict H1B visas for the skilled workers needed in the tech sector; and fully repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which would leave millions of people without health insurance.Overall, a radical Trump would significantly increase the US budget deficit. He would sharply reduce taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals. And while he would broaden the tax base, increase the carried-interest tax, and encourage companies to repatriate foreign profits, his plan would not be revenue-neutral. He would increase military and public-sector spending in areas such as infrastructure, and his tax cuts for the rich would reduce government revenue by $9tn over a decade.A radical Trump would also drastically change the current monetary-policy approach 每 first by replacing the US Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, with a monetarist hawk, and then by filling current and upcoming Fed board vacancies with more of the same. Moreover, he would repeal what he could of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms; gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; cut alternative-energy subsidies and environmental regulations; and slash any other regulations that supposedly hurt big business.Finally, a radical Trump＊s foreign policy would destabilise America＊s alliances and escalate tensions with rivals. His protectionist stance could incite a global trade war, and his insistence that allies pay for their own defence could lead to dangerous nuclear proliferation, while diminishing American leadership on the world stage.But it is actually more likely that Trump will pursue pragmatic, centrist policies. For starters, Trump is a businessman who relishes the ※art of the deal§, so he is by definition more of a pragmatist than a blinkered ideologue. His choice to run as a populist was tactical, and does not necessarily reflect deep-seated beliefs.Indeed, Trump is a wealthy real-estate mogul who has lived his entire life among other rich businessmen. He is a savvy marketer who tapped into the political zeitgeist by pandering to working-class Republicans and ※Reagan Democrats§, some of whom may have supported Vermont senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. This allowed him to stand out in a crowded field of traditional pro-business, pro-Wall Street, and pro-globalisation politicians.Once in office, Trump will throw symbolic red meat to his supporters while reverting to the traditional supply-side, trickle-down economic policies that Republicans have favoured for decades. Trump＊s vice-presidential choice, Mike Pence, is an establishment GOP politician, and his campaign＊s economic advisers were wealthy businessmen, financiers, real-estate developers, and supply-side economists. What＊s more, he is reportedly already considering mainstream Republicans for his cabinet, including former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, Alabama Senator Jess Sessions, and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin (who also advised his campaign).The traditional Republicans and business leaders Trump will likely appoint will then shape his policies. The executive branch adheres to a decision-making process whereby relevant departments and agencies determine the risks and rewards of given scenarios, and then furnish the president with a limited menu of policy options from which to choose. And, given Trump＊s inexperience, he will be all the more dependent on his advisers, just as former presidents Ronald Reagan and George W Bush were.Trump will also be pushed more to the centre by Congress, with which he will have to work to pass any legislation. House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republican leadership in the Senate have more mainstream GOP views than Trump on trade, migration, and budget deficits. Meanwhile, the Democratic minority in the Senate will be able to filibuster any radical reforms that Trump proposes, especially if they touch the third rail of American politics: social security and medicare.Trump will also be checked by the American political system＊s separation of powers, relatively independent government agencies such as the Fed, and a free and vibrant press.But the market itself will be Trump＊s biggest constraint. If he tries to pursue radical populist policies, the response will be swift and punishing: stocks will plummet, the dollar will fall, investors will flee to US Treasury bonds, gold prices will spike, and so forth. If, however, Trump blends more benign populist policies with mainstream pro-business ones, he will not face a market fallout. Now that he has won the election, there is little reason for him to choose populism over safety.The effects of a pragmatic Trump presidency would be far more limited than in the radical scenario. First, he would still ditch the TPP; but so would Hillary Clinton. He claimed that he would repeal Nafta, but he will more likely try to tweak it as a nod to American blue-collar workers. And even if a pragmatic Trump wanted to limit imports from China, his options would be limited by a recent World Trade Organisation  against ※targeted dumping§ tariffs on Chinese goods. Outsider candidates often bash China during their election campaigns, but quickly realise once in office that cooperation is in their own interest.Trump probably will build his wall on the Mexican border, even though fewer new immigrants are arriving than in the past. But he will likely crack down only on undocumented immigrants who commit violent crimes, rather than trying to deport 5-10 million people. Meanwhile, he may still limit visas for high-skill workers, which would deplete some of the tech sector＊s dynamism.A pragmatic Trump would still generate fiscal deficits, though smaller than in the radical scenario. If he follows the Congressional Republicans＊ proposed tax plan, for example, revenue would be reduced only by $2tn over a decade.To be sure, the policy mix under a pragmatic Trump administration would be ideologically inconsistent and moderately bad for growth. But it would be far more acceptable to investors 每 and the world 每 than the radical agenda he promised his voters.?"															
"t may well be the greatest test of whether the cold reality of office dampens the campaign rhetoric of the next occupant of the White House. Out on the stump, there was no doubt which country  held most guilty for the loss of American jobs and saw as the major obstacle to making America Great Again. But going head to head with China would involve a nexus of problems that a business-savvy chief executive should wish to avoid. So will Trump＊s natural combativeness and the pumped-up feelings of his core supporters prevail, or will reason force itself on him?The  conundrum is emblematic of the huge uncertainty surrounding the president-elect. We know the campaign rhetoric about slapping a 45% tariff on Chinese goods. We know that he accuses Beijing of being a currency manipulator and using America as a ※piggy bank§.We know the person he endorses as ※right on§ about China, university professor Peter Navarro, sees war with the People＊s Republic as ※§, argues that ※Bill Clinton sold America down the Shanghai River§, and urges the US to fight China＊s mercantilism by being tough on trade and taxing China＊s exports.But President Trump would be well advised to steer away from the rhetoric of Candidate Trump in dealing with the world＊s second biggest economy and the rising superpower, accepting the all-important nuances of the world＊s single most important relationship.When Deng Xiaoping perceived at the end of the 1970s that the way to make China great again and to save the Communist party from implosion was to pursue economic growth, he turned to exports. The bargain that emerged suited everybody, and led to the entry of the People＊s Republic of China (PRC) into the World Trade Organisation in 2001. China got its growth from selling cheap goods abroad, and attracted foreign investment and technology.Rich countries, led by the US, got cheap imports that kept down inflation and satisfied consumers. The deal got even better when Beijing recycled its earnings into US government bonds, providing capital to help fuel a credit binge.That changed in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Barack Obama skirted round the China question as best he could. Now Trump has to decide how to proceed. It is no longer simply an economic issue.Abandoning Deng＊s advice to keep a low international profile, Xi Jinping aspires to walk tall beside any president from across the Pacific. Though far behind America in terms of overall military strength, the PRC has been building up its forces and asserting its presence in the South China Sea. Forecasts that it will rule the world are confounded by a host of political, economic, social and strategic factors. But, for a president who aspires to make America the unchallenged world champion, the presence of a country intent on becoming equal geopolitical number one can only be troubling.There is no shortage of issues on which to confront China, stretching from trade through intellectual property rights to the mainland＊s reef-building programme in the South China Sea and its unwillingness or incapacity to bring North Korea to heel. One might even add human rights, if they seemed a matter of concern to any of the presidential candidates. But if Beijing comes under pressure on one front, it is likely to react on another. The economic story is interconnected; slapping tariffs on products made in China may play well in depressed manufacturing areas, but there would be a big negative effect on US firms with plants on the mainland, or which assemble goods there 每 and Chinese retaliation would hit their important mainland revenues.Beijing is making the most of the electoral outcome, its media warning that this is what democracy brings. It will seek to exploit doubts about a Trump administration＊s engagement in the fraught situation in east Asia 每 not only over Korea and the South China Sea, but also with animosity between China and Japan, the unresolved matter of Taiwan and growing the way the US urged governments to participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and then repudiated the trade deal.Trump＊s talk of changing the relationship with allies adds to the discomfort. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, quickly booked himself a meeting with the president-elect, who is said to regard treaties as akin to contracts open to renegotiation.Four decades on from China＊s economic opening-up, there is little mutual trust between it and the US, but each knows it needs the other. A grand deal between Washington and Beijing remains highly elusive. If Trump were to aspire to seek it 每 in a new, realpolitik framework 每 he would have to turn his back on core voters and manage a multifaceted strategy at odds with the simplicity of his campaign and his isolationist tendencies. Hence the importance of the test 每 and the probability that each side will continue to prefer to rub along with the other."															
"Asia＊s emerging currencies have have been hit hard by a wave of selling as financial markets bet on the prospect of  pursuing protectionist trade policies.Despite stocks , investors across Asia turned cautious on Friday on fears that Trump could stifle access to the world＊s biggest economy and that his expansionist fiscal plans could fire inflation at home and higher US interest rates. The greenback almost hit 107 yen for the first time since July in US trade and it maintained most of the gains in Asia, sitting at 106.62 yen 每 well up from the 101.20 yen touched in the initial panic of Trump＊s win.It also surged against other currencies across Asia Pacific. The Indonesian rupiah plunged more than 5%,  while the Australian dollar was down 2% and Malaysia＊s ringgit lost 1%.China fixed its yuan reference rate beyond 6.8 against the dollar for the first time in more than six years, with analysts warning the unit could drop further raising more concerns about currency wars.The South Korean won was 1.6% lower after the country＊s central bank held interest rates at record lows.Across the Pacific, the Mexican peso fell back towards record lows on worries about the Trump＊s anti-Mexico stance. The dollar was also up 3.3% at 20.64 Mexican pesos, close to its all-time highs.After an initial shock,  on news Trump had beaten Hillary Clinton, with investors hoping for business-friendly policies and measures to boost the US economy, a key driver of world growth.However, there are worries about his plans after saying he will tear up several trade deals while ramping up import duties.And expectations that Trump＊s plans for huge spending projects will fan prices have lit a fire under the dollar as dealers bet the Federal Reserve will hike borrowing costs more aggressively to keep prices under control.That in turn has led to fears of huge capital outflows from  as investors go back to the US for better, safer returns.The peso 每 as well as the Mexican stock market 每 has been hammered by fears Trump will follow through on campaign pledges to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as pressure the country to pay billions of dollars for a giant border wall.※The dollar is up against most major currencies supported by an upward revision to US interest expectations and focus on Trump＊s pro-growth and inflationary economic policies,§ Elias Haddad, a senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, told Bloomberg News.※Trump＊s economic policies will force the Fed to raise the funds rate at a faster pace than otherwise, which [will push the dollar up].§On equities markets, investors sent Hong Kong 1.5% lower and Seoul 0.9% down, while Taipei, Manila and Jakarta were all down around 2%.The Nikkei in Japan bucked the trend as the weaker yen boosted exporters, although it was down from earlier highs. The CSi300 in Shanghai was up 0.2% and Australia＊s ASX/S&P200 put on 0.3%.Oil prices fell in early trading on Friday, as the market refocused on a persistent supply overhang that is not expected to abate unless Opec and other producers make a significant cut to their output. Brent crude futures were trading at $45.74 per barrel at 0445 GMT, down 10c, or 0.2%, from their last close. Copper, in contrast, soared 5% to a 16-month high as speculation that US infrastructure spending could jump under a Republican administration unleashed a wave of interest in industrial metals.Zinc hit a five-and-a-half-year peak and nickel was at its highest since July 2015.

"Speculation that the UK could avoid a hard  from the European Union, and fears that Donald Trump might snatch a last-minute victory in the race for the White House, have helped sterling register its biggest weekly gain against the US dollar in seven years.The pound＊s respite from its recent heavy falls on the foreign exchanges continued on Friday when it put on a cent against the US currency to trade at $1.2558 每 its highest level for four weeks.Sterling＊s rally came despite , which strengthened Wall Street＊s belief that official borrowing costs in the world＊s biggest economy will be raised before Christmas.Currency dealers paid less interest than usual to the 161,000 increase in non-farm employment last month and the 0.4% increase in hourly earnings, focusing instead on the knife-edge battle between Hillary Clinton and Trump for the presidency.The pound has been rising since the start of the week after evidence of a narrowing of Clinton＊s opinion-poll lead and amid  that the UK economy was set to grow robustly in the fourth quarter of 2016.Sterling then received a double-boost on Thursday when the , and the Bank of England announced that .※We＊re seeing a bit of a relief rally now that the worst-case scenario of a unilateral hard Brexit has been deferred, and markets can start focusing on other factors (like) the US presidential election,§ said CMC analyst Michael Hewson.Investors believe turbulent market conditions will continue, with a government appeal against the high court ruling scheduled for next month, and some analysts weighing up the chances that Theresa May will call an early election to push ahead with Brexit.※Just as markets were looking forward to getting the US election out of the way, this week has seen speculation that another UK election could be right around the corner,§ said Paul Hollingsworth, chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital .The pound ended the week almost 3% higher against the dollar - its strongest performance since October 2009 每 but remained 16% lower than it was before the Brexit referendum in late June.Sterling＊s depreciation has been helpful for the City＊s main stock market yardstick 每 the  100 每 since many of the companies included in the index have dollar earnings which are flattered by a drop in the pound.This week＊s rise in sterling was accompanied by the biggest drop in the FTSE 100 since January. A fall of 97 points on Friday to 6,693 points brought the cumulative loss over the week to 301 points 每 a 4.3% decline. The FTSE 250, which includes more domestically focused companies, posted a smaller 1.8% weekly fall.The last set of US labour market figures before Tuesday＊s election showed a slightly smaller increase in non-farm payrolls than the 175,000 rise Wall Street had been expecting.But analysts said the improvement was solid enough to persuade the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised up jobs growth for August and September by a combined 44,000 and said annual wages growth had edged up from 2.7% to 2.8% 每 a seven-year high.※It seems that the only remaining obstacle to the Fed hiking in December would be a significant adverse financial market reaction to the US presidential election,§ said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the consultancy IHS Markit., as tension between the near neighbours threatened to derail talks aimed at cutting production by the  group of oil-producing countries.Riyadh is reportedly threatening to turn the screw on Tehran before this month＊s crucial  meeting by increasing its own output to push prices even lower.Saudi Arabia produces up to 10.7m barrels per day (bpd) at the moment, but Opec sources said it had threatened to open the taps much further.※The Saudis have threatened to raise their production to 11m bpd and even 12m bpd, bringing oil prices down, and to withdraw from the meeting,§ one Opec source told Reuters.The cost of a barrel of Brent crude dropped to $45.02 before recovering to $45.42, down 2%, after Opec＊s secretary general, Mohammed Barkindo, denied Saudi Arabia had made any threats."															
"here is a tendency to . However, the 2016 US presidential election could deliver a tectonic shift in international economic relations.For the most part, the candidates＊ platforms are standard, partisan fare.  argues for investment in education and infrastructure, and a higher minimum wage. Donald Trump, too, advocates infrastructure spending along with tax cuts and the repeal of Barack Obama＊s healthcare law.However, one issue simultaneously distinguishes the main contenders from previous nominees while separating one from the other. Since at least 1945, it has been a near article of faith in the west that free trade is an engine of growth. No candidate for either main US party has sought to roll back trade liberalisation. Until now.Previously in favour of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a draft of which she once described as , Hillary Clinton now opposes it. Her reason is that it provides insufficient protection to American workers whose jobs and living standards it might harm.Donald Trump is more strident still, and quite distinctly different from any candidate since 1928. Then, Herbert Hoover won the White House promising farmers that he would . In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which increased levies on a range of goods, not just farm products. The consequent retaliation of other nations  in world trade.On his visits to Pittsburgh, once the crucible of US steel production,  that the industry＊s demise was down to bad trade deals negotiated by incompetent bureaucrats. He promised to conclude good, tough deals and bring back steel. While the likely content of a Trump trade policy is unclear, he has threatened tariffs of  and . He says  is an option and that he will .The dogs on the street seem to know that Clinton＊s position is an electoral convenience. , she threw TPP overboard in the primaries but will throw it a lifebelt in office, the argument runs. Rhetorically at least, Trump seems set on holing the world trading system below the waterline. If he expects other countries meekly to accept tariff hikes, he will be sorely disappointed.This antipathy to free trade baffles conventionally schooled policymakers who believe, correctly, that it makes us better off on average. While most people win, however, some lose and lose badly. Economists  have shown that in parts of the US exposed to competition from China, unemployment has risen, pay has fallen and the number claiming benefits has increased. The winners＊ gains are spread thinly and widely. The losers＊ losses tend to be deep and are often concentrated in specific areas, around cities such as Pittsburgh. Although the winners could compensate the losers leaving everyone better off, neither in the US nor elsewhere have we found a way to do that. Trade adjustment assistance 每 payments to US workers affected by import competition 每 has not offset the effects of job losses. makes states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania crucial to the outcome of the race. They more than most have lost jobs to import competition. In this context, railing against trade makes sense. Continuing that in office would leave the US, and others, worse off.Even if Clinton wins and, once in office, tacks towards a freer trade position, this issue will not go away. More Americans  than the opposite. This is not just an American phenomenon. In , fewer than two-fifths of people support an EU-US free trade agreement. Among the explanations for the UK＊s vote to leave the EU is that the places that voted most for Brexit were those that had .Free trade has been a . But winning that case in the public square will no longer be achieved though facts, figures and smart debating points. People need to be convinced, through governments＊ actions, that trade agreements will be properly enforced and that when jobs are threatened there is genuine compensation for the losers. Fail to do that and we will undermine one of the most effective means of improving living standards."															
"Fifteen years without a pay rise. The most protracted squeeze on real wages since Nelson＊s victory over Napoleon＊s fleet in the Battle of Trafalgar. A lost decade for productivity growth. The gist of the post-budget analysis from two of Britain＊s leading thinktanks was simple: the economy continues to break records 每 mostly for the wrong reasons.Neither the  nor the could get especially worked up about the political controversy of the moment: . The move was seen as progressive and a small step in the direction of aligning the treatment of the employed and the self-employed.Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said Hammond appeared to be breaking a Conservative manifesto commitment but lambasted the government for making such a ※silly§ pledge in the first place. Instead, both organisations focused on the bigger picture: the performance of the UK in the years since the onset of the recession since 2008 and what is likely to happen over the next 10 years.Johnson pointed out just how woeful the productivity performance of the UK economy had been since 2008. Growth in living standards depends on improvements in productivity, which in the years leading up to the financial crisis averaged more than 2% a year. In the nine years since 2008, Johnson noted, per capita incomes had grown by 2% in total. ※That＊s nine years to grow as much as it would normally grow in one.§What＊s more, the productivity growth that has been lost will never come back. That＊s because the believes the UK has run out of spare capacity, which means the economy cannot grow any faster without generating inflation.Johnson said: ※What the OBR is saying is that, despite that truly dismal record, all of the productivity 每 and with it earnings growth 每 we would normally expect has been lost forever. ※This remains the big story of the last decade: a decade without growth, a decade without precedent in the UK in modern times.§Unusually low inflation since 2014 has led to a pick-up in real income growth but rebounding oil prices and dearer imports as a result of the pound＊s post-Brexit fall mean this period is coming to an end. The IFS says that on current forecasts, real average earnings will be no higher in 2022 than they were in 2007. ※Fifteen years without a pay rise,§ Johnson said. ※I＊m rather lost for superlatives. This is completely unprecedented.§ Top earners have had a relatively tough time, with their real earnings 12% lower in 2015-16 than they were when the recession started. Johnson said the top 1% pulled away from the rest in the 2000s but were being reeled back in. The ratio between earnings at the 99th percentile and those at the median hit 5 to 1 in the late 2000s but had fallen back at 4.6 to 1 now, about where it was in 1999. Torsten Bell, the Resolution Foundation＊s director, says it is possible to find a decade that was as bleak for wage earners as the 2010s but you have to go back to a time when  was prime minister to find it.The Resolution Foundation concentrates on those on low and middle incomes 每 a group it sees as particularly vulnerable in the years ahead. Weak pay growth and benefit cuts mean that for the poorest third of households, the second half of the 2010s will actually be tougher than the first half.The IFS agrees. It notes that the budget changes announced by Hammond pale into insignificance when set against those introduced by George Osborne before he was sacked by Theresa May.The former chancellor 每 now picking up  at the fund manager BlackRock 每 pushed through benefit cuts that will mean some families will be ?7,000 a year worse off than they would have been otherwise.

"he stocks were sold; the Press was squared/ The Middle Class was quite prepared.§ What Hilaire Belloc wrote of Lord Lundy applies double to Janet Yellen. With excellent reason. With the crybaby aristo, ; Ms Yellen, on the other hand, is doing something far more important. The head of the US central bank is busy preparing America, its new president, and indeed the world, for rising interest rates 每 and for a new economic era. The story of US interest rates this decade is simple to the point of tedium. The key fed funds rate has been dragging along . In December 2015, it was nudged up by a quarter of a percentage point by Ms Yellen and her colleagues at the Federal Reserve. A whole year later, they nudged it up again, which means that seven years after the notional end of the US recession it stands at mere 0.75%.That is set to change. Over the past few weeks, rate setters at the Fed have dropped broader and broader hints that  每 and will keep going up. Last Friday was the turn of Ms Yellen. Speaking in Chicago, she said: ※We currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if the economic data continue to come in about as we expect.§ That is about as straightforward as you get in central-bank speak. Nor is that likely to be the end of the rises: according to the Fed＊s charts, committee members now forecast , and more in 2018. There are geopolitical reasons to hold off making too early a move. Next month, France＊s presidential election, in which rightwing, anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen is leading the polls, kicks off. Last year, the Fed held off in June before the Brexit vote.While the timing is still moot, there are few betting that rates won＊t rise. Considering this, three observations can be made. First, even while all this briefing has been going on, US asset markets have remained remarkably buoyant. That is very different from the nerves exhibited by investors in US Treasury bonds in 2013, when Ms Yellen＊s predecessor,  marked ※easy money§. Even with a much more volatile figure in the White House, financial markets seem far more confident on the prospects for the US.Second, by raising rates now the Fed is giving itself vital room for manoeuvre ahead of the next downturn. The old rule of thumb is that  每 which would mean, going by the National Bureau of Economic Research, that the next bust is not far away. The Fed is in a far better position than the Bank of England, whose benchmark rate is at 0.25%. Mark Carney and the Bank have been obliged to keep rates so low in order to stimulate the economy while the government cuts spending year after year. Far from an accident, this is official policy, summed up by former chancellor George Osborne as ※tight fiscal policy and loose monetary policy§.There＊s a lot wrong with this state of affairs.?It puts an unelected official, Mr Carney, in charge of the UK＊s medium-term growth strategy and leads to a highly regressive system where the rich see their house and other assets soar in price. And, in the event of a plunge or crash or Brexit-related turbulence, it leaves the  with nowhere to go.Finally, a world economy in which the US is pushing up rates while the UK is keeping its rates at rock bottom means one thing: the pound remaining low and import prices going up. Global investors want to stow their cash where they can get higher returns. For the foreseeable future, that will mean dollar-denominated assets over those priced in sterling. Which ultimately means that those in Britain who are ※just about managing§ will struggle to manage. Whatever their rhetorical concern for the Jams,  and Philip?Hammond are following an economic policy that does nothing to help them."															
"Workers in Britain are on course to suffer an unprecedented 15 years of lost earnings growth and have been warned to prepare for a third successive parliament of austerity by a leading thinktank.Analysing Philip Hammond＊s spring budget, the  (IFS) said that after suffering a lost decade of earnings growth, households were now about to be hit by big welfare cuts.Paul Johnson, the thinktank＊s director, highlighted permanent scars to the UK economy from the global financial crisis and said that almost a decade on the prospects for income and earnings growth remained weak.※On current forecasts average earnings will be no higher in 2022 than they were in 2007. Fifteen years without a pay rise. I＊m rather lost for superlatives. This is completely unprecedented,§ he said at the IFS＊s traditional post-budget day briefing.Johnson said the latest economic outlook from the government＊s independent forecaster, the , implied that in the wake of the financial crisis the UK had suffered permanent losses to productivity 每 a measure of output per hour.※All of the productivity 每 and with it earnings growth 每 we would normally expect has been lost forever. This remains the big story of the last decade 每 a decade without growth, a decade without precedent in the UK in modern times,§ he said.The IFS noted the OBR＊s forecasts for the public finances left the UK on course to borrow ?20bn in 2020, which is ?30bn more than intended a year ago.※That leaves a lot of work to do in the next parliament to get to the planned budget balance. It looks like being, I＊m afraid, a third parliament of austerity,§ said Johnson.Similarly, he underscored welfare cuts announced under Hammond＊s predecessor George Osborne that start to come into force next month. ※These will have much bigger effects on people＊s incomes than anything announced [on Wednesday].§The IFS had a relatively positive appraisal of the controversial changes made by Hammond to taxes paid by the self-employed. Johnson said  represented a ※modest but welcome change§ designed to create a slightly less unequal playing field between the self-employed and employees.§The IFS warning on incomes follows the claim earlier on Thursday by the Resolution Foundation that the UK is in the midst of the worst decade for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars of 1803每1815.In , the thinktank said families would miss out on ?12,000 of pay growth by 2020, the worst decade for 210 years.Workers will be hit with falling real pay, , in the coming months, Resolution said. Real average earnings are only expected to return to their pre-crisis peak by the end of 2022.Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, said: ※The big picture from [Wednesday＊s] budget is that the big squeezes on both the public and family finances have been prolonged well into the 2020s.※While the  at least delivered some good news on borrowing, the family finances picture has actually deteriorated since the autumn statement. Britain is set for a return to falling real pay later this year, with this decade now set to be the worst for pay growth since the Napoleonic wars.Bell said that some households would feel the pinch more than others. ※The combination of weak pay growth and over ?12bn of benefit cuts means that for the poorest third of households this parliament is actually set to be worse than the years following .§Resolution calculates that a single person working full time on the minimum wage 每 earning ?13,150 每 will be ?380 worse off by 2020. A dual-earning couple with two children and combined earnings of ?29,020 will be ?360 a year worse off by 2020.Anita Charlesworth, director of economics at The Health Foundation, said the chancellor had rebuffed calls for more health spending, but resources in the NHS were thin.※The next parliament will need to find an extra 1% of GDP in austerity measures and 1% extra for the NHS. I don＊t know how we do that within the existing tax base,§ she said. The amount of tax Britons pay as a percentage of GDP is due to hit a 30-year high in 2019 of 37.5%.Tony Travers, a local government expert at the London School of , said councils were shouldering the burden of austerity and would soon be confined to providing only statutory services such as adult and children＊s social care.※There is a straight line of falls in discretionary spending that ends in the next parliament at zero, leaving no money for anything other than the legal minimum,§ he said."															
															
"Warnings that Britain is heading for a sharp increase in inflation have intensified after a key business survey showed companies in the services sector are grappling with their biggest rise in costs for almost six years.The report into the UK economy＊s biggest sector, which spans banks to hotels and hairdressers, showed firms suffered their first slowdown for four months in January. This suggests the economy lost momentum at the start of 2017.Companies reported higher fuel and labour costs and said they had to pay more for imports because of the pound＊s sharp fall since the referendum. There were also further signs that companies were passing on some of that cost burden to customers in higher prices. That will add to concerns that  and will hit consumer spending, a key driver of the UK economy.Living costs have started to rise at a faster pace in recent months on the back of rising energy prices and the pound＊s weakness.  hit its highest level for more than two years in December at 1.6%, and some forecasters see it going above 3% this year.Food companies have blamed higher costs for imported ingredients as they raise prices in the shops on goods such as ,  and . Prices at the pump have also risen and clothing prices are also expected to increase. High street retailer Next has warned the devaluation of the pound  by up to 5% in the coming months.In the latest sign living costs are rising, Npower said on Friday it was , pushing up dual fuel bills rise by an average of 9.8% or ?109 a year.Despite costs pressures, services firms polled in the latest  (pdf) indicated that they remained optimistic about the year ahead and they continued hiring workers, albeit at a slower pace.The headline index on the report dipped to 54.5 in January from 56.5 the month before. January marks the first time the main activity reading has declined for four months and it was below forecasts for 55.8 in a Reuters poll of economists.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the survey＊s compilers, IHS Markit, said the January slowdown followed a . The services report and  and construction still indicated a ※buoyant start§ to 2017 for the UK economy, he added.※The PMI surveys are collectively signalling that GDP will increase by a robust 0.5% in the first quarter, if current growth is sustained in coming months,§ said Williamson. That would compare with an official estimate that .The report follows the Bank of England＊s move on Thursday to , to 2% from the 1.4% it had predicted in November. The Bank also surprised financial markets by edging down its forecast for inflation.The PMI report, which covers firms making up about 50% of the economy, suggested that companies＊ costs were rising at the fastest rate since March 2011 with pressure from more expensive imports, higher fuel and freight prices and bigger wage bills.※Supply chain managers reported that cost burdens were weighing down more heavily and impacting on their business for the seventh time in eight months,§ said David Noble, group chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which co-publishes the report.※The triple whammy of rising fuel costs, salaries and higher import prices were keenly felt, and these rising costs may have also had an effect on the number of new jobs on offer, reflected in the rate of job creation which was at a five-month low.§Strong pressure on costs led firms to increase their charges in January, at a pace unchanged from December＊s 68-month record, the PMI report said.※Inflationary pressures are becoming increasingly concerning,§ said Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the forecasters EY Item Club, commenting on the poll. ※It looks increasingly likely that we will not escape a steep pickup in consumer price inflation through 2017.§The PMI report polls private sector companies but does not cover retailers or government services. It therefore covers about half the economy, whereas official data on services published with more of a lag covers almost 80%."															
"Mexico＊s president, , has rejected any suggestions of his country paying for a border wall and pledged to sign an updated free-trade agreement with the European Union as he seeks to diversify the economy away from the United States.Speaking in uncharacteristically stern and straightforward language, Pe?a Nieto told an audience of Mexican diplomats: ※All matters that define our bilateral relationship are on the table including security, immigration and commerce.§But he said any negotiations must include touchy topics for Americans, including putting an end to the flow of illegal guns across the border and arming deadly drug cartels.※It is evident that we have differences with the new United States government on some issues, such as a wall that  absolutely will not pay for,§ Pe?a Nieto said. ※At no time will we accept anything that goes against our dignity as a country and our dignity as Mexicans.※Basic principles such as sovereignty, the national interest and the protection of our citizens are non-negotiable.§Pe?a Nieto＊s pronouncement contradicts the insistence of the US president-elect, , that Mexico will cover the costs of fencing off its frontier with the United States.※I want to get started.

Trump＊s tweets and promises to impose penalties on Mexican exports have hammered the peso. Mexico＊s currency reached a record low during his press conference, dipping below 22 per US dollar.Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state nominee, sounded more subdued than Trump on the Mexico topic .※I would never characterise an entire population of people with any single term,§ he said when asked about Trump＊s maligning of Mexicans as ※rapists§ and robbers.※Mexico is a longstanding neighbour and friend of this country,§ Tillerson said. ※We＊re going to engage with Mexico because of their importance to us in this hemisphere and we have many, many common issues, common areas of concern.§Pe?a Nieto listed Mexico＊s concerns in any negotiations with Trump: stopping illegal weapons from entering the country; helping Mexico deal with the waves of migrants from around the world trying to transit Mexican territory ※in their desire to reach the United States§; and maintaining the flow of remittances 每 more than $20bn in 2016 每 sent by Mexicans to their families back home.The president also promised to seek out new markets for Mexican exports 每 starting with an updated European Union trade deal, which he expected to be signed within 12 months 每 as Trump threatens to rip up Nafta and slap a 35% tariff on Mexican-made goods.An Ipsos  found 57% of Mexicans said they would sooner abandon Nafta than give in to Trump＊s demands.

"ood news for Europe,§ . If I tell you it was from an investment bank that backed eurozone austerity to the hilt, you might guess what the good news is. Yes, Fran?ois Fillon (the French Thatcher) stands poised for a runoff with Marine Le Pen (the French Mussolini) in next year＊s presidential election.What could be better news for the investment banking community than having all non-fascist voters, left, right and centre, obligated to vote for a politician who wants to slash the welfare state, sack workers and extend the working day?Berenberg, the German private bank that issued the note, could not wait to celebrate Fillon＊s success in the primary. ※With luck,§ its chief economist, Holger Schmieding, assured clients, ※2017 could be more of an opportunity ＃ than a risk.§ The ※opportunity§ is for a Fillon government, with no credible socialist opposition, to enact ※pro-growth§ measures 每 attacking wages, hours and welfare, and enriching the people who hold 40bn in the private bank. It is symptomatic of the huge political miscalculation that the European political elite is making.The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told an Austrian newspaper on Sunday that there would be no letup on federalising Europe; no national opt-outs from the stagnation economics administered from Brussels.Next Sunday, we get to see whether European centrism＊s ※double-or-quits§ strategy will pay off. In , where far-right populist Norbert Hofer is neck and neck with a Green candidate in the re-run of the election for the ceremonial presidency role, the left and centre are frantically trying to mobilise party-loyal working-class voters. They may fail.In Italy, on the same day, the centre-left government  a referendum designed to strengthen the power of the executive over parliament. If the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, steps down and the markets crash, and Europe imposes a bank rescue plan that raids ordinary people＊s savings, then you could get both a domestic banking and a eurozone crisis by Christmas.To complete the pattern of wilful idiocy the  每 on pain, again, of the enforced collapse of its banking system. Oblivious to the neo-Nazi assaults on migrant camps in the Greek islands, the IMF in Washington 每 like the commission and the ECB 每 can only see rules and balance sheets.It feels, in short, as if the European centrist elite has developed a death wish. And once you understand European culture this morbid possibility is not so far-fetched.In his 1912 novel Death in Venice, Thomas Mann portrays the death-wish of cosmopolitan European culture through the love-obsession of a sick old man. The protagonist, Aschenbach, checks himself into a cosmopolitan hotel in plague-ridden Venice, to fulfil his wish to die. Writing two years before European cosmopolitanism did indeed die, Mann was already on top of the reasons why it might.In the novel, city authorities deny the existence of the plague 每 and, in so doing, create the conditions for its spread. Often read simply as a parable about love and loss, the novel in fact deals explicitly with the self-destructiveness of what Mann called the ※European soul§. Mann＊s settings in this and other novels 每 the Lido hotel, the Swiss sanatorium 每 emphasise the fragility of a transnational culture once crisis breaks out.For Mann, the carefully crafted polycultural world of the hotel lobby 每 where the Poles speak French, the Italians dress in Parisian fashion, and the band plays selections from Hungarian operetta 每 is a fragile illusion. When just one piece of it falls apart, everything does.Today our polyculturality is not so fragile as in the belle epoque. The Schengen freedoms are, for white people at least, real. The Erasmus programme, the EU＊s student-exchange project, cross-pollinated the lives of more than three million students. Alongside the staid and worthy ※city of culture§ programme, Europe＊s young people have been creating the real thing: in the Berlin arts scene, in massive music festivals such as Benic角ssim in Spain, in the wild nightlife of contemporary Belgrade.But even this grassroots culture of globalisation is breakable, if you try hard enough 每 because it can only exist in a space sealed off from official politics. At the typical European bar, beach or coffee shop, tolerance exists because educated people leave their nationality and religion at the door. The assumption among the young 每 implicit but strong 每 is that all politics is bullshit and does not matter.Now politics and nationality have begun hammering on the door. And initially they have produced mainly paralysis and fear.When I asked the young people I met in Ferrara, in northern , in September how they would respond to the new xenophobic wave, many spoke about ※§ 每 a back-to-the-land movement that advocates disconnection with the official economy as a survival strategy against austerity.※It＊s over, it＊s impossible, the right has won,§ are responses you will hear everywhere among the young, once you stop speaking to activists and listen to small-town kids wasting away their 20s in their grandmother＊s spare room.So Fillon v Le Pen is not ※good news for Europe§. Neither is Juncker＊s promise to double down on all the mistakes that led us here; nor the IMF＊s insistence that Greece should destroy its democracy some more; nor Renzi＊s decision to play shit or bust with the Italian banking system.This is no longer a confident, transnational elite, revelling in Samuel Huntingdon＊s famous description of national governments as ※residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite＊s global operations§. And they are now up against a far-right international movement 每 Trump, Farage, the Breitbart media folks 每 whose coherence waxes as the globalists＊ coherence wanes.We can stop this. But only if we reject the incessant demand for austerity, privatisation, longer hours, lower wages and the theft of a young generation＊s future. That＊s why the centre-left, in the short time available, must find the French people somebody better than Fillon."															
"A bailout of struggling Italian bank  should not be seen as a done deal, a key European Central Bank policymaker has said.Jens Weidmann, president of Germany＊s Bundesbank, said the Italian government ought to consider whether it should rescue the bank if it is in a bad financial state.※For the measures planned by the Italian government the bank has to be financially healthy at its core,§ he said in an article published German newspaper Bild.※The money cannot be used to cover losses that are already expected. All this must be carefully examined,§ added Weidmann, a member of the ECB＊s governing council.The ECB has taken a tough line with Italy＊s third-largest bank, . The Italian government  last Friday after the Siena-based bank, which can trace its roots back to 1472, failed to convince investors to fund a 5bn (?4.25bn) cash injection.It plans to dip into a 20bn fund approved by the government earlier this month for the purpose of propping the bank up if no rescue plan could be secured elsewhere. The  was spurred by Monte dei Paschi＊s poor results in ECB ※stress tests§, a system set up by the European Union after the financial crisis to measure banks＊ resilience to unexpected economic shocks.Stress tests are intended to ensure that taxpayers are not asked to pick up the tab for multi-billion pound bailouts, such as those that the British government orchestrated to save Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. Fears about the strength of Monte dei Paschi began to mount after it came last out of 51 European banks in the ECB＊s latest round of tests in July. The bank was told to shore up its finances by the end of the year or face being wound down.※These (rules) are meant especially to protect taxpayers and put responsibility on investors. State funds are only intended as a last resort, and that is why the bar is set high,§ Weidmann told Bild.Monte dei Paschi＊s problems have piled up since the 2008 banking crisis, when it paid 9bn (?7.6bn) for Banca Antonveneta. The deal doubled its size and turned it into Italy＊s third largest bank behind UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo. It bought Banca Atonveneta from a deal that was a key factor in the taxpayer bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland.Three years ago Monte dei Paschi＊s problems escalated. The Sienese bank  amid a scandal over loss-making derivatives contracts and alleged fraud.

"Government proposals to deal with the?care funding crisis in the local government finance settlement by allowing a small increase in council tax will not be nearly enough to plug the gap, and we are very clear that full reform of funding is needed (, 16 December).The 2% increase in council tax this year brought in about ?360m nationally, and still leaves a predicted gap of ?2.2bn by 2020. This would suggest that council tax would need to increase by about 14% to deal with this problem, ignoring any other inflationary problems faced by any provider of services.If council tax was a fair tax then this might be acceptable, but council tax is an inherently unfair tax. People who own a small terrace house in Liverpool?already pay as much as the owner of a mansion flat in Westminster because of the way that the system works. Poor people pay a much higher proportion of their income in council tax than rich people.In some parts of the country the needs of the extremely poor will be paid?by the relatively poor if council tax is the only route for dealing with this problem. This is why the  support a root and branch review of the entire funding programme for health and social care.We need a national debate about these issues if we are to stop such panicked measures like the one the government took in the finance settlement."															
"In the week of Groundhog Day it seemed entirely appropriate: Greek farmers, many on tractors, have once again been blockading roads and border posts amid mounting signs that the country long at the centre of Europe＊s debt woes is 每 once again 每 teetering towards crisis.Protesting farmers have been a regular feature of the social unrest that has sporadically gripped . It is now more than seven years since the Greek financial crisis erupted and the debt drama has often had a deja vu quality about it.Eclipsed last year by the UK＊s vote to exit the EU, and Donald Trump＊s equally unlikely US electoral victory, the nation＊s epic struggle to keep bankruptcy at bay has been out of the spotlight.But away from the headlines, .Bailout negotiations between Athens and its creditors have stalled. The possibility of Grexit, or euro exit, has re-emerged and bond yields have soared. The yield on two-year Greek government bonds has risen from 6% to 10% in less than two weeks as spooked investors have dumped their holdings. And the shrill rhetoric last seen at the height of the crisis in 2015 has returned.Analysts sensing dangerous deadlock are sounding the alarm 每 an alarm that the embattled prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was expected to raise in talks with the German chancellor and other European leaders in Malta on Friday.※I am very worried we are heading towards a rupture with the EU,§ said Pantelis Kapsis, a prominent political commentator. ※There are lots of signs that at the back of their minds people in Syriza [the ruling leftist party] are entertaining various ideas of going it alone. What is sure is that we are entering a very difficult period which quite possibly could lead us to a point of no return.§As always, time is of the essence. Shored up by a third EU-led bailout, Athens was told this week that further rescue funds would not be forthcoming until it concluded a compliance review of terms attached to the 86bn (?74bn) aid package. In July Greece faces debt repayments of 7.4bn, raising the spectre of default because state coffers by then will have run dry.The impasse has turned into a standoff as creditors demand additional austerity once the current bailout expires. Without further reduction of pensions 每 already cut 12 times since the crisis began 每 and the tax-free threshold of personal incomes, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) argues, the debt-stricken country will never be able to achieve its agreed fiscal goal of a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP from 2018. In a fiery parliamentary debate late on Wednesday, Tsipras dug in, insisting his two-party coalition 每 in power with a wafer-thin majority of two 每 would not cave in to demands that his government has repeatedly called absurd. ※The IMF＊s demands go beyond any democratic and constitutional logic and value,§ he railed.Completion of the review is essential to Greece, exiled from international capital markets, being included in the European Central Bank＊s 9 March bond-buying programme, key to the country regaining market access. If the deadline is missed few believe Athens will be able to keep itself afloat without a fourth bailout once the latest loans end. And in a  preoccupied with other matters 每 and in fear of an anti-establishment ascendant far right 每 the prospect of that happening is slim. ※What we are witnessing is a disaster for the real economy because everything is on hold,§ said Costas Panagopoulos who heads the Alco polling institute. ※Once again we are talking about economic catastrophe, once again we are talking about Grexit,§ he told the Guardian. ※The next few weeks are critical. If an agreement isn＊t reached, if there is more uncertainty, we don＊t know how Greeks will react.§On Thursday, amid widespread rumours of his own resignation, the finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos attempted to deflect the spiralling tensions. In a written statement the Marxist economics professor said that while a third of the bailout review had been ※totally completed§ and a third ※totally agreed§, the rest remained subject to ※political negotiation§ 每 raising little hope of the talks concluding any time soon. But what happens next is dependent not only on what happens in Athens. To a great degree events in Europe and Washington will also play a role. Ahead of Germany＊s general election in September, Berlin＊s finance minister Wolfgang Sch?uble has also raised the stakes with growing criticism of Greece 每 a tactic that has proved popular with voters who might otherwise support Germany＊s far-right AfD party. Earlier this week Bild, the mass-selling newspaper, stoked passions further by suggesting the German government was warming to the idea of Greece leaving the euro 每 a notion Sch?uble has openly supported in the past.※Grexit is not our agenda, it is the agenda of those who want the breakup of Europe,§ said Sia Anagnostopoulou, a leading Syriza MP and former alternate European affairs minister. ※It is what Mr Sch?uble wants,§ she added, echoing the commonly held view that Athens is hostage to .Complicating matters further is the direction the IMF will take now that President Trump is in power. In his former role as a billionaire businessman, Trump  that the Greeks were ※wasting time§ in the eurozone. Last week, the IMF delivered its gloomiest assessment yet of Greece＊s debt burden, arguing that it was not only unsustainable but eventually likely to become ※explosive§. The IMF＊s board will formally discuss the issue on 6 February but has already hinted that without a commitment of debt relief from the EU it will be unable to contribute further loans. Germany, the biggest contributor to the nearly 300bn of emergency funds assigned to Greece, insists further aid depends exclusively on IMF participation.Analysts are undecided whether the government is deliberately stalling in the hope of getting a better deal as repayment season approaches and fears of a disorderly default mount, or whether it is playing with fire. Syriza, like every governing party before it, has been hollowed out by the eviscerating effects of having to apply policies that it came to power vowing to oppose. On Tuesday its parliamentary spokesman took Greeks by storm proposing that Grexit be discussed ※without taboo§ in the 300-member house. The once unassailable popularity of Tsipras, meanwhile, has been pummelled by the implementation of some of the harshest measures to date and few believe he has the political capital to enforce another round of austerity. ※It is not a can but a bomb being kicked down the road,§ said one western diplomat. ※In a world where liberal values are under threat we could be looking at a very dangerous scenario where the cradle of democracy also collapses.§ Bereft of growth and battered by cuts and tax increases, Greeks have become poorer and ever more cognizant of their own insolvency in a state where sovereignty exists in little more than name. One in three now live below the poverty line and unemployment hovers around 23%. The latest impasse has not only seen emigration levels rise and non-repayment of household and business loans soar but also nostalgia for the drachma grow. That is what worries Panagopoulos, the pollster, most. What was once a minority view is changing fast, with the majority of Greeks in a recent Alco survey saying it was wrong to have joined the euro. ※We have become a society that has no hope, not even a slice or piece of hope for the future,§ he sighed. ※The only reason people want to stay in the euro is because they fear the consequences if we were to leave, but if things don＊t get better that will change too.§"															
"When the East Wind train rumbles into east  this week, it will be full of socks, bags and wallets for London＊s tourist souvenir shops, as well as the dust and grime accumulated through eight countries and 7,456 miles.The train 每 made up of 34 wagons 每 will be the first to make the 16-day journey from Yiwu in east  to Britain, reviving the ancient trading Silk Road route and shunting in a new era of UK-China relations.Due to arrive on Wednesday, the train will have passed through China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Belgium and France before crossing under the Channel and arriving in the east end of London at Barking rail freight terminal.Faster than a ship, cheaper than a plane, the East Wind won＊t be quite the same train that left Yiwu on 2 January. Differing rail gauges in countries along the route mean a single locomotive and set of wagons cannot travel the whole route. But the journey still marks a new departure in the 21st-century global economy. The new train, which will start to run weekly while demand is tested, is part of China＊s One Belt, One Road policy 每 designed to open up the old Silk Road routes and bring new trade opportunities, said Prof Magnus Marsden, an anthropologist at Sussex University＊s School of Global Studies, who has been studying the trading patterns in Yiwu. China Railway has already begun rail services to 14 European cities, including Madrid and Hamburg. As a result, Yiwu＊s markets are now loaded with hams, cheese and wine from Spain and German beer is available on every corner.※It＊s a new economic geography,§ he said. ※This is the first train to the UK, but very much part of a new type of commercial route. The commodities are small. It＊s not the big corporates who will be using this train, so it＊s very much in the tradition of the Silk Road, giving opportunities for those who are in fact the inheritors of those ancient traders today.§ Yiwu is a gigantic bazaar, he said, where traders from all over the world congregate. The goods brought to Britain by the East Wind are not as exotic as the peacocks and gemstones that were once transported along the Silk Road, which ran through Europe and Eurasia＊s historical dynasties and empires. The trading route, thought to have been established in around 200BC, brought the west textiles, exotic foods, paper making 每 and probably the Black Death.Everything from chairs to illicit drugs were sent back the other way. On one occasion China threatened Queen Victoria that it would stop exporting her favourite rhubarb to England if she didn＊t do something about the British opium trade. ※Yiwu made its name internationally as a city in which traders could buy affordable commodities in bulk,§ said Marsden. ※The city＊s early trade was mostly with markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America and eastern Europe. From the sprawling container markets of the former Soviet Union to the bazaars of the Middle East, commodities purchased in Yiwu have both made and unmade people＊s lives. These products have contributed to the demise of local industries, yet have also had a hand in the resurrection of great trading cities that had fallen into decline, the Black Sea port of Odessa in Ukraine, or Sulaymaniyah in Iraq being such examples.§Today Yiwu＊s streets are among the most cosmopolitan in the world, full of traders from Colombia, Afghanistan, Kurdistan, Pakistan, India, Syria, Angola and Ukraine, and could now be attracting a few from the UK as well.In Barking there is great excitement over the arrival of the East Wind, the name of which references the Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong, who famously said: ※The east wind will prevail over the west wind.§※The new service has a very quick transit time,§ operations director, Mike White, told the . ※We believe this is going to change the way a lot of forwarders and shippers view their imports and exports for China.§"

"Families face a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake of the financial crisis, as Brexit slows the economy and Conservative welfare cuts bite, according to a new report.Analysis of  by the Resolution Foundation thinktank suggests average earnings are set to grow only half as rapidly as in the austerity years after the economic crisis. At the same time, living standards will be undermined by higher inflation and ongoing welfare cuts.While the squeeze of the last parliament affected workers across the income spectrum, the foundation says low-paid households are set to be hardest hit over the next five years, because they are particularly affected by planned welfare cuts.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced a modest softening of cuts to universal credit in the autumn statement, but a ?3bn cut in the ※work allowance§ claimants can earn before their benefits are withdrawn will go ahead.His predecessor George Osborne also previously announced a four-year cash freeze in most in-work benefits, which will go ahead.The foundation＊s director, Torsten Bell, said: ※The combination of lower growth, higher inflation and the government＊s decision to press ahead with big welfare cuts means that households risk experiencing even slower income growth in this parliament than they saw in the aftermath of the financial crisis. ※But unlike the last parliament, it will be low- and middle-income households who feel the tightest squeeze this time round.§The researchers said the entire bottom third of the income distribution would see their real incomes fall in the years ahead. The foundation cites forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which predicted a challenging fiscal climate in the face of Brexit and wider international economic uncertainty. The increase in borrowing set out in the autumn statement is so severe that national debt as a percentage of GDP is expected to be higher at the end of the parliament than the beginning, the research found. Osborne had targeted a surplus of ?11bn on the public finances by 2020-21, now forecast to be a ?21bn deficit, with public debt peaking at more than 90% of GDP.Though Hammond announced some modest borrowing to invest in projects including infrastructure and housing, the foundation＊s research said that cash would be ※wiped out several times over by an expected fall in private sector investment§.In total, the OBR said it expected the chancellor to have to borrow an extra ?122bn over the next five years.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Hammond＊s decision to press ahead with cutting corporation tax to 17%, despite the outlook for lower-income families, showed the wrong people were being hit by the uncertainty. ※We would make sure that instead of giving tax giveaways to the wealthy and corporations, and ignoring the issue of tax avoidance and tax evasion, we would make sure we had a fair taxation system,§ he told BBC Radio 4＊s Today programme. ※We＊re not talking about increasing taxes; we are saying we want to use our resources more effectively.※They have given tax giveaways on capital gains tax, corporation tax, inheritance tax to the wealthy in our community and corporation, cutting universal credit to people [who are] just about managing ＃ people going into work, looking after their families, doing everything they ask for, so they have got the wrong priorities.§"															
"The  is not much cop at forecasting what will happen to the economy. It proved as much before, during and after the financial crisis of 2008-09. But even by its own standards, it has got the post-referendum economy badly wrong.Three months ago when it announced a  after the shock decision to leave the European Union, Threadneedle Street said it expected growth of just 0.1% in the third quarter of 2016 followed by no growth at all in the fourth quarter. If the Bank had been right, the UK would have been a whisker away from a technical recession in the second half of the year.Official figures from the Office for National Statistics show that  between July and September, and the Bank now believes it will grow by a further 0.4% in the fourth quarter. Forward-looking business surveys support this assessment.In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank admits it has been taken aback by the resilience of consumer spending and by the strength of the housing market. That, together with a , has been enough for its nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) to ditch plans for a fresh cut in interest rates before the end of the year.With a warning there are limits to the extent to which inflation at above the government＊s 2% target can be tolerated, the MPC has handed over responsibility for supporting the economy to Philip Hammond at the Treasury.  is expected to average 2.7% in both 2017 and 2018 每 higher than expected in August and the biggest overshoots since the Bank was made independent almost two decades ago.The Bank believes stronger growth than it envisaged in 2016 and 2017 will come at the expense of weaker growth later and that by the end of 2018 the economy will actually be slightly smaller than it predicted in August.Its critics 每 of whom there are a growing number 每 will say its inability to map the path of the economy since June means its forecasts for 2017, 2018 and beyond should be treated with a large pinch of salt. Some will say that growth of 0.5% and 0.4% in the two quarters following the Brexit vote means that the August measures 每 including a fresh cut in borrowing costs and additional money creation through the quantitative easing programme 每 were a mistake and that the stimulus will add to the inflationary pressure caused by the fall in the value of the pound.There is, though, a case for the defence. First, the Bank＊s August package has helped to support the economy. It helped to boost confidence and support activity.Second, the Bank＊s explanation for why growth can be expected to weaken during the course of 2017 and into 2018 without diving into recession looks reasonable enough. Both monetary and fiscal policy will underpin growth and the labour market has so far held up well.But although consumers are enjoying increases in their real incomes, living standards will be squeezed as a weaker pound . What＊s more, the uncertainty over the timing and the terms of Brexit means firms are unlikely to be in any hurry to sanction fresh investment for the next couple of years. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day and for the Bank this might be one of those times."															
"The ＊s monetary policy committee will announce its latest policy decision on interest rates at midday on Thursday. Back in August,  Interest rates were slashed to an all-time low of 0.25%; the Bank announced it would buy a further ?60bn of government bonds, expanding its quantitative easing (QE) programme to a total of ?435bn; and plans to buy ?10bn of corporate bonds were revealed.Much has happened since August for the MPC to take into account. , prompting a further sharp fall in the value of the pound. Official figures showed economic growth was stronger than the Bank expected in the months after the Brexit vote in June, with . Meanwhile, there are increasing signs that  as the impact of the weaker pound feeds through to higher import prices.As the next meeting nears, here is a reminder of what some members of the nine-member MPC have had to say since they last voted.The governor has given little away on the likely path of interest rates. Much of the focus in recent weeks has been on . on 22 September, he made only a broad reference to the low interest rate environment.However, he told  on 25 October that the MPC would be taking into account the weak pound when it meets this week: to prop up the UK economy following the referendum. Forbes voted for the rate cut at the MPC＊s August meeting but opposed the decision to expand QE and buy corporate bonds., she said: Dame Nemat Shafik appeared to take a different view to Forbes when she said  if the UK was to avoid a damaging slowdown following the Brexit vote. Giving  on 28 September, she said:The MPC＊s most recent appointee said last month .  on 5 October, he stressed that he had not yet made up his mind on how he would vote at the November meeting. However, given his comments and the better than expected growth rate for the third quarter, it seems unlikely that he would back another rate cut at this time.Broadbent said , but warned of an ※insidious§ threat to business investment.  on 5 October, he said:"															
"Domino＊s Pizza suffered a sharp slowdown in sales growth in early 2017 as rival  Hut cut prices and consumers reined in spending.David Wild, the Domino＊s chief executive, said Pizza Hut was ※very aggressive§ in January and that consumers were more cautious about spending.※Looking forward, the UK consumer environment is more difficult,§ he said. ※Our research tells us that customers are worried about rising prices.

"I＊ll pay more NI overall 每 probably about ?30 to ?35 per year I think. It＊s said it＊s to level the playing field with those in employment but I already lack sick pay, holiday pay, and employer pension contributions and my work can get cancelled at any point with no compensation.It＊s not a huge increase if the 60p-a-week figure is accurate and I don＊t begrudge paying my share to improve services. But I can＊t help feeling it＊s taken the easy target while avoiding the harder, real issue of self-employment. Using self-employed staff has been on the up in the past five years, meaning employers don＊t have to meet the obligations listed above which saves them huge amounts of money and associated administration. They also avoid paying the share of NI associated with the employer. The business saves all round while the employee gets hit again. It＊s a typical, quick and dirty policy to raise some funds and as usual it comes at the expense of the easy target 每 the individual 每 while letting the businesses that exploit these conditions get away with it. The past five years have been pretty tough keeping the work coming in as people have been hanging onto budgets due to economic uncertainty so any additional expense is unwelcome however small. As I say, I＊m happy to pay my share but not when the bigger fish are being let off the hook.I will end up paying more in national insurance, which could push my tax bill to the point where I will have to make payments on account against the following year＊s tax bill (this is a bizarre convention only self-assessment taxpayers are subject to) What Hammond forgets is that the self-employed have no paid holidays or paid sick leave, and rarely access statutory sick ay. Personally my biggest concern regarding changes to NI is regarding maternity/paternity benefit.With this and Making Tax Digital on the horizon, the chancellor and the current government are making self-employment and founding small and medium-sized enterprises a less attractive and accessible option every single year. Tax policies seem to be entirely in favour of very high earners and very large corporations which have the budgets and manpower to navigate the constantly changing legislation. I believe it is unfair, I won＊t have any serious issue personally but we have to consider that most ＆self employed＊ workers belong to the so-called ※precariat§. We take all the risk and we have a very frail safety net. I have had tremendous changes in my income over the years depended on the available projects (for example: 2013, ?13,000 gross; 2014, ?42,000; 2015, ?25,000; 2016, ?46,000). It is difficult to plan ahead or save money and we take risks. I don＊t think that self-employment is good for society, it just temporarily postpones the problem with pensions and social care by almost getting people out of the system. So if you support that kind of work as a government, the stance should be to give us sick leave and maternity leave paid by the state and an increase in taxation, but mostly by corporation tax or a financial transaction tax. Why on earth should I be happy to pay extra tax when Google pays so little?Increasing NICs for the self employed is grossly unfair. I have not been entitled to any unemployment benefit for over 25 years, because I manage my savings to be able to ride out the peaks and troughs of self-employment. I would only be entitled to benefits in a lean period if I depleted my savings, which would not be the case for an employee who loses her job. Paying the same NICs is therefore unfair. It is also unfair to have come up with this idea off the back of more people being self-employed. Although for someone like me self-employment is part of the career I have chosen 每 and I have no desire to be employed 每 lots of the newly self-employed are on zero-hours contracts. These people, who deserve proper employment and protection from businesses who squeeze ever more profit out of workers＊ misery, would rather be employed. Furthermore they may well have limited savings, so are likely to be needing to claim benefits due to the limited income they are able to earn. It is perhaps because of this that Hammond has seen this as a good reason to raise NICs: because a new raft of people will be needing benefits, so he figures they should pay for them.I have had to start working part time as a self-employed contractor due to the cost of living in this area, and the lack of suitable alternative jobs. I work 40 hours per week on PAYE, and about 12 as a self-employed contractor, while this does allow me a degree of flexibility, I have legal obligations to spend a certain number of hours with my customers which I have to fit in. If I don＊t do this extra work, I can barely afford to survive. This tax increase is going to sap the extra income I make, possibly making it not work the aggro, then what do I do? As far as I＊m concerned, May has broken all her promises of an economy that works for everyone, and her Brexit car crash is only going to make it worse. Right now I＊m hoping for interest rate hike from the Bank of England and a housing crash so I stand a chance. It＊s the only way this is going to work for me.I work as a locum radiographer both for the private sector and for the NHS. Last year the NHS quite rightly audited the cost of temporary workers and made significant reductions in the hourly rate offered. In itself, this move did not affect earnings to the point where it became uneconomical but it did restrict how far we could travel due to fuel and accommodation costs eating into gross pay. In addition to last year＊s changes, the budget has stated that self-employed people, working for government institutions, will be taxed as permanent employees as well as having to pay both employee and employer NIC. How we can be considered permanent is beyond me as it is not uncommon for me to work at two NHS hospitals and a private site in a single week. Traveling and subsistence allowances have been disallowed adding further costs, which means it is not economically viable to continue working as a locum. Many workers are now considering permanent positions which, on the face of it, is in the government＊s favour. I believe the move is short-sighted because it has demoralised temporary workers to the point where they are focusing on moving away from the NHS and 每 in some cases 每 away from the profession altogether. I believe the fallout from this will be staff shortages. Institutions and companies of any reasonable size are reliant on temporary workers to cover skills shortages, holidays, illness and pregnancy leave. The cynical among us might think that the government are deliberately sabotaging the NHS for its own ends."															
"Nearly 4 million people are employed in growing, harvesting, producing, packaging, selling and serving our food and drink.In light of the vote for Brexit, the importance of food and drink to our nation＊s economic and physical wellbeing should be recognised and its future secured. In recent years, Britain has enjoyed access to a wider range of safe, high-quality food and drink, at every price point, than ever before. At a time when household incomes are under increasing pressure, shop prices for food have been kept in check for more than three years and, if that is to continue, the government must ensure the place of food and drink both in our new industrial strategy and at the heart of the  negotiations.Workers from the EU, some of whom are already leaving the UK, play a significant role in delivering affordable and high-quality food and drink. The government should offer unambiguous reassurance to EU workers throughout our supply chain about their right to remain. For the longer term, it is important to recognise that these workers are highly flexible and provide an essential reservoir of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour.If we adopt a work-permit system to control immigration, then the whole of our supply chain must receive equal treatment with financial services or the automotive sectors. All options should be explored, including a workable points-based system for shortage occupations, sector-based and seasonal/guest worker schemes and effective transitionary arrangements. If they are not, the UK will face less food choice and higher food prices.                           "															
"The  has vowed to continue with its programme of electronic money printing to shore up the eurozone recovery but surprised financial markets by reducing the amount of stimulus it expects to provide each month.The single currency bloc＊s central bank  and said it would continue its programme of quantitative easing (QE) to next December or beyond ※if necessary§, marking an extension to its previous guidance that the scheme would run until the end of March.However, the value of the bonds bought by the ECB per month under the QE programme will drop to 60bn (?51bn) from April next year, from 80bn currently. The ECB＊s QE scheme involves creating electronic cash to buy sovereign and corporate debt to counter anaemic economic growth and low inflation. ECB president  insisted the central bank would remain ready to beef up its support for the eurozone economy as needed and rebuffed suggestions the plans for more modest bond-buying from next spring represented ※tapering§, a process by which QE is wound down.※There is no question about tapering. Tapering has not been discussed today,§ he told a news conference after the latest ECB policy meeting.Draghi has previously talked about doing ※§ to support the currency bloc and on Thursday sought to send a similarly reassuring message. He said the policy of low rates 每 the ECB＊s main interest rate is at zero 每 and QE was supporting demand in the eurozone and the economy was expected to continue growing at a ※moderate but firming§ pace. But if things took a turn for the worse, and inflation failed to pick up enough, the ECB could increase its bond-buying again and/or extend the scheme, he added.The ECB＊s own inflation outlook suggested such moves to increase bond-buying could well be warranted. It is forecasting inflation of just 1.3% next year, 1.5% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. When asked if that counted as meeting the ECB target of inflation below but close to 2%, Draghi said: ※Not really, so we have to persist.§The central bank is expecting only modest economic growth for the eurozone over coming years. It believes GDP growth this year will come in at 1.7%, will match that pace again in 2017 and then ease to 1.6% in 2018 and 2019.Jennifer McKeown, at the consultancy Capital , noted how the ECB＊s language reflected a climate of heightened political uncertainty.※Presumably, the Bank has been encouraged by signs that the economy is performing well in the face of political uncertainty at home and abroad. However, it clearly remains in cautious mode,§ she said.※In all, we see a significant chance that the ECB will have to increase the pace of its asset purchases again next year. And even if it does not, policy will be far more supportive than in the US, leading the euro to depreciate further.§Draghi flagged up that uncertain climate in his press conference, referring to upcoming elections in France, the Netherlands and Germany.※Just look at the election calendar for the year to come. That is by itself a source of uncertainty. Look at the rest of the world. Look at what is happening with the emerging market economies,§ he told reporters.He also echoed other central bankers, , as he repeated calls for governments to play a bigger role in driving economic recovery with moves such as improvements to infrastructure and productivity.Many investors had been hoping for an extension of QE at the same pace, rather than the reduction announced by the ECB and there were sharp moves on financial markets as traders struggled to make sense of the central bank＊s stance.The euro initially jumped and then fell back. Yields on government bonds, which move inversely to prices, climbed as traders reacted to the prospect of lower ECB demand from April. Stock markets rallied as bank shares in particular benefited from hopes that a period of ultra-low interest rates might be finally nearing an end.The ECB also used its latest meeting to relax the rules over which bonds it can purchase under QE, reflecting worries that after years of QE it could run out of assets to buy.The changes to the QE programme follow  that loose monetary policy in the eurozone was hurting savers and fuelling rightwing nationalism.

On Thursday, he reiterated that the ECB was not biased towards the currency bloc＊s less prosperous southern states. While Draghi was at pains to reject suggestions the ECB was tapering, many market commentators said the central bank was in fact doing just that.※This is effectively tapering,§ said Marilyn Watson, bond market strategist at asset manager BlackRock.※The ECB＊s announcement, in our view, continues a trend among major central banks of moving away from ever-looser monetary policy stances.§ Others highlighted the ECB＊s apparent attempts to keep all camps happy.※The announcement had something for just about everyone. Those looking for a tapering would welcome the forthcoming drop in the monthly purchase amount,§ said Grant Lewis and Mantas Vanagas, at Daiwa Capital Markets.※But others will welcome the fact that the total additional amount of purchases is larger than if the ECB had simply announced a six-month extension of its current purchase pace.§ "															
"n the months leading up to the EU referendum in June, George Osborne had two people he could always rely on to back the argument that Brexit would have immediate, dire consequences for the UK economy. One was , the managing director of the International Monetary Fund. The other was , the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.Osborne＊s belief that voters would be swayed by fears of recession meant Lagarde and Gurr赤a popped up regularly during the campaign. In the event, the plan did not work. Those who voted to leave the EU appeared sceptical about the forecasts produced by the IMF and the  每 and those from the Treasury and the Bank of England, for that matter.That scepticism has looked increasingly justified in the months since the referendum. The first prediction to go awry was that the economy would plunge into instant recession. It didn＊t.When the economy showed signs of resilience, there was a second prediction: the unexpected strength was driven by consumer spending and a different picture would be painted when figures for investment came in. were published last week. It was up in the third quarter.There has been another retreat to a new fallback position. Yes, the IMF and the OECD admit, we were taken by surprise by the strength of the economy in the months after the  vote and we have been forced to revise up our growth forecasts for 2016. But, take it from us, the outlook for the UK is still grim. The downturn is coming 每 it is simply a matter of time.As such, the  from 2% this year to 1.2% in 2017 and 1% in 2018 每 a markedly gloomier forecast than that produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility for last week＊s autumn statement (1.4% and 1.7% respectively for the same time periods).Despite the recent announcements from Google, Facebook, Apple, Jaguar Land Rover and Tata, the OECD is particularly concerned about the outlook for foreign direct investment into the UK.Who knows, the Paris-based thinktank could be right. The Brexit divorce negotiations have yet to begin, after all. For the time being, however, the OECD should not be surprised if it is the target for the old joke: there are three sorts of economists 每 the ones who can count and the ones who can＊t."															
"or those of us who  about the US presidential election, it is worth suppressing emotional reactions, at least for a month or two, and attempting a dispassionate judgment about what Donald Trump＊s administration may mean for the world. So here are 10 likely consequences of the Trump presidency, divided equally between the good and the bad.The good news starts with US growth, which will almost surely accelerate above the 2.2% average annual rate during Barack Obama＊s second term. This is because the Republican aversion to public spending and debt applies only when a Democrat like Obama occupies the White House. With a Republican president, the party has always been glad to boost public spending and relax debt limits, as it was under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W Bush. Thus, Trump will be able to implement the Keynesian fiscal stimulus that Obama often proposed but was unable to deliver.The resulting deficits may be described as ※supply-side economics§, rather than Keynesian stimulus, but the effect will be the same: growth and inflation will both increase. As the  runs into the limits of full employment, additional growth will push inflation higher, but that bad news can wait until 2018 and beyond.Second, sensible tax reforms, such as an amnesty for multinational companies that repatriate foreign profits, will finally become law. The Republicans＊ hegemony will enable easy agreement on tax cuts financed mainly by higher public borrowing, rather than by facing down special interest lobbies＊ resistance to the elimination of exemptions and loopholes. These tax reforms will create even bigger budget deficits, which in turn will stimulate more growth and inflation.A third boost to economic growth will come from deregulation. While battles over energy and environmental laws may dominate the headlines, the biggest economic impact will come from reversing bank regulations. As banks are encouraged to loosen lending standards, especially for middle-income households, an upswing in residential construction and debt-financed consumption should add further growth impetus. Excessive deregulation could cause a re-run of the 2007 financial crisis, but that, too, is a risk for 2018 and beyond.Fourth, Trump could be good for geopolitical stability, at least in the short term. Trump＊s preference for transactional realpolitik over Obama＊s liberal interventionism should stabilise relations with Russia and China as the world is divided into spheres of influence. Trump could give Russia freer rein in Ukraine and Syria in exchange for restraint in central Europe and the Baltics. China＊s inevitable dominance in Asia could be accepted, provided it avoids outright wars with Japan, Taiwan, and other countries whose security is, in theory, guaranteed by treaties with the US. The Middle East is bound to remain a cauldron of geopolitical unrest; but, even here, Trump＊s preference for local strongmen over ※democracy promotion§ could restore a degree of stability (at the cost of human rights).Finally, Trump＊s election could force Americans to recognise flaws in their own democracy, even as they abandon global ※democracy promotion.§ The fact that Trump  could re-energise efforts to reform the electoral college 每 efforts that already have resulted in the necessary legislation . And the overwhelming opposition to Trump in trend-setting states such as California and New York could encourage their voters to elect legislatures to counteract federal conservatism with progressive state laws on issues ranging from air quality and health care to abortion, treatment of immigrants, and gun control.Now for the bad news. For the first time since the 1930s, the US has a president who views trade as a zero-sum game. Trump＊s protectionist campaign rhetoric may not have been meant literally, but if he fails to deliver any of the trade curbs that he promised, Republicans will suffer a backlash from what is now their core voter constituency, voters in declining industries and regions.US global leadership is therefore bound to shift away from free trade, globalisation, and open markets. Nobody can predict the full effects of the biggest regime change in global economic management since the 1980s; but they will surely be negative for emerging economies and multinational companies, whose development models and business strategies have assumed free trade and open capital flows.A second, more immediate, threat stems from enacting large tax cuts and boosting public spending in an economy already nearing full employment, which implies accelerating inflation, higher interest rates, or probably some combination of the two. Given the likelihood of additional trade protectionism and measures to remove immigrant workers, the increase in inflation and long-term interest rates could be quite dramatic. The impact on financial markets will be disruptive, regardless of whether the Fed aggressively tightens monetary policy to pre-empt rising prices or lets the economy ※run hot§ for a year or two, allowing inflation to accelerate.With the US economy growing faster than expected and long-term interest rates rising,  is a third major risk. Even though the dollar is already overvalued, it could move into a self-reinforcing upward spiral, as it did in the early 1980s and late 1990s, owing to dollar debts accumulated in emerging markets by governments and companies tempted by near-zero interest rates.Fourth, the combination of a dollar squeeze and protectionism spells big trouble for developing countries, with the possible exception of some relatively closed economies such as Brazil, Russia, and India, whose development strategies are less reliant on free trade and foreign financing.Finally, the most dangerous consequence of Trump＊s victory may be its contagion effect on Europe. Just as Britain＊s referendum proved uncannily predictive of Trump＊s win, Trump looks like a leading indicator of populist upheavals in Europe, which could trigger another euro crisis and threaten the breakup of the European Union. The next anti-establishment victories, according to opinion polls, will be in Italy＊s constitutional referendum and Austria＊s presidential election. Globalists can only hope that the polls again turn out to be wrong 每 but in the opposite direction."															
"A new wave of protectionism and trade tensions risks denting global growth, stoking inflation and harming living standards, the west＊s leading economic thinktank has warned  since Donald Trump won the US election on an .The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said it was optimistic that expected spending measures and tax cuts under the new US administration would boost growth there and in other countries. But it said global trade growth was already ※exceptionally weak§ and jobs would suffer if politicians rolled back the clock on trade liberalisation.The thinktank warned of an uncertain outlook for the UK and its trading partners as  negotiations began. It nudged up its forecasts for UK growth next year but still predicted the weakest performance since the recession and a further slowdown in 2018.The  used its quarterly forecasts to urge governments to use low borrowing costs to invest and enact structural reforms. The group reprised a warning to politicians not to over-rely on central banks to drive the recovery with monetary policies, such as low interest rates and electronic money-printing programmes.It forecast that, after averaging 3.9% growth over the decade to 2013, global growth would be 2.9% this year then edge up to 3.3% in 2017 and 3.6% in 2018.※Almost a decade after the outbreak of the financial crisis, the global economy remains in a low-growth trap with weak investment, trade, productivity and wage growth and rising inequality in some countries,§ said Catherine Mann, the OECD＊s chief economist.※Monetary policy is overburdened, leading to growing financial risks and distortions. Alongside structural reforms, a stronger fiscal policy response is needed to boost near-term growth and strengthen long-term prospects for inclusive growth.§The OECD said global trade growth had collapsed and the prospects of only a modest recovery over coming years suggested globalisation ※may now be close to stalling§.The report did not specifically name Trump or any other  over the spoils of globalisation appearing to be unfairly distributed. But it did warn generally on the potential perils of protectionism.OECD researchers analysed global growth prospects under different trade conditions and forecast a significant blow from rolling back the trade liberalisation seen over the last 15 years.※The global loss in GDP would be about 1.3%, but for the countries that impose the restriction, in other words, the US, China and the EU, the loss in their GDP would be closer to 2%,§ said Mann.※The countries that impose the restrictions damage themselves more.§ The report noted that more than 25% of jobs depend on foreign demand in many of the 35 countries in the OECD group.※This economic outlook suggests that protectionism and inevitable trade retaliation would offset much of the effects of the fiscal initiatives on domestic and global growth, raise prices, harm living standards, and leave countries in a worsened fiscal position. ※Trade protectionism shelters some jobs, but worsens prospects and lowers wellbeing for many others,§ the report said.The warning comes days after the US president-elect announced his .Mann said the solution for countries like the US, where voters have voiced their frustration at how globalisation has apparently weighed on wages and job creation, was to use domestic policies to ensure the gains from trade were shared better.※What we know about trade is it expands the pie. Now the problem with trade has been the distribution of the gains from trade and this has always been known ＃ and the fabric of domestic policies has not addressed that,§ she said.On the tax and spending side, the OECD＊s forecasters said they expected stimulus measures from the US government would raise US GDP growth by around 0.4 percentage points in 2017 and around 0.8 percentage points in 2018. US growth was expected to pick up next year and quicken again in 2018.At its last forecasts in September, the OECD  from the Brexit vote. In this new outlook, the thinktank forecast UK GDP would have grown 2.0% this year, a touch higher than the 1.8% it . The forecast for next year was lifted to 1.2% from 1% in September. But that would still be the weakest growth since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009 and is slower than the  and the , the Office for Budget Responsibility. An OECD forecast for 2018 showed economic growth slowing to just 1% and the thinktank warned of .It noted Philip Hammond＊s  of his predecessor, George Osborne, but urged the chancellor to go further. ※A more significant increase in public investment would support demand in the near term and boost supply in the longer term.§The thinktank also urged ※caution§ from the government over plans to raise the ※national living wage§ over coming years, warning it could backfire and hurt workers by increasing unemployment.※The effects on employment need to be carefully assessed before any further increases are adopted, especially as growth slows and labour markets weaken.§"															
"The strain of sluggish consumer spending and rising wages hit profits and dented the optimism of the UK＊s services sector in November, according to the Confederation of British Industry.Predictions of a healthy Christmas failed to lift the sector＊s spirits after falls in the pound and a rise in the government national living wage , a survey by the CBI found. A post-referendum fall in consumer confidence has added pressure on the services sector, and resulted in 18% of firms saying they were more optimistic than three months ago, against 38% who said they were less optimistic. that has shown growth to be more robust than many forecasters expected, but on course for a slowdown over the next year.The CBI＊s latest quarterly service sector survey showed that business and professional services firms, which include accountancy, legal and marketing firms, expect sales to fall during the coming months after a small increase in the last three. But at consumer services companies, which include hotels, bars, restaurants, travel firms and leisure businesses, sales volumes grew modestly, with expectations for faster growth in the next three months.Nevertheless, the report said: ※The share of firms expecting to expand their business over the year ahead were in a clear minority in both subsectors.§The services sector accounts for more than three-quarters of the economy. It has kept the economy moving ahead over the last couple of years while the manufacturing and construction industries have spent time in recession.The trend for increased spending on leisure activities and one-off events has proved a standout feature of the UK＊s GDP growth, with hotels experiencing a boom in short-stay breaks.Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI＊s chief economist, said that while optimism had declined, employment growth remained strong, with service sector firms looking to hire in the coming months. ※Many firms still plan to invest in IT, but uncertainty over future demand could act as a restraint,§ she said.※The autumn statement will have offered some comfort to businesses as the government looks to build on the UK＊s economic strengths, with an industrial strategy that helps deliver growth across the country.§Growth in spending, and intentions to spend, on training and retraining were encouraging, particularly in consumer services, she added, but firms also planned to reduce investment in other areas, such as land and buildings, vehicles, plant and machinery."															
"Britain＊s economy grew faster than previously thought in the three months after the EU referendum, underlining the miscalculations by the Treasury and other forecasters who predicted that the UK would suffer a recession following a vote for .Official figures showed GDP growth in the third quarter rose by 0.6%, The unexpected upgrade to GDP came as the Office for National Statistics made surprise revisions across all sectors of the economy. The services, industrial and construction sectors were all revised upwards.The services sector 每 which accounts for about 80% of economic activity 每 was the main driver of growth, led by transport and communications 每 including online retail deliveries 每 which expanded by 2.6%. The finance sector grew by 0.8% quarter on quarter.But the first two quarters of the year were revised down by one percentage point each. This left the annual growth rate at 2.2%, which was lower than the earlier estimate of 2.3%.Analysts warned that the revised figures emphasised the UK＊s lopsided recovery, with higher growth in the City and consumer spending while the manufacturing sector continued to decline, falling by 0.8% in the third quarter, and a sharp decline in net trade.Darren Morgan of the ONS agreed that most of the revisions stemmed from an improvement in consumer spending and better figures from the financial services sector. ※Robust consumer demand continued to help the UK economy grow steadily in the third quarter of 2016. Growth was slightly stronger than first thought, though, due to greater output in the financial sector,§ he said.In May, the then chancellor, George Osborne, claimed that Treasury forecasts showed that if voters backed an exit from the EU, the country could suffer a slowdown and technical recession, which is defined as two quarters of negative growth. ※Does Britain really want this DIY recession? Because that＊s what the evidence shows we＊ll get if we vote to leave the EU,§ he said.The International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development sounded similar warnings before the referendum.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at financial data business IHS Markit, said it was clear that the economy remained robust despite the vote to leave. ※But to say that the economy has been unscathed by the Brexit vote would be too complacent,§ he said. ※The GDP data show that the construction sector has fallen into a technical recession, with output down 1.1% in the third quarter after a 0.1% decline in the three months to June. Industrial production and manufacturing fell 0.5% and 0.9% respectively in the third quarter. The upturn was therefore driven by services, where output rose 0.8%,. ※For the moment, the data suggest that the economy has exhibited greater than anticipated resilience in the face of headwinds such as Brexit worries and rising prices. However, it seems likely that growth will slow further in coming months as these headwinds intensify.§The ONS said wages jumped by 4.5% to their highest growth rate since 2013. But rising inflation and the impact of cuts to benefits meant disposable incomes shrank by more than the ONS said in its first estimate of third quarter GDP last month. Household disposable income, adjusted for inflation, decreased by 0.6%, which confirmed a dramatic turnaround from the increase of 3.6% in the same quarter last year.Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at consultancy Capital , said: ※As a result of the fall in disposable income, households were only able to fund the rise in spending by reducing the proportion of their income that they save. The household saving ratio fell from 6.3% in the second quarter to 6.1% in the third, its lowest since 2008,.§Net trade, or the balance between exports and imports, also slumped to -1.2% from +0.3% to register the biggest drag from the export sector on GDP since the second quarter of 2012.A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ※The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, but there remain challenges ahead. The chancellor set out, in the autumn statement, his plan to support a resilient economy that works for everyone by driving productivity and supporting working people, while maintaining fiscal discipline.§"															
"he most significant event in food and agriculture over the past year did not take place on our farms. Nor did it occur in our factories, in our restaurants or on our kitchen tables. It happened in the voting booth.Rural voters turned out in of Donald Trump, throwing a Hail Mary pass against the felt by these communities. Caught in a of depressed commodity prices, rising debt and plummeting income, it comes as no surprise that  for change and the hope of different leadership with new ideas.Trump struck a chord with farmers and other rural voterswho were eager for change and desperate to recapture economic opportunity in their industries and communities. Sadly, the inconsistencies of Trump＊s agenda are poised to inflict the greatest damage in these pockets of the country that most faithfully supported him.So far, Trump is assembling an administration that to support the wellbeing of ordinary Americans, including our rural and farming communities. But with a nomination for secretary of agriculture still to come, he has the chance to tap a leader committed to serving the true interests of all of rural America: someone with the vision and strength to rectify campaign promises that will inevitably harm the livelihood of farmers, ranchers and rural citizens.It does not require close scrutiny to identify where Trump＊s proposals would be harmful to American agriculture.Campaign promises to hold the potential to eliminate major markets for US agricultural products and raise prices for imports 每 such as fruit and vegetables from the tropics and southern hemisphere 每 that Americans have come to expect year-round. You don＊t need to be an economist to understand that fewer exports and higher import prices will not stimulate a market economy. In fact, they will work counter to the economic prosperity of American farmers who depend on global trade.Vows to deport undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the Mexican border to constrict the flow of these immigrants would significantly affect the already limited agricultural workforce, as well as the workforce across the food chain that＊s heavily comprised of undocumented workers. According to the US Department of Labor＊s own count, of farmworkers in the US are undocumented 每 a figure widely regarded as an underestimation. Stemming this flow of workers would raise farmers＊ costs and lower productivity, threatening the very lifeline of American farming and, in turn, threatening food security nationwide.On top of that, Trump vows to bring jobs back to the US while  on raising the federal minimum wage. And in an appointment so sinister it almost seems like a hoax, Trump has nominated Andrew Puzder, a fast food CEO and a staunch opponent of raising the minimum wage, to lead the labor department, an entity responsible for overseeing our nation＊s labor policy and protecting our workers. Without raising the minimum wage, the new administration will be hard-pressed to to fill vacant agricultural jobs with its blue-collar supporters 每 many of whom have complained about losing work to immigrants.Trump＊s immigration agenda and resistance to raising wages could decimate the domestic production of fruit, vegetables, dairy and processed meats. Low-paying jobs do little to attract American workers, and without immigrant workers to fill the overwhelming gap, farmers will see their production capacity drop and their sales plummet, inevitably raising food prices. The irony of this scenario is palpable: we are the world＊s largest agricultural producer, yet policy decisions such as these will worsen our ability to provide enough domestically produced, affordable fruit and vegetables to meet domestic demand.Despite his campaign＊s populist,, Trump has appointed Jeff Sessions as attorney general, for extreme consolidation of big agricultural businesses. Sessions is unlikely to instruct the Department of Justice to oppose mergers like the pending, which is set to create the world＊s largest seed and chemical company 每 resulting in fewer choices and higher costs to both farmers and consumers. Failing to block mergers in these industries will further damage already struggling rural economies.It is also worth noting that the rural and farming populations don＊t always share the same interests. About  of the country＊s population is rural, whereas about , very few of whom share the interests of corporate agribusiness. In siding with large agribusiness interests that want to roll back environmental regulations that protect clean air and water in vast swaths of the country, the Trump administration would threaten the health and wellbeing of the majority of people living in those regions.Mere days away from the inauguration, Trump needs to reconcile his conflicting campaign pledges if his administration is to truly help the rural voters who swept him into power. To start, his administration must survey the entire food system and recognize that great economic opportunities will result from policies that support immigration and higher wages, incorporate environmental protections, address growing domestic demand for healthy food and safeguard our workers＊ health. If Trump wants to deliver on his promise of greater prosperity for all, he must enact comprehensive policies that prioritize the wellbeing of the American people over benefits for a select few.We＊ve heard that above all else, Trump values loyalty. Now it is his chance to demonstrate loyalty to the base that elected him by appointing a secretary of agriculture who will truly support them."

Macron was economy minister under Socialist President Fran?ois Hollande until he resigned this year to create his own political movement and stand as an independent candidate in this year＊s presidential election. ※The truth is that we must collectively recognise that the euro is incomplete and cannot last without major reforms,§ Macron said in a speech at the Humboldt University in Berlin.Speaking in English, he added: ※It has not provided Europe with full international sovereignty against the dollar on its rules. It has not provided  with a natural convergence between the different member states.§ must implement labour market reforms and revamp its education system to revive growth, while Germany must accept that more investment instead of austerity can boost growth across the eurozone area, the centrist politician said. ※The dysfunctioning of the euro is of good use to Germany, I have to say,§ said Macron, adding that a lack of trust between France and Germany was blocking major reforms that would increase solidarity among the 19 members of the eurozone. ※The euro is a weak Deutsche Mark,§ said Macron. ※The status quo is synonymous, in 10 years＊ time, with the dismantling of the euro.§ He proposed the creation of a eurozone budget to finance growth-oriented investments and to extend financial assistance to struggling member states. However, this would be anathema to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, whose conservatives face an election this year and have faced domestic resistance to bailouts for Greece by hawks who say such payments turn the euro zone into a ※transfer union§.

"John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has accused  of failing to cancel a ※tax giveaway§ by his predecessor to Britain＊s biggest banks, worth more than ?1bn this year.In his summer budget after the 2015 general election, the then chancellor  announced deep cuts to the bank levy, which was introduced after the financial crisis and charged according to the size of banks＊ balance sheets.Big banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, which felt penalised by the levy, told him that they could move their headquarters outside the UK.Osborne announced phased cuts in the levy over the parliament and made up the shortfall in revenue by imposing an 8% surcharge on banks＊ corporation tax, which falls on all lenders, not just the largest.McDonnell said by failing to reverse the cuts in the bank levy in November＊s autumn statement, Hammond was handing the big banks a rebate taxpayers could ill afford.The latest forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, published alongside the autumn statement, showed revenue from the bank levy at ?2.7bn for the current financial year, instead of the ?3.8bn expected in March 2015, before the general election.※Philip Hammond tried to sneak out the fact that he has continued this cut in the bank levy, which will provide big banks with a tax giveaway larger than under even George Osborne.※The fact that we are seeing such a large handout to the biggest banks in our country at a time when we are seeing cuts to our schools, NHS and a funding crisis in our care service is truly shameful.§McDonnell, who is the closest ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, will make a major speech on economic policy this month and hopes to draw a clear dividing line with the  by showing that he would take on vested interests as chancellor.He recently made a series of spending pledges to protect pensioner benefits, including the costly triple-lock guarantee (that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, consumer price index or 2.5%, whichever is highest), in an effort to win over elderly voters.  also wants to show that it will fight to avoid a ※bankers＊ Brexit§ 每 protecting the interests of the City at the expense of ordinary taxpayers 每 though it has said it would like to see the continuation of ※passporting§, the regime allowing UK-based banks to trade throughout the EU.A spokesman for McDonnell said Labour would reverse the cuts to the levy and would be unlikely to remove the corporation tax surcharge, because it came alongside a series of cuts in the corporation tax rate which had reduced big corporations＊ tax liability.When the government announced that policy, the Treasury minister Harriet Baldwin told MPs: ※It means that the overall rate of corporation tax will be slightly lower for banks than it was in 2010.§Britain＊s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), warned that the shift to the corporation tax levy would reduce the advantages of the tax system for smaller banks trying to break into the market. So-called challenger banks told the CMA they expected to be paying up to ?123m more in tax between them by 2020-21 as a result of the changes.※The overall effect, compared with the pre-2016 position, is that the tax advantages of smaller banks including new entrants have been reduced as a result of the changes to the bank levy and the introduction of the CTS [corporation tax surcharge]. Therefore, any effect that these tax advantages had in offsetting the barriers to entry and expansion such banks face are likely to be reduced,§ the CMA said.A Treasury spokesperson said: ※The government is clear that banks, like all businesses, must pay the right amount of tax. The reform of the bank levy was announced alongside the introduction of a new 8% surcharge on bank profit. Together, the levy and the surcharge are expected to raise over ?18bn from banks over the next five years.?§McDonnell also called for Hammond to abandon ※deeply unfair§ cuts to the corporation tax rate, saying the money could have been used to fund teachers, nurses and police officers.The rate has been reduced from 28% in 2010 when David Cameron became prime minister, to 20% and will fall to 19% in April under plans to reduce it to 17% in 2020. The cuts will be worth almost ?15bn a year to businesses by 2021 and Labour claims this is equivalent to employing 12,000 nurses, 10,000 police officers and 10,000 teachers full-time every year for a decade.McDonnell said: ※We have known for a long time that the Tories＊ cuts to corporation tax have cost the exchequer billions and today we have laid bare what this means for our public services. ※Labour is calling on the government to reverse these deeply unfair tax giveaways and start properly investing in our vital public services.§"

In the past, economists had widely viewed the yuan as , but China during the past year has spent hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign currency reserves to keep the yuan from falling further 每 prompting the US Treasury to ease its warnings on Beijing＊s currency practices."															
"n many ways, the Republican party＊s plan to implement a ※border adjustment tax§ in the US is a virtual complement to the physical wall  plans to erect on the Mexican border. Although the border adjustment tax has not seeped into public consciousness in nearly the same way as Trump＊s wall, it could end up affecting the average American a lot more 每 and not necessarily in a good way.On the surface, the basic idea is to slap a tax of, say, 20% on imports, and to provide tax breaks worth a similar amount on exports. Most populists＊ gut reaction is that this must be fantastic for US jobs, because it discourages imports and encourages exports. Unfortunately, as many have , there is a loose screw in this logic, which is that the US has a floating exchange rate.A stronger dollar 每 a likely result of imposing a border adjustment tax 每 makes it cheaper for Americans to buy imports (because a dollar buys more foreign currency); conversely, a stronger dollar makes US exports more expensive to foreigners. In fact, the baseline textbook result is that the exchange-rate effect would fully offset the tax, leaving the trade balance unchanged. If you think the Republicans＊ proposal sounds like hocus pocus, you might be right, but let＊s hold that thought.Several highly regarded academic economists favour the border adjustment idea, but for entirely different reasons. They take it as an article of faith that the exchange rate  in fact rise to neutralise the trade effects of a border adjustment tax. But they like it anyway.First, the US imports a lot more than it exports, so it runs a large trade deficit, with the broadest measure (the ※current account§) at about 2.5% of GDP. While that is a vast improvement over the 6%-of-GDP deficits the US was running a decade ago, the US still imports considerably more than it exports, meaning the government stands to collect far more revenues from its 20% tax on imports than it would have to give in tax breaks to exporters. Indeed, the tax-subsidy schedule could, on paper at least, bring in roughly $90bn a year.And the magic doesn＊t stop there. Although it might surprise people who are used to thinking of imports and exports as a pure ※us vs them§ phenomenon, in fact roughly half of all trade is intra-firm 每 transactions between foreign and US divisions of the same company. And because US corporate taxes are among the world＊s highest, firms will go to great lengths to assign as much value as they can to foreign subsidiaries, and as little as possible to US companies.One way to do this is by putting an artificially high bookkeeping price on intra-firm imports, and an artificially low bookkeeping price on exports. Under- and over-invoicing is a time-honoured way to get around taxes and controls. When a transaction is all ※in-house§ it essentially involves an accounting sleight of hand to book profits in low-tax jurisdictions.As the University of California at Berkeley＊s Alan Auerbach first , the border tax adjustment is a way to push back on under- and over-invoicing in a high-tax jurisdiction such as the US. So, all in all, even if a border adjustment tax does not directly make US goods more competitive, it is an efficient way to raise revenues, potentially making room for other tax cuts.So what could possibly be wrong with such a technocratically sound idea? First, it relies on some heroic assumptions 每 for example, that people cannot easily game the labyrinthine system and that foreign governments will exercise restraint in retaliating. Second, it ignores a host of difficult transition problems.For starters, the overwhelming majority of US imports are priced in dollars, not foreign currency. So, even if foreign currencies become cheaper, it might not help importers locked into dollar contracts. Their costs would be 20% higher because of the import tax. And, despite the tax subsidy, some exporters would lose, because, as a recent  points out, they rely on imported intermediate goods to produce their products.Another problem is that a stronger dollar would mean a massive wealth loss for Americans, because the value of many foreign assets would go down, as my colleagues Emmanuel Farhi, Gita Gopinath, and Oleg Itskhoki  The biggest problem of all, though, is the blithe assumption that the dollar exchange rate would neatly move to offset the tax/subsidy scheme.If there is anything that the past 40 years of exchange-rate research has taught us, it is that exchange rates can move wildly away from their fundamentals for many years at a time. It is thoroughly unrealistic to assume that a border tax will quickly lead to a sharp offsetting movement of the dollar. The process could take many years, and the short-term effects on US unemployment easily could be negative.True, high border taxes could boost US employment. The scheme would require a huge increase in customs agents, and it would most likely lead to significant expansion in the underground economy as people seek to evade the taxes. But are those really the types of jobs proponents of a border tax have in mind?? "															
"heresa May＊s politics are at war with her very own policies. What she says is utterly undermined by what she actually does. No matter which way I look at Wednesday＊s , that is the conclusion I end up at.The prime minister vows ※§. Her chancellor delivers more of the same cuts. In No 10, they fret about . In No 11, they make policies that, in their own budget analysis published yesterday, hit the just about managing harder than the rich. To Tory activists, : ※The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the rich and powerful, but by the interests of ordinary, working-class people.§ To Tory MPs, Philip Hammond boasts about the cuts he is making to corporation tax. Indeed, flick through the red book and the single biggest giveaway it lists is the two successive reductions to taxes on big businesses, worth . Compare that to the ?2bn he＊s coughed up for care for elderly people.What lies behind the rhetoric is easy to understand. As May herself puts it, the British voted last June for a sea change: not just to leave the EU, but to make their own government and their economy work for them. The new prime minister took on the role of change agent-in-chief, leading a cabinet short on the Notting Hill set and long on provincial south-easteners. To use a ghastly Westminsterism, the ※optics§ were brought bang up to date for the post-Brexit era.Yet her policies look and sound like they are straight out of 2013. Most of May＊s attempts to break with the past 每 putting workers on company boards, blocking Chinese investment in nuclear, checking foreign takeovers of strategically important industries 每 have either been dropped outright or are completely watered down. What she and her ministers are left pushing is continuity-Osborne. The same Osborne, you＊ll remember, whose economics  they fed the public rage that produced Brexit.Billions are still being taken off benefits for working people. Nurses, teachers and other public-sector workers are still suffering a huge pay squeeze, even while hospitals and other public services are crying out for more cash.  will be slightly less severe than it was under Osborne, but it will go on for a whole lot longer. Reducing the deficit was meant to be over by 2015; judging by Hammond＊s statements, it now looks set to carry on until 2025. That means 15 years of cuts to public services. Britain has not yet reached the halfway point of this planned austerity programme, yet already our hospitals are at breaking point, our prisons keep having mini-riots and I＊ve met teachers who bring in their own food and clothes for their pupils.The economic consequences of sticking with Osbornomics are spelt out by the . While it retracted some of the pessimism it expressed at November＊s autumn statement, the outlook remains grim. Five years from now, our national income will actually be smaller than it is today. For the average working Briton, this will be the worst decade for pay since the Napoleonic wars. By spring 2022, workers will still be earning less, once you strip out inflation, than they were when  in autumn of 2007.Much of this is down to Brexit, but it＊s important to remember how weak Britain＊s economy was even before the referendum. And ultimately, what meagre growth we＊ll get will rely on ordinary families shopping and racking up big credit card debts. Last year, more than 100% of the UK＊s growth came from consumption. Hammond＊s biggest gamble is his assumption that British families will keep borrowing and spending even while they are getting poorer. In that scenario, only two things can happen, and neither of them is good. Either families will start to batten down the hatches and spend less, which will further slow down our growth; or a growing number of low-paid people will fall into more problems with debt.The political results of this ought to be devastating. Were it not for the culture war being fought over Brexit, in which the rightwing papers back May and Hammond as long as they frogmarch the UK out of the single market, they would right now be throwing buckets of bile at the chancellor. After all, he is making their own readers poorer. He throws spare change at social care when all the evidence is it needs a lot more cash and a total overhaul. The party of entrepreneurship is now jacking up taxes on the self-employed, which is the sort of thing that would normally ensure a slaughtering by the right, especially its outriders among the freelance commentariat.What Hammond is doing with the self-employed is more interesting than that 每 because it demonstrates how politically insensitive he and May are. The numbers of self-employed have been growing rapidly, so that they now make up one in six of the workforce. There is a stack of evidence and court rulings that firms are gaming the system and ducking taxes by treating their staff as ※independent contractors§ 每 when they are no such thing. What Hammond did yesterday is raise taxes on the workers without tackling the abuses. In his world, multinationals such as Uber will see their tax bills fall, even while their taxi drivers must pay out more.Nor is this an isolated case of topsy-turvyism. The chancellor spoke yesterday about how people up and down the country ask: ※Will our children enjoy the same opportunity that we did?§ His answer was to offer poor kids taxi rides so they can attend free schools. Yet according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the number of children in poverty will rise over the next five years by more than a quarter to . And next month the government will cut inheritance taxes paid by children whose parents are worth more than a million 每 even while tax credits and housing benefits will be scrapped for the third or fourth child in poor families. In both cases, a child＊s financial situation will be radically changed not because of anything they have done, but through their parents＊ actions. It just so happens that the child lucky enough to be born to very rich parents will get richer still, while the poor child will be punished.What Brexit and Trump show is that these blatant injustices and contradictions cannot carry on for ever. At some point, they will be resolved 每 and probably not in ways that May or any mainstream politician will welcome. The prime minister was right in sensing that the British wanted an overthrow of the old regime. But she is failing to deliver it."															
"The  100 reached another new peak on Tuesday and broke a near 20-year record for its longest run of closing highs. The index jumped 37.70 points or 0.52% to end the day at 7,275, its ninth consecutive day of closing highs, beating the eight-day run in May 1997 following Labour＊s general election landslide under Tony Blair.The latest boost for investors has come mainly from the weakness of the pound since the uncertainty created by the  vote last June. Sterling has lost more than 18% against the dollar and is hovering close to 31-year lows, excluding October＊s flash crash. It has fallen 12% against the euro.By the time the London market closed, the pound was flat at $1.2164, having fallen sharply on Monday followng comments from Theresa May suggesting a hard Brexit was on the cards. Over the weekend the prime minister , which appeared to quash hopes of retaining access to the single market.The plunging pound has lifted the FTSE 100 because it is packed with overseas earners and international businesses such as mining companies. A weak pound boosts their dollar revenues and profits and makes their goods more competitive. A stable performance from the UK economy despite the dire warnings ahead of the EU referendum also provided support for the market, and a recovery in the oil price was another factor in the rise of commodity companies.Mining companies were among the main gainers in 2016, with the FTSE mining index up 100% over the year, and they have continued to help push the market higher since the turn of the year. Four of the top 10 risers on the FTSE 100 on Tuesday were commodity companies, with Anglo American 每 up more 313% since the start of 2016 每 leading the way. Supermarkets also helped push the FTSE 100 to its new record after .The comparative weakness of sterling has also attracted overseas investors looking for bargains in the market despite the Brexit risks, and reopened the prospect of international companies snapping up UK peers at cheaper prices. The FTSE 100 may continue to move higher if, as expected, the pound continues to struggle. Michael Hewson, the chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: ※Markets once again appear to be pricing in the prospect of a so-called hard Brexit, and the extra costs that the leaving of the single market might entail, which has once again seen the pound come under pressure. ※With the March deadline for article 50 fast approaching, the uncertainty [over Brexit] isn＊t likely to diminish, and this may well pressure the pound further in weeks ahead.§The FTSE 100＊s rise is also part of a general move higher for most major global markets after the surprise election of Donald Trump as US president, and  Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 have hit new peaks in recent weeks. After coming within a whisker of the elusive 20,000 barrier on Friday before falling back, the Dow rebounded in early trading on Tuesday to within 60 points of it.Even the more UK domestically focused FTSE 250 hit a new closing high of 18,413 on Tuesday, although it remains below its all time peak of 18,607 reached on 4 Ocober 2016.  The FTSE 100＊s record winning streak came against a very different background to the May 1997 gains. Then the market was boosted by Blair＊s attempts to distance himself from previous Labour administrations and the trade unions, his move to abandon nationalisation and income tax rises, and the decision to give the Bank of England independence to set interest rates.The FTSE 100 itself was a very different creature, with just one mining company in the form of RTZ, now Rio Tinto, a large proportion of consumer goods groups such as Cadbury Schweppes, EMI, Bass and Allied Domecq, and several utilities including Thames Water, PowerGen and Scottish Power.With the dotcom boom a couple of years away, the main technology companies were telecoms group such at British Telecommunications, Cable and Wireless, Vodafone and Orange."

"The  is due to provide a snapshot of the strength of Britain＊s biggest lenders after assessing their resilience to a dramatic economic downturn and sharp fall in house prices.Threadneedle Street will announce the outcome of its  每 and one building society, Nationwide 每 on Wednesday, alongside its assessment of the major risks to the financial system in the wake of the Brexit result.The Bank will also scrutinise the effectiveness of measures aimed at limiting the risks in the housing market. It has previously said it is concerned about the ability of some households to keep paying their debts if unemployment rises and wage growth stalls. The results will be the focus for investors. The banks being tested are Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds  Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, the UK arm of Spanish bank Santander and Standard Chartered, which is based in London but has most of its activities in emerging markets.The tests were introduced in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis and are based on hypothetical scenarios devised by the Bank. ※In the Bank＊s 2016 stress scenario vulnerabilities across financial markets and the global and UK economies crystallise,§ the Bank said. The test also incorporates projections for fines and other costs associated with misconduct, although the Bank said: ※There remains a very high degree of uncertainty around any approach to quantifying misconduct cost risks facing UK banks.§The Bank has set out an imaginary five-year period in which there is a ※synchronised global downturn§ under which the global economy contracts by 1.9% 每 as it did during the financial crisis. It has also incorporated domestic factors: a 31% fall in house prices, 42% reduction in commercial property prices with the economy contracting by 4.3% and unemployment rising by 4.5 percentage points.

"A big week in parliament for the Jacob Rees-Mogg committee (formerly known as the Treasury select committee), which will again be grilling one of its favourite targets: economic forecasters.First up on Tuesday comes Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which last Thursday said that Brexit really means . The following day will see Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, whose organisation also had a run-out last week, when it predicted the .None of which is likely to have gone down terribly well with Rees-Mogg, the flag-bearer of the Tories＊ Eurosceptic wing, who has shot to fame this year by .To say that the Rees-Mogg demeanour tends towards the traditional is to recklessly underplay the situation, although even his critics concede his entertainment value.The old Etonian former fund manager was once accused of going to bed in double-breasted pyjamas and, at the 1997 general election, stood as the Tory candidate for the solidly Labour seat of Central Fife. He attracted ridicule 每 by canvassing with his nanny.※Any man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists in his error.§ Given that next week will be the 2,058th anniversary of the death of Roman philosopher Cicero, it＊s too much of a stretch (even for this column) to suggest that the great orator foresaw the role of the financial analyst 每 however compelling the circumstantial evidence may be.Still, for as long as the trade of analyst has existed, its members have attempted to illustrate how much life there is in those wise words. Take Topps Tiles, whose shares have dropped almost 50% this year. Despite that, the company＊s supporters have been harder to dislodge than a 30-year-old installation of one of its products. Peel Hunt rated the shares a buy in January (at about 150p), when they were worth almost twice as much as now, and has reiterated that view six times during 2016. Cantor Fitzgerald, Berenberg and Liberum also persisted in their error 每 remaining positive on the company all the way down.So, aside from admitting to a costly mistake, is there any way out of the mess? Well, the retailer reports numbers this week 每 so it＊ll be prayers to Jupiter all round.Consumer confidence has been holding up pretty well following the EU referendum 每 rather defying gloomy expectations of a slump and giving further ammunition to those claiming that Remainers over-egged the risks of a  vote.Last month, , which assesses respondents＊ outlook for the next 12?months, decreased by two points to -3, ending a revival since June＊s Brexit vote that pushed the index up to -1 from a low of -12.

That seems like good news 每 it＊s an area often thought to show the first signs of a slowdown 每 but like almost everything on Brexit, you can use the figures to argue whichever way you want.So confidence to buy expensive items could mean everybody really is feeling chipper and Brexit is no big deal. Or it could mean that the referendum-induced slump in the pound is going to send prices soaring, so we＊re all really getting our big purchases in before the arrival of a nasty bout of inflation.

"he European Union did not cause the 2007-08 financial crisis. The European Union did not instruct George Osborne to introduce an austerity policy which magnified the deleterious effects of that crisis. The  did not impose neoliberal and excessively deregulatory policies which contributed to a situation where the ※fruits of globalisation§ were concentrated in the top 5% of the population.However, in a propaganda feat which will go down in history, the Leave campaigners managed to persuade enough British voters that the EU was the source of many of our problems, and, just as bizarrely, that leaving the EU would be the answer.It was against the background of this farcical development that the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Treasury had to prepare the groundwork for last week＊s autumn statement. Thanks to the combined impact of the financial crisis and the austerity programme, the OBR had already revised downwards its estimates of the country＊s productivity and the growth of productive potential; this revision took place between last November＊s autumn statement and the March budget.Then came the referendum, and the net result of feverish work going on at the OBR since then is that the fallout from Brexit 每 indeed, from the very prospect of  每 is that the outlook for productivity growth has been revised downwards again, with all that this implies for living standards and the tax revenues that go to finance public spending.One problem facing the OBR in making its assessment was that it had little idea what the government＊s policy was for Brexit. This is not surprising, because the government itself has little idea either.But Robert Chote and his colleagues at the OBR did not get where they are today without possessing a lot more sense and judgment that the Brexiters who have landed us in this mess. These are Brexiters who are so bereft of common sense that they argue departure from the EU will free this once-great nation to be able to trade with China, India, Australia and the rest of the world, as if we did not trade with them already.Ah, they say, but freed from the constraints of the EU we shall be able to do even better. Tell that to Germany: an economy that, allegedly constrained by the EU, seems to fare a lot better in world markets than we do.Now, one thing missing from the latest OBR report is the usual catchy soundbite we have come to expect: remember ※economic rollercoaster§? I suspect the reason for the OBR＊s more sober tone is that the facts, or lack of them, speak for themselves.Thus the OBR states: ※The OBR is required by legislation to produce its forecasts on the basis of current stated government policy (but not necessarily assuming that specific objectives will be met). In the current context of looming Brexit negotiations, this is far from straightforward.§I＊ll say! Notwithstanding the barrage of propaganda in the Brexit press that everything is fine and dandy with the post-referendum economy, the OBR knows something about economic time-lags. Furthermore, it does not commit the elementary error of assuming away the effects of something that has not yet happened 每 in other words, it does not confuse post-referendum with post-Brexit.It says: ※We have made a judgment 每 consistent with most external studies 每 that over the time horizon of our forecast [that is, the rest of this decade] any likely Brexit outcome would lead to lower trade flows, lower investment and lower net inward migration than we would otherwise have seen, and hence lower potential output.§It points out that uncertainty will lead firms to delay investment, reducing economic growth, and the impact of that will be compounded as consumers are squeezed by higher import prices, thanks to the fall in the?pound.Now, as the chancellor pointed out in his speech to the Conservative party＊s annual conference, the nation did not deliberately vote on 23 June to become poorer. But at the very least all the signs are that it will, via Brexit, become poorer than it otherwise would be. And thinktank after thinktank is telling us that it is the least well-off 每 many of whom apparently voted for Brexit as a protest 每 who are going to suffer most.What is to be done? Well, Nicholas Boyle, emeritus professor of German at Cambridge University, has pointed out that only 28% of the population of this country voted to leave the EU. ※Should 28% be entitled to compel 72% to do what they want?§ he asks. That, he says, is the real constitutional issue.※The 17 million [Leave voters] represented no one other than themselves. The members of the House of Commons represent all 64 million of us, whether voters or not.§ He adds that if it is true that 70% of MPs do not wish to leave the European Union, then they ※have every right to feel they more truly represent the views and interests of the country§.Unfortunately, there is a timing problem. One suspects that when the true implications of Brexit become apparent in higher prices, squeezed incomes and an aggravation of austerity, large numbers of Leave voters will have second thoughts. The tragedy is that a lot of damage will have been done by then."															
"rimes perpetrated on the basis of hate are nothing new. They are always with us. The levels, and the groups targeted, tend to ebb and flow with the political tides. However, the recent waves of rightwing populism in the UK and elsewhere have  and emboldened those who provoke or endorse them.In the US, where each new day brings  under a presidency that has made some of the most offensive tropes around race and immigration mainstream, the latest annual on ※hate groups§ makes for stark reading. They are defined as having ※beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics§. The SPLC has tracked hate crimes and groups for decades. Its latest report reveals that the number of hate groups rose for the second consecutive year in 2016.According to the SPLC, there were  (the organisation specifies what it defines as ※active§ groups based on criteria including marches, publishing and recruitment drives), up from 892 in 2015. The most dramatic change was in the category for anti-Muslim groups, which tripled in number year-on-year from 34 in 2015 to 101. The report＊s author, Mark Potok, points out that the total hate group figure is most likely an underestimate as they have shifted operations online, making tracking more challenging.None of this occurred in a vacuum. It is set against a backdrop of (now highly visible) rightwing populist movements in the US and beyond. The analysis concludes that a key factor in the most recent upswing in the number of groups was that Trump＊s campaign ※electrified§ the radical right, who ※saw in him a champion of the idea that America is fundamentally a white man＊s country§. Threats of Muslim bans and building a border wall with Mexico are two of the campaign pledges that fed into this.But it＊s not just that hate groups have been bolstered. As with Britain and Brexit, hate crime in the US has seen leaps, too. In the days immediately following the 2016 presidential election the SPLC reported a wave of hate crimes and bias-related incidents around the country 每  after 9 November 每 according to its own count. Potok concludes that this was clearly tied directly to Trump＊s victory, with more than a third of these early incidents involving references either to his remarks about grabbing women＊s genitals or the ※Make America Great Again§ slogan.One notable observation in the analysis is a decline in ※real world§ activities like rallies and violence organised by hate groups because, as Potok writes: ※There hardly seemed a reason to organise their own rallies when extremists could attend a Trump event filled with just as much anti-establishment vitriol as any extremist rally.§There are numerous parallels between the UK and the US, Potok says. Not just for raw statistics on rises in hate incidents, but also in terms of the forces propelling them. Among these is a general backdrop epitomised by decades of globalisation, coupled with rising economic inequality and insecurity, but more specifically the deliberate and strategic stoking of fears among parts of the population susceptible to populist messages by political opportunists.The  is a common feature of Brexit Britain and the current US political landscape. But reports like this one tell us that the fuelling of such hate should be countered at every possible opportunity."															
"ll things considered, it could hardly have gone better for Britain＊s retailers in 2016. Shops and online outlets were fully braced for a big hit to activity in the period after the  but it didn＊t happen. Consumers spent in the summer. They spent in the autumn and they spent at Christmas too.That spree is over. Retailers are going to find life tougher in 2017. Those facing the prospect of higher business rates alongside a dip in demand will experience a painful double-whammy.Three factors explain why the pundits who confidently predicted carnage in the high street after the Brexit vote were wrong: consumer psychology; policy changes; and the economic fundamentals underpinning consumer demand.Taking those points in reverse order, spending was supported by rising employment, low interest rates and rising real incomes. The big slump in oil prices at the end of 2015 had pushed down inflation and reduced fuel bills. Individuals were getting better off, had lost their fear of being made redundant, and had more money left over when the essentials were paid for.These benign conditions became even more conducive to spending when the  in early August, something it was always likely to do once Britain had voted to leave. The idea that Threadneedle Street would sit back and do nothing was for the birds.Not that consumers needed much encouragement. The 52% who voted for leave spent because they were celebrating; the 48% who voted for remain spent as a form of retail therapy. Either way, the evidence is that people quickly got on with their lives.Strong consumer spending was the reason the economy grew by 0.6% in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Activity was especially strong in November, but then fell back sharply in December. ran counter to the City＊s expectations and has left a strong impression that the party＊s over.This is probably true, even though some caution needs to be taken with the retail sales data. The figures are subject to seasonal adjustment to take account of the fact spending rises strongly in November and December before collapsing in January. The raw numbers from the  show that there was a 13% rise in the value of retail sales (excluding fuel) between November and December followed by a 30% drop between December and January. Getting the seasonal adjustment right with these sorts of monthly gyrations is quite tricky and has been made harder by the recent popularity of Black Friday in November, when retailers offer early Christmas bargains. This has had the effect of bringing forward spending that would normally take place in December.But it is also likely that the prospect of higher inflation prompted consumers to buy big ticket items in 2016 that they would otherwise have put off until 2017. To that extent, some of the growth seen last year has been borrowed from the future.That＊s rational behaviour, because  between October and January and is certain to go higher over the months ahead. So far, the pick-up in the cost of living has been the result of the global rise in oil prices but retailers are also struggling with the higher prices paid for imports as a result of the post-referendum fall in the pound. Tough competitive pressures and the current softening of demand mean that only part of the increases in costs will be passed on but consumers are still going to feel the impact. In July and August last year, inflation was running at 0.6% and earnings were going up by 2.5%. Annual inflation will be running at 3% before long and unless wages start to rise real incomes will start falling.If the past was any guide to the present, wage inflation would already be accelerating. The last time unemployment was as low as it is now was in 2005 when average earnings were growing at annual rate of 4%. Currently, they are increasing at about 2.5%.For a while, this weakness in wage growth could be explained as a temporary response to the savage recession in 2008-09. Workers sacrificed earnings in order to prevent being laid off. The result was to spread the pain: a much smaller increase in unemployment but falling living standards for those in work. But this interpretation is starting to look a little threadbare. As might have been expected, the rate of earnings growth fell sharply during the period when the economy was contracting. Output collapsed by about 6% over six quarters in 2008-09 and by the time growth had bottomed out earnings growth had fallen to 2%.Yet it continued to fall even after recovery began. By 2013, earnings growth had slipped to 1% and it remained there well into 2014 even though by that time the jobless rate had dropped from 8% to 6% and was falling fast.When earnings growth did at last start to pick up in late 2014 the expectation was that the upward trend would continue. But that didn＊t happen. Wage inflation reached 2.5% in early 2015 and has remained there ever since.Britain should be at the point where earnings growth starts to rise. Productivity has started to improve, inflation has picked up from unusually low levels, the number of workers resigning in order to move to a new job has reached a post-crisis high and there are plenty of job vacancies.That should ensure some pick-up in earnings growth this year, but the improvement is likely to be modest and that means earnings will struggle to keep pace with prices. As a result, consumer spending will be squeezed and growth more dependent on the performance of exports. Retailers will only have another bumper year if wage inflation picks up markedly and that looks improbable.Economists have been arguing about whether there is a strong relationship between wages and unemployment ever since Bill Phillips published his seminal paper on the subject in 1958. Looking at data from 1861 to 1957, Phillips found that when unemployment came down wage inflation went up and vice versa. The Phillips curve was born, became fashionable in the 1960s and then fell out of favour in the 1970s when, in the era of stagflation, unemployment and inflation both rose.Over the years, it has become clear that there is a link between unemployment and wage growth, although not quite the neat long-term relationship that Phillips detected. Falling unemployment eventually leads to wage inflation but the jobless total has to fall a long way for workers to be able to exert any real bargaining power. There has been a structural change in the labour market that leaves the peak in wage inflation lower in each economic cycle. "															
"Dimitris Costopoulos stood, worry beads in hand, under brilliant blue skies in front of the Greek parliament. Wearing freshly pressed trousers, polished shoes and a smart winter jacket 每 ※my Sunday best§ 每 he had risen at 5am to get on the bus that would take him to Athens 200 miles away and to the great sandstone edifice on Syntagma Square. By his own admission, protests were not his thing.At 71, the farmer rarely ventures from Proastio, his village on the fertile plains of Thessaly. ※But everything is going wrong,§ he lamented on Tuesday, his voice hoarse after hours of chanting anti-government slogans.※Before there was an order to things, you could build a house, educate your children, spoil your grandchildren. Now the cost of everything has gone up and with taxes you can barely afford to survive. Once I＊ve paid for fuel, fertilisers and grains, there is really nothing left.§Costopoulos is Greece＊s Everyman; the human voice in a debt crisis that refuses to go away. Eight years after it first erupted, the drama shows every sign of reigniting, only this time in a new dark age of Trumpian politics, post-Brexit , terror attacks and rise of the populist far right.※I grow wheat,§ said Costopoulos, holding out his wizened hands. ※I am not in the building behind me. I don＊t make decisions. Honestly, I can＊t understand why things are going from bad to worse, why this just can＊t be solved.§As  hurtles towards another full-blown confrontation with the creditors keeping it afloat, and as tensions over stalled bailout negotiations mount, it is a question many are asking.The country＊s epic struggle to avert bankruptcy should have been settled when  每 the biggest financial rescue programme in global history 每 from the EU and International Monetary Fund in May 2010. Instead, three bailouts later, it is still wrangling over the terms of the latest 86bn emergency loan package, with lenders also at loggerheads and diplomats no longer talking of a can, but rather a bomb, being kicked down the road. Default looms if a 7.4bn debt repayment 每 money owed mostly to the European Central Bank 每 is not honoured in July.Amid the uncertainty, volatility has returned to the markets. So, too, has fear, with an estimated 2.2bn being withdrawn from banks by panic-stricken depositors since the beginning of the year. With talk of Greece＊s exit from the euro being heard again, farmers, trade unions and other sectors enraged by the eviscerating effects of austerity have once more come out in protest.From his seventh-floor office on Mitropoleos, Makis Balaouras, an MP with the governing Syriza party, has a good view of the goings-on in Syntagma. Demonstrations 每 what the former trade unionist calls ※the movement§ 每 are a fine thing. ※I wish people were out there mobilising more,§ he sighed. ※Protests are in our ideological and political DNA. They are important, they send a message.§This is the irony of Syriza, the leftwing party catapulted to power on a ticket to ※tear up§ the hated bailout accords widely blamed for extraordinary levels of Greek unemployment, poverty and emigration. Two years into office it has instead overseen the most punishing austerity measures to date, slashing public-sector salaries and pensions, cutting services, agreeing to the biggest privatisation programme in European history and raising taxes on everything from cars to beer 每 all of which has been the price of the loans that have kept default at bay and Greece in the euro.In the maelstrom the economy has improved, with Athens achieving a noticeable primary surplus last year, but the social crisis has intensified.For men like Balaouras, who suffered appalling torture for his leftwing beliefs at the hands of the 1967-74 colonels＊ regime, the policies have been galling. With the IMF and EU arguing over the country＊s ability to reach tough fiscal targets when the current bailout expires in August next year, the demand for 3.6bn of more measures has left many in Syriza reeling. Without upfront legislation on the reforms, creditors say, they cannot conclude a compliance review on which the next tranche of bailout aid hangs.※We had an agreement,§ insisted Balaouras, looking despondently down at his desert boots. ※We kept to our side of the deal, but the lenders haven＊t kept to their side because now they are asking for more. We want the review to end. We want to go forward. This situation is in the interests of no one. But to get there we have to have an honourable compromise. Without that there will be a clash.§It had been hoped that an agreement would be struck on Monday at what had been billed as a high-stakes meeting of euro area finance ministers. On Friday, EU officials announced that the deadline had been all but missed because there had been little convergence between the two sides.With the Netherlands holding general elections next month, and France and Germany also heading to the polls in May and September, fears of the dispute becoming increasingly politicised have added to its complexity. Highlighting those concerns, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, attempted to end the rift that has emerged between eurozone lenders and the IMF over the fund＊s insistence that Greece can only begin to recover if its 320bn debt pile is reduced substantially.In talks with Christine Lagarde, the Washington-based IMF＊s managing director, Merkel agreed to discuss the issue during a further meeting between the two women to be held on Wednesday. The IMF has steadfastly refused to sign up to the latest bailout, arguing that Greek debt is not only unmanageable but on a trajectory to become explosive by 2030. Berlin, the biggest contributor of the 250bn Greece has so far received, says it will be unable to disburse further funds without the IMF on board.The assumption is that the prime minister, , will cave in, just as he did when the country came closest yet to leaving the euro at the height of the crisis in the summer of 2015. But the 41-year-old leader, like Syriza, has been pummelled in the polls. Persuading disaffected backbenchers to support more measures, and then selling them to a populace exhausted by repeated rounds of austerity, will be extremely difficult. Disappointment has increasingly given way to the death of hope 每 a sentiment reinforced by the realisation that Cyprus and other bailed-out countries, by contrast, are no longer under international supervision.In his city centre office, the former finance minister Evangelos Venizelos pondered where Greece＊s predicament was now. ※[We are] at the same point we were several years ago,§ he joked. ※The only difference is that anti-European sentiment is growing. What was once a very friendly country towards Europe is becoming increasingly less so, and with that comes a lot of danger, a lot of risk.§When historians look back they, too, may conclude that Greece has expended a great deal of energy not moving forward at all.The arc of crisis that has swept the country 每 coursing like a cancer through its body politic, devastating its public health system, shattering lives 每 has been an exercise in the absurd. The feat of pulling off the greatest fiscal adjustment in modern times has spawned a slump longer and deeper than the Great Depression, with the Greek economy shrinking more than 25% since the crisis began.Even if the latest impasse is broken and a deal is reached with creditors soon, few believe that in a country of weak governance and institutions it will be easy to enforce. Political turbulence will almost certainly beckon; the prospect of ※Grexit§ will grow.※Grexit is the last thing we want, but we may arrive at a point of serious dilemmas,§ said Venizelos. ※Whatever deal is reached will be very difficult to implement, but that notwithstanding, it is not the memoranda [the bailout accords] that caused the crisis. The crisis was born in Greece long before.§Like every crisis government before it, Tsipras＊s administration is acutely aware that salvation will come only when Greece can return to the markets and raise funds. What happens in the weeks ahead could determine if that is likely to happen at all.Back in Syntagma, Costopoulos the good-natured farmer ponders what lies ahead. Like every Greek, he stands to be deeply affected. ※All I know is that we are all being pushed,§ he said, searching for the right words. ※Pushed in the direction of somewhere very explosive, somewhere we do not want to be.§"															
															
"With deft accuracy, a design worker is sticking sparkles on a gift bag in an office festooned with crackers, wrapping paper swatches and shelves loaded with multicoloured glitter. Based near a former colliery in south Wales, a team of 45 designers work on new creations for IG Design Group 每 the world＊s biggest producer of wrapping paper and crackers. The team started designing for next Christmas in August. One worker says she often gets home to find glitter in her car, on her hair, even on the dog: ※It can be  every day here.§ Loss-making and struggling under a mountain of debt in 2008 after a string of acquisitions, IG has survived by restructuring, and broadening its product ranges to include stickers, gift bags and other new products alongside traditional wrap and cards. The wrapping paper is made in  while the design team＊s other creations are turned out at IG＊s factories in China and the Netherlands.Paul Fineman, chief executive of the group, says order books for next year are ※heaving§ because the drop in the value of the pound post-Brexit has boosted demand from abroad.The group produces 1bn m of wrapping paper a year, almost half of which is made in Wales. It supplies all the major supermarkets and major international retailers including Ikea and Costco. Upmarket crackers, under the Tom Smith brand, sell for up to ?500 and will be adorning the royal Christmas dinner table.In October, IG sent a selection of four specially selected cracker designs to Buckingham Palace so that the Queen could choose one to grace her Christmas table.Its products may be swathed in glitter, but the factory in Ystrad Mynach, a short drive from Newport, is an example of gritty British survival against the odds. Previously IG had three sites 每 one where wrap was printed, one where it spun huge printed reels of paper onto cardboard tubes and another where goods were packed up ready for stores. The group spent ?8m on bringing the whole operation together in one site two years ago. It switched to using more environmentally friendly and efficient water-based inks and introduced new processes that can add glitzy touches such as holograms and shiny finishes.※In 2008 we had to seriously think whether we could make this a viable facility,§ says Fineman. ※It was loss-making and had a lot of issues. We had choices and one of those choices would have been that this place didn＊t have a future as a manufacturing site. But we felt if we could remodel, find different customers and channels and create a sufficient resource to invest that not only could we survive but it would be very profitable. It was very challenging but it is working.§IG＊s enormous printing machines have 10 heads that layer ink onto a polymer roll on which the design has been laser cut so it stands proud like a giant potato print. Paper from reels more than 1m thick is fed through the printing system before being dried in a long oven and then sliced in half as it is spun back into another thick roll.The plant can print 72km of paper an hour, and employs up to 450 people at peak times about half of whom work in manufacturing. From September the printing machines are working 24/7 right up until Christmas week to cope with late orders from British retailers. Production restarts for next Christmas almost immediately and shipping begins from June or July with boxes of wrapping paper packed off to Bristol docks and shipped over the Atlantic.The company is having a good year. Underlying sales were up more than a fifth in the six months to the end of September with profits up 36% as gift bag sales soared. Fineman says the fall in sterling will bring another boost. ※The UK is going to be a very uncertain place. But over the next 12 to 18 months UK manufacturing, the number of cards sold is up 5% year on year.※Sending Christmas cards has declined other than single cards to close relatives. ※People aren＊t just writing out cards to their colleagues at work. But there are new occasions and reasons to send cards all the time. People just see a card and think ＆that＊s fun＊ and get it. There doesn＊t have to be a specific reason any longer.§IG is also trying the same trick with crackers 每 with versions for Halloween and Easter. Some of the crackers are designed in Wales but they are made at the company＊s factory in China from which it ships to 29 countries. Last year it imported 60m crackers to the UK 每 nearly one for every person in the country.And who writes the jokes? The company employs a network of freelancers, but anyone can contribute an idea. Even Fineman claims to have contributed a couple over the years, although he won＊t reveal what they are. Maybe it＊s the one about ※tinsel-itis§."															
"s Charles Dickens wrote of revolutionary France and Britain: ※It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.§ Economic conditions for the masses far lagged those of the aristocracy. Today＊s elites include bankers and politicians. The masses are disillusioned citizens voting their frustration. That dichotomy is the difference between what central banks say and what people feel.Last week, the  by a quarter point. The financial press applauded the start of a tightening phase as reflecting economic stability.This happened last year too. On 16 December 2015, the Fed also  by 25 basis points (0.25%). It forecast four rate hikes for 2016. We got one. The forecast is now three for 2017. If the past is prelude, we might get another one. For eight years, the Fed has institutionalised a policy of being wrong, on forecasting rate hikes, economic growth, and financial stability.That＊s why ※emergency measures§ to provide liquidity (to banks) became an eight-year strategy for providing artificial stimulus to banks and markets. Once the Fed initiated its 2008 zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) and quantitative easing programmes, they were exported globally. Central banks copied these policies and added regional flavour.Last year, Fed chair Janet Yellen anticipated ※gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy§ with a moderately-paced expansion of economic activity and strengthening of the labour market.This year, the federal open market committee (FOMC) assured: ※The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.§ According to Yellen, the Fed is acting ※under a cloud of uncertainty§. That＊s code for waiting for the other shoe to drop, on the markets or banks. The message is that rate hikes follow economic growth. But voting in the US and globally says something else.During the first presidential debate,  accused ※this Janet Yellen of the Fed§ of being ※political by keeping the interest rates at this level§. Establishment democrats that supported Hillary Clinton were enraged. They noted the real economy wasn＊t as bad as Trump made out. Yet Trump won. Not because his voters were racist, xenophobes (though some are), but because of prevalent economic anxieties of working class Americans, notably in the rust-belt states he swept.For all his bombastic bluster and , Trump＊s read of the population was correct. He captured its participation deficit 每 in stock market escalation, bank resurrections, and glorified reductions in headline unemployment figures. And the anger.From Brexit to Trump to trans-European anti-EU votes spanning Italy to eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Moldova) with a looming possibility of Geert Wilders winning the Netherlands＊ election in March, and Marine Le Pen in France, financial stability is a core issue.The average person might have no clue about the particulars of central bank policy fabricating speculative capital. But everyone is well aware that economic rewards floated to the banks and the wealthy. They are desperate for change. Grandiose promises act as immediate salves.Last year＊s Fed rate hike spurred a 10每20% stock market drop depending on the country. To compensate, the Bank of Japan introduced negative interest rate policy in January, and the European Central Bank in March. Both have extended their versions of quantitative easing since.Not to be outdone, and in a coincidental reaction to Brexit, Bank of England governor Mark Carney slashed rates in Britain from 0.50% to 0.25% in August. In October, despite skirmishes with prime minister Theresa May, he announced he would  covering the two-year article 50 period.If we see a repeat of last year＊s global reaction to the Fed＊s hike, the only major central bank with room to cut rates to zero will be the . That signals ZIRP coming to Britain, along with an even lower British pound. This would not help Britain＊s mounting job and economic woes any more than any of the other central banks＊ manoeuvres did in their countries. But Carney will say it will.Carney slashed capital requirements in July. He pressed banks to lend more to the real economy. But words aren＊t binding. Lenders will do what they have always done: act in their own interest.Over in the US, Trump selected a cadre of Wall Street and big business sympathisers for his court. They like cheap money. His campaign browbeating of Yellen fell flat given this rate hike. Having chaired Bill Clinton＊s council of economic advisers in the 1990s, she also happens to be his link to Clinton. He needs Yellen to go slow on the Fed rate hike gas pedal in order to keep banks and markets happy during his rule. In this Tale of Two Cities, there is only one Fed. Regardless of who is president and what party is in charge, the Fed acts on behalf of the banks and markets.Fed d谷j角 vu means it＊s the same of times. "															
"Donald Trump＊s decision to hand a key spot in his administration to a scholar known for his ※apocalyptic§ attacks on  is further proof the American billionaire is spoiling for a fight with Beijing, a Chinese newspaper has claimed.Peter Navarro, a prominent China hawk who has called Beijing ※the planet＊s most efficient assassin§ and a ※totally totalitarian§ state, was  on Wednesday.China＊s  but editorials in the country＊s Communist party-controlled press on Friday underlined the extent to which Navarro＊s rise has ruffled feathers in the Chinese capital. ※His appointment is another sign of the confrontational approach the incoming Trump administration seems intent on taking in relations with China,§ the China Daily, an English-language mouthpiece, wrote in . ※[This is] no laughing matter.§ The state-run newspaper said that before Trump＊s shock election it was possible to laugh off the ※apocalyptic language§ used against China by Navarro, the author of books called Death by China and The Coming China Wars. ※Now, however, there is real cause for concern,§ it added.   The Global Times, a nationalistic state-run tabloid also famed for its use of apocalyptic language, claimed Trump＊s pick had made conflict between the world＊s top two economies more likely. ※This is by no means a positive signal,§  urging Beijing to face up to the reality that Trump would take a ※hard-line attitude toward China§ by introducing ※reckless§ measures targeting Chinese companies.   ※[Beijing] must discard any illusions and make full preparations for any offensive move by the Trump government,§ the Global Times added, warning: ※The US can no longer push China around today.§Navarro, a 67-year-old professor from the University of California, Irvine, was part of Trump＊s team of advisers during his campaign, during which the Republican candidate accused Beijing of ※raping§ the .The China Daily described him as the ※mastermind§ behind Trump＊s repeated campaign trail attacks on Beijing. Navarro has blamed China＊s admittance into the World Trade Organisation in 2001 for decimating the US economy and destroying millions of jobs and has urged American consumers to boycott Chinese goods to avoid bankrolling what he describes as Beijing＊s increasing militarism.Orville Schell, the head of the centre on US-China relations at New York＊s Asia Society, said Navarro＊s appointment was a ※risky bargain§. ※The positive side is that it＊s a real signal that things are out of balance 每 which I think everybody agrees they are - in terms of trade and investment [between the US and China].§  ※The bad side of it is that China reacts often in a very neuralgic way to insults or things that they might take as an insult. And I can imagine they might view Navarro as something of a provocation.§ Schell said Navarro＊s appointment and  on issues including Taiwan and the South China Sea would have left Beijing off-balance. ※But of course when they get off-balance sometimes they get more pugnacious,§ he said.Navarro＊s appointment will fuel fears that Trump could spark a trade war with China by following through on  on his first day in office and slapping tariffs on Chinese imports. Cheng Dawei, a former trade adviser to Beijing,  she believed commerce ministry officials were currently ※quite busy§ devising ways of hitting back against any such measures. ※China is now preparing some weapons,§ said Cheng, an economics professor from Beijing＊s Renmin University. Tu Xinquan, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing,  US companies would pay ※a much heavier cost§ than Chinese ones for such a conflict.

"Britain faces a decade of disruption after  with low growth, stagnating incomes for the poor and the public finances at breaking point, according to a bleak analysis by a leading thinktank.The report, Britain in the 2020s, by , says Brexit will ※profoundly reshape the UK ＃ painful trade-offs are almost certain. Growth is expected to be lower, investment rates worse, and the public finances weaker as a result of Brexit.§The analysis, which draws on data from the OECD, the ONS and numerous economists and researchers, forecasts a 30% increase in the number of over-65s in the population by 2030, and a doubling of the number of over-85s. It predicts that the proportion of the population that is non-white will climb to more than one in five within 12 years.The world of work will be revolutionised with millions of jobs in retail and manufacturing disappearing as a result of automation and the internet, the report says.  will become more entrenched, as will the wealth gap between London and the rest of the country.By 2030 households will on average be ?1,700 worse off per year than they would have been if Britain had stayed in the EU, with a persistently falling currency driving up prices and hitting the living standards of poorer people the hardest, according to the report.Low-income households are predicted to see their earnings rise by just 2% between now and 2030, leaving them little better off than a generation before. Meanwhile, the average FTSE 100  is forecast to soar to ?9.5m by 2030 每 350 times the median income, up from a multiple of 144 today. The report＊s author, Mathew Lawrence, said the IPPR had taken a neutral position during the run-up to the EU referendum, and the report simply highlighted how Brexit would exacerbate challenges around inequality and  that the UK was already facing. New barriers to trade after Britain leaves the EU are likely to drive the  down and to increase costs, the report says. Government finances may buckle under the strain of NHS and pension spending as Britain ages and  reduces the tax base. The 65-plus population will rise to 15.4 million by 2030, from 11.6 million today, while the working-age population will rise by just 3%. The IPPR predicts a ?13bn shortfall in the funding of  alone by 2030 as the government struggles to finance care for elderly people in their homes. Pressure on schools, hospitals and infrastructure will also increase as Britain＊s population continues to grow rapidly despite a short-term post-Brexit reduction in EU migration. The report forecasts that the UK will have the fastest growing population of any major country in Europe, overtaking France＊s population by 2030 and Germany＊s in the late 2040s. The IPPR also predicts a more diverse country, with the non-white proportion rising from 14% in 2011 to 21% by 2030 and to more than a third of the population by 2050. Vast numbers of workers in the UK face losing their jobs as automation progresses, with the economy soon hitting ※peak human§ before robots and artificial intelligence take over, the IPPR argues. It forecasts that 2m jobs in retail will disappear by 2030 and 600,000 will go in manufacturing. Britain in the 2020s will continue to see a hollowing out of middle-income jobs, with large numbers of well-paid jobs in a few industries 每 largely in London and the south-east 每 offset by a growing precariat of poorly paid, often self-employed workers. ※There will be more self-employed workers in the 2020s than public sector employees,§ the report says. It says the rest of the world also faces a slowdown in economic growth, partly as population growth slows and partly because of climate change. It also forecasts crises for China. By 2030 the country will have 17 of the top 50 cities in the world ranked by GDP, but its rapidly ageing population, credit bubbles and political uncertainty will undermine its rise and ensure the US remains the dominant global power.Keir Starmer MP, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: ※This report shows once again the clear dangers of a hard Brexit and the importance of ensuring we get the best possible Brexit deal that protects jobs, the economy and living standards.※It also reminds us that there are wider and profound challenges facing the Britain in the years and decades to come - both to our economy, society and our place in the world.

"Expansion in British factories slowed a little in October as the weak pound boosted exports but also pushed the prices of imports sharply higher.In the latest  following  since the Brexit vote, manufacturers raised the price of their goods at the fastest rate in more than five years. The latest Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers＊ index) survey suggested that firms are starting to pass on higher import costs as the weak pound makes raw materials such as oil more expensive.However, the weak exchange rate also helped to boost orders from the US, the EU and China.The broader survey suggested the sector got off to a decent start in the fourth quarter. The headline index combining output, orders, and employment fell to 54.3 in October, from 55.5 in September, where anything above 50 signals expansion.Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit, and an author of the report, said the  should return to growth in the fourth quarter, after shrinking by 1% in the third.He added: ※On the positive side, the boost to competitiveness [from the weak pound] drove new export order inflows higher, providing a key support to output volumes.

"The new year brings with it new hope and optimism, a chance for a fresh start and an opportunity to reassess the way forward. Or at least that＊s the plan.On one hand, 2016 was a tough year because in many ways it felt as though the conversation about Australia＊s diversity became more polarised. Just talking about diversity in the public arena seemed to split people into opposing camps: for and against. But it wasn＊t bad when it came to my work at  (DCA) in helping businesses harness the benefits of diversity.More businesses adopted a  and many are introducing innovative diversity and inclusion programs, setting targets and identifying senior leaders to bring about change.

They reported an increase in the proportion of organisations that have a gender equality policy, have conducted a gender pay gap analysis and have a strategy for flexible working arrangements.But it＊s clear there is much more work to be done this year. Now, more than ever, we must work together to create a society that includes rather than divides.I was severely jolted out of my new year optimism in January when I read about the  from a site in Melbourne after threats were made to the company behind it.While acknowledging the very valid problems Australia Day presents for Indigenous Australians, it made me wonder what sort of people feel so intimidated by young children waving flags that they would threaten violence?This followed earlier  for its back-to-school catalogue, which featured a diverse range of models, including children with disabilities and from various cultural backgrounds. Many consumers supported the catalogue, but some took to Twitter to argue for a boycott.These kinds of vile and hateful reactions to attempts to be inclusive are nonsensical. Our society is not homogenous 每 it is incredibly diverse and getting more so.One in five Australians has a disability, and there is increasing religious diversity in the nation. Moreover, there is widespread cultural diversity. One in four of Australia＊s 24 million people were born overseas; 46% have at least one parent who was born overseas; and nearly 20% of Australians speak a language other than English at home.Advertising doesn＊t exist in a vacuum.

"Wouldn＊t today＊s economists be better served by reading some economics history rather than relying on their models (, 6 January)? JK Galbraith＊s classic  details the things that contribute to a volatile, overheating economy, and in the foreword to the recent reprint, his son James, also an economist, notes the uncanny similarities in the build-up to 2007-08 to those before October 1929, particularly mentioning America, Britain and Iceland. But how far can economists be of help when the model is flawed and we have a government that is determined to sweep away all vestiges of Keynesianism and New Dealism and return our economy to the 19th century? The reason economics is so poor at predicting is that it was never designed as a science in the first place. The origins of the discipline were as a political and ethical subject, and the founders were explicit about this. Indeed Alfred Marshall (who first fully developed supply and demand analysis) said a pure economic science was a waste of time. What contemporary orthodox economics has done is to patch together a variety of competing political economies, which is why it is contradictory and irrelevant, and is unable to explain why change occurs let alone predict it. It is presented as a science in order to justify largely laissez-faire policies.Most of the relevant concepts (including economic cycles) were initially developed as critiques of orthodox economics, and have been incorporated into the mainstream in a neutered form. This has left orthodox economics as a largely useless discipline.Developing new economic models will not help in the slightest. Many of the people who did predict the latest crisis did so using generic statistical techniques and/or their own experience, rather than orthodox economic models. Also it is not clear what the point of prediction is unless some reaction is proposed. If, as former US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan suggested, nothing much would be done differently, there seems little point in predicting. There is a long alternative tradition of political economy looking at social and political institutions such as law and power, which are far more realistic and promising avenues than altering a few variables in pointless models.  may be in crisis, but not because of the failure of economic forecasters precisely to anticipate the date of the financial crunch or the quantum of potential economic decline immediately following the EU referendum. This tendency to judge the success or failure of economic models by the above test of precision in forecasting is a cause of the crisis. The problem lies in the rejection of analysis which refuses to impart a spurious sense of precision to predictions arising out of that analysis. Those who expressed doubts about the potentially huge danger of deregulation, freeing speculators to create and gamble with financial derivatives which are priced by imputing spurious measures of risk, had been ignored for decades as failed Keynesians because they could not predict the precise date of any financial collapse.It would likewise be wrong to dismiss?the warning by those economists who refused to engage in precise forecasting before the referendum but expressed concern about economic policy being dictated by identity politics the likes of which have impoverished Europe in the past and now continue to hinder economic progress elsewhere, especially in poorer countries. Andy Haldane of the  rightly says ※economics is in crisis§. He then attributes the failure of economic forecasting to consumers behaving irrationally. By irrationally, economists mean not behaving in ways that fit in with their theories. In every other branch of endeavour, theories are tested and changed if they do not fit reality. In economics, which falsely claims to be a science, reality is supposed to fit the theories. The irrational ones are the economists who confuse their fairy tales with reality to such an extent that they did not just fail to see the 2008 crisis but said it could not happen. It is a bit rich to use the headline ※Economics in crisis§ just because the chief economist of the Bank of England points out that economic forecasters invariably get their forecasts wrong.  is not forecasting. It is a set of tools and techniques of analysis that millions of businesses and consumers, governments, and other decision-makers use every day to allocate resources and income in an optimal manner.Please do not exaggerate: economics is alive and well, even if the crystal ball fails. Simon Jenkins claims that ※Economists have completely failed us with their predictions§ (, theguardian.com, 6 January). In the physical sciences, experts are apparently aware that attempting to take measurements can interfere with the phenomenon that they seek to measure. Surely, the prediction of economic and financial consequences will have consequences. The predictions will cause players in the markets and those affected by consequences to take measures to exploit, mitigate or avert such consequences. The only way to assess the predictions of economic experts might be to keep them secret! Perhaps, what the economics experts require is a prediction strategy using double, triple, quadruple bluff with their true predictions kept in a sealed envelope. Andy Haldane identifies the 2008 financial crisis as the ※Michael Fish moment§ of the economics profession, and suggests that the economics profession needs to emulate the post-piscatorial improvement in weather forecasting. But elsewhere in his talk at the Institute for Government, Haldane explained why the forecasting of economic crises is inherently difficult: an easily forecasted crisis would be averted. Weather forecasting has improved since 1987 because of the use of hugely increased computing power and data; the underlying models of atmospheric physics are essentially unchanged. If the economics profession is to raise its game in understanding crises, it needs new thinking rather than more powerful computers and bigger data sets. Haldane＊s analogy points us in the wrong direction. Both Andy Haldane and Norwegian PM Erna Solberg (, theguardian.com, 5 January) touch on the point of a lack of skilled British economists able to handle a Brexit negotiation. The problem lays in the way economics is taught. Keynes stated that an economist must be a ※mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher§. Today, students only receive heavy doses of the mathmetician 每 trained in econometrics or else deemed unsuited to the field. Fortunately there are some institutions that deliver a more rounded curriculum that could create those much needed Brexit negotiators; unfortunately many sit in the EU.  is most certainly not in crisis. It is completely broken as it supports a model that assumes it is possible to obtain exponential growth of GDP in a world of finite resources, increasing population,climate change etc. Painful though it be to admit, it seems that Mr Gove was correct in his assessment of experts insofar as most economists are concerned. As economist (!) Ezra Solomon said: ※The only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.§"															
"t took the Queen to show that the emperor had no clothes. On a visit to the London School of Economics in November 2008, when a second Great Depression was looming large, she asked a simple but devastating question: Almost a decade later, the Queen might be tempted to lob another grenade at the economics fraternity: why did you get it wrong again about ?In fairness, the economics profession had its Cassandras in the run-up to the financial crisis and not all economists thought a vote to leave on 23 June meant instant Armageddon. Even so, it is a valid question. How can it be that the     not to mention the vast majority of academic economists, all predicted so confidently and yet so wrongly that the UK economy would plunge straight into a stonking great recession after a Brexit vote?On both occasions, economists have been guilty of groupthink. On both occasions they pretend to have forecasting powers that don＊t really exist. As the economist Paul Ormerod points out, in the short term it is nigh-on impossible to sort out genuine information from noise. who insisted there would be no hurricane on the eve of the biggest storm to hit southern England in living memory.Meteorology has moved on in the past three decades: the use of satellite technology has made forecasting more reliable. The same cannot be said of economic forecasting, which is no better now than it was half a century ago.The models, however sophisticated, don＊t work awfully well, particularly when big shocks occur. And that, of course, is when they are needed most. The ※great moderation§ 每 the period in the 1990s and 2000s when growth was steady and inflation low 每 lulled economists into a false sense of security.There are lessons to be learned. The past is not a reliable guide to the future. The consensus is not always right. Economic forecasting is not a hard science, even though it pretends that it is. The fallback position for those who said the sky would instantly fall in after the referendum is that they were right about everything apart from the timing. Armageddon has been postponed, not cancelled. The consensus is that in the long term there will be a sizable and permanent hit to the economy from Brexit, caused by a loss of trade and inward investment. The Treasury＊s central forecast is that the cost of leaving the EU is an economy that will be 6% smaller in 2030 than it would be under the status quo.Yet models are only as good as the information they process: garbage in equals garbage out. The garbage factor increases if forecasts are designed to serve a political end, as was the case with both sides during the referendum campaign.A new * shows that forecasting the medium to long term can be just as prone to error as forecasting the short term. Their argument is simple. Leaving the EU is a unique event. No other country has tried to do it. There is no past experience to draw on, which means that the best forecasters can do is construct ※a series of scenarios based on assumptions about future trading arrangements, migration controls and about the short-term uncertainties which could affect business investment in the run-up to the likely leaving date of 2019§.This is what the Treasury purportedly did in i, published last April. It concluded that leaving, but remaining a member of the single market, would carry a 3.8% of GDP cost after 15 years; leaving with a negotiated bilateral trade deal would cost 6.2%; while having access to the single market on the same terms as any other member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) would cost of 7.5% of GDP.The Treasury used what is known as gravity modelling to come to these conclusions. So do other forecasters, such as the IMF, which is why once they have all crunched the numbers they all come up with the same result.Gravity modelling is Newtonian physics adapted for economic forecasting. Just as the attraction between two heavenly bodies is directly proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them, so the volume of trade and the amount of foreign direct investment between two countries depends on how big and how geographically close they are.Using this approach, the Treasury says there would be a 43% loss of trade with the EU were the UK to revert to WTO rules, and because almost half the UK＊s trade is with the EU this would result in a 24% loss in total trade. The assumption is that there has been a 76% increase in UK trade as a result of membership of the EU and that all of these gains would be lost. There would be no gains in trade with non-EU countries to compensate for the loss.How plausible is this? Not very, according to the Cambridge economists. They note that the share of UK exports going to Europe peaked in the late 1980s and has been falling in recent years as a result of weak demand in the eurozone. EU external tariffs average only 3% and the Treasury forecasts take no account of movements in the exchange rate. The Cambridge paper estimates that the 15% drop in the value of sterling since the referendum would be enough to offset the impact of a 10% external tariff on cars, which perhaps explains why the government has been able to persuade Nissan to build a new model in Sunderland.The paper expresses similar doubts about the Treasury forecasts for inward investment, since they are heavily influenced by the wave of capital attracted by the ultra-cheap labour on offer in eastern Europe after the collapse of communism.Using different but still relatively pessimistic assumptions, the Cambridge study says the loss peaks at 3% of GDP early in the 2020s. The loss of GDP per head is smaller 每 never much more than 1% 每 and soon recovers.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, would do well to have a squint at the Cambridge paper, since its findings are much more in tune with the May government＊s view about how the economy will perform after Brexit. It will, of course, still be the same economy 每 warts and all."															
"Mark Carney can himself do far more to bring about his desire for the rebalancing of the economy to help the ※left behind§ (, 6?December). In August the Bank of England announced a further ?60bn of its quantitative easing programme, taking the total of e-printed money to ?435bn, the equivalent of nearly ?7,000 for every man, woman and child in the country.Instead of using this staggering amount of money to prop up the banks and inflate stock markets, property and other assets, the new ?60bn of QE should be used to buy bonds from a national investment bank and from local authorities to generate a ※jobs in every constituency§ programme. This would give all people, not just the left behind, a sense of hope about their economic future and should involve decentralised infrastructure projects centred on a decades-long, multi-skilled programme of energy refits of all the nation＊s 30?million dwellings, a shift to localised renewable energy, and a rebuilding of local transport, food and flood defence systems.Such an approach is technically feasible, and  that, if the government requested it, then the next round of QE could be used to buy assets other than government debt. It＊s time he and the government worked together to achieve this jobs-everywhere approach, and in doing so really tackle the economic insecurity that is pure oxygen for the extreme right. Mark Carney says that ※rather than a new golden era, globalisation is associated with low wages, insecure employment, stateless corporations and striking inequalities§. Absolutely right, but Mr Carney is reminiscent of the driver of the biggest truck in a traffic jam complaining about the traffic. He is (part of) the problem and he offers no solutions. The idea that free-trade capitalism will somehow become more egalitarian is fanciful and is not supported by any historical evidence.An uncomfortable question for the remain camp is whether Mr Carney would even be saying such things, let alone doing anything about them, had Brexit and Trump not won. The left needs to realign, and quickly, to promote fair trade, not so-called free-trade, and the free movement of labour based upon talent and need, not upon the undercutting of wages. It is a depressing yet sadly unsurprising reality that half of people in poverty have a disability or live with someone who does (, 7?December). Despite our improving economy, the financial squeeze on disabled people continues to bite. Most people don＊t realise that life is much more expensive if you are disabled.From buying a wheelchair and higher energy bills to having to spend more on taxis and insurance, disabled people and their families face extra costs in all areas of life. Disabled people tell us they struggle to heat their homes and are falling in to debt. such as disability living allowance and personal independence payment play an important role in helping disabled people to meet their extra costs. It is vital that government continues to protect the value of these payments. Businesses and government also need to take action to drive down the additional costs disabled people face for essential goods and services. Two recent articles offer very different verdicts on the idea of a citizen＊s or basic income: an unconditional income for every individual. Gaby Hinsliff (, 25 November) thinks that a basic income sends the wrong message about employment. It does not. It＊s the current means-tested benefits system that does that, by imposing deduction rates of up to 96% on additional earned income as tax is paid, and benefits, including tax credits, are withdrawn. No financially feasible basic income would disincentivise employment, but, as a , a basic income could take a lot of households off means-tested benefits, offering them far more incentive to seek new skills, seek additional employment or start a new career. (See , ISER, June 2016.)Matthew d＊Ancona (, 28 November) suggests that job-destroying automation will compel the state to pay a basic income. Automation can create employment as well as destroy it, so we don＊t know what the employment market of the future will look like. What we do know is that employment is increasingly diverse and insecure. There is nothing wrong with an increasingly flexible employment market, provided households have a secure financial platform on which to build an appropriate mixture of employment, self-employment and new businesses. The current tax and benefits system can＊t provide that. A basic income could. Theresa May looked fabulous in her leather trousers and, with the price of turkey these days, goose may be a sensible financial option for Christmas dinner (, 7 December); but you are missing the point. The PM turned 60 in October. She, surely, is the poster girl for those who moved the pension goalposts so thousands of women of the same age now have to wait until they are 66 and 67 to receive their state pension. Mrs May will be fine, of course; not so the rest I fear 每 even if they look younger than their years and dress well. Who wants to employ them? Many have been pushed out of their jobs through redundancy, lack of training for the digital world, ageism or budget cuts, yet they are vastly overqualified for, say, retail sales, hospitality and admin, and cannot get a serious look-in with HR. I wonder how many of the unemployed are women over 60? There＊s a more worthy story for you＃"															
"Britain＊s strength in the digital economy means it is one of the countries best placed to take advantage of the shift away from capital-intensive industry, according to an international survey of more than 150 countries.A study looking at the nations that would thrive in coming decades was dominated by Scandinavian countries. However, the UK was ranked as the highest-placed member of the G8 leading industrial countries, in fifth position.Sweden led the league table dominated by European nations published by , a platform created by LetterOne, chaired by the former Russian oil magnate Mikhail Fridman. The Indigo Index has been designed to look at the way in which factors such as education, technological knowhow, history and politics will shape economic performance.Behind Sweden were Switzerland, Finland, Denmark, the UK, the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, Ireland and Japan. The United States ranked 18th, with the four big emerging nations known as the Brics well down the list. Brazil was 45th, Russia 51st, China 65th and India 77th.Manufacturing has shrunk as a proportion of the UK economy in recent years and output is  than it was at the time the economy went into recession in 2008. But the Global Perspectives report said economic success in the future would depend less on whether countries were well endowed with natural resources and had invested in capital-intensive industries. Instead, it said the new era would be dominated by those countries that score heavily for human and creative capital.Using data from sources such as the World Bank, Unesco and Harvard University, the study ranked 152 countries according to how well they scored in five categories: creativity and innovation, economic diversity, digital economy, freedom, and stability and legal frameworks. The UK＊s highest scores were for economic diversity (3rd) and its digital economy (4th).Fridman said: ※We believe the countries that are best placed to thrive and prosper in the coming decades will be those who have the socio-economic infrastructure that allows every person to realise his or her intellectual and creative potential.§"															
"onald Trump＊s determination to stamp his mark on US trade policy ※would be horribly destructive§, according to the most exhaustive assessment of his pre-election tweets, speeches and declarations in Fox News interviews.Among the more consistent themes in his various pronouncements, the president-elect said he would tear up the  to US markets on about half of its goods.Trump also threatened , which he said could be as much as 35%, to punish the Beijing for a policy of ※currency manipulation§.The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, president Obama＊s hard-won free trade agreement with Japan, Australia and much of the Pacific rim, which lowers tariffs on a wide range of goods, will be thrown in the Oval Office bin, if a Trump  in the first 100 days is anything to go by.The Peterson Institute, a non-partisan thinktank in Washington, said in its September report  that the sum of all these moves would bring the US recovery to a juddering halt, and possibly plunge it into recession.The institute＊s chairman, Adam Posen, a former Bank of England policymaker, said in his foreword to the report: ※The belligerent trade policies proposed by Trump would devastate viable American businesses and their vicinities.§But as the inauguration nears, it looks like the doomsday scenario put forward not just by Posen, but also in the pages of ,  and much of the US media, can be put on ice.Just as Trump is turning his attention away from prosecuting Hillary Clinton, so a trade war with the Chinese and Mexicans is no longer a priority.Of the three main threats to trade, only axing the TPP agreement looks likely to happen, since it has yet to be ratified by Congress and remains, like the Paris climate deal, a White House policy, not a US policy.Marcus Noland, an author of the Peterson Institute report, says signals from the Trump camp indicate he has also shelved his threatened war on China and Japan while he focuses on domestic concerns.That will be a relief to the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which have spent the last couple of years wringing their hands over a sharp decline in trade.In October, the IMF said the sum of trade across the world had grown by just over 3% per year since 2012, less than half the average rate of expansion during the previous three decades.※The slowdown in trade growth is remarkable, especially when set against the historical relationship between growth in trade and global economic activity. Between 1985 and 2007, real world trade grew on average twice as fast as global GDP, whereas over the past four years it has barely kept pace. Such prolonged sluggish growth in trade volumes relative to economic activity has few historical precedents during the past five decades.§In a barely disguised attack on Trump and fellow protectionists, it warned leaders to put more effort into mitigating the effects of globalisation. ※An increasingly popular narrative that sees the benefits of globalisation and trade accrue only to a fortunate few is also gaining traction. Policymakers need to address the concerns of trade-affected workers, including effective support for retraining, skill building and occupational and geographic mobility, to mitigate the downsides of further trade integration for the trade agenda to revive.§Noland says Trump＊s first term could still be scarred by battles with China.※Let＊s say the president wins approval from the Republican-dominated Congress for a large fiscal stimulus with a mixture of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. If this boom sucks in more imports and increases the balance of payments deficit, as everyone expects, Trump will come under renewed pressure to act,§ he said. ※This could be a couple of years down the line, but would mean him pursuing all the protectionist threats he made in the campaign.§Swati Dhingra, a trade specialist at the London School of Economics＊ Centre for Economic Performance, says there could be some easy wins for Trump if he needs them. ※The Nafta agreement has an inbuilt annual renegotiation clause, so there is the potential for the president to secure changes to tariffs with Canada and Mexico without throwing out the whole thing,§ she says.※But it＊s scary when Trump starts to attack China. Who knows how bad things will get if he imposes tariffs against World Trade Organisation rules.§China could appeal against them to the WTO board, though Trump has said he would quit the WTO rather than step back from a fight.A more likely reaction from Beijing would be tit-for-tat tariffs. The , a newspaper seen by many as a vehicle for the Chinese leadership to float ideas and respond to sensitive political issues, said earlier this month that China could easily favour Airbus over Boeing when it buys aircraft.※US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US,§ it said.President Obama has already been down this road. Not long after he took office, he imposed a 35% import tariff on Chinese tyres to protect Firestone and other domestic suppliers. But one study estimated it saved a maximum 1,200 jobs and cost US consumers $1.1bn in higher prices. In addition, China reacted by slapping tariffs on US chicken and car parts, costing US businesses millions of dollars in lost revenue.Worse, the  was growing strongly and adding jobs in the tyre industry, so the 1,200 jobs were probably in the pipeline anyway.Mitt Romney, the Republican＊s losing presidential candidate in 2012, was damning in his criticism of Obama and the way he allowed auto workers to bully him into raising protectionist tariffs.The former Massachusetts governor will need to eat his words should he become  and join an administration only too keen to upset free trade advocates. But then he will need to apologise for calling Trump a fraud and a phoney during the campaign, so maybe ditching his free-trade principles will be the least of his worries. The  (TPP) would cut tariffs and deepen economic ties between the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Mexico, Peru and Chile. It also aims to simplify regulations and copyright laws so that member countries would have a more or less unified system. Overall, more than 18,000 tariffs would be affected, and though some will take more than 10 years to disappear, the result could be a new single market, similar to the European Union, with the current signatories comprising about 40% of the global economy.Opinion is divided over success of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a deal between Mexico, Canada and the US signed by Bill Clinton in 1994.  say it meant millions of poor Mexicans became servants of a northern power that exported its 2008 financial crisis and not much else. Supporters say it bolstered the rule of law, and kept democracy afloat and the generals and dictators at bay. Maintaining strong links with the US is a top priority for the Mexican government. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is a series of negotiations between the EU and US that aims to cut tariffs on everything from cars to beef. It is a bigger version of the TPP: the US wanted agriculture and financial services included.  following a rebellion by German MPs and disquiet in France over the use of secret courts to resolve trade disputes. Critics say the courts allow large, mainly US multinationals to sue governments when policy changes hit their profits. Trump, however, believes it will favour EU companies and undermine US jobs, so it is probably dead, rather than on hold.The is a mini-me deal between Canada and the EU that was supposed to pave the way for the much bigger TTIP, but now it looks like being the only scheme for lower tariffs with another country to secure approval in Brussels. It must now be ratified by all 28 members of the EU, including Britain, though Theresa May could well abstain."															
"British businesses continued to invest and consumers carried on spending in the months following the  vote, defying predictions that a wave of uncertainty would hit economic activity.In the first official estimate of how firms＊ spending fared after the referendum, the Office for National Statistics said  in the July-to-September quarter. That was only a small slowdown from 1% growth in the previous quarter and beat forecasts for 0.6% growth in a Reuters poll of economists. The figures echoed business surveys suggesting .The ONS confirmed its earlier estimate that , only a small slowdown from 0.7% growth in the second quarter and stronger than most economists had predicted in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result. But there were warnings the brunt of the Brexit vote would be felt next year as the weak pound stokes inflation and as negotiations over leaving the EU begin.Providing more details of the third quarter in Friday＊s update, statisticians said consumer spending continued to be the main driver of economic growth, fuelled by rising household incomes. There was also a contribution to growth from net trade 每 the difference between what the UK exports and imports. That came as imports fell but exports grew, probably helped by the weakness of the pound since the Brexit vote, which makes UK goods more competitive in overseas markets.But the data also confirmed earlier estimates showing that the construction sector had fallen into a technical recession, contracting for two straight quarters, while output was down for manufacturers and the wider industrial sector.The ONS said that since the referendum in June, GDP growth had been in line with recent trends, suggesting ※limited effect so far§ from the referendum.Darren Morgan, head of GDP at the ONS said:※Investment by businesses held up well in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, though it＊s likely most of those investment decisions were taken before polling day. ※That, coupled with growing consumer spending fuelled by rising household income, and a strong performance in the dominant service industries, kept the economy expanding broadly in line with its historic average.§ Economists were quick to warn the recent pace of growth would be hard to sustain. The government＊s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility, predict  as business investment slows and as incomes are squeezed by higher living costs. Inflation is expected to pick up because the weaker pound makes imports to the UK more expensive.The data company IHS Markit said its surveys pointed to the firms＊ and households＊ resilience continuing into the final quarter of this year. But it too was cautious about the year ahead.※For the moment, the data suggest that the economy has exhibited greater than anticipated resilience in the face of headwinds such as Brexit worries and rising prices. However, it seems likely that growth will slow further in coming months as these headwinds intensify,§ said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.Ruth Gregory at the consultancy Capital  said importers and retailers would likely absorb some of the increase in costs from the weak pound, ensuring that the squeeze on household incomes is not too intense. Low interest rates would also help support consumers, she said.※With ultra-accommodative monetary policy continuing to support spending and discourage saving, we don＊t think a sharp slowdown in spending is on the cards.§A leading thinktank warned this week that the combination of rising inflation and weaker pay growth as Brexit unfolds will mean . The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the recovery in real wages 每 pay adjusted for inflation 每 will now be so slow that by 2021 they will still not be back to their 2008 level before the global financial crisis hit.For now, however, the ONS figures showed consumers remained the biggest driving force behind GDP growth. Household spending rose 0.7% in the third quarter, down only slightly from 0.9% growth in the second quarter. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at the bank Berenberg said: ※Rather than postponing spending decisions amid the heightened uncertainty following the Brexit vote, good fundamentals 每 a strong labour market, rising house prices and improving credit conditions 每 supported a continued expansion in household spending.§"															
"he slow economic strangulation of millions of Britons started long before the vote to leave the European Union this year. It was first felt when austerity wrapped its long fingers around public spending. But it all began with the Great Crash in 2008. Cataclysmic events have contributed to desolate times for workers for many years ahead. The Institute for Fiscal Studies＊ finding that after this week＊s autumn statement , as the workforce suffers the worst decade for pay in at least seven decades, should ring alarm bells. The reasons are now well known: lower business investment, scared off by Brexit uncertainty, will result in lower productivity and sink wage growth. The drop in sterling, sparked by the fears of Britain＊s departure from the continent, has pushed up inflation. Real wages will flatline next year and looming benefit cuts will squeeze living standards. The thinktank pointed out that by 2021 real GDP per household will be ?1,000 lower than expected only months ago, back in March.This points to a dark time ahead for a country already split over attitudes to Europe and polarised by political forces once considered on the fringe, but now firmly in the mainstream. : while the over-60s saw their incomes rise 11% until 2014, British workers aged between 22 and 30 saw median wages fall 7%. The tax and benefit changes, modelled by the IFS, reveal that over the next five years the top 30% of earners will benefit; the bottom 70% will lose out. The government＊s plan to raise the new minimum wage for over 25s 每 to ?9 an hour by 2020 每 has been .The Conservative party has changed its attitude to borrowing. It is now content to saddle the country . What Conservatives have not done is think again about redistribution. They need to. Rising living standards are a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for a happier society. When there＊s less to go round, more anxious and fractious voices are raised. But if the rich just get richer while the poor keep getting poorer, society can retreat into rigidity and intolerance. Once enough voters lose the sense they are getting ahead and wealth is being sucked up by a tiny elite, trouble lies ahead. Populists will trade on such fears. Mainstream politicians must understand they have a chance to stop them 每 but only by sharing wealth and opportunity."															
"Philip Hammond has set aside up to ?412m of additional funding to help Whitehall deal with leaving the  following criticisms that the civil service cannot cope with Brexit.The chancellor＊s autumn statement said that the Department for Exiting the EU, or Dexeu, will receive ?51m this financial year and an extra ?94m from 2017/2018 until the UK＊s exit is complete. Additional resources of ?26m each year by 2019/20 will be provided to Liam Fox＊s Department for International Trade and the Foreign Office.It follows concerns from  that Whitehall does not have the staff or the skills to cope with the volume of work necessary to ensure that Britain leaves the EU.The top civil servants＊ union said that the money would do little to ease the problems because of impending cuts of 18% that were announced in 2015 by the then chancellor George Osborne. Dave Penman, head of the civil servants union, the FDA, said: ※With no additional funding, departments will once again be asked to deliver ever more with ever less.§Whitehall currently has a shortage of trade experts. Civil servants have not handled trade negotiations directly for 40 years because these were negotiated by the EU.Extra money to Fox＊s department will take its budget to just over ?400m a year when combined with resources moved to the new department from UK Trade and Investment and the old business department. Budgets for other departments will not change, as the chancellor announced that the 2015 plans would remain in place. The Institute for Government, the Whitehall thinktank, said it was too soon to say whether the additional money would help Whitehall prepare for Brexit as the government had not yet explained how  negotiations will be approached or what resource will be required.※The government still has a huge number of commitments to deliver on top of Brexit. Despite emergency funding for prisons, today we saw  of how the chancellor will address the ticking time-bomb in other public services, like health and social care,§ a spokesperson said. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service under David Cameron added to recent warnings that Whitehall was not sufficiently equipped to cope with the extra demands of leaving the EU.It comes after a  suggesting an extra 30,000 people could have to be hired to deal with the additional work."															
"Business leaders have told the government it must convert a new ?23bn productivity investment fund into ※tarmac, tracks and telecoms§ rapidly if it wants to boost Britain＊s lagging productivity and economic growth. The private sector has become increasingly frustrated at a string of unfulfilled pledges by the government 每 primarily by the former chancellor George Osborne 每 to step up investment in British infrastructure.Philip Hammond, Osborne＊s successor, announced in the a national productivity investment fund that will be launched in an attempt to boost productivity by investing in innovation and infrastructure.The fund, to be financed by extra borrowing, will oversee ?23bn of spending over the next five years. Some of the expenditure has already been allocated to specific areas: ?7.2bn on building new homes; ?4.7bn on science and innovation; ?2.6bn on modernising roads, building infrastructure for electric vehicles and supporting railways; and ?700m on high-speed fibre broadband and 5G services.The announcement was broadly welcomed as a way to kickstart much-needed improvements in infrastructure across the country. However, there are major concerns about how the fund will be run, which projects will be backed, and how other proposals in the autumn statement 每 such as the restrictions on  每 could damage productivity.Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of business lobby group the CBI, said Hammond had ※prioritised a pragmatic downpayment on future productivity growth§, but added: ※These measures must now be translated into action. That means tarmac, tracks and telecoms being laid, and clear, deliverable timetables for major projects. Only then will they act as a catalyst for investment, jobs and growth.§The autumn statement document says the specific projects to be funded will be decided in ※due course, using value for money assessments, following HM Treasury standards§. It adds: ※Where relevant, expert sector bodies such as Highways England, the Homes and Communities Agency and UK Research and Innovation will make this assessment.§ The national infrastructure commission has also been set up to advise the government on long-term investments and make recommendations.However, ?7bn of the ?23bn fund remains unallocated to any sector and is not scheduled to be spent until 2021-2022. The government said the fund would take total spending on housing, economic infrastructure and research and development to ?170bn over the next five years. But the size of the fund is dwarfed by the government＊s commitment to the  rail line, which will cost an estimated ?56bn.Christopher Mahon, investment manager at asset management firm Barings, said the chancellor＊s infrastructure plan is ※upside-down§ with ※eye-watering sums§ committed to HS2, a third runway at Heathrow airport and Hinkley Point C. The final two projects will be built using private sector funds, although they are .※Meanwhile only token amounts of money are being spent on practical projects that are needed today, such as easing rail and road bottlenecks,§ Mahon said. ※For example, the ?2bn announced today [for transport] is 50 times smaller than the amounts committed to the three mega projects alone. This is despite the Treasury＊s own analysis showing these smaller, less glamorous projects give the bigger payback to the taxpayer. So it is a great shame that the chancellor continues to be seduced by the glamour of the mega and ignores the utility and timeliness of the micro.※Britain seems to be locked into a type of topsy turvy spending dogma which results in the UK＊s well-known productivity stagnation.§Critics also claimed the government＊s ambition of boosting productivity could be undermined by other measures in the autumn statement. For example, JLT, the insurer, said restrictions on salary sacrifice schemes and an increase in the insurance premium tax would hit employees and hurt companies that try to reward strong performances. Mark Pemberthy, director of JLT employee benefits, said: ※It is ironic that in an autumn statement which is targeting productivity, some of the incentives that employers use to raise productivity and engage their workforce have been made less affordable.§Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said the government could have done more to encourage businesses to invest, which would also boost productivity. He said: ※The chancellor＊s attempts to increase productivity by investing in transport infrastructure, broadband and housing are welcome, but businesses would also have liked to have seen measures to encourage them to invest now. ※The OBR predicts that next year will be the low point for growth, so we are surprised that amidst all of the political and economic uncertainty there weren＊t many measures to help ＆just managing＊ businesses now.§Paul Dossett, partner at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, added: ※Infrastructure is important but building roads and bridges will not solve the productivity problem alone. ※Instead, we need to start at school, build aspirations and community involvement, and focus on measures that will improve not only economic prosperity but increase the health, happiness and wellbeing of the population.§"															
"Theresa May＊s hopes of a post-Brexit trade deal with  suffered a hammer blow from Delhi as the prime minister prepared to make her first official visit to the country.A spokesman for India＊s minister of external affairs suggested that a policy brought in by May as home secretary restricting the right of Indian students to stay in the UK after graduation could prove to be a block on any progress.Before her first bilateral visit outside Europe on Sunday, taking 33 business representatives to India, May said she wished to ※reboot§ the relationship between the two countries. ※The UK and India are natural partners 每 the world＊s oldest democracy and the world＊s largest democracy 每 and together I believe we can achieve great things 每 delivering jobs and skills, developing new technologies and improving our cities, tackling terrorism and climate change,§ she said.However the Indian government spokesman, Vikas Swarup, told the  that May faced tough questions when she arrived in Delhi on immigration and mobility for Indian students and workers in the UK.※Indian students and people-to-people relations are important pillars of India-UK ties,§ he said. ※In the last five years or so, the number of Indian students enrolling in UK universities has gone down by almost 50%; from around 40,000 to about 20,000 now. This has happened because of restrictions on post-study stay in the UK.※We will continue to raise our concerns regarding mobility with the UK. Mobility of people is closely linked to free flow of finance, goods and services.§The comments came as the former business secretary, Vince Cable, claimed that May＊s relations with India would be a major block to making progress on any UK-India deal. He said: ※The chances of them getting anything out of India are pretty remote pending a complete volte-faceon immigration and visas.§The former Liberal Democrat MP said that among a series of policy decisions by the Home Office, May＊s refusal to allow greater access to the UK for skilled Indian workers, in particular, ※screwed up§ chances of an EU-India trade deal. He said: ※When I was secretary of state I was involved in trying to negotiate the EU-India trade agreement, which didn＊t get very far. This myth has been created that we are not able to make progress on deals because of Wallonia or Slovenia. In this particular case, the problem was Britain.※May in particular was very obstructive of any attempt to make a genuine generous concession, and that was one of the things that screwed up the negotiation.§In 2010, when she was home secretary, May scrapped the post-study work visa, which allowed foreign students a two-year work permit in the UK after completing a course at a British university. Indian students now find it difficult even to get internships or part-time work while they study in the UK.In 2013 May tried to introduce a controversial ※visa bond§ scheme for foreign students from six African and Asian countries, of which India was the biggest, to prevent ※high-risk§ students staying in the UK after their work permits expired. The scheme, which was not introduced in the end, caused widespread outrage among Indian students at the time and Cable said it was ※remembered§ by Indian politicians.May is travelling to India with 30 ?British businesses, including small- and medium-sized enterprises from every region of the country. A series of commercial deals were expected to be sealed during the visit, delivering 1,370 UK jobs, Downing Street said.May and the Indian prime minister,  are due to meet on Monday afternoon for more than two hours of talks on trade, investment, defence and security. Downing Street said May wanted to break down existing trade and investment barriers, and secure agreement to talks that would pave the way for a bilateral trade arrangement once the UK had left the EU. The PM will be accompanied by international trade secretary Liam Fox and trade minister Greg Hands.Before the visit, May said: ※This is a partnership about our shared security and shared prosperity. It is a partnership of potential. I intend to harness that potential, rebooting an age-old relationship in this age of opportunity and with that helping to build a better Britain.§But Shashi Tharoor, chairman of India＊s parliamentary standing committee on external affairs, said May＊s anti-immigrant policies were ※detrimental§ to relations between the UK and India.He said: ※I do believe it is as much in Britain＊s interests to attract Indian students as it is in India＊s interests for our students to study there.※The Indian government should ask why this is happening, and whether the withdrawal of the welcome mat sends a broader signal, intended or otherwise, to other Indians.§※The hope and expectation is that most of the students will return to India with enhanced skills and knowledge, whereas emigrants are lost to India altogether, which gives the Indian government no reason to encourage their departure.※But again, the broader question is whether these anti-immigrant policies signify an anti-Indian stance which would have broader implications for the relations between the two peoples,§ he said."															
"e＊d come to praise the economy. But while he was there he might as well also bury it. They didn＊t call him Phil ※The Undertaker§ Hammond for nothing. This was to be the Undertaker＊s last spring budget. Just as well, as he didn＊t really have anything much to say. Not that it would stop him from taking his time in not saying it. Seldom has a chancellor been on his feet for so long and said so little.With prime minister＊s questions over, the Undertaker lurched towards the dispatch box. ※The economy has shown robust growth, the deficit is down and the labour market is strong,§ he said. At this point, he paused and scratched his head. If everything was going so well, why the hell was the country leaving the EU? Best not to ask that sort of question. Way too far above his pay grade. If the country wanted to bury itself, the least he could do was give it a proper send-off.※We can＊t rest on our past achievements,§ the Undertaker went on. No one could argue with that, as there hadn＊t been many to rest on. The growth forecasts might have been better than last autumn but they were still well down on this time the previous year. Ten minutes in and with nothing of any interest said, a few heads started to go down on the Tory benches.Time for a gag. The bereaved always appreciated a little humour. Nothing too funny, mind. No danger of that. ※The last Labour government,§ he said. ※They don＊t call it the last Labour government for nothing,§ he explained. Theresa May squeezed out a forced laugh. The Undertaker beamed with pleasure. He hadn＊t had that good a reaction since his double cremation gag in Croydon back in 1998.The Undertaker droned on. And on. He liked the sound of his own voice even if no one else did. A funeral address had never been so funereal. Never before had the rich paid so much in tax. The Tory backbenchers didn＊t look entirely pleased by that, but the Undertaker was quick to reassure them. Think about it this way: the rich had been earning more and more while everyone else was going broke. A celebration of inequality.. He supposed he had better say something even though there wasn＊t much to say. Who cared if a few old people croaked? More work for funeral directors. Every cloud and all that ... Sure he＊d bung them an extra ?2bn. But only over three years. It wasn＊t nearly enough but the opposition was too feeble to do anything about it. Besides, it would serve the country right. A hard Brexit was a gonna fall and the body count would rise.But the Undertaker was damned if he was going to pay for other people＊s funeral costs. The self-employed could pay for the social care bill. It＊s about time those freeloaders paid their fair share of national insurance contributions. Theresa urgently tapped him on the shoulder. ※Psst,§ she said. ※We promised not to increase NICs at the last election.§ The Undertaker picked up a copy of the manifesto and crossed out the relevant section. Sorted.And that was it. Everything was pretty much as expected. Wage increases were offset by cuts to in-work benefits and rising inflation. The continuous beep of the cardiograph was music to his ears. The country was flatlining. As was the Commons after 50 minutes of nothingness. One last gag and he was done. One day we might have driverless cars, he observed. ※And the party opposite knows all about being driverless.§ Some MPs nearly laughed. It was a toss-up whether they would rather be in a car with no driver or a hearse being driven by a dozy funeral director.Responding to a budget is one of the toughest gigs of the parliamentary year and most opposition leaders hastily scribble a few notes while the chancellor is on his feet.  made none. He had his speech already written and he was determined to stick to the script. Only it was more of a rant than a speech.※This was a budget of utter complacency,§ he shouted, his voicing ramping up to volume 11, ※utter complacency about the crisis facing our public services ... § The louder he shouted about the evils of the Tories without bothering to address a single issue raised by the chancellor, the less anyone was inclined to listen.Corbyn didn＊t even appear to have clocked that the chancellor had broken an election pledge. Rather, it was a deranged kamikaze attack in which the Labour leader was the only fatality. Still, it was an achievement of sorts. It＊s not every day that someone manages to empty the chamber faster than the Undertaker."															
"all Street is making some big bets on Donald Trump. One of the biggest is that the US president can persuade Congress to  that he believes ties the financial services industry in knots. Bank shares have carried the US stock market higher ever since Trump said it was a priority.Another big bet is on a Trump-inspired spending spree by , including the Mexican wall and on the military. This bet gets a steroid boost when traders add in the impact of huge tax cuts, albeit for the richest, trade tariffs on imports (protecting smaller US firms from competition) and a supposedly benign form of blackmail targeting major corporations that consider opening factories abroad (forcing them to locate inside the US).All these initiatives add up to the greatest economic stimulus since Ronald Reagan blew the US federal budget in the early 1980s and sent the stock market into the stratosphere.With what appears to be devil-may-care abandon, investors have moved their savings out of cash and into risky assets on a huge scale. The  (it was worth 15,660 this time last year). In tandem, investors have expanded their lending to the corporate sector to embrace some of the riskiest businesses. These are companies that are usually forced to borrow money at sky-high interest rates after analysts have looked them up and down and agreed that they are at the greatest risk of going bust. It means the bonds they issue to investors fall well below the AAA ratings given to the safest businesses. Charmingly,  and their bonds are rated CCC or less.But in the middle of a Trumpian boom, who cares about ratings? Nothing and nobody is going to go bust. There will be employment for everyone and, if there isn＊t, the deregulated banks will lend struggling households and businesses some more money.Figures this week show borrowings by CCC-rated companies have increased by two-thirds in the past year.There will be many on Wall Street who say: what could be better than even the most conservative investors entering the $2.2tn (?1.75tn) junk bond market? Except we know that when this happens, it is a house of cards that will collapse with horrible consequences for all.To emphasise the point, there are even early signs of junk-rated businesses using cheap lending facilities to borrow more money and use it to enrich their private equity owners, a move that evokes the worst behaviour before the 2008 crash. Thankfully, the betting must be that only a few investors get hurt in the stampede, the reason being that Congress simply will not allow Trump to pursue his crazy spending plans and mania for deregulation. Trump needs to win over eight Democrats in the Senate to push through his controversial agenda and that looks increasingly unlikely as he goes about his daily routine of upsetting even moderate Republicans with his attacks on the judiciary and anyone else who stands in his way.And while he can probably secure a majority for some extra military spending and a little extra infrastructure, these things take years to result in more ships and new motorway building. So we must hope that investors rein in their search for yield and take a more sober view of the bonanza they believe lies on the horizon. It is a mirage.As protesters take to the streets of Athens, the blame game among those who have imposed debilitating austerity on Greece is hotting up. The International Monetary Fund aimed the first punch, arguing that the beleaguered nation had taken enough punishment. The IMF is reluctant to support the European Union＊s stance on  without a huge debt-relief package in place.In the opposite corner is the official who manages the Brussels credit card, Klaus Regling. He has ruled out debt relief, saying the solution for Greece lies in the government making further cuts in pensions and benefits.This untenable position, which ignores 25% unemployment and endemic corruption, was then undermined further by a simple untruth. Writing in the Financial Times, he said: ※The eurozone＊s rescue funds have disbursed 174bn to Greece. We would not have lent this amount if we did not think we would get our money back.§There is no way the Greeks will ever pay that money back. It will just hang over them forever while they struggle to pay the interest and sink further into the mire."
