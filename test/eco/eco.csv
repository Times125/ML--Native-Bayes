"he  governor, Mark Carney, needs to look no further than the pay of his own staff to figure out why 每 when he believes we＊re on the verge of a pay boom 每 most people＊s wage rises are stuck in first gear. The Bank  last week with low-paid staff that had become so toxic inside Threadneedle Street that even the pink-jacketed, top-hatted front-of-house greeters had joined their colleagues in the maintenance section and other blue-collar roles by downing tools.Carney had offered a 1% pay rise in line with the public sector pay cap. He took a tough line, even though the Bank is not seen as part of the public sector. And he held the line with only a few minor concessions. A little extra money was promised to a handful of the very lowest paid, a little extra holiday entitlement was also part of the modest package, and there was a pledge to include the union in future pay talks from the start.The 1% pay cap remains in place. And why wouldn＊t it when fewer than 100 of the Bank＊s 4,000 employees felt aggrieved enough to go on strike? They were angry enough to protest for three days before the dispute ran out of steam.A longer strike was never on the cards; it is a sad fact that workers have such little power in Britain today. The railway workers might use their muscle should they embark on a winter of disputes over driverless trains, but elsewhere workers face draconian employment laws that make them among the most flexible in the world when it comes to how and when they work. That＊s not how the Bank reads the broader economy. It disregards the dispute under its nose and believes that 3%-plus pay growth is around the corner. Listening to the speeches of some policymakers, anyone would think that with unemployment at a 40-year low of 4.4% in June, the workers would have taken their dispute to the wire and, without a more generous offer, quit for a better job elsewhere.The Bank＊s argument is that full employment, if not already here, is just around the corner. . Employers are crying out for people and are poised to rip up their pay rates in favour of more generous salaries to secure the staff they need. With inflation expected to rise towards 3%, from 2.6% in July, workers need to see their pay packets following suit.In this scenario, a combination of few available workers and price rises in the shops will put huge pressure on employers to pay higher wages or risk unfilled vacancies.It is a message the monetary policy committee (MPC) is likely to repeat on Thursday when it makes its next judgment on the economy. The committee will most likely hold the base interest rate at 0.25% with the strong hint that a rise is imminent now that the labour market is tight and vacancies are rising.The Bank is not alone. Several City economists conclude that wages are about to jump now that the high level of vacancies is out of sync with the low level of unemployment.Kalum Pickering at Berenberg bank said: ※We expect that by the end of the year, and certainly by the beginning of 2018, providing sterling doesn＊t take another major leg down, real wages will be rising again.§To back up his point, wages across the economy have already started to rise from 1.6% per year at the beginning of the year to 2.1% in the latest figures. It will take a surge in wage rates to get past 3% to meet Pickering＊s forecast of inflation-busting pay rises, but as he points out, three months of improving pay growth shows it is going in the right direction.Yet, given the Bank of England strike＊s outcome, the central bank and its supporters in the City, at least as far as its analysis is concerned, seem completely out of touch. They seem to ignore the fact that the job market is stratified and regional and the answer to a chronic labour shortage is not necessarily higher pay.In the construction industry a shortage of specialist staff, which cannot be met by the current pool of skilled workers, has forced building firms to delay projects. Anecdotal evidence is that employers are not willing to take a cut in margins and customers are unwilling to pay more, so projects are mothballed.The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, which regularly talks to human resources directors across the private and public sectors, says the bottom end of the labour market continues to have a plentiful supply of workers. Its last survey showed there were an average of 24 applications for each low-skilled job, 19 candidates for every medium-skilled vacancy and eight for each high-skilled post. One factor was the continued influx of EU workers.It said: ※EU net migration levels remain well above post-enlargement average levels due to a continued strong supply of EU15 and Bulgarian and Romanian nationals. Initial fears that  would have a material impact on employers＊ ability to fill vacancies therefore seem to be somewhat premature.§Then there is the government＊s continuation of austerity, which will have the effect of making low income households even more desperate for a job, and when they have one, ask for longer hours just to make ends meet.Maybe Bank officials comfort themselves with the news that  with their own low-paid staff. But again it was just a smattering of staff who felt able to confront the restaurant chain 每 in line with the real trend, and not the Bank＊s fantasy projections, McDonald＊s has so far felt little anxiety about workers quitting for higher pay elsewhere.So the flexible market for labour remains firmly in place and pay increases are a pipe dream for most. It＊s why the archbishop of Canterbury joined the  to say, among other things, that trade unions needed more support.※We are failing those who will grow up into a world where the gap between the richest and poorest parts of the country is significant and destabilising,§ Justin Welby said.The Bank, to maintain the obvious respect it still commands with Britons, could more helpfully give a more accurate picture of the economy. For this to happen, Carney and his fellow committee members need to get out more."
"＆Sometimes you get the impression that the British are talking to themselves,§ said the outgoing French ambassador, Sylvie Bermann, on the  programme last week.There have been suggestions that the French are rubbing their hands and doing their best to lure as much business as they can from the City of London to Paris.My own impression, however, is that the French, and most other of our fellow Europeans, are saddened and not a little mystified by the sight of a nation whose leaders give every impression of rushing headlong to the cliff edge.Of course they want to take advantage of this weird situation. But it is a natural consequence of self-harming decisions made in this country, not in continental Europe.There was a similar air of puzzlement at the annual meeting of the Ambrosetti Forum which I attended last weekend in the beautiful surroundings of the Villa d＊Este on Lake Como. The Ambrosetti Forum has been described as the Italian version of the World Economic Forum in Davos, but it is a more civilised and less pretentious event.Nor was it just about Brexit 每 although it was a distorted version of what the EU＊s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said at the forum that  in the Britain that talks to itself.I can tell you, I was there when  was speaking. He did not, as widely reported, say in belligerent tones that the British needed to be taught a lesson. His general tone was one of regret, but not hostility. The future of the EU itself was far more important than Brexit, but Brexit had ※extremely serious and important consequences, which should not be underestimated§. Not?unreasonably, he said that ※these have not been explained properly to the British people§.As for the endless ※debate§ about the exit bill, he pointed out that there wasn＊t one. The UK had undertaken in 2014 to pay its 14% share of ※all our [EU] expenses§ for the next seven years. As the  : ※The EU commission ＃ is clearly right that the UK should pay its share of budget commitments that have already been signed off, and agree in principle to cover pension?liabilities.§Barnier emphasised: there was no exit bill, no punishment. It wasn＊t blackmail. It＊s fact.A few days later, in response to some distorted reporting on the BBC, Barnier tweeted that  was an ※occasion to explain single market benefits to all countries §.That was earlier in the week. Some of my anti-Brexit friends are worried that, while definitely winning in exchanges with our benighted government, Barnier must not make the mistake of overplaying his hand. The fear is that there could be a reaction in this country.While on Lake Como I met a Dutch couple who told me that when, the day after the referendum, they went to a Coldplay concert in Amsterdam, proceedings began with lead singer Chris Martin apologising to the audience for the referendum result! The result was bad enough, but the way our so-called leaders accepted ※the will of the people§ amazes me.Yet, on returning to London last week I wondered whether there were not just a glimmer of hope, amid the outcry caused by the leak of the government＊s immigration proposals, and the chaos around the so-called repeal bill, that more of our parliamentarians are waking up to the damaging absurdity of Brexit.They made a mockery of their own sovereignty when, ignoring the wisdom of Edmund Burke, they acted as delegates after the referendum vote, not representatives with their own minds and judgment, and voted to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, thereby setting out on the road to ruin.As the French president, Emmanuel Macron, stated in June, in spite of everything, the door to continued EU membership remains open.The ridiculous thing is that there are enough problems in the British economy and British society without the added self-inflicted damage from Brexit 每 a first taste, of course, being the collapse of the pound, which has hit British holidaymakers forcibly this?summer.On the economy in general, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in a report coordinated by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, is surely right to claim that  and requires ※fundamental reform§.But he and his colleagues also go on to say that reform is required on the scale of the 1940s and 1980s. I concur about the 1940s but I should like to remind the archbishop that much of the economic injustice that he so rightly laments dates from the more rampant elements of Thatcherism in the 1980s.Finally, all praise to John Le Carr谷 for reminding us that his famous fictional character George Smiley dreamed of a united Europe, and not the Brexit that le Carr谷 and so many of us detest."
" is to force a Commons vote on scrapping the 1% public sector pay cap.On Sunday, the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, called on Tory MPs to join his party in backing moves to end the ※unfair§ cap with a motion to be debated on Wednesday. Any vote on Labour＊s motion will be non-binding on the government.The opposition is seeking to capitalise on Conservative support for public sector workers to receive a pay increase and Theresa May＊s lack of a majority to pressure her to take action sooner than previously hinted.The announcement of the motion comes after a former top Treasury official labelled the cap unsustainable in the long term.Nicholas Macpherson, who spent a decade as permanent secretary to the Treasury until 2016, said any failure to properly cost the lifting of the 1% cap would leave the deficit unacceptably high.May and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, would have to decide either to cut spending or hike taxes to pay for it, Lord Macpherson said.Ashworth told Sky News＊s Sunday with Niall Paterson: ※What the government needs to do is understand the concerns of the people who work in our National Health Service and wider public services and get rid of this pay cap. ※We keep getting briefings in newspapers and suggestions that the government is sympathetic and wants to do something, and ＆Oh, it＊s terrible and we accept that but let＊s see where we get to＊. ※We＊re bringing a vote to the House of Commons on Wednesday and those Conservative members of parliament who have sincerely said they believe the pay cap should go, we＊re calling on them to vote with us, and I＊m calling on your viewers to lobby those Conservative members of parliament and let me know what they say. ※We can put an end to the pay cap on Wednesday for the NHS staff if they vote with us.§ Asked if Labour would support a union-backed general strike, Ashworth replied: ※People go on strike for industrial reasons. They don＊t go on strike for political reasons and ＃ the Labour party supports people who take industrial action. ※But we don＊t want it to get to that stage. We don＊t want to see a strike. We don＊t want to see nurses going on strike and wider public servants going on strike. ※The way to avoid that is for the government to understand the concerns of public sector workers and get rid of this unfair pay cap.§The defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, said last week that the government fully understood that public sector workers have taken their ※share of the pain§ of deficit reduction and signalled that the chancellor was looking at the issue.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said if public sector pay were to rise in line with inflation for the next three or four years it would cost the public purse between ?6bn and ?7bn more than if the cap were retained.Commenting on the speculation, Macpherson told BBC Radio 4＊s Westminster Hour: ※Generally pay caps aren＊t sustainable in the long term.※So the government does need to find a way of getting off this policy.§The Treasury is due to send out letters within weeks setting out the remit for public sector pay review bodies for next year＊s pay round, and Hammond is under pressure to allow them greater flexibility to recommend more generous rises."
"t was a glorious September morning. But I was in a ruminative mood, walking towards Westminster＊s Church House for the unveiling of another damning account of Britain＊s economy. It was the launch of the interim report from the Institute of Public Policy＊s (IPPR) economic commission. is one of the best I＊ve read and yet I was wondering how its unanswerable assessment of our economy and the need for systemic reform has so little purchase on the national debate.I made similar arguments in my book  20 years ago and have attended many such launches ever since, often graced by bishops and some daring business executives prepared to break cover and speak out. It＊s the same story of underinvestment; a woeful track record on R&D; overemphasis on high, short-term profits; an incredibly poor record on productivity and stagnating real wages. On almost every international comparison, Britain fares badly, with a desperately weak export sector overfocused on financial services and a few manufacturing industries.Many aspects 每 the structure of our companies, the priorities of finance, the skills of our workforce, the creaking infrastructure, the weakness of the tax base 每 need to be addressed because the failures are interlinked. We have an economic muddle rather than an economic model, declares the IPPR commission. Yet for all the self-evident truth in the report, my fear is that little will change. After all, both Churchill and Keynes said nearly a century ago that finance was too proud and industry too humble 每 the heart of the IPPR＊s diagnosis. We＊re still saying it today.The IPPR commissioners gamely argue that the problems are becoming so acute that the years ahead 每 as in the 1930s and 70s 每 will see a paradigm shift. I am not so sure. For all the failures, I doubt they will trigger popular demand for system change unless we can create political and cultural forces much better at articulating what needs to be done and then doing it. There hasn＊t been a reframing of the way capitalist institutions work since the 1930s and 40s. The change in the 1970s was a shift to the right, still firmly in control of the national narrative, and now running the rightwing coup that is .There are multiple reasons for the right＊s hegemony. Part is cultural. Jacob Rees-Mogg is a twerp, his views are rooted in prejudice rather than evidence and he is no ally of the mass of the British. But too many English instinctively genuflect to that lazy ※gentlemanly§ superiority. So when he and his ilk dismiss the case for system change as ※ socialist engineering§ and instead lay the blame on welfare, European regulations (without being able to name any) and the moral bankruptcy of liberals who indulge everything from the work-shy to soft criminal sentences, they get an undeserved hearing.But, surely, the great banks, investment houses and mighty companies can＊t be that flawed? Our extravagantly paid managerial class can＊t be so incompetent? Instead, we are tempted by the easy option of understanding failure and decline on this scale in terms of individual moral failings for which we are being punished. The benefit cheats in the flats opposite or the migrants allowed to crowd in a safe house, snapping up jobs on zero-hour contracts. Then there＊s soft liberalism with its pernicious indulgent views.Powerful rightwing newspapers that foreground the same stories about welfare cheats and immigration while relentlessly attacking liberal institutions 每 the BBC, the NHS, the EU 每 reinforce these reflex reactions. They would never endorse or champion the IPPR＊s powerful analysis. And the written word, even from a tawdry biased media, retains disproportionate cultural force.Too few figures at the top of our society speak out either in defence of Enlightenment values or at the evident crisis before their eyes. They fear being struck off the lists for non-executive directorships and public appointments by making criticisms that could help the dread forces of Labourism. Not to mention lost invitations to the ritziest of parties.In this respect, Britain has echoes of other declining nations over the centuries 每 Venice in the 16th century, Spain in the 18th, Austria-Hungary and France in the 19th. All knew full well that their political, economic and social systems had become dysfunctional, but reform was impossible. Too many at the top had stakes in the old order, reinforced, as in today＊s Britain, by being at the apex of the social pyramid.This makes Labour＊s political challenge all the more difficult. It is the outsider party, so that even when it holds office it feels like an unwelcome and short-term occupant. System change needs allies from within prepared to provide the ammunition to support telling criticism and make common cause in reform.But Labour＊s leadership often finds itself in a bind. Either it so craves legitimacy, like Blair and Brown, that it does not want to embrace criticism of the status quo, so it threatens and does nothing. Or it so disregards forces it openly despises 每 see Corbyn and McDonnell 每 that it can recruit few or no business and financial allies. But the task of system change requires coaxing insider allies to burn their conservative boats and make common cause for the national good. You need Blair＊s persuasiveness and Corbyn＊s conviction 每 an impossible combination? Otherwise, the left mouths intent, but with little evidence or substance to back its proposals, which is disabling it even if it wins office.Perhaps Brexit is changing these dynamics. The right is managing a cockup of such epic proportions that some in the Tory elite are beginning to dissociate themselves from a brand that is becoming as toxic and emblematic of failure as the Romanovs and Hapsburgs. Tory newspapers are so biased that their influence is slipping.I know of one British ex-ambassador who flaunts his Labour party membership as a badge of pride at every prestigious event he attends; he was once seen as a loopy eccentric but now others are now wondering if he is not right. Most businesses and their lobby organisations will find it hard to fault what the IPPR argues, and a wide cross-section of people have signed up as commissioners. has won it many admirers and its manifesto signalled a welcome awareness of both the direction and systemic nature of necessary change.These are but straws in the wind, but they foretell how Brexit may be the trigger to breaking the Conservative hegemony and perhaps even reshaping the balance of power between finance and industry. If so maybe my worries are misplaced and any successor walking into Dean＊s Yard in 20 years＊ time will be attending the launch of a report discussing a country on the economic rise 每 and leading the EU. Here＊s hoping."
" new study  examining the impacts of tax cuts has found that while lowering tax rates for the rich will stimulate the economy, it does so at the great cost of increased inequality.Most damningly, it finds the benefits of tax cuts targeted at the wealthiest 25% 每 such as the one the Turnbull government brought in last year 每 are far too weak to raise the welfare of the majority of the population and also never pay for themselves. Last year, the government made great talk of the need for a tax cut for those earning more than $80,000. The threshold for the 37% rate was raised to $87,000 to ensure 每 as the prime minister  at the time that ※middle-income Australians, those that are on average full-time earnings, which as you know is nudging $80,000, don＊t move into the second top tax bracket§.But as I , those on $80,000 earned roughly 1.5 times the current median taxable income of $55,000, putting them above what would be considered ※middle class§. Such income earners were also around the top 25% of those with a taxable income and in the top 14% of all adults.This year, the only income-tax cut delivered was similarly targeted at high-income earners 每 in this case the very high. The end of the deficit levy, which delivered a 2% tax cut to those earning more than $180,000, combined with the 0.5% increase in the Medicare levy, , while those earning above that amount received a tax cut. And this is important because of the new IMF study 每 tax cuts aimed at the top 25% improve growth but reduce the welfare of most of the population, and tax cuts targeted at middle-income earners reduce inequality and can actually raise the size of the middle class. The study also rather sharply slaps down the biggest furphy put forward by many who advocate tax cuts to stimulate growth 每 that they will pay for themselves through stronger growth and, thus, more tax revenue. The idea of self-funding tax cuts got a big run in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan. He argued that his policies, which slashed the top tax rate in the US from 70% to 26%, would pay for themselves through increased growth. They didn＊t.In 2006, a  found that the tax cuts caused revenue to fall in real terms and was only partially made up by other tax increases that Reagan introduced. But the myth of tax cuts paying for themselves remains. The current US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin,  that economic growth would pay for Donald Trump＊s tax cuts;  Liberal senator James Paterson told the Senate that ※the revenue collected from individuals after the tax rates were cut [by Reagan] in fact increased rather than decreased§.The IMF study, which modelled the impacts of tax cuts on a US-style economy, found that any income-tax cut 每 whether targeted at middle or high-income households 每 reduced tax revenue. The study＊s authors noted that personal income-tax cuts stimulated growth but the supply-side effects, such as increased employment and wages, ※are never large enough to offset the revenue loss from lower marginal tax rates§.Or as they succinctly conclude: ※tax cuts do not pay for themselves§.The study, however, finds that tax cuts do generate growth. This is not uncontroversial 每 giving people money either through direct or indirect payments or a tax cut will generally lead to them spending more money and thus increase economic growth. The issue is how to pay for the tax cuts and what impact they will have on the economy. The study looked at two types of tax cuts 每 one for middle-income earners and the other for those in the top 25% income bracket. It found that both improved economic growth, but more growth resulted from the high-income tax cuts. If you stopped reading there, you would miss the crucial aspect. While a high-income tax cut generates more growth than one directed at middle-income earners, that growth delivers very skewed benefits. The study found that in an economy such as the US or Australia, the high-income tax cut would lead to increased spending on goods and services, which in turn could improve wages for those lower-income earners who provided those goods, but it would also cause prices to rise and would need to be paid for by either other tax increases or cuts to government spending. The total impact, even when you accounted for policies that tried to ※protect the poor§ to reduce the impact of other tax increases and spending cuts, was ※a significant decline in consumption of low and middle- income households, and a significant reduction of the middle class§.So you get strong economic growth, but you reduce the size of the middle class and increase inequality. Damningly, the study＊s authors conclude of the high-income tax cut that ※the ＆trickle-down＊ effects§ are ※insufficient to raise the welfare of the bulk of the population§.On the other hand, they find that a tax cut targeted at middle-income earners, while generating less overall growth, ※reduces income inequality and polarisation by moving people from lower income households back into the middle class§.The study estimates that a tax cut targeted at middle-income earners can increase the size of the middle class by about 4% and reduce inequality,  itis paid for by raising consumption taxes such as the GST. In the past, the belief has been that you need to sacrifice equality for economic growth. Numerous , however, have found that reducing inequality improves economic growth in the long term. The IMF study gives the issue an even more precise examination. Rather than talking in general economic terms, it looks at the specific impact of taxation policy. And it shows that governments that choose high-income tax cuts are choosing economic growth for the few and reduced welfare for the many. "

"In the weeks that followed their disastrous election result, a delegation of Tory MPs marched to Downing Street with a clear message for the prime minister and her team. After years of austerity,  was running out, and some positivity was needed.The MPs went away from the meeting convinced they had secured an end to the public sector pay cap that would mark a loosening of spending cuts that they could use to show their constituents that the government was listening.Yet while Theresa May and her chancellor, , are preparing to make a gesture to selected public servants, the years of salami slicing mean that, quite apart from Brexit, there are now myriad issues that ministers fear could erupt into full-blown political crises.It is why some Tories are now concerned that, far from staging a political recovery in the autumn, the party may do well to dodge a winter of discontent that would provoke renewed anger among voters and make the once-distant prospect of prime minister Jeremy Corbyn more likely.The spinning plates most in danger of crashing to the floor include not just public sector pay, but forthcoming welfare cuts, the increasingly  of a new benefits system, local government funding and an NHS heading into an early winter crisis.※The next three to four months are possibly going to be the rockiest so far 每 with Brexit uncertainty affecting some of these domestic issues,§ said one minister. ※These are choppy waters to navigate between now and New Year＊s Eve.※The question is what concessions can be made in the budget consistent with our reputation for sound money and balancing the books. The threat of prime minister Corbyn is the only glue that is holding the Tory party together.§The immediate threat is coming from the unions, some of whom are threatening strikes should the government attempt to reward some public sector workers rather than others.Major unions are already warning ministers not to be selective about which public servants deserve a raise. A survey by the public services union Unison of nearly 11,000 employees, including paramedics, teaching assistants, hospital porters and police staff, found that more than two in five (43%) described their standard of living as worse than a year ago, and a quarter (26%) said they owed more money than they did 12 months ago.※Enough is enough,§ said Dave Prentis, Unison＊s general secretary. ※The pay cap must end, not this autumn or next year, but now. The government cannot pick and choose who should benefit. Everyone working in the , schools and higher education, local government and the police service is long overdue a rise.§Meanwhile, a coming welfare squeeze 每 combined with the new universal credit system of administering a series of benefits 每 is also threatening to unravel. Some Tories who rebelled over past attempts to cut tax credits still have concerns. ※The problem with universal credit is the so-called taper rate [the amount of benefits a claimant loses for each pound they earn] 每 it is at 63p in the pound, meaning some are paying an effective 63% rate of tax on extra money they earn,§ said Stephen McPartland, one of the leading Tory campaigners on the issue. ※I would like to see the chancellor look at this again in the budget.§There is an even more pressing issue emerging over the way universal credit is being administered. From October, the number of job centres introducing the new benefit is set to increase from five to 50 a month. However, highly respected Citizens Advice has taken the extreme move of calling for a pause of the rollout amid signs that delayed payments are pushing recipients into debt.In an analysis of more than 50,000 cases published last Monday, it found that claimants are 14% more likely to have problems with pressing debts if they are on universal credit compared with the benefits it is replacing. A fifth of recipients on universal credit are not being paid in full within six weeks.Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions select committee, said: ※The idea of making people wait six weeks, and sometimes longer, for their benefit to be paid is made to look increasingly questionable by each bleak new piece of evidence on universal credit. People who are already hard up simply cannot cope that long without an income.※I＊ve pleaded with the government for a Christmas truce 每 a postponement of the full rollout of universal credit in Birkenhead [the Labour MP＊s constituency] 每 otherwise the system will push families into destitution over the festive?period.§Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said universal credit remained ※deeply flawed§, adding: ※If government doesn＊t fix these problems, its expansion is a disaster waiting to happen.§A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said the organisation＊s analysis was not representative. ※The vast majority of claimants are comfortable managing their money, and for anyone who needs extra help we have budgeting advice and benefit advances,§ she said.Also in the precarious policy mix is evidence that the NHS may face an early winter crisis. , NHS Providers, which represents 229 of the 233 NHS trusts in England, said that the health service was on course for disaster unless an extra ?350m was found for extra beds and staff.It all adds up to a very long queue outside the chancellor＊s door as he draws up one of the most challenging budgets in recent years. While the uncertainty over Brexit means he instinctively wants to take a conservative approach, political pressures to turn on the spending taps are?growing.Ending austerity comes with a hefty price tag of ?33bn a year, according to the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies. It says that, among other things, allowing public sector pay to rise in line with pay in the private sector until 2020 would cost ?9.7bn by 2021-22. Unfreezing benefits would cost ?3.6bn, while reversing the cuts to work allowances in universal credit would cost about ?3.2bn. Allowing departmental spending to rise in line with economic growth would cost ?12.3bn.※Hammond has indicated that he has listened to the message in the election, but has also indicated he remains wedded to the idea of balancing the books by the middle of the next decade,§ said Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ※At the moment he is on course to slightly undershoot his public finance target for 2017-18. That could give him some wiggle room, but not much.§Hammond is still said to be in cautious mode, but sympathetic to aiming any budget help at the young. Cancelling the forthcoming rise in student debt interest is one option.Some senior Tories see the mounting threats as part of a wider lack of vision from their party that needs to be addressed urgently. Grant Shapps, the former party chairman, said: ※Winning elections involves having both positive achievements and a positive message. It is vital that in this party conference and budget season we grasp the opportunity to show that there is no party in Britain more aspirational for the future of the British people than Conservatives.§"
"A previously muted British business establishment is now in full cry over Brexit. The leak last week of proposals to restrict the ability of  nationals to live and work in the UK were described as ※catastrophic§ by one employers＊ group. Voices from housebuilding to aerospace, farming and hotels raised concerns over the plans, which signalled a hard Brexit is very much on the cards.The warning of catastrophe came from the British Hospitality Association, while the National Farmers Union said the  would cause ※massive disruption to the entire food supply chain§. The reaction was also fuelled by the government＊s refusal to disown the plans, alongside its apparent support of a hard Brexit agenda. We answer the key questions raised by the leak, including the potential consequences for the UK economy.The document, entitled the Border, Immigration and Citizenship System After the UK Leaves the EU,  by limiting them to a maximum residency of two years. Meanwhile ※high-skilled occupations§ would be granted permits to work for a longer period of three to five years.Plans to scrap EU rules on the rights of extended family members to reside in the UK would mean that the current system, which has ※virtually no limits§, according to the document, was replaced by one that would determine ※family members as direct family members only, plus durable partners§.EU nationals would be required to travel on a passport and not a national ID card. They would also have to apply for a biometric residence permit, which may include a fingerprint, after they had stayed for between three and six months.In defiance of the EU＊s free-movement directive, residence permits would not be granted to jobseekers. Instead, a specific ※income threshold§ would be introduced for ※self-sufficient§ migrants. Employers would also be heavily involved in policing the new system. They would need to carry out ※right to work§ checks. If they failed in this duty, criminal sanctions against the organisation and its bosses should be expected, the document says.The most common reason given by business leaders for allowing migrants the freedom to roam is a belief that they are the lifeblood of any developed economy. This is especially true in the US, where the business magazine  constantly reminds its readers that major companies 每 including 40% of its Fortune 500 list 每 were .In the last 20 years it has become increasingly common in the UK for the engines of technological change to be fired by migrants. One in six new hires between 2009 and 2015 in the British tech industry were EU citizens, according to the trade body techUK.But immigrants also fill the gaps in low-paid sectors where few Brits are willing to work. Last week employers voiced their dismay at restrictions on both the skilled and unskilled. Farmers were joined by all the major business lobby groups, which want more of an open-door policy than the government＊s interpretation of the EU referendum vote appears to allow.Peter Gowers, chief executive of the hotel chain Travelodge, said: ※Even if the hotel industry recruited virtually every person on the unemployment register there wouldn＊t be enough people to fill all the roles needed in the 10 years following . That＊s particularly the case in London.§The rapid reduction in net migration to below 100,000 new arrivals to the UK each year 每 a Conservative party pledge before the election 每 could knock 3.1% off GDP by 2025 and lower tax receipts by ?32.7bn, according to the Centre for  and Business Research.This week, Theresa May repeated the pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, which means non-EU migrants, who have consistently arrived each year in larger numbers that EU migrants, would also face a much tougher test. This would have an even bigger impact on GDP growth.Paul Johnson, head of the thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says EU migrants have also been good for the public finances. On average immigrants from the EU are better educated, younger and more likely to be in work than native Britons. Young people in work contribute, on average, much more in taxes than they take out in benefits and public service spending.He wrote in a blog: ※A large part of what government does is to take money from young workers and give it to pensioners. Without high net immigration the public finances would be in a worse state. If we were significantly to reduce the number of EU migrants, we would have to borrow more, raise taxes or spend less.§Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader and former business secretary, says nine studies into the impact of migrant labour crossed his desk between 2010 and 2015. In each case they were left to gather dust in the Home Office, he says, blaming May for their disappearance.The studies seen by Cable showed that migrants rarely supplanted UK-born workers, and went instead into expanding industries where UK-born workers were in short supply.A  was among those to reject a causal link between the arrival of migrant workers and the unemployment of UK-born workers. Where it allowed more room for debate was on pay. In some instances pay was depressed by migrant workers, but not by much, it said. Johnson＊s IFS shared this view.There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that doesn＊t show up in the studies to suggest that competition for work from migrants locked out UK-born workers and drove down rates of pay. Those who cite this argument range from architects in central London to agricultural workers in Lincolnshire.Many Vote Leave campaigners believe a crackdown on migrants would force companies to train UK-born workers for jobs that in recent years they recruited ※oven-ready§ foreign workers to perform. But many of the jobs in hospitality depend on people working long hours for low pay. A fear among hotel and restaurant owners is that if they increase the pay bill and add in the cost of training, customers will refuse to shoulder the higher costs and they will go out of business.Last month the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD) said employers saw little incentive to offer big pay rises because they are receiving an average of 24 applications for each low-skilled job. The CIPD said this would change after Brexit. Plenty of City economists believe a reduction in migrants would eventually feed through into higher pay. The question is whether the vacancies remain advertised when the economy is suffering and businesses rein in recruitment.Industries with skills shortages would have to move quickly to train their staff and new recruits. They should also introduce automation and robotic technology to overcome labour shortages and raise levels of productivity.Punam Birly, who advises companies on immigration at the consultancy group KPMG, says most countries operate similar immigration systems to that proposed in the Home Office leak and still manage to prosper.So once the uncertainty is out of the way, the UK should find a method for letting EU migrants stay for longer than is the case in the hard Brexit proposals. Then firms could implement investment plans that had been put on hold and reap the benefits. But the key is not repeat the mistakes of pre-credit crunch Britain, when the UK＊s productivity gains were largely snaffled by businesses and their shareholders."
"Britain＊s efforts to expand trade in goods beyond the European Union＊s border took a knock in July after official figures showed the UK＊s deficit with the rest of the world widened following a drop in exports.The deficit in the trade in goods with non-EU countries widened by ?2.4bn while exports to the EU grew to cut the trade gap by ?1.3bn. The figures were released as a new report from thinktank the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said economic growth shows signs of accelerating in the UK, albeit still at a slower pace than in recent years.Analysts had expected the fall in the pound to give a significant boost to exports with the EU and beyond, but the trend since last year＊s Brexit vote has shown only a , despite the higher cost, leaving only a marginal improvement in the net trade position.Overall, UK exports of goods and services edged down 0.2% month on month in July and were up just 0.6% from one quarter to the next. At the same time the  as the fall in sterling fails to lift exports as much as expected. The Office for National Statistics added to the gloomy economic news with data showing that the manufacturing sector remained ※subdued§ in July and the  in new orders in the three months to the end of June, especially in the housebuilding sector., though this only meant reducing the loss of production of 0.6% in June to 0.1% in July. The ONS said a flurry of new car models helped the motor industry recover ground lost earlier in the year.The news came as the second of the UK＊s new generation of aircraft carriers, HMS Prince of Wales, was officially named in a ceremony at Rosyth Naval Dockyard on Friday. Liam Fox, the trade secretary, said 90% of the suppliers for the construction of the ?3bn boat and its sister ship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, were based in the UK. Set against the positive picture for manufacturing, there was worse news for the construction sector. Output dipped by 1.2% in July, the fourth consecutive month of contraction, while new orders fell to the lowest level since 2014 following an 8% slump. In a damaging development for the government, housing orders were down almost 10% on a year ago with public housing the worst affected.Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, described the trade, construction and manufacturing data as a ※mixed bag§ that showed the upbeat signals from some manufacturing industry surveys was starting to register in official data, though the trade and construction data ※point to a UK economy still struggling to break out of sluggish growth§.ONS senior statistician Kate Davies said: ※Manufacturing remains relatively subdued since the start of the year, though July showed the first significant monthly growth of 2017, with car production increasing partly thanks to new models rolling off the production lines. The usual period of summer maintenance of North Sea oil platforms also failed to materialise for a second month running. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers＊ trade body, said there was some good news from the export figures, which revealed ※robust numbers on manufactured exports§.She said: ※Double-digit year-on-year growth is carrying through to the start of the second half of the year. But the need to import materials and components at the same rate means the overall deficit isn＊t budging.§Industrial production appears to be helping to bolster GDP growth after the worst start to the year since 2012. The economy is expected to have grown by 0.4% in the three months to the end of August, according to NIESR. While that＊s still below the long run trend of about 0.6%, it＊s an improvement on the three months to the end of July, when the economy grew by just 0.2%. The mixed signals on the economy add to the conundrum facing interest rate setters at the Bank of England as they prepare to meet on Thursday. Rising inflation, hitting 2.6% in July and expected to head higher over the coming months, would usually be enough for Threadneedle Street .But weak growth and the stuttering  talks will probably convince them to stay put, according to economists. Philip Shaw, of City bank Investec, said the monetary policy committee will probably keep rates steady until 2019, while a rate hike this year is ※very unlikely§."
" has left in its wake upended lives and enormous property damage, . But the storm that pummelled the Texas coast for the better part of a week also raises deep questions about the United States＊ economic system and politics.It is ironic, of course, that an event so related to climate change would occur in a state that is home to so many climate-change deniers 每 and where the economy depends so heavily on the fossil fuels that drive global warming. Of course, no particular climate event can be directly related to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But scientists have long predicted that such increases would boost not only average temperatures, but also weather variability 每 and especially the occurrence of extreme events such as Harvey. As , ※There is evidence that some extremes have changed as a result of anthropogenic influences, including increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.§ Astrophysicist Adam Frank : ※Greater warmth means more moisture in the air which means stronger precipitation.§To be sure, Houston and Texas could not have done much by themselves about the increase in greenhouse gases, though they could have taken a more active role in pushing for strong climate policies. But local and state authorities could have done a far better job preparing for such events, which hit the area with some frequency.In responding to the hurricane 每 and in funding some of the repair 每 everyone turns to government, just as they did in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis. Again, it is ironic that this is now occurring in a part of the country where government and collective action are so frequently rebuked. It was no less ironic when the titans of US banking, having preached the neoliberal gospel of downsizing government and eliminating regulations that proscribed some of their most dangerous and antisocial activities, turned to government in their moment of need.There is an obvious lesson to be learned from such episodes: markets on their own are incapable of providing the protection that societies need. When markets fail, as they often do, collective action becomes imperative.And, as with financial crises, there is a need for preventive collective action to mitigate the impact of climate change. That means ensuring that buildings and infrastructure are constructed to withstand extreme events, and are not located in areas that are most vulnerable to severe damage. It also means protecting environmental systems, particularly wetlands, which can play an important role in absorbing the impact of storms. It means eliminating the risk that a natural disaster could lead to the discharge of dangerous chemicals, as happened in Houston. And it means having in place adequate response plans, including for evacuation.Effective government investments and strong regulations are needed to ensure each of these outcomes, regardless of the prevailing political culture in Texas and elsewhere. Without adequate regulations, individuals and firms have no incentive to take adequate precautions, because they know that much of the cost of extreme events will be borne by others. Without adequate planning and regulation, including of the environment, flooding will be worse. Without disaster planning and adequate funding, any city can be caught in the dilemma in which Houston found itself: if it does not order an evacuation, many will die; but if it does order an evacuation, people will die in the ensuing chaos, and snarled traffic will prevent people from getting out.America and the world are paying a high price for devotion to the extreme anti-government ideology embraced by  and his Republican party. The world is paying, because cumulative US greenhouse-gas emissions are greater than those from any other country; even today, the US is one of the world＊s leaders in  greenhouse-gas emissions. But America is paying a high price as well: other countries, even poor developing countries, such as Haiti and Ecuador, seem to have learned (often at great expense and only after some huge calamities) how to manage natural disasters better.After the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the shutdown of much of New York City by Sandy in 2012, and now the devastation wrought on Texas by Harvey, the US can and should do better. It has the resources and skills to analyse these complex events and their consequences, and to formulate and implement regulations and investment programmes that mitigate the adverse effects on lives and property.What America doesn＊t have is a coherent view of government by those on the right, who, working with special interests that benefit from their extreme policies, continue to speak out of both sides of their mouth. Before a crisis, they resist regulations and oppose government investment and planning; afterwards, they demand 每 and receive 每 billions of dollars to compensate them for their losses, even those that could easily have been prevented. One can only hope that America, and other countries, will not need more natural persuasion before taking to heart the lessons of ."
"The immigration strategy discussed in the leaked Home Office document could be as beneficial to British workers as the Black Death (, 6 September). My limited historical knowledge tells me that when the working population was decimated as the bubonic plague spread throughout Britain (and Europe), employers suddenly had to start treating the people working for them decently, even paying them enough to live on.Of course, the document fails to address the impact their proposals will have on every area of economic activity across the whole country: no more cheap crop harvesters, nurses, carers, shop assistants, road cleaners, office workers, taxi and bus drivers etc. Nor does it even think about the massive impact that having to pay people real wages will have on business finances across the whole economy.But that last comment shows it could bring an end to the real cause of the Brexit anger: the fact that wages have stagnated for the longest period in 150 years (, 6 September). Many Tories will again rejoice that they have at last taken us back to the 60s 每 the 1860s that is. In respect of the rights of EU citizens post-Brexit, it＊s often said that EU immigrants provide a major contribution to the economy and society. Is it not the case, then, that non-EU immigrants also provide a great contribution, usually under more financially adverse conditions? What is scandalous is the inequity of the present (pre-Brexit) immigration system. Pretty much all of the measures in the leaked document (including 每 yes 每 digital fingerprinting) have at some stage been part of my own immigration process, as a skilled non-EU migrant to the UK. Prior to my successful citizenship application, I paid UK taxes for seven years without the right to claim any form of benefit, while supporting a minor. Without exception, our passports have been checked on entry to the UK. None of this has been a problem: these are reasonable measures borne with a good humour by those of us who want to work in the great environment of the UK. If similar measures can be applied to all, that is only to be applauded. It is striking to note UK government proposals to end EU free movement rights as soon as the UK leaves the bloc in 2019. New rules would require EU nationals to seek permission before taking up a job, making employers recruit locally first. The impact of such a policy on Scotland will be devastating and it is no wonder that a plethora of major organisations have lined up to roundly condemn these proposals.There is clear evidence that Scotland＊s future economic health, key services such as the NHS, the strength of our key institutions such as our universities and our future public finances depend on the maintenance of the ability of EU nationals to work and study freely in Scotland. While the number of pensioners in Scotland is expected to rise by 28% over the next 25 years, worker numbers are only increasing by 1%. We therefore face an ageing population, but only marginal growth in the working-age population. Scotland needs immigrants to balance this out and these reckless proposals will?be absolutely devastating.In the run up to the EU referendum, senior figures in the leave campaign, such as Michael Gove, promised increased powers over immigration would come to Scotland should the UK vote to leave the EU. These pledges, like many others that were made in that campaign, have been predictably quickly forgotten.Scotland desperately need an immigration system that caters to the challenges we as a nation face, not one that shuts the door to much-needed talent. If there is any political morality at all, it is lower-skilled foreign workers whom the UK ought to be offering home to. High-skilled workers, by contrast, are a precious resource in their own countries, and it is these people whom we should say no to. Our long-standing policy of stripping emerging economies of the people they most need has benefited the first world at the expense of the developing world. It has also sustained our failure over the long term to encourage, train and reward our own employees properly, and it is a policy we should stop at once.  I trust the migration advisory committee, in providing evidence to underpin a new immigration policy, will ask UK citizens living in the other 27 countries of the EU, and in particular their family members, whether they would welcome the same ※plan§ being applied to them post-Brexit by the EU27. Mass immigration is only a benefit to those in control of large businesses that benefit from it. The general public suffers competition and depressed wages. If a company cannot survive without a constant flow of immigrants, it shouldn＊t be allowed to survive. If that means Londoners＊ refined sensibilities are hurt then so be it! "
