In an interview set to air Thursday on the "Make it Plain with Mark Thompson" show on SiriusXM's Progress channel, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders teased a possible return to the presidential campaign stage in 2020. "Are you leaving 2020 on the table or are you taking it off the table?" asked Thompson. "No, I'm not taking it off the table, I just have not made any decisions," replied Sanders. He conceded, however, that it's "much too early" to speculate.  Sanders quickly pivoted to health care, asserting that the focus for politicians now should be the fight against the Senate's 'disastrous" health care bill and to "take on all of Trump's reactionary proposals." The Senate's revised versions of their health care plan is expected to be released on Thursday, which senior administration officials and Senate GOP sources say still includes several tax increases from Obamacare that had originally been eliminated. A new score by the Congressional Budget Office is also expected to be released in the coming days. The 75-year old also touched on the release of Donald Trump Jr.'s emails detailing the arrangement of a meeting with a Russian government lawyer in the hopes of securing damaging information on Sander's former Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.  "It is a very damaging piece of evidence," Sanders said. "But what is important is that there be a methodical, objective, bipartisan process that looks at this whole business of the possibility of Trump's campaign colluding with the Russians." Sanders also said issues like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, making public colleges and universities tuition-free, and being more aggressive on criminal justice reform were top priorities for him. "There's a whole lot of fights that we have to fight, it's just too early to be talking about an election three and a half years from now," added Sanders.
