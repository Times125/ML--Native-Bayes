"Attorney General Jeff Sessions called on Congress on Thursday to tighten the rules for people seeking asylum through a system he said is filled with ¡°rampant abuse and fraud.¡±In a speech at the Justice Department¡¯s Executive Office for Immigration Review, Sessions said the nation¡¯s policies allow too many asylum seekers to exploit loopholes in a ¡°broken¡± and extremely backlogged process.¡°The system is being gamed,¡± Sessions said. ¡°Over the years, smart attorneys have exploited loopholes in the law, court rulings and lack of resources to substantially undermine the intent of Congress. .?.?. There is no cost or risk for those who make a baseless asylum claim.¡±Tightening standards in the U.S. asylum system was among immigration principles and policies the Trump administration recently said were needed to protect public safety and jobs for U.S.-born workers. The administration¡¯s list, sent to Congress, included funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, curbing federal grants to ¡°sanctuary cities¡± and cracking down on the influx of Central American minors.  Civil liberties advocates said Sessions¡¯s comments were inaccurate and unfair to the thousands of people fleeing dangerous, life-threatening situations in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Venezuela.¡°Attorney General [Sessions¡¯s] remarks today were a mere continuation of the administration¡¯s efforts to falsely paint asylum seekers and refugees as threats and frauds,¡± said Eleanor Acer, the senior director of refu?gee protection at Human Rights First. ¡°These individuals are not criminals and frauds; they are mothers, teenagers, and children desperate to escape violence and persecution.¡±Asylum is given to a person on specific grounds because the person fears or has experienced persecution on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. There are two ways to be granted asylum: One is ¡°affirmative¡± asylum through the Department of Homeland Security. An applicant has to file a claim within a year of arriving in the United States.The second is a ¡°defensive¡± application for asylum because the person has filed late, was rejected by the DHS or was apprehended without proper legal documents. The defensive cases are handled by Justice Department immigration courts.Sessions said that many of the asylum cases ¡°lacked merit¡± and are ¡°simply a ruse to enter the country illegally.¡±¡°As this system becomes overloaded with fake claims, it cannot deal effectively with just claims,¡± Sessions said. ¡°The surge in trials, hearings, appeals, bond proceedings has been overwhelming.¡± He said that ¡°credible-fear claims¡± at the border increased from about 3,000 cases in 2009 to more than 69,000 cases in 2016. The Justice Department¡¯s immigration review office has more than 600,000 cases pending, triple the number pending in 2009, according to the department.¡°We also have dirty immigration lawyers who are encouraging their otherwise unlawfully present clients to make false claims of asylum, providing them with the magic words needed to trigger the credible-fear process,¡± Sessions said.Sessions¡¯s remarks are the latest in a string of anti-immigration stances he has taken since becoming attorney general. Sessions was the Trump administration official who announced Sept.?5 the end of the protection provided by the Obama administration for some 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children ¡ª they are often called ¡°dreamers¡± ¡ª to live and work in the United States without fear of deportation.  Sessions has also threatened to withhold federal policing grants to ¡°sanctuary cities¡± that do not cooperate with the federal government in detaining for deportation people who are in the country illegally. In speeches across the country, Sessions has blasted specific cities, such as Chicago, and tied their crime rates to their policies on undocumented immigrants.Separately, the Justice Department on Thursday warned five jurisdictions considered to have ¡°sanctuary¡± policies ¡ª Chicago, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia and Cook County, Ill., whose county seat is Chicago ¡ª that officials had preliminarily found them to be in violation of a federal law governing communication with immigration authorities and that they could be at risk of losing grant funding. More than $8.3?million is at stake, a Justice Department spokesman said.  ¡°Jurisdictions that adopt so-called ¡®sanctuary policies¡¯ also adopt the view that the protection of criminal aliens is more important than the protection of law-abiding citizens and of the rule of law,¡± Sessions said in a statement.Last month, the Trump administration arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in cities, including Washington, New York, Baltimore and Los Angeles, that are some of the harshest opponents of President Trump¡¯s immigration policies. Under Sessions, the Justice Department has defended various iterations of Trump¡¯s entry ban, which in its current version would suspend the issuance of visas to some citizens of eight, mostly majority-Muslim, countries.In his speech Thursday, the attorney general, who left the U.S. Senate to lead the Justice Department, called on his former colleagues in Congress to revamp the asylum system by imposing penalties for fraudulent applications, increasing the use of expedited removals, raising the standard of proof in ¡°credible fear¡± interviews and expanding the ability to send asylum seekers to safe third countries.¡°What we cannot do ¡ª what we must not do ¡ª is continue to let our generosity be abused,¡± Sessions said. Maria Sacchetti and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report."
"President Trump introduced his pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday, nominating White House staffer and cybersecurity expert Kirstjen Nielsen.¡°I share the president¡¯s profound commitment to the security of our country,¡± she said at a brief White House ceremony. ¡°Truly, there is nothing more valuable than to feel safe and secure in your homeland.¡±Nielsen was the favorite of White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, and her nomination is another sign of the former Marine Corps general¡¯s effort to impose a more conventional, professional management regime on an administration with a .Nielsen was Kelly¡¯s chief of staff when he was DHS secretary, and Kelly later brought her into the same role at the White House, where some staffers came to see her as the former general¡¯s dreaded . Her supporters say she has been trying to help professionalize the White House.In introducing Nielsen, Trump praised her ¡°sterling reputation¡± as a longtime public servant dedicated to security, ¡°not politics or ideology.¡±  ¡°There will be no on-the-job training,¡± he said. ¡°She will be ready from Day One.¡±If confirmed, Nielsen would replace Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke, who was widely criticized for characterizing the federal government¡¯s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico as a ¡°.¡±Duke assumed that role when Trump brought Kelly into the White House in July. While she has otherwise earned high marks for her performance, Duke does not have a background in counterterrorism or law enforcement, usual prerequisites for leading the sprawling agency with a $40 billion budget and 240,000 employees. Trump said Duke would remain at DHS as Nielsen¡¯s deputy.Nielsen, 45, is the first nominee to have experience at DHS. As a young attorney, she drafted legislation and policy at the Transportation Security Administration, then served as a special adviser for emergency preparedness and disaster management under President George W. Bush.Nielsen was part of the White House team that shouldered much of the blame for the government¡¯s botched response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005.That episode of her career may become a  for Senate Democrats during the confirmation process. But Nielsen is not expected to face an especially difficult fight, given her background as an experienced professional and a no-nonsense, nonpartisan manager.She would be immediately served a full plate of operational challenges and policy controversies: overseeing the government¡¯s response to multiple natural disasters, safeguarding the country¡¯s transportation networks from terrorist attacks and protecting its election infrastructure from foreign hackers. DHS is also the agency responsible for implementing the Trump administration¡¯s immigration enforcement agenda.Senate Democrats may press Nielsen on that point, especially as protection expires for some 800,000 ¡°Dreamers¡± who were brought to the United States illegally as children. They were allowed to remain in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, whose protections will begin to expire in March, leaving them at risk of deportation.Administration officials were optimistic that the confirmation process would move fairly quickly, with senators voting to install Nielsen in the role within a month.That fast-track timeline would leave DHS under Duke¡¯s temporary leadership for more than three months, and Democrats had criticized the White House for moving slowly on Kelly¡¯s replacement.   ¡°Given the threats posed to the United States by everything from terrorism to natural disasters, having permanent leadership in place at the Department of Homeland Security is more important than ever,¡± said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee. ¡°I look forward to working with Chairman [Ron] Johnson to ensure that the Committee¡¯s process is comprehensive and fair.¡±"
"As Attorney General Jeff Sessions began testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday, legislators signaled they hoped to question the country¡¯s top law enforcement officer on a wide range of topics, including homegrown terrorism, the rise in opioid deaths and the firing of FBI director James B. Comey.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she also hopes to question Sessions about how he has shifted the department¡¯s position in voting rights cases and on protections for LGBT people. Lawmakers are also likely to question Sessions on why the department he now leads had previously supported legislation that some now say undermined the Drug Enforcement Administration¡¯s ability to stem the flow of pain pills. Sessions¡¯s appearance at the Judiciary Committee¡¯s regular Justice Department oversight hearing will offer senators from both political parties the opportunity to grill their former colleague, who now serves as the nation¡¯s top law enforcement official. The hearing is the first time Sessions has appeared before the committee since his confirmation hearing in January. The committee chairman, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), said he had not insisted the attorney general come sooner because he had hoped Sessions would have more of his leadership team in place first.   Sessions has taken the department in a significantly different direction than did his predecessors in the Obama administration, and he is sure to be asked to justify many of his recent decisions ¡ª especially on his interpretation of federal law as it relates to the DACA program, the Affordable Care Act and discrimination against transgender people. Sessions was the public face of the decision to wind down the DACA program, which granted a reprieve from deportation to people who came to the U.S. without documentation when they were children. He has asserted the program could not withstand legal challenges. Sessions also laid out the legal underpinnings for the Trump administration to create , and he paved the way for . Legislators, who could get involved to save DACA or replace or in some way change the Affordable Care Act, are likely to press the attorney general on how he came to the legal conclusions that he did, and to what extent his and his department¡¯s assertions about the law might have been influenced by the president¡¯s policy agenda or his own political views. Democrats also have warned Sessions they expect him to answer questions about his conversations with President Trump, especially as they might relate to the firing of Comey and the ongoing investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential race. Sessions is recused from that case and, at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in June, he refused to detail his conversations with the president. But Democrats have questioned his rationale for not providing at least some information. In a letter to Sessions last week, they said the attorney general needed to formally identify the topics over which Trump would assert executive privilege ¡ª and Sessions thus could not address ¡ª and fully answer questions about the others.   ¡°We expect that when you appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 18th, you will have determined whether the president will invoke executive privilege as to specific topics and will be prepared to answer completely all questions in those areas on which he has not,¡± the Democrats wrote. ¡°As to the former category, we will expect you to provide the Committee with a list of issues over which the privilege has affirmatively been asserted.¡± Civil liberties advocates said they hope legislators press, too, on the ways in which ¡ª in their view ¡ª Sessions has rolled back protections for LGBT people and diminished the department¡¯s emphasis on police reform across the country. The attorney general this month  that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not protect transgender people from workplace discrimination, and his Justice Department  who refused to bake a cake for a gay couple¡¯s wedding. Civil liberties advocates say his recent memo offering guidance on religious freedom essentially amounts to . Under his leadership, the department  Sessions, too, has , and he has  that instructs prosecutors to pursue the most serious, readily provable crimes, even if those might trigger stiff mandatory minimum sentences. He has been especially aggressive in cracking down on illegal immigration ¡ª even threatening to take certain grant money from certain so-called ¡°sanctuary cities,¡± though his efforts to do so have largely been blocked by federal courts. "
"  Joe Geeb didn¡¯t know if there was one shooter, or 30.When the call for a ¡°mass casualty incident¡± blasted through the radio Sunday night, the Clark County fire captain had no idea what was happening on the Las Vegas Strip, but he immediately began thinking about how he would run toward the bullets, the mayhem and the carnage while everyone else was running away.He quickly donned his flak vest and the helmet designed to withstand rifle fire and gunshots. Then he paused as a group of armed police officers created a protective bubble around him and other firefighters. Moving as one, the team hurled itself into the center of the chaos.¡°I knew the officers had my back, and I would have had theirs,¡± Geeb said. ¡°We¡¯re going to go in together, and we¡¯re going to come out together.¡±Relationships between the nation¡¯s police and fire departments can range from friendly rivalries to downright acrimony. In Las Vegas, officials are confident that an innovative effort requiring both agencies to train together to respond to active-shooter incidents saved countless lives in the massacre that left 58 dead.Fire departments traditionally have waited on the sidelines of shooting scenes until police declare it safe for medics to go in and treat victims. In some cases, including high-profile mass shootings, that resulted in wounded patients bleeding to death even though medics could have saved them with immediate aid.  Learning lessons from the shootings at Columbine High School outside Denver in 1999 and at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., in 2012, Nevada¡¯s first responders decided they should work while under fire.¡°We saw from the reports of how these people died and the lack of interaction with the police departments and we knew we had to fix that,¡± Clark County Fire Chief Greg Cassell said Thursday.Cassell said police and fire agencies in Nevada have been working together since 2010 to develop concerted responses to critical incidents, but Sunday was the first time their years of training and drills deploying ¡°rescue task forces¡± played out in real life.Sixteen such task forces raced into the concert venue the night gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, sending volleys of bullets down on a country music festival with 22,000 attendees, fire officials said.Each task force included four to six armed police officers, who created a perimeter around three paramedics, said Roy Session, the deputy chief of Clark County fire operations, who deployed the teams throughout the night. The medics treated and transported the wounded to ambulances under the blanket of safety those officers provided, moving in unison with police from patient to patient.¡°What we discovered in Columbine and Aurora is that people were laying and dying waiting for help,¡± Session said. ¡°This team was trying to avoid that.¡±The fire department has trained with police on skills including kicking down doors and treating patients in simulated live-fire environments, with blank rounds fired to ensure medics learn to do their lifesaving work while disrupted by the sound of gunfire.Sgt. Branden Clarkson, of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, was one of the many officers who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with firefighters at a Clark County fire department news conference Thursday to discuss Sunday¡¯s rescue efforts. A decade ago, officials said, it would have been unusual to have even a single police officer at a fire department event.¡°We have a joking relationship and a friendly rivalry, but when it comes down to it, we know we are there for each other,¡± said Clarkson, who heads the police department¡¯s efforts related to ¡°multi-assault counter-terrorism action capabilities.¡±Firefighters and medics faced several challenges Sunday as they responded to what they would later learn was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, Cassell said.People with gunshot wounds appeared at various hotels, but the calls were dispatched to first responders as a report of a shooter at each hotel. The calls initially generated more than 30 different possible shootings along the Strip.¡°That complicated our response,¡± Cassell said. ¡°We¡¯re starting to think, ¡®Uh-oh, we¡¯re having attacks at other locations.¡¯?¡±People scattered into hotels, to the tarmac of the airport and into neighborhoods, creating a response area that stretched about a mile.¡°It was not in one building, it was not in one spot, it was not in one address,¡± Cassell said. ¡°It was spread over a massive area.¡±  The fire department transported more than 200 people to area hospitals that night and treated victims suffering from gunshot wounds, fractures and trampling injuries from the stampede to escape the gunfire.Some of the injured were wounded further as they were transported out. In some cases, those escaping loaded the most-injured person in a group into a truck or car first because the individual could not move. But then other people would pile on top of that person to get out of the area. Geeb and his team at one point helped 10 people who had crammed into a compact car.¡°Then there was the emotional chaos,¡± said Geeb, whose team treated dozens of people on Sunday. He said people around him kept screaming: ¡°¡®Where is it coming from? What¡¯s happening? Where do I go?¡±No firefighter or medic was struck by gunfire or injured, except one who hurt his knee in a fall.Session said the response to Sunday¡¯s shooting was built on lessons learned from previous incidents, but training has focused on a shooter who is at ground level, not someone firing from an elevated position.He said the department is already breaking down its response to Sunday¡¯s shooting to determine how to adjust for the future.¡°Our goal is to learn from those lessons,¡± Session said. ¡°Hopefully, we won¡¯t have to use this again.¡±Cassell said that since Sunday¡¯s shooting, law enforcement agencies and emergency officials from all over the world have contacted him to commend him on the department¡¯s response and to ask for advice on how they can emulate it in the case of a similar incident.Although Sunday¡¯s shooting was nothing for which anyone could have ever planned, Cassell said, it was something police and fire were ready to handle. It all came down to preparation and relationships, Cassell said.¡°We love our cops, and they love us,¡± Cassell said. ¡°That paid off for us the other night¡±"
"Russian government hackers lifted details of U.S. cyber capabilities from a National Security Agency employee who was running Russian antivirus software on his computer, according to several individuals familiar with the matter.The employee had taken classified material home to work on it on his computer, and his use of Kaspersky Lab antivirus software enabled Russian hackers to see his files, the individuals said. The case, which dates to 2015 and has not been made public, remains under investigation by federal prosecutors.The NSA declined to comment on the breach, which was first reported by .The employee involved was a U.S. citizen born in Vietnam and had worked at Tailored Access Operations, the elite hacking division of the NSA that develops tools to penetrate computers overseas to gather foreign intelligence, said the individuals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing case. He was removed from the job in 2015, but was not thought to have taken the materials for malicious purposes such as handing them to a foreign spy agency, they said. The theft of the material enabled the Russian government to more easily detect and evade U.S. government cyberespionage operations, thwart defensive measures and track U.S. activities, the individuals said. It is the latest in a series of damaging breaches of the NSA in recent years and is among the first concrete indications of why the U.S. intelligence community believes that Kaspersky Lab software operates as a tool for Russian espionage.  The breach ¡°serves as a stark warning ¡ª not just to the federal government, but to states, local governments and the American public ¡ª of the serious dangers of using Kaspersky software,¡± said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), a vocal critic of Kaspersky who has pushed for the software¡¯s ban in federal networks. The material the employee took included hacking tools he was helping to develop to replace ?others that were considered compromised following the breach of NSA material by former contractor Edward Snowden, said one individual familiar with the matter.The Washington Post reported the 2015 removal of the employee last November.  The incident underscores the risks of using products as seemingly innocuous as antivirus software, which can be leveraged for national security purposes.The breach predates last year¡¯s arrest of former NSA contractor ?Harold T. Martin III, who was accused by officials of carrying out what is said to be the largest theft of classified information in U.S. history. Martin pleaded not guilty this year to violating the Espionage Act and is awaiting trial. The intelligence community has long assessed that Kaspersky has ties to the Russian government. A Russian law requires telecommunications companies in the country to provide access to their networks. Kaspersky¡¯s servers are located in Moscow, which means that customer data flowing through its servers passes through those same telecom providers¡¯ networks, a person familiar with the matter told The Post.Kaspersky Lab said in a statement that it ¡°does not have inappropriate ties to the Russian government.¡±¡°Kaspersky Lab has not been provided any evidence substantiating the company¡¯s involvement in the alleged incident,¡± the company said, ¡°and it is unfortunate that news coverage of unproven claims continue to perpetuate accusations about the company.¡±Last month, the U.S. government moved to ban the use of Kaspersky security software by federal agencies over concerns it had ties to Kremlin cyberespionage activities. The Department of Homeland Security ordered civilian agencies to identify Kaspersky Lab software on their networks and remove it after 90 days unless otherwise directed.The government said the move was done on the grounds that Kaspersky had connections to the Russian government and that its software posed a security risk. Months earlier, the General Services Administration removed Kaspersky from its list of approved vendors, suggesting a software vulnerability existed with Kaspersky that could give Moscow backdoor access to the very systems the company said it protects.¡°It¡¯s a lot harder to beat your opponent when they¡¯re reading your playbook, and it¡¯s even worse when someone on your team gives it to them,¡± said Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.). ¡°Russia is a clear adversary in cyberspace and we can¡¯t afford these self-inflicted injuries.¡±All antivirus products, including Kaspersky¡¯s, run in similar fashion. The product is placed on a client¡¯s computer to detect malicious software. To keep the detection capability up to date, the software routinely connects to the antivirus company. That connection is a double-edged sword. It allows the software to be updated, but it also provides an opportunity for the company to inspect files on the computer ¡ª and to remove them. At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in May, the chiefs of six major U.S. spy agencies all said they would not use Kaspersky software on their computers.The company¡¯s founder, Eugene Kaspersky, graduated from a KGB-supported cryptography school and had worked in Russian military intelligence.Shaheen has called for a hearing on the matter. ¡°The strong ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are extremely alarming and have been well documented for some time,¡± Shaheen said. ¡°It¡¯s astounding and deeply disturbing that the Russian government continues to have this tool at their disposal to harm the United States.¡±  "
" It was different in the light of day.There was no sound of blaring sirens, no ¡®pop, pop, pop¡¯ of gunfire, no screams.Just a quiet, sprawling lot of cars abandoned by those, like Kassidy Owen, who escaped with their lives.¡°It¡¯s strange to hear the silence,¡± Owen said, ¡°because all I remember was the noise.¡± The 22-year-old was one of dozens of concertgoers who returned to the scene of the Route 91 Harvest festival on Wednesday morning to retrieve the vehicles they left behind as they fled from a gunman raining down bullets from high above in the tower of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino across the street. Survivors of the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday needed their cars to move on with their lives ¡ª to get back to work, to school, home. It was the first time they were returning to a scene that would forever alter them, when joy and celebration and music turned into bloodshed and chaos and horror.Before they could move forward, they had to go back to the place where they thought they were going to die.On the night of the shooting, Owen texted her mother at 10:14.             Owen had run to her car to hide and had tried to drive away, but she couldn¡¯t. People were running, bodies dropped to the ground, and cars bottlenecked in the parking lot. During a brief pause during more than 10 minutes of gunfire, she worried the lights of her SUV made everyone inside a shining target.¡°¡®They¡¯re shooting again!¡¯?¡± her best friend¡¯s brother screamed. ¡°¡®Turn off the car!¡¯?¡±That¡¯s when she got out and fled.¡°I just remember slamming the door and running,¡± Owen said.    Now, nearly three days later, she was back, sitting in the driver¡¯s seat of her SUV. Her eyes were puffy and red. This was a long way from over.¡°You just keep hearing the gunshots in your head,¡± Owen said.Carlos Alfaro-Sandoval had jumped into the back of a police cruiser Wednesday morning with officers who escorted him through a lot cordoned off by police tape and fencing to look for his white truck. As he rode through, he noticed shattered glass on the ground, bullet holes in the concrete walls.¡°It should be in that back parking where they had all the employees park with all those white tents,¡± he told officers as they pulled up to a lot that was sectioned off. ¡°That¡¯s unfortunately going to be the closed lot,¡± the officer told him. ¡°They released cars from there but then the FBI thought there was going to be something related in the parking lot over there.¡±Alfaro-Sandoval worked as a bartender at the country music festival. Upon hearing the gunfire, he briefly took cover but decided he had to start moving. He left his truck, backpack and tip money and just ran.  ¡°I¡¯ve got a 4-month-old and a 7-year-old,¡± Alfaro-Sandoval said. ¡°That¡¯s why I ran.¡±He was hoping to reunite with his truck Wednesday to start returning to a routine life. Not being able to access it meant one thing: Having to return yet again some other day.¡°The sleep is not fun. You start seeing the little visions or hearing the pops and people falling and just blood,¡± Alfaro-Sandoval said. ¡°That¡¯s the worst part. We were just jumping over people who were laying down or trying to help people up, but they couldn¡¯t get up because they were .?.?. ¡±His voice trailed off, too traumatized to say it: dead.Before Wednesday, the last time Stephen Charshafian saw his maroon SUV, he and his wife were inside hoping to escape the rapid fire of bullets cutting through the night.There, the 59-year-old military veteran heard the strike of metal on metal. Charshafian knew that sound immediately. They weren¡¯t safe from the rounds hurling toward them.¡°It sounded like it had ripped right through the car,¡± Charshafian? said.He and his wife bailed and scrambled out into a neighborhood, leaving his wallet and cash inside the abandoned vehicle.Here he stood, again, on the same street where just days ago he had loaded wounded and bleeding concertgoers into the back of a Jeep and helped direct ambulances and traffic through the chaos. Charshafian choked back tears recalling the carnage and the brief moment he had been separated from his wife. Charshafian of Long Beach, Calif., had thought about moving to Las Vegas before the shooting because the schools are better, there¡¯s less graffiti, and it¡¯s a cleaner place. That¡¯s not going to happen now.¡°I don¡¯t want to stay any longer than I have to,¡± Charshafian said, his voice quaking. ¡°I need to get away from here.¡± Charshafian had gone back to the lot twice in previous days before he was able to retrieve his Ford SUV on Wednesday. After inspecting a small dent beneath the license plate ¡ª where it looked like a bullet left a scar ¡ª Charshafian and his wife hopped in, finally able to drive away."
" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson insisted Wednesday that he is not planning to quit, rebutting persistent reports of policy disputes and personal clashes with the White House. ¡°I have never considered leaving this post,¡± Tillerson said at an extraordinary and hastily called news conference at the State Department. Tillerson did not directly respond to an NBC News report earlier Wednesday that he had referred to President Trump as a ¡°moron.¡± ¡°I¡¯m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,¡± Tillerson said, adding that he does not understand what he called a Washington impulse to ¡°sow dissension¡± and undermine the administration¡¯s work. He called Trump ¡°smart¡± and committed to American security and the accountability of those around him. Trump responded quickly after Tillerson¡¯s appearance: ¡°The @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec. Tillerson and @VP Pence. It is #FakeNews. They should issue an apology to AMERICA!¡±In Las Vegas, after visiting a hospital, Trump told reporters he has ""total confidence in Rex. I have total confidence.""  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Tillerson and Trump spoke on the phone immediately after Tillerson spoke to reporters. She characterized the conversation as ""good,"" and said, ""They are all good."" She said Tillerson intends to stay on the job. ""The secretary never considered resigning from his post,"" she said, ""and for those who want him to do so, go ahead and keep pushing, because that will only strengthen his resolve."" Nauert also flatly denied that Tillerson had ever called Trump a ""moron."" She said Tillerson did not apologize, and one was not necessary. ""The secretary does not use that type of language,"" she said. ""The secretary did not use that type of language to speak about the president of the United States. The secretary does not use that language to speak about anyone. He did not say that."" Tillerson¡¯s public remarks came after months of disagreements between Tillerson and the White House over staffing and administrative matters at the State Department and a disconnect over what Trump saw as Tillerson¡¯s conventional approach to policy matters. Over the weekend,  on diplomatic relations with North Korea and its leader. Trump tweeted that the secretary of state was ¡°wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man¡± ¡ª his nickname for North Korea¡¯s Kim Jong Un. The former ExxonMobil chief executive¡¯s eight-month-long State Department tenure has been marked by what people close to the situation describe as tension over what Tillerson saw as Trump¡¯s impulse to cut him off at the knees on policy initiatives and what the White House increasingly saw as Tillerson¡¯s tendency to freelance. The NBC News report cited Tillerson¡¯s growing isolation from the administration and his personal anger at Trump. It quoted sources describing Tillerson as being on the verge of quitting in July. Vice President Pence gave Tillerson a ¡°pep talk¡± and told him that he needed to move forward with Trump¡¯s policies, NBC reported. Tillerson flatly denied Wednesday that Pence had intervened to talk him out of leaving and said persistent rumors of an impending exit had been ¡°misreported.¡± The rumors were widespread enough to earn a nickname: ¡°Rexit.¡± Pence spokesman Jarrod Agen said the assertion Pence and Tillerson had discussed his resignation was ""categorically false,"" and said that ""at no time did he and the secretary ever discuss the prospect of the secretary's resignation from the administration.""  ¡°My commitment to the success of our president and our country is as strong as it was the day I accepted his offer to serve as secretary of state,¡± Tillerson said Wednesday. ¡°President Trump¡¯s ¡®America first¡¯ agenda has given voice to millions who felt completely abandoned by the political status quo and who felt their interests came second to those of other countries.¡± Tillerson said he plans to stay in his job for as long as Trump wants him to. ¡°I serve at the appointment of the president, and I¡¯m here for as long as the president feels I can be useful in achieving his objectives,¡± he said.   Whispers about Tillerson being on the outs have circulated for months. White House officials have recently groused to associates outside the administration that Tillerson felt too free to speak or act on his own, without White House approval, and about what officials familiar with recent policy discussions called a worsening relationship with national security adviser H.R. McMaster. Tillerson also raised eyebrows with apparent criticism of  to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in August, which the president said had included many ¡°fine people.¡± Tillerson¡¯s pointed remark that ¡°the president speaks for himself¡± irked Trump, but did not provoke a crisis. Tillerson, 65, had spent his entire professional career at the company now known as ExxonMobil. An engineer by training, he had no government experience and no relationship with Trump before the newly elected Republican selected him as the nation¡¯s top diplomat last fall. ¡°He loves his country. He puts Americans and America first,¡± Tillerson said of his boss Wednesday. ¡°He¡¯s smart. He demands results wherever he goes, and he holds those around him accountable for whether they¡¯ve done the job he¡¯s asked them to do. Accountability is one of the bedrock values the president and I share.¡± Tillerson entered office as one of the mainstream foreign policy and national security voices around Trump, putting him at odds with Trump¡¯s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. He also held an uncertain balance of power with Trump¡¯s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whom Trump tasked with seeking Middle East peace and described as a key foreign policy adviser. Tillerson won some policy battles and lost others, most prominently over whether the United States should remain in the Paris climate accord and how to approach the looming threat from North Korea. Tillerson clashed with other Trump advisers over the administration¡¯s approach to the  and whether Trump should certify to Congress this month that the landmark agreement is in the U.S. national interest. Tillerson has argued internally that it is, despite what he calls serious flaws in the deal.  went public Tuesday with the same argument. But Trump has strongly suggested that he will go the other way and has chafed at being ¡°steered¡± toward what he views as an inauthentic position, several people familiar with the dispute said. Tillerson would not say Wednesday whether he agrees with Mattis, whose own position within the administration appears solid."
"Prosecutors in the bribery trial of Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) don¡¯t plan to call former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as a witness in their case, despite his presence at a key meeting in the corruption case, according to people familiar with the matter.The decision not to call Reid as a witness reflects the likely double-edged nature of his testimony. Though Reid, a Nevada Democrat, was a participant in a meeting in which Menendez pressured federal health officials to be more considerate of a longtime friend and major donor, Reid has also publicly praised Menendez, even after being drawn into the investigation.It¡¯s unclear if Menendez¡¯s legal team might call him as a defense witness. By not calling Reid, prosecutors apparently hope that jurors will be convinced by the accounts of others who were at the meeting, including former staffers and former health and human services secretary .Menendez is on trial in federal court in Newark, N.J., where prosecutors are expected to wrap up their case in the next week or two.Reid retired in January, ending a 34-year career in Congress during which he relished a reputation as a highly unpredictable speaker. Even his closest advisers acknowledged that sometimes when he went speak on the Senate floor, or before the press, they were never certain what he would say ¨C a penchant that served him well on Capitol Hill but one that makes any appearance on the witness stand a high-risk endeavor.Menendez, a powerful Democratic senator who once chaired the Foreign Relations Committee, is accused of using his office to do corrupt favors for a Florida eye doctor, Salomon Melgen. Prosecutors say that Melgen gave the senator private jet flights, a luxury hotel stay, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions, and in return the senator helped the doctor lobby the government on business and personal issues.  One of those efforts involved an $8.9 million dispute over how Melgen billed Medicare for applications of an eye drug. Sebelius testified that at an August 2012 meeting with Menendez and Reid in the then-majority leader¡¯s office, Menendez tried to convince her to change the billing policy that could cost Melgen millions of dollars.¡°I don¡¯t know exactly what [Menendez] wanted, just that he wanted me to do something,¡± Sebelius, a Kansas Democrat who led HHS from 2009 to 2014, testified. ¡°My definite impression was that he was very concerned that the policy was inconsistent and unfair and something should be done.¡±Menendez¡¯s lawyers have argued that he voiced concerns about a national policy issue - an appropriate action for someone with congressional oversight duties, and that he didn¡¯t even bring up Melgen¡¯s name during the meeting.The meeting in Reid¡¯s office is a central part of the government¡¯s case against Menendez.¡°It was unusual for Senator Reid to ask me to come to a meeting involving another member of Congress,¡± Sebelius said, adding it was the only time she could recall a member of Congress asking her to discuss a specific Medicare or Medicaid billing policy.By the time they met in Reid¡¯s office, Menendez had already tried and failed to get , to help with the issue. Prosecutors did call Harkin to testify against Menendez, but his account was a mixed bag ¨C he called his meeting with Menendez a ¡°courtesy¡¯¡¯ often extended to fellow lawmakers. Calling Reid as a witness against Menendez could have posed similar challenges for prosecutors. Back in 2015, after Reid was interviewed by the FBI but before Menendez was indicted, Reid publicly praised the senator, saying Menendez ¡°has done a stellar job as chair of the [Foreign Relations] committee, and as far as I am concerned, he¡¯s been an outstanding senator.¡¯¡¯ Paul Kane contributed to this report. Maimon reported from Newark."
"A federal judge dismissed the criminal case against Joe Arpaio on Wednesday and upheld President Trump¡¯s power to pardon the controversial former Arizona sheriff ¡ª although she left uncertain, for now, whether his conviction and other orders in the case will be vacated, according to Arpaio¡¯s defense attorney and other people involved in the case. Jack Wilenchik, an attorney for Arpaio, said U.S. District Judge Susan R. Bolton in Arizona rejected challenges to the pardon filed by outside groups and indicated that it was valid. Wilenchik said Bolton dismissed the case but did not immediately rule on a request to vacate all the orders in it, including Arpaio¡¯s conviction. Arpaio, 85, considers that step important to clearing his name, and it could have repercussions in civil lawsuits, Wilenchik said.   In July, Bolton found Arpaio guilty of criminal contempt for ignoring another judge¡¯s order to stop detaining people because he merely suspected them of being undocumented immigrants. He had yet to be sentenced. Arpaio had long been a controversial figure for his extreme views on immigration and for his forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and sleep outdoors in his Tent City jail. But he found an ally in Trump, on whose behalf he spoke at the Republican National Convention. As the case against Arpaio headed toward trial, Trump had asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions whether it would be possible to drop the matter. Advised that that option was not tenable, the president opted instead to pardon the former Maricopa County sheriff after his conviction. ¡°He¡¯s done a great job for the people of Arizona, he¡¯s very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration, he is loved in Arizona,¡± Trump said at the time. ¡°I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him, right before the election voting started.¡±Arpaio, who was first elected sheriff in 1993, was voted out of office in November.Most pardons are granted long after the recipients are convicted or sentenced, putting Arpaio in a somewhat atypical position. Pardons generally serve to forgive people, rather than to erase what they have done, and the Justice Department notes in guidance on its website that pardons do not remove convictions from a person¡¯s criminal record.But Arpaio had asserted his innocence and vowed to appeal. He asked the judge to thus vacate all her findings in the case ¡ª arguing that he would not be able to clear his name through the normal court process, nor would it be practical to do so. ¡°Because the President issued a pardon before sentencing and judgment ¡ª and clearly, before the conclusion of any appeals ¡ª the Court is obligated to vacate its verdict and all other orders in this matter, and to dismiss the case with prejudice,¡± Arpaio¡¯s attorneys wrote. ¡°Because Defendant will never have the benefit or opportunity to seek a reversal of the court¡¯s verdict through appeal (and a retrial by jury), it is only fair that the Court vacate its verdict and all other rulings in the case.¡±The Justice Department agreed with Arpaio¡¯s position, but several Democratic lawmakers and outside groups and legal scholars asked to intervene in the case, arguing that the pardon was unconstitutional and the guilty finding should not be vacated. Ian Bassin, executive director of the Protect Democracy Project, which had argued that the pardon was unconstitutional, said the judge felt bound by a 1925 Supreme Court case which affirmed the president¡¯s pardon power, but the decision was not an easy one. ¡°I think if the president continues to abuse his pardon power, you are likely to see courts take a very hard look at whether that century-old case got it wrong,¡± he said.

"A bipartisan group of lawmakers is seeking to impose a significant new restraint on law enforcement¡¯s access to data gathered by the National Security Agency under a powerful authority that enables collection of foreign intelligence on U.S. soil.The measure, contained in a bill unveiled Wednesday by the House Judiciary Committee, is likely to set up a clash with the Trump administration in the coming weeks, with the legal power set to expire at year¡¯s end. The administration wants the bill to be renewed without change ¡ª and permanently.At the same time, civil liberties groups are arguing for stronger limits.The law in question is often referred to as Section 702, a portion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amended in 2008. Its renewal is the intelligence community¡¯s highest legislative priority this year.Section 702 ¡°is the single most important operational statute that the NSA has,¡± NSA general counsel Glenn Gerstell said recently. ¡°There is no replacement for it.¡±  House members generally agree that the authority is useful and that it should be renewed. But a number of them have one major privacy concern: The law allows the FBI to query the Section 702 database for emails and phone-call transcripts of Americans without first obtaining a warrant.A range of lawmakers, from tea party Republicans to civil-libertarian Democrats ¡ª as well as some former senior intelligence officials ¡ª say that the Trump administration should consider the privacy implications of tapping the surveillance database for U.S. citizens¡¯ communications.  The Judiciary Committee¡¯s bill, which would renew Section 702 for six years, would not restrict the query process itself. But the legislation, called the USA Liberty Act, would require the FBI to obtain a warrant to review any communications that are returned in response to a query seeking evidence of a crime. The drafting of the bill was led by the panel¡¯s chairman and vice chairman, Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) and John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.).The new limit seeks to address lawmakers¡¯ concern that the FBI is able to see communications that agents ordinarily would need a warrant to review, congressional aides said. It would not apply to queries for counterterrorism, counterproliferation or counterespionage purposes, they said.¡°It leaves the NSA, CIA and the intelligence arm of the FBI largely untouched,¡± said one aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the record.For law enforcement officials, imposing a limit on access as opposed to the query itself is a distinction without a difference.In July, the head of the FBI¡¯s national security branch,  that the bureau would not risk the authority by using Section 702 on something ¡°that was not of critical national security importance to us.¡± In such cases, he said, a warrant requirement would ¡°have a significantly negative impact on operations¡± and undermine the ability to find important information that could save lives. A coalition of civil liberties groups issued a letter Tuesday saying that anything short of a warrant requirement for all queries would ¡°undermine constitutional protections and create an unacceptable loophole to access Americans¡¯ communications in criminal and foreign intelligence investigations alike.¡±Michael V. Hayden, who has headed the NSA and the CIA, said that ¡°there are legitimate concerns with how the data is accessed, particularly when using U.S. person selectors¡± such as phone numbers and email addresses. ¡°I can understand concerns when those selectors are used for law enforcement as opposed to foreign intelligence purposes,¡± he said. ¡°So my advice to the community is to hear those concerns out and to act accordingly.¡±If the FBI wants to read emails for a murder or money-laundering investigation, for instance, ¡°there may be a need to involve the court in one way or another,¡± Hayden said.Senior government officials said that as a legal matter, no warrant is required to query data already collected lawfully. At least three federal district courts and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court have agreed with that position. One appeals court has sidestepped the issue, and a second has yet to rule.Nonetheless, the officials acknowledged, the policy question of whether a warrant requirement is a good idea has not been resolved.  Congress passed Section 702 in 2008 to give the NSA more agility in detecting terrorist threats and to gather information on a host of other foreign intelligence matters. It was a reaction to the outcry over the disclosure of a warrantless surveillance program begun by the George W. Bush administration after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has introduced a bill that would give the administration a clean, permanent reauthorization. But given the political alliance in the House, renewing Section 702 without change is unlikely. And a number of lawmakers in both chambers are likely to insist on an opportunity to revisit the legislation in several years.Sens. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) are working on Section 702 legislation that does not go as far as the House bill in imposing new limits but does include an expiration date. Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) are planning to introduce a bill in the coming weeks that goes further than the House bill by requiring a warrant for all queries related to U.S. persons in Section 702 data.Under the current law, the NSA can target the communications of foreigners overseas if they fall into any of a number of broad, court-approved categories of foreign intelligence. They include counterterrorism, counterproliferation, cybersecurity and foreign powers.In 2016, the NSA targeted 106,000 such foreigners, working through companies such as Yahoo and Microsoft. All the people the foreign targets corresponded with also had their communications picked up. This is called ¡°incidental¡± collection.  Some lawmakers, including Conyers and Goodlatte, have been pressing the intelligence community for years to provide even a rough estimate of the number of Americans whose communications are incidentally gathered. Last month, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats told Wyden that doing so would ¡°cause serious damage to national security.¡±Officials said they operate under strict guidelines and layers of oversight. To query the 702 database using a U.S. person¡¯s email address or phone number, the analyst must document the foreign intelligence reason for the query, and compliance personnel and NSA lawyers must approve the search before it is executed. The Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence also review the queries.That material has proved enormously helpful, officials say, in everything from identifying malicious hackers from foreign governments to determining whether a U.S. company was knowingly about to ship weapons material to a country under sanctions.Section 702 also has been useful in understanding Russia¡¯s efforts to interfere in the U.S. election last year. In May, NSA Director Michael S. Rogers said that ¡°much of what was in the intelligence community¡¯s assessment¡± on that effort ¡°was informed by knowledge we gained through 702 authority.¡±The House bill also would codify a ban on a subset of Section 702 surveillance that the NSA recently ended voluntarily after the intelligence court raised concerns. It would change the procedure by which U.S. government officials request the ¡°unmasking¡± of U.S. persons¡¯ identities in foreign intelligence reporting. It would also enhance criminal penalties for the mishandling of classified information and extend whistleblower protections to private contractors working for the intelligence community.   "
"A federal judge in Maryland early Wednesday issued a second halt on the latest version of President Trump¡¯s travel ban, asserting that the president¡¯s own comments on the campaign trail and on Twitter convinced him that the directive was akin to an unconstitutional Muslim ban.U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang issued a somewhat less complete halt on the ban than his counterpart in Hawaii did a day earlier, blocking the administration from enforcing the directive only on those who lacked a ¡°bona fide¡± relationship with a person or entity in the United States, such as family members or some type of professional or other engagement in the United States.  But in some ways, Chuang¡¯s ruling was more personally cutting to Trump, as he said the president¡¯s own words cast his latest attempt to impose a travel blockade as the ¡°inextricable re-animation of the twice-enjoined Muslim ban.¡±Omar Jadwat, who directs of the ACLU¡¯s Immigrants¡¯ Rights Project and represented those suing in Maryland over the ban, said: ¡°Like the two versions before it, President Trump¡¯s latest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core. And like the two before it, this one is going down to defeat in the courts.¡±The third iteration of Trump¡¯s travel ban had been set to go fully into effect early Wednesday, barring various types of travelers from Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, Chad, Somalia, North Korea and Venezuela. Even before Chuang¡¯s ruling, though, a federal judge in Hawaii stopped it ¡ª at least temporarily ¡ª for all of the countries except North Korea and Venezuela.That judge, Derrick K. Watson, blocked the administration from enforcing the measure on anyone from the six countries, not just those with a ¡°bona fide¡± U.S. tie. But his ruling did not address whether Trump¡¯s intent in imposing the directive was to discriminate against Muslims. He said the president had merely exceeded the authority Congress had given him in immigration law.The Justice Department already had vowed to appeal Watson¡¯s ruling, which the White House said ¡°undercuts the President¡¯s efforts to keep the American people safe and enforce minimum security standards for entry into the United States.¡± Both Watson¡¯s temporary restraining order and Chuang¡¯s preliminary injunction are also interim measures, meant to maintain the status quo as the parties continue to argue the case.The administration had cast the new measure as one that was necessary for national security, implemented only after officials conducted an extensive review of the information they needed to vet those coming to the United States. Those countries that were either unwilling or unable to produce such information even after negotiation, officials have said, were included on the banned list.¡°These restrictions are vital to ensuring that foreign nations comply with the minimum security standards required for the integrity of our immigration system and the security of our Nation,¡± the White House said after Watson¡¯s ruling. ¡°We are therefore confident that the Judiciary will ultimately uphold the President¡¯s lawful and necessary action and swiftly restore its vital protections for the safety of the American people.¡±Like Watson¡¯s order, Chuang¡¯s 91-page ruling also found Trump had exceeded his authority under immigration law, but only partially.The order ¡ª which has ¡°no specified end date and no requirement of renewal¡± ¡ª violated a nondiscrimination provision in the law in that it blocked immigrants to the United States based on their nationality, Chuang wrote.But Chuang said he could not determine, as Watson did, that Trump had violated a different part of federal immigration law requiring him to find entry of certain nonimmigrant travelers would be ¡°detrimental¡± to U.S. interests before blocking them.Chuang instead based much of his ruling on his assessment that Trump intended to ban Muslims, and thus his order had run afoul of the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. When Trump was a presidential candidate in December 2015, Chuang wrote, he had promised a ¡°complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,¡± and all of his comments since then seemed to indicate his various travel bans were meant to fulfill that promise.After his second ban was blocked, Chuang wrote, Trump described the measure as a ¡°watered down version¡± of his initial measure, adding, ¡°we ought go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place.¡± The president had then revoked and replaced his first travel ban, which had also been held up in court.In August, with courts still weighing the second version, Chuang noted that Trump ¡°endorsed what appears to be an apocryphal story involving General John J. Pershing and a purported massacre of Muslims with bullets dipped in a pig¡¯s blood, advising people to ¡®study what General Pershing .?.?. did to terrorists when caught.¡¯?¡±  In September, as authorities worked on a new directive, Trump wrote on Twitter ¡°the travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific ¡ª but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!¡±Chuang had  on what the government would have to do to make the new ban legal, and he noted in his ruling that the new directive had changed from the previous iterations. The government, for example, had undertaken a review process before inking the new measure, and had added two non-Muslim majority countries to the banned list.But Chuang wrote that he was unmoved that government had simply relied on the results of their review, and instead believed they made ¡°certain subjective determinations that resulted in a disproportionate impact on majority-Muslim nations.¡± He wrote that the government offered ¡°no evidence, even in the form of classified information submitted to the Court, showing an intelligence-based terrorism threat justifying a ban on entire nationalities,¡± and asserted that even the new measure ¡°generally resembles President Trump¡¯s earlier description of the Muslim ban.¡±¡°The ¡®initial¡¯ announcement of the Muslim ban, offered repeatedly and explicitly through President Trump¡¯s own statements, forcefully and persuasively expressed his purpose in unequivocal terms,¡± Chuang wrote.The suits in federal court in Maryland had been brought by 23 advocacy groups and seven people who said they would be negatively impacted by the new ban.

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday morning at what is expected to be a wide ranging hearing ¡ª covering everything from Sessions¡¯s dramatic shift of the Justice Department¡¯s stance on several legal issues to his conversations with the president about former FBI director James B. Comey. Sessions¡¯s appearance at the Judiciary Committee¡¯s regular Justice Department oversight hearing will offer senators from both political parties the opportunity to grill their former colleague, who now serves as the nation¡¯s top law enforcement official.  Sessions has taken the department in a significantly different direction than did his predecessors in the Obama administration, and he is sure to be asked to justify many of his recent decisions ¡ª especially on his interpretation of federal law as it relates to the DACA program, the Affordable Care Act and discrimination against transgender people. Sessions was the public face of the decision to wind down the DACA program, which granted a reprieve from deportation to people who came to the U.S. without documentation when they were children. He has asserted the program could not withstand legal challenges. Sessions also laid out the legal underpinnings for the Trump administration to create , and he paved the way for . Legislators, who could get involved to save DACA or replace or in some way change the Affordable Care Act, are likely to press the attorney general on how he came to the legal conclusions that he did, and to what extent his and his department¡¯s assertions about the law might have been influenced by the president¡¯s policy agenda or his own political views. Democrats also have warned Sessions they expect him to answer questions about his conversations with President Trump, especially as they might relate to the firing of Comey and the ongoing investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential race. Sessions is recused from that case and, at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in June, he refused to detail his conversations with the president. But Democrats have questioned his rationale for not providing at least some information. In a letter to Sessions last week, they said the attorney general needed to formally identify the topics over which Trump would assert executive privilege ¡ª and Sessions thus could not address ¡ª and fully answer questions about the others.   ¡°We expect that when you appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 18th, you will have determined whether the president will invoke executive privilege as to specific topics and will be prepared to answer completely all questions in those areas on which he has not,¡± the Democrats wrote. ¡°As to the former category, we will expect you to provide the Committee with a list of issues over which the privilege has affirmatively been asserted.¡± Civil liberties advocates said they hope legislators press, too, on the ways in which ¡ª in their view ¡ª Sessions has rolled back protections for LGBT people and diminished the department¡¯s emphasis on police reform across the country. The attorney general this month  that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not protect transgender people from workplace discrimination, and his Justice Department  who refused to bake a cake for a gay couple¡¯s wedding. Civil liberties advocates say his recent memo offering guidance on religious freedom essentially amounts to . Under his leadership, the department  Sessions, too, has , and he has  that instructs prosecutors to pursue the most serious, readily provable crimes, even if those might trigger stiff mandatory minimum sentences. He has been especially aggressive in cracking down on illegal immigration ¡ª even threatening to take certain grant money from certain so-called ¡°sanctuary cities,¡± though his efforts to do so have largely been blocked by federal courts.

"Islamic State fighters fleeing their , have left behind an?unprecedented array of deadly improvised explosive devices, U.S. officials say, forecasting what¡¯s expected to be a years-long effort to purge them.Only about 100 militants remain in the city, but the sophisticated explosives they¡¯ve rigged are slowing efforts to declare a full victory there and could pose grave challenges for Raqqa¡¯s residents as they begin to rebuild after the months-long battle to expel the Islamic State.¡°The fight in Raqqa is as much about the fight against IEDs as a fight against ISIS,¡± Army Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in Syria and Iraq, told Pentagon reporters by teleconference Tuesday. He echoed remarks made recently by a commander with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the principal group opposing?the Islamic State?there.The weapons?range from hastily rigged bombs to hidden pressure plates and motion-activated explosives. They have been found under floors, concealed in ovens and drawers, and attached to corpses and children¡¯s toys.In at least one instance, a teddy bear was rigged to explode.The threat lurks with every step?made by troops fighting to liberate the city and the Raqqa Internal Security Force, a local policing unit of about 1,600 that will try to keep the peace there once the offensive ends. Its commander, Idris Khan, was killed by an IED strike Monday. Two SDF soldiers also died in the blast, Dillon said.  ¡°The use of IEDs and explosives is more dense?than other cities we¡¯ve seen in this campaign,¡± Dillon told The Washington Post in an interview, including the Iraqi cities of Mosul, Ramadi and Fallujah. All those cities were heavily mined by?Islamic State fighters looking to kill coalition troops sweeping through them?to reassert government control.Surpassing the scope of rigged munitions in Mosul would be significant. Following its liberation, United Nations and U.S. State Department assessments concluded that? to remove the remaining explosives. It is unclear when such assessments will be made for Raqqa.The U.N. estimated that 300,000 people have fled Raqqa since before the offensive there began in April.?Between?10,000 and 25,000 remained?as of August; exact figures are impossible to calculate.Soon, the State Department will lead?five multiagency teams into Raqqa, where they¡¯ll help identify and clear munitions and provide humanitarian assistance, an?official there said on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter openly. As part of that, officials will educate returning residents?about the weapons¡¯ hazards, the official said.  They face a problem three years in the making. Bomb builders have circulated?lessons and best practices from Iraq and Afghanistan during the reign of ISIS in Raqqa, creating a de facto laboratory for experts to hone their craft.That expertise will also challenge members of Raqqa¡¯s police force, who receive 10?to 15 days of general training which includes?basic counter-IED instruction, Dillon said. It does not include how to defuse and remove the weapons. Some receive additional training focused on such skills, he added, but he was unsure whether the Pentagon is providing any specialized safety?equipment such as bomb suits or robots.The lack of experience among the forces concerns Matthew Hefti, a former Air Force bomb technician with two deployments each to Afghanistan and Iraq.?Bombers often target what troops call fatal funnels ¡ª confined places such as hallways, stairwells and doorways. So those tasked with clearing bombs will need to study those places to identify where the militants may have safely ventured.¡°You have to be unpredictable,¡± Hefti said. ¡°You have to do the opposite of what the bomber thinks you¡¯ll do.¡±"
"A federal judge on Tuesday largely blocked the Trump administration from implementing the latest version of the president¡¯s controversial travel ban, setting up yet another legal showdown on the extent of the executive branch¡¯s powers when it comes to setting immigration policy.The decision from U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson in Hawaii is sure to be appealed, but for now, it means that the administration cannot restrict the entry of travelers from six of the eight countries that officials said were unable or unwilling to provide information that the United States wanted to vet the countries¡¯ citizens.The  was set to go fully into effect in the early hours of Wednesday, barring various types of travelers from Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, Chad, Somalia, North Korea and Venezuela. Watson¡¯s order stops it, at least temporarily, with respect to all the countries except North Korea and Venezuela.In a  granting the state of Hawaii¡¯s request for a temporary restraining order nationwide, Watson wrote that the latest ban ¡°suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor.¡±Watson also wrote that the executive order ¡°plainly discriminates based on nationality¡± in a way that is opposed to federal law and ¡°the founding principles of this Nation.¡±The White House said in a  that Watson¡¯s ¡°dangerously flawed¡± order ¡°undercuts the President¡¯s efforts to keep the American people safe and enforce minimum security standards for entry into the United States.¡±¡°These restrictions are vital to ensuring that foreign nations comply with the minimum security standards required for the integrity of our immigration system and the security of our Nation,¡± the White House said. ¡°We are therefore confident that the Judiciary will ultimately uphold the President¡¯s lawful and necessary action and swiftly restore its vital protections for the safety of the American people.¡±The State Department said that it instructed embassies and consulates across the globe to resume regular processing of visas for people from the six countries but that it would implement the order for those affected from Venezuela and North Korea. Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said government lawyers would appeal the judge¡¯s decision in an ¡°expeditious manner.¡±¡°Today¡¯s ruling is incorrect, fails to properly respect the separation of powers, and has the potential to cause serious negative consequences for our national security,¡± he said.Opponents of the ban, though, hailed the judge¡¯s ruling. Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said, ¡°Today is another victory for the rule of law. We stand ready to defend it.¡±Omar Jadwat, who directs the ACLU¡¯s Immigrants¡¯ Rights Project and was involved in a separate challenge to the ban in federal court in Maryland, said, ¡°We¡¯re glad, but not surprised, that President Trump¡¯s illegal and unconstitutional Muslim ban has been blocked once again.¡±Trump was blocked by courts from imposing his last two versions of the travel ban, but the ultimate question of whether he ever had the authority to implement such a measure remains somewhat murky.The Supreme Court had been scheduled to hear arguments on his second travel ban, , which barred the entry of citizens from six majority-Muslim countries and refugees from everywhere. But a key portion of that ban expired and Trump issued his latest ban before the hearing.That prompted the justices to remove oral arguments from the calendar. They later  to the March version of the ban.Federal appeals courts had ruled against the Trump administration on the last measure, and Watson relied in part on the precedent from one of those cases in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. The Supreme Court, though, had vacated the precedent from the other ruling that went against the administration in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.  The state of Hawaiit and others who sued over the March travel ban  in federal courts in Hawaii, Washington state and Maryland. They argued that Trump had exceeded his legal authority to set immigration policy and that the latest measure ¡ª like the last two ¡ª fulfilled his unconstitutional campaign promise to implement a Muslim ban.  ¡°It exceeds the limits on the President¡¯s exclusion authority that have been recognized for nearly a century, by supplanting Congress¡¯s immigration policies with the President¡¯s own unilateral and indefinite ban,¡± the challengers in Hawaii wrote of the new ban. ¡°And it continues to effectuate the President¡¯s unrepudiated promise to exclude Muslims from the United States.¡±Hawaii asked a judge to block the ban with respect to all the majority-Muslim countries; the state¡¯s lawyers did not challenge the measures imposed against Venezuela and North Korea.Watson did not address whether the ban was constitutional; rather, he limited his analysis to whether Trump had exceeded the authority Congress has given the president to impose restrictions on those wanting to enter the United States. Of particular concern, he said, were that officials seemed to treat someone¡¯s nationality as an indicator of the threat the person poses ¡ª without providing evidence of a connection between the two.Watson said that the order did ¡°not reveal why existing law is insufficient to address the President¡¯s described concerns¡± and that it was internally flawed ¡ª for example, by exempting Iraq from the banned list even though Iraq failed the U.S. government¡¯s security assessment.Legal analysts had said challengers of the latest travel ban would face an uphill battle, particularly because the measure was put into effect after an extensive process in which the United States negotiated with other countries for information.Such a process, legal analysts said, presumably would help the government defeat arguments that the president had not made the appropriate findings to justify his order. The list of countries affected also was changed to include two countries that are not majority Muslim ¡ª Venezuela and North Korea ¡ª potentially helping the government argue that the measure was not meant to discriminate against Muslims.Challengers to the ban, however, sought to link the new directive to its predecessors, and they asserted that even the additions were mainly symbolic.  The directive imposed more complete bans on some countries than on others.For Syria and North Korea, the president¡¯s proclamation blocked immigrants wanting to relocate to the United States and nonimmigrants wishing to visit in some capacity. For Iran, the proclamation blocked both immigrants and nonimmigrants, although it exempted students and those participating in a cultural exchange.The proclamation blocked people from Chad, Libya and Yemen from coming to the United States as immigrants or on business or tourist visas, and it blocked people from Somalia from coming as immigrants. The proclamation named Venezuela, but it only blocked certain government officials. Carol Morello contributed to this report.        "
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions is setting up a unit in the Justice Department to oversee a policy he reinstated to help state and local police take cash and property from people suspected of a crime, even if they have not been charged.Sessions came under fire from Democratic and Republican lawmakers when he announced the policy in July because of concerns about abuse in earlier incarnations of the asset forfeiture program. In a memo Tuesday, Sessions directed Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to hire a director to review all aspects of the department¡¯s policy and take action if problems arise.¡°The asset forfeiture program has proven to be extremely valuable to law enforcement in our country, but it has received certain criticisms,¡± Sessions wrote in his memo.Sessions this summer reversed  to stop the program. Two years ago, Holder barred state and local police from using federal law to seize cash and other property without criminal charges or warrants.Since 2008, thousands of police agencies across the country made more than 55,000 seizures of cash and property worth $3?billion under the program, which allowed local and state police to make seizures and then share the proceeds with federal agencies.The Sessions policy reauthorizes what is called federal ¡°adoption¡± of assets that state and local police seize ¡ª when the alleged conduct that led to the seizures appears to violate federal law.When Sessions announced the policy last summer, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) criticized the move, calling it ¡°a troubling step backward.¡± Holder said it was ¡°another extremist action,¡± and the American Civil Liberties Union called it ¡°outrageous.¡±¡°It¡¯s nice to see at least some acknowledgment that civil forfeiture is in need of increased oversight, but the changes really don¡¯t go far enough and the core problem still remains,¡± Issa said in a statement Tuesday. ¡°Americans are still going to have their property taken from them, without due process, at record rates.¡±A Washington Post investigation in 2014 found that since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, state and local police had seized almost $2.5 billion from motorists and others without search warrants or indictments. Police routinely stopped drivers for minor traffic infractions, pushed them to agree to searches without warrants and then seized large amounts of cash when there was no evidence the drivers had done anything wrong, The Post¡¯s series found.There was little oversight on how the police spent the money, according to The Post¡¯s investigation. Sometimes they bought luxury vehicles, high-powered firearms and armored cars.  But Rosenstein said that the Justice Department would ensure there were safeguards to prevent abuse. He told reporters in July that police departments will have to tell property owners about their rights and the status of the seizures. Police will also be required to detail the probable cause for the seizures, Rosenstein said.Rosenstein¡¯s new director will oversee and manage compliance of both civil and criminal asset forfeiture and ¡°promptly review¡± complaints from judges, attorneys, defendants or others and ¡°take appropriate action,¡± according to Sessions¡¯s memo.¡°The Asset Forfeiture Program is one of the most effective tools Congress has provided the Department of Justice to fight crime, combat cartels and other transnational criminal organizations and take the profit out of crime,¡± Sessions wrote. ¡°The American people and Congress must know this program is being administered professionally, lawfully and in a manner consistent with sound public policy.¡±"
"U.S. prosecutors have charged two Chinese nationals who sold fentanyl to American customers over the Internet in a massive international conspiracy case, the Justice Department announced Tuesday. The case is unique, the department said, because the men are the first Chinese-based fentanyl manufacturers and distributors to be slapped with a label reserved for those who have control of the most prolific international drug-trafficking and money-laundering organizations.  Prosecutors identified the men charged in the case as Xiaobing Yan, 40, and Jian Zhang, 38.Yan, the Justice Department alleged, operated websites selling fentanyl directly to U.S. customers and also ran at least two chemical plants in China that were capable of producing tons of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. The department said that Zhang similarly ran an enterprise that made ?fentanyl in at least four labs in China and that he advertised and sold fentanyl over the Internet.At a news conference held to announce the charges, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein said the cases ¡°mark a major milestone in our battle to stop deadly fentanyl from entering the United States.¡± The men were labeled ¡°consolidated priority organization targets¡± and are the first Chinese-based manufacturers to be given the designation.It is unclear whether they could ever be brought to the United States to face charges. Rosenstein said that China has no extradition treaty with the United States but that U.S. authorities would share the evidence in the case with their Chinese counterparts and are ¡°optimistic¡± that the Chinese would take action.Rosenstein said he was in China two weeks ago to meet with China¡¯s minister of public security about fentanyl and other issues.¡°They are, in fact, helping us, but we need them to do more,¡± he said.Federal authorities have long warned of the dangers of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that often contributes to overdoses and is sometimes added to heroin and cocaine. The substance is so dangerous, authorities have said, that it has.Rosenstein said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that more than 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl and fentanyl analogues in 2016. Investigators think nearly all of it and its components originate in China, he said.The cases against Yan and Zhang originated domestically. In Yan¡¯s case, Rosenstein said, a 2013 traffic stop in Mississippi helped uncover a drug ring selling bath salts, and investigators working that case identified Yan as a distributor of several illegal drugs.His illicit work, Rosenstein alleged, spanned at least six years and included monitoring legislation and law enforcement activities in the United States and China to try to evade prosecution. Fentanyl¡¯s chemical structure, Rosenstein said, can be modified to create analogues that are inside the bounds of U.S. and Chinese law. Federal agents identified more than 100 distributors of synthetic opioids in Yan¡¯s network, Rosenstein said.Investigators were tipped to Zhang, he said, as they investigated the 2015 death of an 18-year-old who had overdosed on fentanyl in North Dakota. Tracing the source of the substance that killed the teenager took those working the case through Oregon, Canada and eventually to Zhang in China, Rosenstein said.Authorities found that Zhang had shipped thousands of packages of fentanyl and other drugs to the United States since January 2013, Rosenstein said. Charges against him included conduct resulting in the deaths of four people from New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota and Oregon in 2014 and 2015, prosecutors said.Prosecutors said that Zhang and Yan were charged with conspiracy to distribute drugs and related counts and that 21 people have been indicted on drug charges as part of the investigation.If convicted, Yan would face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison; Zhang would face life in prison, prosecutors said."
"Dozens of Islamic State militants were killed Monday by U.S. airstrikes targeting training camps in?Yemen, the first time the group has been targeted in a country historically traversed by al-Qaeda loyalists, American officials said.The camps in?Al Bayda governorate were used to train militants on the use of small arms, according to the Pentagon. Officials confirmed Tuesday this marks the first time U.S. forces have targeted ISIS elements there.Al Bayda is a?sprawling region southeast of the capital, Sanaa, that has been the focus of ongoing U.S. military action.?The first drone strikes of the Trump administration  in January.

U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the region, said the strikes were the first time ISIS fighters have been targeted in Yemen.The country?has become a beacon for militant activity?since the?collapse of the country¡¯s government in 2014, when Shiite Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, forced then-Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi to flee.Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has led an Arab coalition that has attacked?Houthi positions, leading to accusations of indiscriminate bombings and civilian deaths.

"A long-awaited overhaul of veterans¡¯ health care is being unveiled to the world. At the helm throughout the two years of developing this road map has been David J. Shulkin.As the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is finally on the cusp of rolling out its master plan to ensure every veteran has access to timely, quality care, the VA secretary reportedly is interviewing for another job. As the Wall Street Journal , the White House brought Shulkin in last week to discuss having him take over the Department of Health and Human Services, a post left vacant by the .?(VA did not confirm or deny the Journal¡¯s reporting.)  There is a lot of unfinished business in VA, requiring knowledgeable leadership. The White House cannot sacrifice that even if direction is needed elsewhere in the .Shulkin was drafted from the private sector in 2015 to tackle VA¡¯s access crisis as it was being blamed for killing veterans stuck on secret wait lists, forced to line up for months before being seen. He was appointed undersecretary of VA¡¯s Veterans Health Administration by President Barack Obama and promoted 18 months later to VA secretary after President Trump was elected. With veterans organizations¡¯ enthusiastic support, the Senate confirmed Shulkin 100-0 in February.During an otherwise chaotic time in Washington, the transition of power has been smooth at VA. Shulkin was already intimately aware of the challenges he faced coming in, having worked closely with his predecessor Bob McDonald. That experience mattered in understanding the VA as well as the relationships with Congress and the veteran communities and organizations within it.Shulkin elevated his top aides to seamlessly backfill. While other agencies struggled through drastic change, VA benefited from continuity. The result is perhaps the most productive first year among any of President Trump¡¯s Cabinet-level positions.Now the prospect of VA losing its chief at this critical time is alarming. But significantly compounding the concern is that two of Shulkin¡¯s top lieutenants just quit. Both were driving creation of the new ¡°CARE¡± plan, which stands for Coordinated Access and Rewarding Experiences, a multibillion-dollar strategy to ensure access for veterans who live far from VA facilities or near VA medical centers that are over capacity or underperforming.Poonam Allaigh and Baligh Yehia  within the past few weeks. Alleigh was VA¡¯s acting undersecretary for health since Shulkin was promoted, and Yehia ran VA¡¯s network of community medical providers. Both joined the organization in 2015, commissioned to fix a broken system.CARE is the product of more than two years of collaboration by VA, veterans service organizations and other stakeholders. Much of the plan, expected to be released this month, contains a lot of vagueness, outlining policies but leaving the creation and implementation of regulations up to the VA secretary?¡ª?someone, it is hoped, intimately involved in its creation. We?cannot leave formation of these regulations to a person who was not integral in establishing overall strategy.  VA has three major pillars: health care, veterans benefits and cemeteries. Each is vital to the government keeping its promise to veterans and their families, so each is supposed to be led by an undersecretary confirmed by Congress. But President Trump has yet to nominate anyone for VHA or the Veterans Benefits Administration.?If the administration does not move wisely, it will create a dangerous leadership void in an agency that the president often says is among his most important.There is no doubt the top post at Health and Human Services is vital to every American, given the raging debate over the future of health-care insurance, certainly including veterans. There is little doubt Shulkin is qualified. But the timing is dangerous to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the millions of veterans who depend on it.As a veteran, I would never leave my compatriots behind. I hope Shulkin feels the same way."
"One of the country¡¯s leading gun-control groups changed its name Tuesday from Americans for Responsible Solutions to , the name of the former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head in 2011 and founded the group two years later after 20 Connecticut first-graders were killed.Gun-control advocates said the name change is part of a larger effort to reframe the gun debate in the wake of the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas. By focusing on former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords as a symbol of ¡°courage,¡± they are hoping to draw in more people to fight for stronger firearms laws.¡°It will be a long, hard haul, but I¡¯m optimistic,¡± Giffords said in an interview with her husband, Mark Kelly, from their home in Tucson.¡°It is about the courage of single individuals, but also the courage of members of Congress and state legislators to stand up to the gun lobby and focus on this like they never have before,¡± said Kelly, a former astronaut and co-founder of the group. ¡°If we don¡¯t have the courage to talk about this .?.?. we¡¯re going to have another Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, another shooting like we saw in Vegas.¡±Kelly traveled to Las Vegas last week and met with the families of two women with injuries similar to those suffered by his wife. ¡°These two young women have serious traumatic brain injuries and a long road ahead of them,¡± Kelly said. ¡°And I¡¯ve been there before. Their lives have been completely changed forever. They are going through something very similar to what Gabby and I went through. I wanted to let them know to count on me if they need any advice. It¡¯s a sad, sad situation.¡±Kelly and Giffords, both gun owners, released a  Tuesday that they made with former president Barack Obama, Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) and retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a former U.S. Army general who commanded the Joint Special Operations Command for five years.¡°People say we can never take the guns out of society completely,¡± McChrystal says on the video. ¡°Well, I don¡¯t think many people are calling for that. I think what we¡¯re calling for is the kinds of things that bring sanity back.¡±After every mass shooting, gun-control groups have urged lawmakers to pass stronger background checks and tighten other gun laws. Gun rights advocates resist, nothing happens in Congress and the same pattern repeats itself after the next event.  Kelly and Giffords, both gun owners, said that cycle can be broken, if only incrementally at first. They pointed out that after the Las Vegas shooting, members of Congress, including Republicans, called for legislation to restrict or prohibit ¡°bump stocks.¡± Stephen Paddock, firing from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, had used bump stocks to accelerate the gunfire from his rifles, killing 58 people and injuring more than 500 attending a music festival on the Strip below.¡°To me, that is counter to the argument that a lot of them make all the time,¡± Kelly said. ¡°Their argument often is, ¡®Legislation doesn¡¯t matter because criminals do not follow the law.¡¯ They at least left the door open for Congress to act on regulating a device that turns a semiautomatic weapon into a fully automatic weapon.¡±  Four days after the shooting, the National Rifle Association unexpectedly joined the effort, releasing a statement saying, ¡°The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations.¡±The bump-stock issue, however, is already at a standstill. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and many other House Republicans last week backed away from congressional action to ban the devices, saying the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) should regulate or ban bump stocks by decree.But, in a letter to Congress, current and former ATF agents said it is Congress that should take action. They said that under the law, attaching the device to a gun ¡°does not make it a machine gun,¡± so ATF cannot regulate it.  ¡°The law is very clear, and it does not currently allow ATF to regulate such accessories,¡± Michael R. Bouchard, former ATF assistant director and now president of the ATF Association, wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The Washington Post.Kelly and Giffords have an uphill battle. The NRA spent more than $30?million supporting Donald Trump¡¯s presidential campaign. In recent months, the Trump administration has been easing gun regulations. It blocked, for example, the Social Security Administration from reporting mentally impaired recipients to a national background-check database, reversing an Obama administration action.The NRA declined to comment on the rebranding of the Giffords group.  Even before the Las Vegas shooting, the Giffords group had fought against legislation in Congress to make it easier to buy gun silencers and to carry concealed weapons across state lines. Giffords has raised about $15 million a year and traveled to dozens of states, playing a role in the passage of many of the 210 new gun laws enacted in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Her group has also merged with California¡¯s Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.Arkadi Gerney, an advocate for stronger gun laws who worked for then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the Center for American Progress, said it is fitting to put Giffords and her story at the center of the fight against the gun lobby.¡°There¡¯s been a growing powerful movement to overcome the NRA,¡± Gerney said. ¡°It¡¯s two steps forward and one step backward. But, there¡¯s a lot of determination. Gabby Giffords is both a symbol and actuality of that courage and determination.¡±      "
"The massive attack that rocked a bustling Mogadishu street Saturday, killing 300, was a demonstration of resilience by ?al-Shabab, an Islamist militant group that has been battling U.S.-backed forces.The group frequently targets public spaces in Somalia¡¯s capital with the goals of undermining the central government¡¯s legitimacy and pushing back against its cooperation with the United States and a coalition of African allies. While U.S. officials and other observers say Saturday¡¯s bombing does not necessarily signal ?al-Shabab¡¯s resurgence, it does highlight the group¡¯s ability to absorb setbacks and survive to execute brazen attacks. The militant group has experienced territorial, financial and recruitment losses since 2010, when the United States and its coalition began targeting its command structure. But that has not prevented the group from massing to attack military bases or coordinate bombings inside and outside Somalia, said Seth G. Jones, director of defense policy at the Rand Corp., a Pentagon-funded think tank in Washington.¡°Al-Shabab has areas where they can operate relatively freely,¡± Jones told The Washington Post, including strongholds in southern river valleys. It¡¯s challenging terrain for ground troops to navigate, and the dense foliage can obscure drone surveillance.Attacks against Somali troops and those assigned to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), a force numbering about 22,000, have grown more spectacular as al-Shabab¡¯s territory has shrunk, Jones concluded in a 2016 report on the counterterrorism campaign there. In June 2016, for instance, 30 Ethio?pian soldiers were killed ¡ª along with 150 al-Shabab militants ¡ª in an attempt to overrun a base some 200 miles north of Mogadishu.The group has been dangerous to U.S. troops, too. Navy SEAL Kyle Milliken, a senior chief petty officer,  during a mission described as ¡°behind¡± Somali troops but later revealed as a mission shoulder-to-shoulder with them.As U.S. airstrikes have targeted al-Shabab¡¯s commanders and its training camps, the group¡¯s leaders have made security adjustments, Jones said. They rely less on computers and cellphones, whose transmissions can be tracked. The U.S. military presence in Somalia is about 400 troops, with approximately half in Mogadishu, the Pentagon said Monday. Those forces include Special Operations troops to train Somali forces and conventional personnel on hand for logistical support, although much of the focus has been on collecting and handing off surveillance and intelligence data to the Somalis. Al-Shabab still controls many rural areas in the south, including the roads leading to cities and towns. Even in Mogadishu, militants go around collecting ¡°taxes¡± from businesses to offset revenue losses of seaside ports recaptured by government forces. AMISOM troops heading to Baidoa, one of the largest cities in Somalia, must often use aircraft to get there rather than roads primed for ambushes, said Abdi Ismail Samatar, a Somalia analyst and geography professor at the University of Minnesota who also serves on the board of the University of Mogadishu.¡°They are fighting with a bunch of guerrilla fighters who are exceptionally mobile, who are working in a huge territory in which there is no government, so they are able to do what they want at a time of their own choosing,¡± he said. A State Department official acknowledged that Saturday¡¯s truck bomb shows that al-Shabab is capable of staging attacks throughout the country, but said the government is making progress in helping Somalia transition from rule by warlords and clans to a federal government with a countrywide reach.¡°The magnitude of this attack caught everybody by surprise,¡± said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under State Department ground rules for briefing reporters.¡°As terrible as the individual attack is, the fact is we don¡¯t see this every day now in Somalia. This is extraordinary, and it doesn¡¯t change the overall positive trajectory we¡¯re seeing there.¡±The State Department official said the Somalis have thwarted a number of planned attacks, and defections have been encouraged by the newly elected president, the Somali American Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. He noted that the latest bombing was condemned by Sheikh Mukhtar Robow, a former al-Shabab leader who defected after the Trump administration removed him from the most-wanted list of terrorists run by the State Department¡¯s ¡°Rewards for Justice¡± program.¡°I wouldn¡¯t characterize the overall situation as the central government is failing or returning to a failed state,¡± the official said. ¡°Under the previous and current governments, we¡¯ve seen some pretty significant improvements.¡±The United States over the past six years has spent $1.5 billion on humanitarian aid for victims of drought and famine, and $240 million on economic development aid, including good-governance projects and new schools and government buildings.The United States also has a diplomatic presence of sorts, although it is limited to the heavily fortified Mogadishu airport, where Somali officials must travel to visit. The embassy officially is in Nairobi, a reflection of the dangerous environment, although it has been rotating diplomats on temporary duty between Somalia and Kenya until it can establish a full-time embassy on the airport grounds."
"Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who vanished in Afghanistan and spent five years in brutal captivity before the United States recovered him in a controversial prisoner swap, pleaded guilty Monday to two crimes in connection with his disappearance.Bergdahl, now 31, was a private first class when?he went missing in 2009. Appearing in an Army courtroom at Fort Bragg, N.C., he entered guilty pleas to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy.The desertion charge could yield up to five years¡¯ confinement.?The misbehavior charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Rarely used, it¡¯s applied?when service members run away, surrender or otherwise endanger fellow?troops¡¯ safety through disobedience, neglect or intentional misconduct.¡°I understand that leaving was against the law,¡±?he told the judge, , adding later, ¡°I believed they would notice me missing, but I didn¡¯t believe they would have reason to search for one private.¡±Bergdahl walked away from his combat outpost just before midnight June 29, 2009, in what an Army investigation determined was an attempt to cause a crisis and draw attention to concerns that Bergdahl had about his leaders. The soldier was captured within hours by? armed Taliban fighters on motorcycles and turned over to the Haqqani network, a group in Pakistan that tortured him on and off for years.A U.S. Special Forces team recovered Bergdahl in May 2014 as part of a deal in which the Obama administration released five Taliban operatives held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The move was bitterly protested by some critics, including Donald Trump, who declared during his bid for the White House that Bergdahl was a traitor.?The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office concluded that the Obama administration violated the law by failing to provide Congress with sufficient notice about its plans.Obama administration officials defended the prisoner swap, saying the United States does not leave soldiers behind on the battlefield.Bergdahl was charged in March 2015. It is not clear what punishment he will receive from the case¡¯s judge, Army Col. Jeffery R. Nance. He is expected to be sentenced at Fort Bragg in an Oct. 23 hearing that could include testimony from several U.S. service members and veterans who Nance ruled this year were injured while searching for Bergdahl.Thousands of U.S. troops were involved in that effort over Bergdahl¡¯s five years in captivity.Nance also could take into account Bergdahl¡¯s treatment in Pakistan. An Army physician who testified in the case found that Bergdahl, who was at times kept in a cage, suffered muscular nerve damage in his lower legs, degenerative back damage and a loss of range in motion in his left shoulder that prevents him from lifting heavy objects. In addition to confinement, Bergdahl could receive a dishonorable discharge?and lose his medical benefits.Bergdahl¡¯s defense team has said he?was unable to receive a fair trial due to Trump¡¯s repeated attacks. One attorney, Eugene Fidell, accused Trump of treating Bergdahl as ¡°a political chew toy,¡± but Nance rejected a request to dismiss the case on grounds that Trump had unlawfully altered the course of the case.In an interview , Bergdahl complained bitterly about his prospect of a fair trial due to Trump, and said it was ¡°insulting¡± that some critics accuse him of sympathizing with the Taliban.¡°We may as well go back to kangaroo courts and lynch mobs that got what they wanted,¡± Bergdahl said. ¡°The people who want to hang me ¡ª you¡¯re never going to convince those people.¡±Lt. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, a senior Army officer who interviewed Bergdahl, testified in 2015 that he found Bergdahl ¡°unrealistically idealistic¡± and believed a jail sentence would be inappropriate, given the circumstances of the case. A military doctor determined that Bergdahl, who had previously washed out of the Coast Guard, exhibited symptoms of a mental disorder known as schizotypal personality disorder, which is considered a variant of schizophrenia that has less frequent or intense psychotic episodes.Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Trump¡¯s national security adviser, said in the ABC News report published Monday that he also does not think that Bergdahl deserves jail time.¡°So the guy deserted his men, his soldiers, his squad ¡ª no doubt,¡± Flynn said. ¡°[But] I don¡¯t think he should serve another day in any sort of confinement or jail or anything like that, because frankly, even though he put himself into this situation to a degree, we ¡ª the United States government and the United States military ¡ª put him in Afghanistan.¡±"
"A jury convicted a New Jersey man Monday in a bombing last year that injured 31 people and sparked a frantic two-state manhunt. The verdict means the bomber, Ahmad Khan Rahimi, is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.A jury in Manhattan federal court deliberated for just a few hours between Friday afternoon and Monday morning before finding Rahimi guilty of all eight counts against him for planting bombs in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea on Sept. 17, 2016. One bomb left on a sidewalk did not explode, but another, left inside a metal trash container, detonated, causing the injuries.U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim called Rahimi¡¯s conviction ¡°a victory for New York City, a victory for America in its fight against terror, and a victory for all who believe in the cause of justice.¡¯¡¯Rahimi chose not to testify in his defense, and in closing arguments his attorneys did not dispute some of the charges he faced ¡ª only the ones that with convictions would trigger a mandatory life prison sentence. His sentencing is scheduled for Jan.?18.  presenting the mangled metal dumpster and other evidence to the jury. Authorities say Rahimi, before planting bombs in New York, left a bomb that detonated, without injury, along the course of a five-kilometer charity race in Seaside Park, N.J. He also dumped a bag of pipe bombs outside a New Jersey train station before trying to disappear and evade police.Rahimi was captured when police officers in Linden, N.J., found him sleeping in the doorway of a bar. Authorities say he pulled a gun from a waist pack and started shooting, striking one of the officers in his protective vest.Prosecutors had a wide array of evidence to convince the panel, including fingerprints and records of his purchases of bomb parts.Jurors watched security camera videos that showed him outside his residence on the day the bombs were planted, then showing the same person arriving at Penn Station in Manhattan. There was also video of his movements in the city and of him leaving one of the bombs on West 27th Street.Among the most damning pieces of evidence was a letter written in a notebook Rahimi was carrying during his shootout with police. Stained by blood and torn in places, the letter is addressed to the U.S. government and describes his anger over U.S. foreign policy, indicates his admiration of Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni American cleric and propagandist, and ends with the declaration: ¡°Inshallah the sounds of bombs will be heard in the streets. Gunshots to your police. Death to your OPPRESSION.¡±Rahimi is a U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan whose last name is sometimes spelled in government documents as Rahami. He faces separate charges in New Jersey for his alleged crimes there.Counterterrorism officials have described Rahimi as a lone wolf who was not part of any broader conspiracy but was inspired by terrorist propaganda ¡ª much of it from overseas ¡ª and decided to act on his own. Prosecutors say a laptop in Rahimi¡¯s home contained 14 issues of al-Qaeda¡¯s Inspire magazine, which included various bombmaking recipes.The Rahimi case also highlighted how difficult it can be to prevent such an attack, even when authorities have some inkling a person might be dangerous. The FBI briefly looked into Rahimi in 2014 after it learned his father had made comments to others indicating his son might be involved in terrorism. But that investigation ended after an FBI review found no links between Rahimi and terrorist groups."
"Just before President Trump announced on Friday that he would decertify the Iran nuclear deal, French President Emmanuel Macron called his counterpart in Tehran to offer reassurance, Macron¡¯s office said in a statement. No matter what Trump said, he told Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Europe would continue to back the agreement.The Europeans were only interested in Iran¡¯s money, Trump scoffed to reporters later that day. Macron, he said, had also called him.¡°I said: ¡®Look, Emmanuel, they just gave Renault a lot of money,¡¯?¡± Trump related, referring to a recent business deal between Iran and the French carmaker. ¡°?¡®Take their money; enjoy yourselves. But we¡¯ll see what happens.¡¯¡±What has already happened is a widening chasm of mutual disdain between the United States and its traditional allies. Trump sees them as self-interested freeloaders who must be reminded of U.S. power. They see him as an erratic force who must be managed as he squanders American leadership.  Republican and Democratic lawmakers were largely split in their reactions to Trump¡¯s announcement that he would terminate the nuclear deal if Congress didn¡¯t come up with a way to rewrite it to his liking. Many Republicans congratulated the president and agreed it was time to get tough against Iran.Many Democrats criticized Trump for what Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said was ¡°clearly a political decision¡± made to please his base voters ¡°and not a strategic one.¡± Reed and others warned that  risked conflict and would be opposed by U.S. negotiating partners who had also signed it ¡ª Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.When Trump invited them to join him in holding Iran¡¯s feet to the fire, Russia and China said there was nothing to talk about. The Europeans, in a joint statement, said they were eager to discuss their shared complaints about Iran ¡ª its ballistic missile program and support for terrorism ¡ª but that there could be no changes in the nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini bordered on scornful, saying in a statement Friday that the JCPOA ¡°is not a domestic issue¡± and ¡°does not belong to any single country¡± to demand changes. Trump was powerful, she said, but did not have the power to do that.  But several senior officials from the European signatory countries said privately that there was little to be gained, for now, by shouting their opposition. Instead, their plan is to continue trying to  if they take the path Trump has set for Congress.All refused to speak for quotation out of what they said was worry that they would add fuel to an already smoldering fire. But they uniformly expressed concern about what they described as yet another instance of America walking away from an international commitment.Last spring, as Trump prepared for his first overseas trip in May, White House aides outlined his game plan to assume the mantle of global primacy.¡°One thing he has the ability to do is really bring people together and galvanize people around a common set of goals,¡± a senior adviser said in describing objectives for the 10-day tour that took Trump to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Rome, Brussels and a G-20 meeting in Sicily.Rather than a liability, Trump¡¯s ¡°unpredictability .?.?. is a real asset,¡± said the adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under White House ground rules. The new president, he said, was ¡°sending one big message, which is America is ready to lead in the world again.¡±Yet instead of leading, Trump¡¯s ¡°my way or the highway¡± approach has been a detour from the multilateral road the United States has traveled since World War II. And as Trump has left behind, or threatened to, the premier international agreements of this century, from the Paris climate accord to global trade alliances and now the Iran nuclear deal, he has not had many willing followers.Among the exceptions, governments in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joined Israel in praising what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump¡¯s ¡°courageous¡± decision on Iran.Yet even those who have proclaimed him as a leader have sometimes not felt bound by his demands. Early in his administration, Trump gently chastised Israel for its West Bank settlements, saying that they ¡°don¡¯t help the process¡± and were not ¡°a good thing for peace.¡± He has remained silent, however, as Netanyahu¡¯s government, including as recently as last week, has approved additional settlements, leading some perplexed Israeli commentators to speculate on whether he made a ¡°secret¡± deal with Netanyahu.In May, when the heads of dozens of Muslim-majority countries gathered in Riyadh to listen to him speak about a unified fight against terrorism, Trump claimed credit for a unity agreement on counterterrorism cooperation signed with the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council.Just days later, the Saudis and Emiratis, joined by fellow GCC member Bahrain and Egypt, broke relations with Qatar, another council member, and closed their air and sea borders to it. While Trump initially supported the action ¡ª even as his State and Defense Department secretaries called for it to be reversed ¡ª he later changed course.Appearing last month with the visiting emir of Kuwait, Trump called for the gulf states to patch up their differences and said if the problem wasn¡¯t ¡°quickly¡± resolved, he would summon regional leaders to the White House and take care of it. Since then, he has said nothing publicly about a presidential intervention.Trump has claimed massive progress in the U.S. fight against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq under his leadership. But he was unable to persuade Iraq¡¯s Kurdistan Regional Government, one of America¡¯s closest military and political allies in the region, to call off an independence referendum late last month that has left Iraq in a turmoil the administration has been powerless to resolve.Similarly in Turkey, where Trump last month said bilateral ties under his administration were ¡°better than ever,¡± relations now seem to be at a modern all-time low, with tit-for-tat suspension of visa issuance earlier this month.Rather than ¡°galvanizing¡± respect and unity, Trump sometimes appears to engender resentment and division. Although NATO members agreed in 2014 to increase their domestic defense spending, Trump¡¯s exhortations and threats to diminish the U.S. presence in the alliance seemed to spur some countries to speed up that process. But his subsequent chest-beating has left many irritated and bitter.Even in Asia, where he has worked to build personal relationships with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ¡ª both of whom he will visit on a lengthy trip next month ¡ª Trump can befuddle. Early this month, he undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson¡¯s efforts to keep open channels of communication with North Korea, telling Tillerson via Twitter to stop ¡°wasting his time¡± trying to negotiate with Pyongyang over its nuclear weapons program. North Korea, he said, had ¡°made fools¡± of U.S. negotiators in the past.On Friday, Trump told reporters that ¡°if something can happen where we can negotiate,¡± with North Korea, ¡°I¡¯m always open to that.¡±"
"On Aug 27, 2005, two days before Hurricane Katrina made landfall, officials at the American Red Cross wrote to a top homeland security adviser at the White House, warning that the storm was likely to slam New Orleans as a major hurricane.The message was sent to Kirstjen Nielsen, whose title was special assistant to the president for prevention, preparedness and response. She was 33 years old.It was the first of many alarming emails Nielsen would receive over the following days as water poured into New Orleans and the city was deluged. And in the storm of blame that followed the costliest natural disaster in American history, Nielsen¡¯s team was widely criticized for its passive and .Twelve years later, President Trump has nominated Nielsen to the top job at the Department of Homeland Security. As DHS secretary, she would be in charge of a 240,000-employee agency with a $40 billion budget whose many responsibilities include managing disasters such as Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.¡°There will be no on-the-job training for Kirstjen,¡± Trump said Thursday as he  her nomination at the White House, praising her ¡°sterling reputation.¡± He noted she would be the first DHS secretary to have previous experience at the agency. ¡°She is ready on day one,¡± Trump said.Nielsen¡¯s exact role in the Katrina episode remains unclear, but the ordeal could leave her facing tough questioning during her Senate confirmation hearings, which are likely to be held in the next few weeks. Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the ranking Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, sent a letter Thursday to Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate committee that will question Nielsen, expressing his ¡°serious concern¡± about her fitness for the role.¡°While I am pleased the President has finally named a nominee for this critical national security position, I am greatly troubled by Ms. Nielsen¡¯s record,¡± the letter stated. ¡°Given the ongoing tragedy in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, along with other homeland security challenges facing our Nation, the Department of Homeland Security must have a proven, capable leader as Secretary.¡±¡°Unfortunately, Ms. Nielsen¡¯s record raises questions about her suitability for such a position,¡± he wrote.   Former DHS and White House officials who worked with Nielsen during Katrina said it would be grossly unfair to hold her responsible for the Bush administration¡¯s botched response to a calamity that killed more than 1,800 and drove a million Americans from their homes.Former colleagues remember her and her small staff of about five aides working around the clock as a torrent of information ¡ª some of it erroneous ¡ª poured into the White House while the catastrophe played out on live television.If anything, Nielsen¡¯s defenders say, the Katrina episode left her a front-row seat to the country¡¯s most notorious case of federal emergency mismanagement. If she can articulate what she learned from the episode to senators at her confirmation hearings, she has the chance to turn a black mark on her career into an asset.¡°She started off with the Super Bowl,¡± said Matthew Broderick, the retired Marine Corps general who was in charge of the Homeland Security Operations Center during Katrina, and resigned several months later. ¡°Usually with these things you get a few games to work your way up.¡±Broderick said Nielsen¡¯s job was mostly to serve as a traffic cop for information during the chaotic days following the storm, and he remembers her ¡°doing a great job.¡±¡°She wasn¡¯t in charge of anything, so all she could do was react to the requests we were making and make sure they were completed as smoothly as possible,¡± Broderick said. ¡°She couldn¡¯t control what was going on ¡ª only mitigate it.¡±Nielsen, who is currently the deputy chief of staff at the White House, did not respond to interview requests. But in the post-Katrina autopsies produced by House and Senate bipartisan committees, which together run more than 1,300 pages, Nielsen¡¯s name repeatedly comes up. In the months before the storm, Nielsen was one of a handful of White House officials warned of the so-called ¡°New Orleans scenario¡±: a hurricane rated Category 3 or higher hitting the city and bursting its aging levees.The 582-page bipartisan , ¡°A Failure of Initiative,¡± specifically faults Nielsen¡¯s White House team for failing to recognize the threat to New Orleans from Katrina and conveying the gravity of the situation after the storm hit. ¡°I don¡¯t want to underplay it, but she was like the rest of us,¡± said Gail Kulisch, a retired Coast Guard officer who was an aide to then-DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff during Katrina. ¡°We were busy staffers trying to do the king¡¯s business.¡± Even after the lone Federal Emergency Management Agency official sent to New Orleans alerted Nielsen and other White House staffers of broken levees, residents trapped on roofs and corpses floating in the streets, there was little detectable urgency from President George W. Bush and Chertoff. The DHS secretary went to Atlanta to attend a conference on avian flu; Bush gave a speech in California and was photographed happily .¡°It does not appear the president received adequate advice and counsel from a senior disaster professional,¡± the House report concluded. Nielsen was supposed to be that professional on his staff.¡°Despite the clear warnings before landfall that Katrina would be catastrophic, the President and the White House staff were not sufficiently engaged and failed to initiate a sufficiently strong and proactive response,¡± a group of Democratic senators wrote in a section of the 737-page ¡°Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared.¡± Nielsen¡¯s team was singled out for failing to properly manage the flow of urgent on-the-ground reports sent to the White House. The White House staff did not fully engage the president or ¡°substantiate, analyze and act on the information at its disposal,¡± the House report concluded, noting Nielsen¡¯s team failed to confirm the collapse of New Orleans¡¯s levee system on Aug. 29, the day of Katrina¡¯s landfall. Frances Townsend, who was Bush¡¯s top homeland security adviser during Katrina and Nielsen¡¯s boss, defended her protegee¡¯s performance. ¡°You have information coming in from all different places, so you¡¯re trying to discern what¡¯s true and what isn¡¯t, or what were real needs and what aren¡¯t,¡± she said. ¡°In fairness to Kirstjen, we were being overrun.¡±Townsend, who has been a prominent public supporter of Nielsen¡¯s nomination to DHS secretary, said Katrina taught Nielsen and others critical lessons about the way the federal government handles emergencies and natural disasters. Chains of command are clearer. Disaster declarations are now made in advance. DHS agencies have learned to ¡°pre-position¡± abundant supplies into disaster zones ahead of time.   And the biggest lesson, Townsend said, is that the federal government ¡°isn¡¯t a good first responder. In Katrina and Maria, the ability of state and local authorities to respond is ¡°the biggest determinant of your success,¡± she said.The House report on Katrina found exactly that, recommending that the federal government, and especially the Defense Department, must move quickly to fill in for state and local authorities when they are incapacitated by the disaster. It¡¯s the same scenario that has played out once more in Puerto Rico, where DHS and FEMA officials say they did not expect to have to assume so much responsibility."
"Pakistani officials have described the mission to free an American woman, her Canadian husband and their three children as a harrowing operation and a rare bit of positive news in the troubled relationship between their country and the United States.Pakistani soldiers, acting on American intelligence, appear to have opened fire Wednesday at the tires of a car carrying Caitlan Coleman, 31, her husband, Joshua Boyle, 34, and their three children not long after it crossed the border from Afghanistan into Pakistan¡¯s tribal areas.A senior Trump administration official, shortly after the family¡¯s release, compared their ordeal to ¡°living in a hole for five years.¡±But, as with so many aspects of the murky and often confusing U.S.-Pakistan relationship, the family¡¯s dramatic rescue has raised as many questions as it has answered. On Friday night, Coleman, Boyle and their children arrived in Toronto after the family, at the husband¡¯s insistence, had refused to get on a plane for the United States.Boyle¡¯s father told the New York Times that his son did not want to stop at Bagram air base in Afghanistan, where Americans have been accused of abusing detainees.In a statement to the Associated Press, Boyle said, ¡°God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination.¡±   The family¡¯s refusal to travel to the United States led some former U.S. officials to speculate about the couple¡¯s motives in journeying to Afghanistan five years earlier and suggest that they may be trying to avoid tough questions from U.S. intelligence officials. Other U.S. officials played down that explanation.¡°The administration made very clear that if they wanted to come back to the United States there would be no problems,¡± said a U.S. official who is familiar with the case and was speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss dealings with the family.Shortly after marrying in 2011, Coleman and Boyle visited Central America and then headed off to Russia and Central Asia. Coleman was pregnant with their first child in 2012 when they decided to go hiking in Wardak province, a dangerous region south of Kabul that is dominated by feuding militant groups.The couple¡¯s decision to visit Wardak and Boyle¡¯s unusual personal history set off widespread speculation inside the U.S. intelligence community about his motives. Before he wed Coleman, Boyle had married and divorced the oldest sister of Omar Khadr, a Canadian who was arrested by U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2002 and was alleged to have ties to al-Qaeda.The patriarch of the Khadr family was killed in 2003, along with al-Qaeda and Taliban members, in a shootout with Pakistani security forces near the Afghanistan border. Boyle¡¯s associations with the family led some U.S. intelligence officials to speculate that the visit to Afghanistan may have been part of a larger effort to link up with Taliban-affiliated militants.¡°I can¡¯t say that [he was ever al-Qaeda],¡± said one former U.S. intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information. ¡°He was never a fighter on the battlefield. But my belief is that he clearly was interested in getting into it.¡±After they were taken captive, Boyle and Coleman appear to have suffered through a harrowing ordeal.Coleman was pregnant when they were abducted and gave birth in captivity, the AP reported. Upon landing at the Toronto airport late Friday, Boyle told journalists their captors had killed their infant daughter and raped Coleman during the years they were held.In a video released in December 2016, Coleman described her captivity as a ¡°Kafkaesque nightmare.¡±¡°Just give the offenders something so they and you can save face and we can leave the region permanently,¡± she said in the video aimed at President Barack Obama.  The successful rescue also set off a flurry of questions about what it might portend for U.S.-Pakistan relations. ¡°The first thing to recognize is that this relationship is as broken as it¡¯s been since 2011,¡± when U.S. officials launched a clandestine raid into Pakistan to kill Osama bin Laden, said Moeed Yusuf, an associate vice president for the United States Institute of Peace.The Trump administration¡¯s new strategy in Afghanistan has put a heavy emphasis on military operations to punish the Taliban in Afghanistan and has increased pressure on Pakistan to eliminate enemy sanctuaries there.Pakistan would prefer a plan that prioritizes peace talks with the Taliban over a military-focused effort. In the aftermath of the successful mission, President Trump suggested that his tough rhetoric had helped to bring Islamabad into line. But Yusuf and other analysts suggested that the president was misreading Pakistani motives.¡°The danger here is that Washington internalizes the message that tough talk with the Pakistanis is working,¡± Yusuf said. ¡°I am overall pessimistic about the relationship.... If there is one thing that underpins everything, it is a deep mistrust between these two countries.¡±Other analysts who follow South Asia were slightly more positive in their assessments and saw potential for cooperation between the two nations.¡°The United States and Pakistan have some key areas of aligned interests, including on counterterrorism and counterextremism,¡± said Daniel Feldman, who was the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Obama administration. ¡°This demonstrates that there are opportunities to work together in both our nations¡¯ interests.¡±At the Coleman household in southeastern Pennsylvania, the focus wasn¡¯t on geopolitics but on the return of a long-missing daughter.Her family posted a note on their door referring to the ¡°joyful news¡± and asking for privacy ¡°as we make plans for the future.¡± Shaiq Hussain in Islamabad and Greg Miller in Washington contributed to this report."
"Nine passengers on a domestic flight for which immigration authorities made everyone show identification before they could deplane are suing the government, alleging they were subjected to an unconstitutional search, an attorney for the group said. The passengers, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, asked a federal judge Thursday to bar the government from requiring people to produce ID before deboarding a domestic flight without a warrant or individualized reason to do so. ACLU Deputy Legal Director Cecillia Wang said that even though passengers are required to show identification before being allowed into the area where flights are boarded, those on board the flight were ¡°shocked¡± to be asked to do so before they could leave. ¡°There was no lawful justification for detaining every single passenger on this domestic flight,¡± she said. A Justice Department spokeswoman and a Customs and Border Protection spokesman declined to comment. The Customs and Border Protection spokesman said the lack of response ¡°should not be construed as agreement or stipulation with any of the allegations.¡±  The incident occurred in February on Delta Flight 1583 from San Francisco to New York. Once on the ground at John F. Kennedy International Airport, Wang said, those on board were greeted by Customs and Border Protection agents, who stood in the boarding bridge and demanded identification documents. Those who questioned what was happening were told it was routine, Wang said. Kelley Amadei, 40, was flying back home to New York with her wife and 7-year-old son. As the plane was taxiing to the gate, Amadei said, a member of the flight crew announced that ¡°nobody would be allowed to deplane until they showed government-issued identification.¡±¡°That was alarming to me, because that¡¯s not something I had heard before,¡± Amadei said. At first, Amadei said she was scared. ¡°My initial instinct was, ¡®Has something happened? Are we in danger?¡¯?¡± But as she watched two agents block people from leaving, asking each of them for their IDs, her fear turned to outrage.  ¡°I said, ¡®He¡¯s seven years old, he doesn¡¯t carry ID on him,¡¯?¡± Amadei said. Agents ultimately let her pass, and she soon contacted news outlets to share her story.  sked if their family was in trouble. ¡°It felt like a violation,¡± Amadei said. Authorities had been searching for an immigrant who had received a deportation order to leave the United States. The incident sparked significant controversy, as it came amid an ongoing . The Trump administration has promised to crack down on illegal immigration and has sometimes employed controversial tactics, such as using courthouses to arrest people suspected of being in the country illegally. An official with the Department of Homeland Security told The Washington Post after the incident that the steps Customs and Border Protection agents took were normal and did not stem from a new policy or executive order. ¡°When we¡¯re asked by our law enforcement partners to assist in searching for a person of interest, we are able to, and will, help,¡± the official said.The person whom agents had been seeking was not on the flight, authorities said. Those suing include two journalists, a college professor and others, Wang said. She said they are particularly concerned with the Department of Homeland Security¡¯s characterization of the incident as normal, because, in her view, government agents should not have been allowed to ask passengers for identification without a warrant or some suspicion of a particular person.¡°We basically want to stop the government from doing this again, without any individualized suspicion,¡± Wang said.

"Members of Congress who have squared off on the Iran nuclear deal since its inception strategized Wednesday in preparation for President Trump¡¯s highly anticipated announcement on its fate.Leading House Republicans huddled with national security adviser H.R. McMaster Wednesday evening for a classified briefing on the administration¡¯s plan for the 2015 agreement. Emerging from the meeting, McMaster told reporters simply that it had been ¡°Great, thanks.¡±If Trump decides to decertify Iran¡¯s compliance, as expected, Congress will have 60?days to decide whether to ¡°snap back¡± sanctions that were lifted in exchange for curbs on Iran¡¯s nuclear program. If sanctions were reimposed, despite the International Atomic Energy Agency verifying eight times that Iran has lived up to its end of the deal, the United States would be in breach of its commitments. In effect, it would be walking away unilaterally.House Democrats met earlier in the day with former secretary of state John F. Kerry and former energy secretary Ernest Moniz, who were the primary negotiators of the deal made between Iran and six world powers. Wendy Sherman, another key negotiator, was also present. Jacob J. Lew, the former Treasury secretary, joined the discussion by phone.Joining them were ambassadors to the United States from France, Germany and Britain ¡ª three European nations that also were parties to the multilateral agreement and have urged the United States not to abandon the deal so arduously negotiated.Democrats are fiercely opposed to Trump¡¯s determination that Iran is not meeting its commitments and insist the agreement must remain intact to survive. Many will not even discuss what congressional debate might follow if Trump decertifies, instead focusing the arguments for certification.But several key Democrats suggested there might be room to negotiate with Republicans about beefing up the deal without eviscerating it.The involvement of Congress is not required under the agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was approved by the United Nations. But it is a requirement of U.S. law.Rep. Elliot Engel (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he would consider modifying the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act so the president certifies Iran¡¯s compliance less frequently than every 90?days now, or using different standards. He would not say whether he would be open to other changes, stressing new conditions might violate the deal.France, Germany and Britain, despite their opposition to Washington backing away from the deal, have told U.S. lawmakers that they could join discussions on constraining Iran¡¯s long-term nuclear ambitions, according to one congressional Democratic aide.Republicans have complained that the deal delays Iran¡¯s nuclear ambitions but could allow Iran to resume its nuclear program after certain restrictions expire. Iran has denied it wants to build a nuclear bomb, and the agreement commits it to never build one, but various ¡°sunset clauses¡± would allow Iran to amass greater stockpiles of fissile material that raise concerns.Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) have been working for months hashing out a package to present to Congress, only recently bringing in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, learned of their work a little over a week ago.Cardin went to the State Department on Wednesday to meet with Tillerson. Cardin¡¯s spokesman said the purpose of the meeting was to go over the administration¡¯s plan for the nuclear deal. Tillerson¡¯s spokesman said they discussed several issues, including Iran. Tillerson is expected to reach out to other members of Congress in coming days to brief them on the administration¡¯s intentions on the nuclear deal.Some Democrats complain it would be difficult to join in a bipartisan plan to restrain Iran¡¯s nuclear ambitions. Trump¡¯s strenuous opposition to the agreement forged by the Obama administration ¡ª which Trump criticized during the campaign as the worst deal ever ¡ª means any attempt to change the conditions would be interpreted by Tehran as an effort to blow it up.¡°The effect of what the president has done has really been to constrain our freedom of action,¡± said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat of the House Intelligence Committee, ¡°because steps we might have taken to constrain Iran¡¯s malevolent activity will now be viewed through the prism of the president¡¯s hostility to the nuclear deal. Ironically he may have limited our ability to confront Iran, rather than expand it.¡±In addition, Trump could at any time decide not to waive the nuclear-related sanctions again ¡ª a decision he must make every 120 days under U.S. law. Many Democrats believe that is more likely to happen if Congress does not act to make changes to the existing agreement.¡°That¡¯s what we have to consider,¡± said Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppelsburger (D-Md.), the former top-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. ¡°But the good news is if we can get to the American public like we did on health care .?.?. and we have our military, Cabinet members who already think the deal is working, we hope he would re-evaluate.¡±In this environment, many Democrats believe working on the periphery of the deal could be the congressional equivalent of destroying the village to save it.¡°The president said he wanted to tear up the deal. He¡¯s now taking a step that would lead to tearing up the deal,¡± said Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.), one of the key members who whipped support for the Iran deal in Congress when it was struck. He called Trump¡¯s move to kick the deal to Congress a ¡°trap¡± and ¡°a tactic intended to reach the president¡¯s goal of tearing the deal apart.¡±"
"Federal prosecutors rested their case Wednesday against Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), capping off a month of testimony in Newark federal court about his alleged corrupt dealings with a wealthy Florida eye doctor.After  that included jet pilots, former congressional staffers, federal officials, and one ex-senator, the government¡¯s case ended with testimony from FBI agent Alan Mohl. He has been reading emails between Menendez and the senator¡¯s staff that prosecutors say shows the lawmaker was determined to use his position to help his friend and donor.Menendez is accused of taking gifts ¡ª including a luxury hotel stay, flights on private jets, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions ¡ª from Salomon Melgen, in exchange for doing favors for the doctor.One of the last pieces of evidence entered in the prosecution case was an email Menendez wrote to a staffer in 2009, in which the senator said he was looking for ¡°the best juice¡± he could find inside the federal government to help Melgen in a multimillion-dollar billing dispute with Medicare.In an earlier email from 2009, Menendez told a staffer to call Melgen immediately regarding ¡°a Medicare problem we need to help him with.¡± That directive marked the beginning of a three-year effort that culminated in a 2012 meeting with then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who, like every other official contacted by Menendez, declined to intervene in the dispute.  Mohl spent all Tuesday on the witness stand reading from the emails and other documents collected in the investigation. He was called back to testify again Wednesday, and when he finished prosecutors told the judge they had no more witnesses.The Medicare problem Menendez was referring to involved Melgen¡¯s practice of ¡°multi-dosing¡± an expensive eye drug ¡ª by splitting single vials of medication into multiple doses and billing Medicare for more than one vial. Medicare claimed Melgen overbilled the agency $8.9 million.Defense attorneys have argued that Menendez¡¯s interest in the issue went beyond Melgen and reflected a concern about Medicare policy.But in their emails back and forth, Menendez and his staffers didn¡¯t make any secrets about whom they were trying to help.¡°Dr. Melgen is still in the non-litigant stage, so we should determine who has the best juice at [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services],¡± Menendez wrote to chief of staff Daniel O¡¯Brien in August 2009.As Melgen¡¯s appeal of the HHS ruling played out, Alan Reider, a Melgen lobbyist, told Menendez staffers that he believed Sebelius had the authority to make the case go away.Menendez¡¯s office, meanwhile, worked on getting to Sebelius, an effort that included ¡°encouraging and channeling outreach¡± from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who ended up hosting the August 2012 meeting with Sebelius.  as a witness in the trial.Another ex-senator, Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), , but his account of a meeting with Menendez on the Medicare billing issue was a mixed bag. At one point, Harkin said he took the meeting as a ¡°courtesy¡¯¡¯ to Menendez, and said doing so was common among lawmakers.Menendez attorney Abbe Lowell argued the prosecution was selective in which emails it introduced as evidence and questioned why all of the various authors of the emails weren¡¯t called to testify.As Menendez made his final attempts to argue his friend¡¯s side in the Medicare dispute, prosecutors noted that Melgen gave $600,000 ¡ª two separate contributions of $300,000 ¡ª to a Democratic super PAC that was earmarked to the state of New Jersey. On the check stub of one of those contributions, Melgen said the money was for ¡°B. Menendez.¡±Menendez is also accused of using his position to help Melgen¡¯s girlfriends get visas to visit the United States. And prosecutors said he tried to get federal officials to help Melgen in a contract dispute the doctor was having with port security officials in the Dominican Republic.When the trial began in early September, Menendez made an emotional declaration of innocence outside the federal courthouse in Newark, insisting: ¡°Not once have I dishonored my public office.¡±Outlining the 12-count indictment to the jury , prosecutor Peter Koski said the Menendez case ¡°is what bribery looks like.¡±As the two sides have sparred over witnesses and documents, Menendez¡¯s legal team has not contested most of the basic facts of the case. The senator does not deny pressing health officials on multi-dosing, or seeking to help Melgen¡¯s girlfriends get approval to visit the United States. Instead, the defense has challenged the prosecutors¡¯ charge that he did so in exchange for bribes that enabled the lawmaker to enjoy the finer things in life that he could not otherwise afford, such as a hotel stay in Paris or private flights to the Dominican Republic. Menendez¡¯s lawyer insists he helped Melgen because he wanted to do so, because the two were such close friends."
"In 2015, Israeli government hackers saw something suspicious in the computers of a Moscow-based cybersecurity firm: hacking tools that could only have come from the National Security Agency.Israel notified the NSA, where alarmed officials immediately began a hunt for the breach, according to people familiar with the matter, who said an investigation by the agency revealed that the tools were in the possession of the Russian government.Israeli spies had found the hacking material on the network of Kaspersky Lab, the global anti-virus firm under a spotlight in the United States because of suspicions that its products facilitate Russian espionage.Last month,  on their networks and remove it on the grounds that ¡°the risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.¡± The directive followed a decision by the General Services Administration to remove Kaspersky from its list of approved vendors. And lawmakers on Capitol Hill are considering a governmentwide ban.  The NSA declined to comment on the Israeli discovery, which was first  by the New York Times.Kaspersky said in a statement that ¡°as a private company, Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia, and the only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight.¡± The company said it ¡°does not possess any knowledge¡± of Israel¡¯s hack.The firm¡¯s founder, Eugene Kaspersky, said in a blog post last week that his anti-virus software is supposed to find malware from all quarters.¡°We absolutely and aggressively detect and clean malware infections no matter the source,¡± , suggesting that the NSA hacking tools could have been picked up as malware by the anti-virus program.In the 2015 case, investigators at the NSA examining how the Russians obtained the material eventually narrowed their search to an employee in , which comprises hackers who collect intelligence about foreign targets. The employee was using Kaspersky anti-virus software on his home computer, according to the people familiar with the matter.The employee, whose name has not been made public and is under investigation by federal prosecutors, did not intend to pass the material to a foreign adversary. ¡°There wasn¡¯t any malice,¡± said one person familiar with the case, who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing case. ¡°It¡¯s just that he was trying to complete the mission, and he needed the tools to do it.¡±Concerns about Kaspersky have also emerged in the cybersecurity industry, where some officials say that the firm¡¯s software has been used not just to protect its customers¡¯ computers but also as a platform for espionage.Over the past several years, the firm has on occasion used a standard industry technique that detects computer viruses but can also be employed to identify information and other data not related to malware, according to two industry officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.The tool is called ¡°silent signatures¡± ¡ª strings of digital code that operate in stealth to find malware but which could also be written to search computers for potential classified documents, using keywords or acronyms.¡°Silent detection is a widely adopted cybersecurity industry practice used to verify malware detections and minimize false positives,¡± the company¡¯s statement said. ¡°It enables cybersecurity vendors to offer the most up-to-date protection without bothering users with constant on-screen alerts.¡±Kaspersky is also the only major anti-virus firm whose data is routed through Russian Internet service providers subject to Russian surveillance. That surveillance system is known as the SORM, or the System of Operative-Investigative Measures.The company said that customer data flowing through Kaspersky¡¯s Russian servers is encrypted and that the firm does not decrypt it for the government.Andrei Soldatov, a Russian surveillance expert and author of ¡°,¡± said, ¡°I would be very, very skeptical¡± of the claim that the government cannot read the firm¡¯s data. As an entity that deals with encrypted information, Kaspersky must obtain a license from the FSB, the country¡¯s powerful security service, he noted, which ¡°means your company is completely transparent¡± to the FSB.It is not publicly known how the Russians obtained the NSA hacking tools in 2015. Some information security analysts have speculated that the Russians exploited a flaw in Kaspersky software to filch the material.But other experts say the Russians would not need to hack Kaspersky¡¯s systems. They say that the material could be picked up through the country¡¯s surveillance regime. e said that Kaspersky¡¯s line of work is of particular interest to Russian President Vladi?mir Putin and that because of the way things work in Russia, Eugene Kaspersky ¡°knows he¡¯s at the mercy of Putin.¡±¡°The case against Kaspersky Lab is overwhelming,¡± said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), a vocal critic of Kaspersky who has pushed to remove the company¡¯s software from federal networks. ¡°The strong ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are very alarming.¡±The federal government has increasingly conveyed its concerns about Kaspersky to the private sector. Over at least the past two years, the FBI has notified major companies, including in the energy and financial sectors, about the risks of using Kaspersky software. The briefings have elaborated on the risks of espionage, sabotage and supply-chain attacks that could be enabled through use of the software. They also explained the surveillance law that enables the Russian government to see data coursing through its domestic pipes.¡°That¡¯s the crux of the matter,¡± said one industry official who received the briefing. ¡°Whether Kaspersky is working directly for the Russian government or not doesn¡¯t matter; their Internet service providers are subject to monitoring. So virtually anything shared with Kaspersky could become the property of the Russian government.¡±Late last month, the National Intelligence Council completed a classified report that it shared with NATO allies concluding that the FSB had ¡°probable access¡± to Kaspersky customer databases and source code. That access, it concluded, could help enable cyberattacks against U.S. government, commercial and industrial control networks. Jack Gillum contributed to this story."
"Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein indicated Tuesday that the Justice Department may be more aggressive in trying to secure access to encrypted information from technology companies during criminal and terrorism investigations.In a speech in Annapolis, Rosenstein, the second-highest-ranking official in the Justice Department, acknowledged the balancing act between privacy and public safety but said the needs of law enforcement can outweigh personal privacy when crimes need to be prevented and solved.¡°Warrant-proof encryption is a serious problem,¡± Rosenstein said in his speech at a conference at the U.S. Naval Academy. ¡°The public bears the cost. When investigations of violent criminal organizations come to a halt because we cannot access a phone, even with a court order, lives may be lost. When child molesters can operate anonymously over the Internet, children may be exploited. When terrorists can communicate covertly without fear of detention, chaos may follow.¡±Rosenstein did not offer policy proposals or specific steps Justice Department officials will take to combat what law enforcement refers to as ¡°going dark.¡± But he strongly criticized technology companies and said the government¡¯s efforts to engage with them has not been successful.  ¡°Technology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,¡± Rosenstein said. ¡°They are in the business of selling products and making money. .?.?. We are in the business of preventing crime and saving lives.¡±Ari Schwartz, a former senior director for cybersecurity in the Obama White House, said that while there are ¡°a few instances¡± in which technology companies do not help the government, ¡°there are plenty of cases¡± in which they do.¡°I¡¯m not seeing how this gets us closer to having the real discussion about solutions in this space,¡± said Schwartz, managing director of cybersecurity services at the Venable law firm. ¡°The government feels as though tech companies have to find a solution for them, and the tech companies feel as though the government just doesn¡¯t understand how they¡¯re putting the larger security at risk here.¡±Rosenstein highlighted the February 2016 case in San Bernardino, Calif., when the FBI obtained the iPhone used by a terrorist who shot and killed 14 people and injured 22 others. The data on the iPhone was encrypted, and the government sought Apple¡¯s assistance to find out whether there was evidence of other attack plans.¡°Apple rejected the government¡¯s request, although it had the technical capability to help,¡± Rosenstein said.An Apple spokesman declined to comment on Rosenstein¡¯s remarks.The Obama administration went to court to obtain an order requiring Apple to help, and Apple said it would appeal the order. The FBI was eventually able to access the data on the phone without Apple¡¯s assistance, by enlisting the help of professional hackers.  ¡°But the problem persists,¡± Rosenstein said. ¡°Today, thousands of seized devices sit in storage, impervious to search warrants. Over the past year, the FBI was unable to access about 7,500 mobile devices submitted to its computer analysis and response team, even though there was legal authority to do so.¡±Rosenstein said that while technology companies do not cooperate with Justice Department officials, they operate in foreign countries that censor and suppress information, citing incidents that involved  and . (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)¡°American technology providers sell products and services in foreign markets where the governments have questionable human rights records and enforce laws affording them access to customer data, without American due process or legal protections,¡± Rosenstein said. ¡°Surely those same companies and their engineers could help American law enforcement officers enforce court orders issued by American judges, pursuant to American rule-of-law principles.¡± Ellen Nakashima contributed to this report.

"More than two months after making John F. Kelly his chief of staff, President Trump is not close to nominating a replacement to head the Department of Homeland Security, a delay that is likely to leave the agency without a Senate-confirmed leader for longer than any period in its history.Asked when he would pick Kelly¡¯s replacement, Trump reporters on Sept. 29 that ¡°we¡¯ll be making that decision probably within a month.¡±With 240,000 employees, a $40?billion budget and a mile-wide organizational chart, the DHS is managing multiple threats, crises and disasters, both natural and man-made. While leading the recovery efforts after three major hurricanes, the department is also busy policing America¡¯s borders, airports and seas; implementing Trump¡¯s controversial immigration policies; and guarding the country¡¯s electoral system and infrastructure from unprecedented hacking attempts, among other tasks.Acting secretary Elaine Duke has been in the role since July 31, but she does not have a background in emergency management, counterterrorism or law enforcement. Though she has earned mostly praise for her stewardship of the agency during a difficult stretch, she is not considered a candidate for the secretary job, according to several administration officials with knowledge of the search.  Duke continues to enjoy the support of the White House, particularly Kelly, her former boss, and that confidence has lessened some of the urgency to quickly nominate a replacement, according to the officials, who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the search publicly.Aside from her widely derided characterization of the federal response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico as ¡°,¡± Duke is generally viewed as a competent manager and steady hand.Presidents have typically moved to fill the DHS secretary position quickly, rather than leaving it to someone in a fill-in role. In the fall of 2013, acting DHS secretary Rand Beers served in a temporary capacity for 3? months, but since Trump¡¯s next choice will face Senate confirmation, Duke¡¯s tenure is likely to exceed that.¡°I¡¯m concerned that a position so important to the security of this country is being left to an acting person rather than a presidentially appointed secretary,¡± said Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), the top-ranking Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee.¡°An acting secretary can do some things, but it¡¯s not like having a permanent person in there, and right now we don¡¯t even have a nominee,¡± Thompson said.Trump¡¯s eventual pick will test the prevailing political currents inside the White House, and particularly Kelly¡¯s influence over the president, according to current and former administration and DHS officials.While Kelly and others are said to favor a candidate with management experience in counterterrorism, law enforcement or the military, others in the administration are eager to see an immigration hard-liner in the role, particularly with the DHS at the center of a looming showdown over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Kirstjen Nielsen, Kelly¡¯s deputy and a cybersecurity expert, has extensive experience at the DHS and the White House and is viewed as one of the prime candidates for the job, according to current and former DHS officials. Others include Tom Bossert, the president¡¯s homeland security adviser, and Kevin McAleenan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, was a subject of frequent speculation after Kelly¡¯s departure, but persons with knowledge of the search said he is no longer considered a front-runner because Trump¡¯s core supporters view him as on immigration.¡°I don¡¯t think the position of DHS secretary has been politicized so much as the issues have become more politicized,¡± said Jane Holl Lute, who was deputy DHS secretary from 2009 to 2013.Current and former DHS officials say Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, in particular, is eager to send a signal that the White House will not back down on DACA, deportations and other contentious immigration issues, especially after some conservatives mocked the president as ¡°¡± after the outlines of his immigration deal with Senate Democrats emerged. The president¡¯s well-known fondness for martial figures and police commanders could favor Thomas Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, whose demeanor ¡ª more beat cop than lawyer ¡ª has particular appeal to Trump.Also frequently mentioned is Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a hero to immigration hard-liners, who was by Trump in May to co-chair a presidential commission investigating allegations of voter fraud in the 2016 election. But Kobach is a polarizing figure who would face a difficult confirmation fight, and administration officials say Kelly doesn¡¯t want him in the DHS job.White House officials said the delay in picking a nominee has to do less with political divisions within the administration than with the challenge of finding the right person for the job ¡ª someone who must be part cop, lawyer, chief executive and politician, with a disaster always looming.¡°It¡¯s a heavy load. Whoever has that job feels a deep, cold dread in their soul every time the phone rings in the evening, because it¡¯s never good news,¡± said Stewart Baker, the top DHS policy official under President George W. Bush. ¡°But you learn how to handle emergencies, and handle emergencies in a political environment.¡±Trump earned rare bipartisan praise when he picked Kelly, a retired four-star Marine Corps general. But the delay in choosing his replacement has increased concern among many lawmakers that the president will use the nomination to fire up the part of his base that loved chanting ¡°Build the wall!¡± at his rallies and still expects him to do so.Several Democratic and Republican lawmakers who sit on the committees responsible for DHS oversight say they are looking for the administration to nominate someone with broad appeal who could be quickly confirmed.¡°Obviously the border is important, and disaster relief,¡± said Rep. Peter T. King (N.Y.), one of the leading Republican members of the House Homeland Security Committee. ¡°But this department was created to stop terrorism, so it should be someone with a strong counterterrorism or law enforcement background.¡±"
"After nearly nine months of the Trump administration, many of America¡¯s closest allies have concluded that a hoped-for ¡°learning curve¡± they thought would make President Trump a reliable partner is not going to happen. ¡°The idea that he would inform himself, and things would change, that is no longer operative,¡± said a top diplomat here.Instead, they see an administration in which lines of authority and decision-making are unclear, where tweets become policy and hard-won international accords on trade and climate are discarded. The result has been a special kind of challenge for those whose jobs are to advocate for their countries and explain the president and his unconventional ways at?home.Senior diplomats and officials from nearly a dozen countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia expressed a remarkable coincidence of views in interviews over the past several weeks. Asked to describe their thoughts about and relations with the president and his team as the end of Trump¡¯s first year approaches, many described a whirlwind journey beginning with tentative optimism, followed by alarm and finally reaching acceptance that the situation is unlikely to improve.¡°We have to adjust to this,¡± said a second diplomat from a different continent.Their concerns echo those expressed increasingly in public by Republican lawmakers such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker ?(R-Tenn.), who has spoken of administration ¡°chaos¡± and on Sunday described the White House under Trump as an ¡°adult day care center¡± where the president¡¯s behavior must be managed.  Frustrations and fears, building for months, have grown especially intense in the past few weeks following Trump¡¯s  and his apparent decision to decertify Iranian compliance with the international nuclear deal.Although foreign diplomats are restrained by the nature of their jobs from speaking out about the policies and politics of their host governments, it is not unusual for them to trade tips and gossip in the early days of a new administration when information is in short supply and it is unclear which top officials have the most sway with the leader of the free world.But their perplexing dealings with the Trump administration have become an obsession of late for ambassadors.¡°It¡¯s always an undercurrent when we get together,¡± a third senior diplomat said. ¡°We¡¯re always asking each other, ¡®Who do you deal with inside the administration?¡¯ ¡®How do you handle difficult situations?¡¯?¡±¡°When somebody actually sees Trump, people immediately flock around: ¡®What did you see?¡¯ ¡®What did he say?¡¯ ¡®Was Ivanka there?¡¯ .?.?. ¡®What kind of look was on Kelly¡¯s face?¡¯?¡± he said, referring to White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly. It is, he said, a kind of Kremlinology.Some diplomats choose to focus on the positive. Estonian Ambassador Lauri Lepik, whose country¡¯s fears of a resurgent Russia on its eastern border are practically existential, praised . It helped reassure NATO allies after Trump, on an earlier trip to Brussels, failed to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to alliance mutual defense.¡°That was a highly appreciated visit,¡± Lepik said. ¡°The administration was engaged, and we were in constant contact.¡±Others, some of whom had difficulty with the Obama administration, have found a new closeness with the United States. Saudi Arabia, after enduring President Barack Obama¡¯s human rights criticism and policy objections, is now a favored Trump nation.  Newly arrived Hungarian Ambassador Laszlo Szabo, whose government hews to the nationalistic right, said bilateral trade ¡°is improving nicely and constantly.¡± His , was the first European leader during last year¡¯s U.S. campaign to say a Trump presidency would be better for Europe ¡ª a view widely derided by his European partners.Afghanistan¡¯s Ambassador Hamdullah Mohib, whose government was alarmed by the Obama administration¡¯s unfulfilled plans to withdraw the vast majority of U.S. troops from the country, said he and his government had regular high-level access to senior Trump administration officials this summer as heated up. ¡°I was at the White House on a daily basis,¡± he said.The access did not always bring clarity, especially when it came to figuring out how competing fiefdoms operated inside the West Wing. In August, Afghanistan paid $120,000 for a three-month contract with the Sonoran Policy Group, a lobbying firm with close ties to the White House, to gain ¡°a better understanding of how the inside of the Trump administration works,¡± Mohib said.The majority of those interviewed were far more critical and said they would speak candidly only on the condition of anonymity.Several spoke of the difficulty of determining where power lies within the administration and how decisions are made. ¡°We are still not sure how the equilibrium in this administration is playing out in terms of who is responsible for what,¡± a senior European said. ¡°Is it the White House? The State Department? Is Defense calling the shots? .?.?. I¡¯m being clinically analytical, not chiding. This is the situation. We are guessing, sometimes.¡±Things have gotten ¡°a bit better¡± since Kelly¡¯s arrival over the summer, a Latin American said. ¡°At least with process, if not policy. It¡¯s clear [Kelly] has influence. But Jared? McMaster? We don¡¯t know if they¡¯re in or out,¡± he said, referring to Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, Trump¡¯s national security adviser.  Some try to posture in a way they think will appeal to Trump and those around him. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a progressive pragmatist who visited Trump in the White House in June, ¡°tried to sync with him, but it didn¡¯t work,¡± said Joon Hyung Kim, a professor of international studies at Handong University.¡°Moon is really a detail person, and he tried to explain things in detail¡± regarding defense and economic issues,¡± Kim said. ¡°I don¡¯t think Trump really liked that.¡±¡°We want to trust Mattis and others,¡± he said, referring to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, generally considered a moderate buffer for Trump, ¡°but we¡¯re not really sure if they¡¯re 100?percent bulletproof.¡±Many of those interviewed said they are often told by administration officials to ignore Trump¡¯s tweets or undiplomatic remarks. They recognize it is a risky game.¡°In the business sector, you can be very forceful in negotiations,¡± said a diplomat whose government has been on the receiving end of Trump¡¯s tweets. ¡°You call each other names all day, then you sit down and have a martini. In foreign policy, there are consequences to the name-calling. Damage is done.¡±Some foreign diplomats have tried to work around the White House by forging closer relationships with the battered and shrinking Democratic and Republican foreign policy establishment in Congress. Another strategy, particularly on issues related to climate change and trade, has been to work directly with governors, avoiding Washington entirely, several foreign diplomats said.Others said their leaders, in meetings with Trump, have had to decide whether to take on what one called the president¡¯s ¡°one-sentence, very blunt affirmations.¡± Asked to give an example, this official recalled a discussion of the  in which Trump asserted, as he has before, ¡°Iran is allowed to build a bomb¡± as soon as the agreement expires.European signatories to the Iran nuclear deal have given up on trying to change his mind, or to argue that the accord¡¯s sunset provision does not give Tehran a pass to restart its nuclear program. Instead, they have directed their attention to persuading Congress not to legislate new sanctions on?Iran.A diplomat whose country has close and cordial relations and no obvious problems with the administration said his government is nonetheless exploring more extensive trade and diplomatic ties with Asia.¡°At the beginning,¡± he said, Trump was ¡°a fascination.¡± As the months have passed, he said, ¡°all this perplexing noise from Washington, it becomes background noise. And the United States is a bit less important than before.¡±         "
"The Pentagon on Saturday released the name of a U.S. Special Forces soldier killed alongside three other Americans and four Nigerien troops during a surprise attack earlier this week near Niger¡¯s border with Mali.Sgt. La David Johnson, 25, was missing for two days before his body was recovered Friday, officials said. He died Wednesday from wounds ¡°sustained during enemy contact¡± when the small group of U.S. and Nigerien troops was ambushed by dozens of armed militants in pickup trucks. The U.S. and Nigerien group was conducting a reconnaissance patrol, according to the Pentagon.It remains unclear how Johnson, of Miami Gardens, Fla., became separated from other U.S. troops on the patrol or if he had fallen into enemy hands. Officials said Saturday that the incident is under investigation.On Friday,  three of the fallen soldiers as Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35, of Puyallup, Wash.; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; and Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29, of Lyons, Ga. All four were assigned to the Army¡¯s 3rd Special Forces Group, which is based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina and serves as the U.S. military¡¯s primary unconventional-warfare unit operating in Africa.Four Nigerien troops were killed and two other U.S. troops were wounded in the battle, but their names have not been disclosed. Officials said the Americans were in stable condition at a U.S. military hospital in Germany.  The French military, which also maintains a presence in the region, scrambled Mirage fighter jets in response to the attack, presumably to search for La David Johnson and provide support for those under threat on the ground.The White House on Friday said President Trump spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss the situation in Niger. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders demurred when asked whether the administration intends to avenge the troops¡¯ deaths.¡°Obviously,¡± she replied, ¡°any time one of the members of our great military are injured, wounded or killed in action, that is something we take very seriously. .?.?. We¡¯re continuing to review and look into this,¡± she added, noting that White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, a retired general whose Marine son was killed in combat, had kept President Trump apprised of efforts to locate the missing service member.Trump met with his top generals and admirals Thursday to discuss a range of national security issues. While posing for a group photo, he cryptically referred to the moment as ¡°the calm before the storm.¡± When asked what he meant, the president responded, ¡°You¡¯ll find out.¡±  The Pentagon and the White House have long sought to frame the U.S. military¡¯s activities in Niger and elsewhere in Africa as providing support for American allies battling extremists throughout the region ¡ª and being removed from direct combat with those groups.Officials have said the attack occurred during an ¡°advise and assist¡± mission, a broad term that critics say downplays the danger associated with training partner nations using small numbers of troops near militant strongholds.U.S. forces have expanded efforts in Niger, military officials have said, as part of a growing presence in the Sahel region.

That is an increase from 645 in June. About 300 to the south in Cameroon provide logistical and intelligence support.

"Federal authorities revealed Friday they had arrested and charged three men in connection with a 2016 plot to carry out bombings and shootings in crowded areas of New York City, then kept the court case under seal for more than a year as investigators worked.The alleged scheme was more nefarious than many: The group, which wanted to attack Times Square and the New York City subway system, claimed to have been in touch with an Islamic State affiliate to obtain the official sanction of the terrorist group, prosecutors said.One of them, a U.S. citizen living in Pakistan, traveled in that country to meet with explosives experts and another purchased bombmaking materials and secured a cabin within driving distance of New York City, the prosecutors said.By that time, though, the group was unknowingly communicating with an undercover FBI agent, who was posing as an Islamic State supporter, authorities said.  Authorities arrested one in the group in May 2016 after he traveled to the United States, allegedly to prepare for the attacks, and took the others into custody in Pakistan and the Philippines in September 2016 and April 2017.Charged in the case were Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, a 19-year-old Canadian citizen; Talha Haroon, a 19-year-old U.S. citizen living in Pakistan; and Russell Salic, a 37-year-old Philippine citizen, authorities said.Bahnasawy was arrested in New Jersey in May and has pleaded guilty to terrorism offenses. The other two were arrested in the countries in which they live and prosecutors are hoping to extradite them to the United States, authorities said.Prosecutors announced the case against the men as , killing 58 and injuring hundreds more in the worst mass shooting in modern American history. The Islamic State has claimed that attack, though authorities have said repeatedly they have found no evidence to support the terrorist group¡¯s assertion.Prosecutors alleged the men in New York plotted similar mass destruction during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The men wanted to carry out bombings and shootings in Times Square and the New York City subway system and shoot people at concert venues, and they referenced similar attacks in Brussels and Paris, authorities said.Bahnasawy told the undercover FBI agent he wanted to ¡°create the next 9/11¡± and in May 2016 sent maps of the New York City subway system with plans for where explosives could be detonated, prosecutors alleged. He also asserted the group should put a car bomb in Times Square, prosecutors alleged.¡°Look at these crowds of people!¡± he wrote, according to prosecutors.Meanwhile, in Pakistan, Haroon allegedly told the undercover FBI agent that he planned to travel to the United States to join in the attacks and ¡°cause great destruction¡± and that he had been in touch with a branch of the Islamic State active in Pakistan.¡°NY Needs to fall,¡± Haroon wrote to the undercover agent. ¡°It¡¯s a must.¡±Bahnasawy bought 40 pounds of hydrogen peroxide, which prosecutors alleged could be used to make a component of an improvised explosive device, as well as batteries, Christmas lights, thermometers and aluminum foil, prosecutors said.They said Salic, who had a pro-Islamic State social media presence, told the undercover agent he was prepared to transfer money to help fund the attacks and claimed to have previously sent money to other countries to support the Islamic State. He ultimately sent $423 to the undercover agent, authorities said.When Bahnasawy traveled from Canada to the New York City area on May 21, 2016, to begin preparing to execute the plan, Canadian and U.S. law enforcement were watching and took him into custody, authorities said. The case was initially sealed because prosecutors feared revealing it could compromise an ongoing investigation into an imminent terrorism threat.All three men are charged with conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiring to commit terrorism and other related offenses, authorities said."
"   Like many enjoying the final concert of the Route 91 Harvest festival Sunday, Travis and Haley Haldeman thought they were hearing fireworks when the first pops sounded.But when the next volley started, the off-duty firefighter and his wife realized they had to take cover from gunfire.They jumped behind a metal barrier near the stage. Travis¡¯s heartbeat slowed; he knew he had to keep calm. But Haley was in hysterics. She kept thinking about their two children, 2 and 3, and how they should grow up with their parents ¡ª both of them.During a brief pause in the gunfire, Travis turned to the woman he had married nearly four years ago and told her she had to run and he had to stay.¡°?¡®Metro is really good at their job,¡¯?¡± the nine-year Clark County firefighter recalled telling her. ¡°?¡®They¡¯re going to get this guy quick. Run to the Tropicana, and I¡¯ll meet you at home.¡¯?¡±That¡¯s when the couple split.  Haley thought she knew what she was getting into when she married a first responder. She understood he rushed into burning buildings and stormed into the places most people flee.But in the moment, crouched to the ground with a barrage of mysterious gunfire piercing through the night sky, she didn¡¯t want to be alone. And she realized she might never see her husband again.¡°I knew he was going to stay,¡± Haley said.She still heard shots when she ran to a podium and crawled beneath it, joining a scrum of other terrified concertgoers. Haley said the Lord¡¯s Prayer, over and over again.   The shooting stopped.  After separating from his wife, Travis jumped over the barrier and noticed the wounded people.He rushed to a man who had been shot in the leg and was bleeding profusely. They took cover behind a metal pillar while Travis took off his belt and made a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. Travis then threw the injured man onto his back, going about two or three steps as shots skipped across the pavement by his feet. Travis continued on about 100 feet and dropped the man off at a medical tent. Travis hurried back out to help other victims who had been shot taking cover behind a bar. He took one woman shot in the hip into his arms and told another woman with a shoulder injury to grab his shirt while they headed for help.Along the way, a group of about a half-dozen people were frozen by fear.¡°We need to get out of here,¡± Travis said. ¡°We can¡¯t be part of the problem; let¡¯s move.¡±The most critically injured was a panicked young woman who was shot in the lower back. Travis tried to calm her down when an off-duty police officer appeared.The officer had been loading people into his pickup truck to take them to the hospital when he discovered his own daughter was the wounded woman Travis was treating. The woman¡¯s father ¡°miraculously just showed up with a backboard,¡± and they loaded her into the truck. Travis jumped on board, riding with her to the hospital.Haley sprinted to the Tropicana. Through the crowds, she and friends made it to an employee entrance. Frantic people crammed the hallways, and fire alarms wailed. In the panic of fleeing, Haley didn¡¯t realize she was missing her phone. She borrowed a friend¡¯s and called Travis. ¡°It was hard to hear him,¡± Haley said. ¡°He said he was on the back of a pickup truck taking a young girl to the hospital. I knew he was safe at that time. It was just a matter of getting home and getting together again. It was what I was focusing on and what I couldn¡¯t wait for.¡±Haley made it home just before midnight. Her children were asleep under the watch of their nanny, but she was a ¡°hot mess.¡±She called her mother in the middle of the night screaming, unable to calm down, wondering when her husband would return.About 3? hours later, relief.Travis walked though the door, looking drained, but home.¡°I gave him a big old hug and then gave him a little bit of a shove for not being together all throughout it,¡± Haley said. ¡°I prepared for the kind of man I married. I know he¡¯s that kind of guy, but in the moment, you have the selfishness of ¡®I want my person with me.¡¯ ¡±It was difficult being away from his family, but Travis said he knew he had to help. ¡°I looked around and saw a lot of people that could benefit greatly from my experience and calmness,¡± Travis said. ¡°It was just a split-second gut decision that I had to make.¡± "
"Defense officials have released the names of three elite Special Forces soldiers killed in an ambush during a reconnaissance patrol Wednesday in Niger, near the border with Mali.On Friday, U.S. officials identified the fallen soldiers as Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, 35, of Puyallup, Wash.; Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson, 39, of Springboro, Ohio; and Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright, 29 of Lyons, Ga. All were assigned to the Army¡¯s 3rd Special Forces Group, which is based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.Details about their mission are still unclear, though media reports have detailed a brief but brutal fight involving dozens of fighters in armed pickup trucks called technicals. The Pentagon and the White House have long sought to frame the U.S. military¡¯s activities there, and elsewhere on the African continent, as providing support for American allies battling extremists throughout the region ¡ª and being removed from direct combat with those groups.That appears to be changing, observers say. ¡°Training operations have picked up in recent years, and with this incident, the U.S. seems to be getting closer and closer to combat operations,¡± said Andrew Lebovich, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.U.S. forces have expanded efforts in Niger, military officials have said, as part of a growing presence in the Sahel region. The vast expanse of desert stretches across the continent, and have taken advantage of instability in Libya, where arms and fighters flow into a region difficult to govern.About 800 U.S. personnel are assigned to posts in Niger, mostly at two sites focused on gathering aerial reconnaissance for Nigerien forces. That is an increase from 645 in June. About 300 to the south in Cameroon provide logistical and intelligence support.This expansion is a potential tension point for President Trump, who has sought to facilitate the Pentagon¡¯s counterterrorism objectives while calling for scaling back the U.S. military global footprint because his political base does not see such missions as vital to the national interest.Those impulses appear to collide in the Sahel, putting the Pentagon and the White House in the difficult position of explaining to the American public how three elite soldiers were killed on a mission that many did not previously know existed.On Thursday, the Pentagon¡¯s chief spokeswoman, Dana White, said the soldiers died, along with a ¡°partner nation member,¡± from enemy contact, although she was careful to avoid the word ¡°combat.¡±¡°To the soldiers in the fight, it was ,¡± added Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., who is director of the Pentagon¡¯s Joint Staff. He and White endured a tense exchange with reporters, who questioned the two officials over the often-fraught characterization of troops killed by gunfire, explosions and in other hostile acts in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. troops are charged with similar missions to buttress partner forces.But McKenzie emphasized that the overall conditions in western Niger were not characterized as combat.If the mission was indeed training, Lebovich said, ¡°it seems it was meant to be a realistic training mission.¡±The soldiers¡¯ deaths mark the first known hostile-fire casualties among U.S. forces in Niger. A soldier with the 3rd Special Forces Group, the main unconventional warfare unit in the Africa Command, was killed in a vehicle accident there in February.The incident Wednesday occurred about 120 miles north of Niamey, the capital, near the border with Mali, officials said. White and McKenzie refused to elaborate on the nature of the mission or why U.S. forces were so close to Mali, a country rife with militant activity. They would not say whether Wednesday¡¯s operation indicates plans to expand security missions in the region or whether other hostile engagements have recently occurred there.The United States already conducts surveillance drone flights piloted from Niamey and is finishing construction on an installation at Agadez, a central city in the Sahara, that will move flights closer to southern Libya and northern Mali, allowing surveillance aircraft to stay in the air longer.Lebovich said Special Forces personnel have, since at least 2014, run training operations out of Ouallam, a town halfway between Niamey and the Mali border, where militants cross for incursions into Niger. Officials acknowledged activity at Ouallam but did not specify what operations were based there.The Drive, a website that chronicles international defense activity, reported recently that the Pentagon has contracted fuel deliveries there, indicating the need to keep tactical missions self-sustainable in remote regions far from Niamey.Deepening involvement in Africa translates to a learning curve for U.S. forces there, said Nasser Weddady, a regional security analyst. French military forces are posted across the region and have a deeper cultural understanding because France is a former colonial power in the region. France also holds business interestsin uranium mines there, he said.¡°The French know these places. This is their Tijuana. This is their Mexico,¡± Weddady said of the Sahel. ¡°The U.S. is still discovering the place.¡±News of the deaths appeared to Weddady as a turning point in U.S. involvement in Africa, and he thinks there may be eagerness to expand operations in what he called the logic of war, which could lead to a spiral of involvement.¡°How do you strike that optimal balance of security and assistance?¡± Weddady said. ¡°Until yesterday we had that balance. And then it went out of whack.¡±        "
"Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued sweeping guidance to executive branch agencies Friday on the Justice Department¡¯s interpretation of how the government should respect religious freedom, triggering an immediate backlash from civil liberties groups who asserted the nation¡¯s top law enforcement officer was trying to offer a license for discrimination.In a memorandum titled ¡°Federal Law Protections for Religious Liberty,¡± Sessions articulated 20 sweeping principles about religious freedom and what that means for the U.S. government ¡ª among them that freedom of religion extends to people and organizations; that religious employers are allowed to hire only those whose conduct is consistent with their beliefs; and that grants can¡¯t require religious organizations to change their character.Though the principles are lofty ¡ª and some of them in no way objectionable ¡ª they could have a broad negative impact, permitting religious groups to impinge on the rights of LGBT people and others, said civil liberties advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Equality Federation and others. The announcement, though, was welcomed by groups like the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council.¡°Except in the narrowest circumstances, no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law,¡± Sessions wrote. ¡°Therefore, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, religious observance and practice should be reasonably accommodated in all government activity, including employment, contracting, and programming.¡±The most immediate effect seemed to be on the Affordable Care Act¡¯s contraception coverage mandate. On Friday, the Trump administration issued a rule ¡ª which the ACLU said it would sue over, but groups like the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said they support ¡ª allowing a much broader group of employers and insurers to exempt themselves from covering contraceptives, such as birth control pills, on religious or moral grounds.  Sessions had offered some legal justification for that in the memo. He wrote that requiring employers to provide insurance coverage of contraceptives in violation of their religious belief ¡°substantially burdens¡± their free practice of religion.¡°This is a direct attack on women¡¯s rights,¡± said Vanita Gupta, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.  And civil liberties groups said there could be other effects. The principle allowing religious employers to hire only those whose conduct is consistent with their beliefs, for example, might allow a religious school to fire a teacher who had a child out of wedlock or a man who wed another man, said Louise Melling, deputy legal director at the ACLU.¡°It is countenancing discrimination,¡± Melling said. ¡°It is countenancing exercises of faith in a way that will harm other individuals.¡±Senior Justice Department officials said the guidance was not meant to be a policy position, but rather, an interpretation of existing federal law. They said it was not meant to address any current legal dispute, nor was it meant to condone discrimination.A  barring federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation remains in place, Justice Department officials said.Family Research Council President Tony Perkins praised the memo, saying that under the Obama administration, agencies lost a proper understanding of religious freedom.¡°President Trump and the Department of Justice are putting federal government agencies on notice: you will not only respect the freedom of every American to believe but live according to those beliefs,¡± he said in a statement.The guidance was generated in response to  that was supposed to make it easier for churches to engage in politics without losing their tax-exempt status. Sessions¡¯s memo said the IRS should not treat religious organizations different from secular nonprofits.Trump¡¯s order is being challenged in court, though some religious activists and experts have said it was more symbolic than practically meaningful.  Rick Garnett, a law professor at University of Notre Dame, said in some respects, the guidance served to ¡°summarize, restate, and endorse existing and established Supreme Court doctrine,¡± but in others, it took ¡°strong religious-freedom stands on questions that are contested.¡±Religious schools, hospitals and other organizations would probably welcome the memo, as it would increase their ability to compete for federal grants, Garnett said. Analysts said the Justice Department seemed to be interpreting broadly  that said efforts at separating church and state go too far when they deny religious institutions access to government grants meant for a secular purpose. Some analysts think that the decision was written narrowly to address only the issue of getting a grant to purchase recycled tires to resurface a playground.The Justice Department under Sessions and Trump has changed course significantly from the Obama administration, especially on issues of civil rights and protections for LGBT people.For example, Sessions  that a major federal civil rights law barring employers from sex discrimination does not offer protection to transgender people. The Justice Department also sided with a Colorado cake baker who would not bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.Rebecca Isaacs, executive director of the Equality Federation, said the latest memo was a ¡°an attack on the values of freedom and fairness that make this nation great.¡±¡°Freedom of religion is one of our nation¡¯s most fundamental values, which is why it is already strongly protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution,¡± Isaacs said. ¡°But the freedom of religion does not give people the right to impose their beliefs on others, to harm others, or to discriminate.¡±Others, though, said concerns might be overblown.¡°Most of what it actually says is bland and general,¡± said Doug Laycock, a professor at University of Virginia Law School. ¡°Whether it is significant depends on the follow-through and on how it is interpreted.¡± Robert Barnes and Sandhya Somashekhar contributed to this report."
"The United States permanently lifted a raft of sanctions on Sudan on Friday, saying the African nation had begun addressing concerns about terrorism as well as human rights abuses against civilians in the country¡¯s Darfur region.The decision to lift the sanctions and end an economic embargo comes after the Trump administration last month  of countries whose citizens are subject to travel restrictions. Sudan was the only country that was removed.But the decision leaves other sanctions in place for the time being, including those against individuals with arrest warrants related to atrocities committed during the . And it does not remove Sudan from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, a removal ardently sought by its government. A separate review is underway on that designation.The change reflects a strategy shift in how to bring about reforms in Sudan, where President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has clung to power since taking office in a military coup in 1989. Instead of relying solely on punishment via sanctions, the new strategy is to use relief to encourage more changes.The sanctions relief also was part of a push to enlist more countries in an effort to  U.S. officials said that while it was not an explicit condition for lifting sanctions, Washington told Khartoum that an ¡°absolute, vital part of the relationship¡± going forward is full compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions related to North Korea.Officials also said they asked for and got a commitment from ?Sudan not to purchase arms from Pyongyang. A U.N. report last year found that Sudan bought North Korean air-to-ground missiles in 2013 in a deal with a front company.¡°We will not necessarily take the government at their word,¡± one official said. ¡°We will closely be monitoring the situation. And they understand we have zero tolerance for continued arms deals with North Korea.¡±The lifting of sanctions rescinds measures imposed in 1997 related to terrorism concerns and other steps put in place in 2006 in connection with the conflict in Darfur. The sanctions were temporarily eased in January just before President Barack Obama left office, with his administration citing the same progress the Trump administration noted. In July, President  for three months, angering the Sudanese, who stopped some lower-level meetings with U.S. officials in retaliation but maintained contacts between senior officials.A State Department official familiar with the decision said the administration will continue pushing Sudan to make more progress, including paving the way for 2?million internally displaced people who fled the fighting in Darfur more than a decade ago to return home safely.¡°We see this as an important milestone, but one on a road that¡¯s going to take a lot longer to get to where we want to go in Sudan,¡± said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under State Department guidelines.¡°It¡¯s a real marker, taking what had been a very bad and difficult relationship in a new and positive direction. It doesn¡¯t mean there isn¡¯t much to do. There¡¯s a lot to do yet. This is a productive first step.¡±Sudan routinely shows up as a country of particular concern on State Department reports assessing human rights and . Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court to face genocide charges related to the Darfur conflict. Muslims are an overwhelming majority, and Christians who remained in Sudan after South Sudan declared independence in 2011 are closely watched. Many of those with means are fleeing the country, seeing little future there.But U.S. officials think Sudan has made progress in counterterrorism since the days when Osama bin Laden lived there in the early 1990s. Officials in Sudan say that since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Sudanese have been cooperating with U.S. intelligence.The State Department official said Sudan has cooperated in countering militants inside Sudan and throughout North Africa by helping deter attempts by terrorists to transit through the country.U.S. officials also have seen progress on the humanitarian front. The government has announced unilateral cease-fires in areas where the Sudanese army has been battling rebels; stopped aerial bombardments that killed civilians; and created safe routes for humanitarian aid to get through.There also are geopolitical factors. Both Israel and Saudi Arabia have urged the United States to ease up on Sudan, to encourage it to distance itself from Iran. And while Sudan has by all reports stopped sending arms and material support to , Washington wants to encourage a regional effort to end the fighting there, which has prompted one of the biggest waves of refugees since the Rwanda genocide.Some human rights activists have worried that sanctions relief will prolong Bashir¡¯s reign. Members of Congress have urged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to make sure that American victims of terrorism facilitated by Sudan would be compensated. And Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) said Friday that Sudan¡¯s progress has been minimal and vowed that ¡°any backsliding will likely result in Congress reinstating sanctions.¡±But even the Obama administration recognized that sanctions alone have not been effective.¡°For far too long, Washington promoted a policy of punishment only,¡± said Zach Vertin, a former diplomat who worked on Sudan issues during the Obama administration. ¡°It failed for two decades. Everyone agrees that transformational change in necessary. .¡°Khartoum still wants many things from Washington,¡± Vertin said. ¡°Now the administration is in a good place to extract further gains. The administration should make clear if Khartoum wants to continue the path to normalization, it should continue progress in the identified areas and undertake a long overdue process that leads to a political transition.¡±"
"More than any other issue that has threatened transatlantic cohesion this year, President Trump¡¯s decision to decertify Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal could start a chain of events that would sharply divide the United States from its closest traditional allies in the world.¡°After the Paris climate decision,¡± in which Trump withdrew the United States from a widely supported, painfully negotiated accord, ¡°this could push multilateralism to the breaking point,¡± said a senior official from one of the three European signatories to the Iran deal.None of the three ¡ª Britain, France and Germany ¡ª believes Iran is in violation, and each has said publicly  U.S. imposition of sanctions affecting banks that even indirectly do business in Iran would doubtless influence those countries¡¯ companies, they say, and would be considered an unfriendly act.  ¡°We will not follow the United States in reneging on our international obligations with this deal,¡± said a second official. ¡°Not the E-3, nor the rest of the 28¡± members of the European Union.Trump is expected to give a speech late next week announcing his decision and outlining the results of a months-long Iran policy review. People familiar with his thinking say he will not certify that Iran is and will declare that sticking with the deal is no longer in the U.S. national interest.Nothing will happen immediately, as the decision would be punted to Congress. The Senate could decide to restore pre-deal sanctions on Iran with a simple majority of 51, including a vote by Vice President Pence to break any tie.In that case, Iran could call for a meeting of the majority-ruled committee of signatories and, an assertion with which the Europeans think they would be hard put to disagree. That would put them on the same side as two other signatories ¡ª China and Russia ¡ª that are sure to support Iran, leaving the United States as a minority of one.¡°What do we do? What do we say?¡± asked the first European official, one of several from the signatory countries who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the sensitive diplomatic issue. ¡°It would be a big crisis.¡±The Europeans insist that everyone with whom they have spoken inside the Trump administration ¡ª except for Trump himself ¡ª has expressed But they have for some time considered his decision a foregone conclusion and have directed their attention to Congress, where even some Republicans who have long opposed the deal as deeply flawed worry that a reimposition of sanctions might make matters worse.¡°We¡¯re working the Hill a lot,¡± the first official said. ¡°What we understand is that there is no inclination in the Senate to kill the deal by voting immediate sanctions. Staffers tell us that nothing is decided. ¡°But we¡¯re convinced somebody like Cotton will go out with a bill,¡± said the official, referring to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). ¡°That will cause a crisis among the Republicans. .?.?. Nobody wants to appear to be defending Iran. Nobody wants to appear to be defending Obama.¡±The White House has , and Cotton himself, an outspoken hawk on Iran who met Thursday with Trump, said this week that he has ¡°no intention right now to introduce .?.?. sanctions legislation.¡± While a law passed when the deal was done gives Congress 60 days to reimpose the sanctions lifted by the agreement with relative ease, lawmakers can take more time and pass a new sanctions law whenever they want.¡°I¡¯m not sure 60 days is enough,¡± Cotton said Tuesday at the Council on Foreign Relations, for the United States to practice ¡°coercive diplomacy¡± to bend others to its will. It might, he said, take until spring but no longer.¡°I hope we don¡¯t have to coerce allies. I¡¯d like to persuade allies,¡± Cotton said. ¡°Many of them don¡¯t require much persuasion, allies in the Middle East, for instance,¡± although they are not signatories to the deal. ¡°But, ultimately, countries have to make a decision, if it comes to that. Do they want to deal with the United States¡¯ $19?trillion economy, or do they want to deal with Iran¡¯s economy .?.?. about the size of Maryland?¡±Even if European political leaders are unpersuaded, he said, European businesses, vulnerable to U.S. sanctions if they continue dealing with Iran, may be. And if that does not work, Cotton said, ¡°let there be no doubt about this point: If forced to take action, the United States has the ability to totally destroy Iran¡¯s nuclear infrastructure. And if they choose to rebuild it, we could destroy it again, until they get the picture.¡±Such comments infuriate the Europeans. ¡°I would remind our American friends that when we started to impose sanctions, the United States did not have any trade with Iran .?.?. [and] we carried the burden¡± of financial losses, G¨¦rard Araud, France¡¯s ambassador to the United States, said last week at the Atlantic Council.A Western diplomat in Zurich said the Europeans are contemplating reviving regulations the E.U. used to shield its companies and individuals from U.S. secondary sanctions in the 1990s. ¡°Everyone¡¯s looking at options,¡± the diplomat said.Any deal without the United States would be ¡°very fragile¡± in terms of keeping the incentive for Iran to uphold its side of the bargain, said a senior executive with a large multinational corporation. ¡°It will also play to the hard-liners in Iran and help shift power back to them,¡± the executive said.Long-standing Republican antipathy to the deal has come back to haunt its creators. Negotiators had envisioned a U.S. president who would justify staying in the arrangement as long as Iran lived up to its obligations, not a  The 60-day, expedited ¡°snapback¡± provision in U.S. law was designed to punish Iran quickly in the event it violated the deal and did not envision that the United States would breach it.Europeans are frustrated with what they consider misperceptions about what the .

"The Las Vegas gunman used ¡°bump stocks¡¯¡¯ to turn at least a dozen rifles into something akin to automatic weapons, as well as remote video cameras to alert him when police were closing in on his firing positions, according to law enforcement officials.One of the cameras was placed on a room service food cart just outside Stephen Paddock¡¯s hotel room door, in what officials said was an apparent effort to get an early warning when police were about to break in. At least one other camera was positioned inside the room, apparently for the same reason, officials said.People familiar with the investigation said the cameras were linked to a tablet device that allowed the gunman to ¡°watch his back¡± for first responders while firing down on the concert crowd from his 32nd-story suite, killing 58 people and injuring more than 500 others.  The cameras and weaponry speak to what officials said Tuesday was a remarkable amount of planning and preparation by the shooter to increase the lethality of his attack. He may have used the cameras to ensure he was not captured alive, according to people familiar with the investigation.When a SWAT team burst into his room, they found him dead on the floor, apparently having shot himself in the mouth with a silver, black-handled revolver.Officials revealed more details of the 23-gun arsenal Paddock brought up to Room 32-135 of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. He hauled them in suitcases and apparently was stealthy enough that hotel staff members never spotted the weapons and stacks of ammunition magazines.Detectives believe he used a hammer to break out two windows in the large suite, then moved between the openings, alternating weapons as he alternated windows, according to people familiar with the investigation.After the attack, investigators found another 19 guns at the shooter¡¯s home in Mesquite, Nev. Authorities say the weapons purchases appear to have been legal, some acquired at local stores near his home and others bought at chain retailers such as Cabela¡¯s.ATF officials said Tuesday evening that 12 of the guns recovered in Las Vegas had ¡°bump fire¡¯¡¯ stocks ¡ª devices which make semi-automatic weapons fire almost as fast as fully automatic weapons. Investigators are still working to determine how many guns in his arsenal he used. Agents from the FBI¡¯s headquarters were in Las Vegas to help collect evidence, some of which would be sent back to FBI labs for further testing and evaluation, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said.  The arsenal included AR-15-type rifles, as well as an AK-47-type weapon, according to officials. Some of the weapons were mounted on bipods. At least one had a scope.Photos obtained by local  show an AR-15-type rifle on the floor of the hotel room. The weapon has a bump- or slide-fire modification, said Cody Wilson, director of Defense Distributed, which primarily sells a gunmaking machine.Bump-fire stocks, first made by the company Slide Fire, are legal modifications to the lower receiver of rifles that simulate automatic fire. The modified stock harnesses the energy from recoil, forcing the firing mechanism to move faster than originally designed, according to the Trace, a nonprofit website that examines gun violence in the United States. Numerous videos online, including from Slide Fire, demonstrate the mechanics.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives decided in 2010 that bump stocks do not violate federal firearms laws.The modified rifle with the bump-fire mechanism included a high-capacity magazine that could hold between 60 and 100 rounds, an EOTech-brand holographic sight and a forward hand grip ¡ª a key accessory that allows a shooter to push the rifle away from the body to bounce, or bump, the weapon into the trigger finger.Those components used together in a weapon suggest a desire to quickly shoot a lot of automatic-like fire into masses of people without much concern for accuracy, as the recoil from simulated automatic fire would make it difficult to hit specific targets at long range. The concert stage was between 400 and 500 yards from the hotel.¡°He obviously tried this out before he was in the hotel room,¡± Wilson said. He added that his initial conclusion from audio of the gunfire pointed to a bump modification on at least one weapon. The fire rate was inconsistent with a weapon originally designed to fire automatically, Wilson said.  Another photographed weapon, however, shows a meticulous collection of accessories indicating that the shooter also readied himself for precision fire.An AR-15-type weapon  with a magnification scope commonly used for hunting, which assists in focusing on individual targets for single shots. The bipod legs at the front of the weapon would have been used to steady the rifle on hard surfaces, such as a table, a move that could have provided distance from the window that would help conceal smoke and gunfire flashes.That weapon did not appear to have been modified beyond the accessories, Wilson said.Las Vegas officials have opened an internal investigation into how the photos of the crime scene became public.Lombardo said authorities have recovered .223-caliber weapons ¡ª associated with AR-15-style rifles ¡ª as well as at least one .308 rifle ¡ª a caliber common for hunting game. Lombardo was unsure whether any of the weapons were originally designed as automatic, or whether any illegal modifications were used on other weapons.Other controversial yet legal modifications can simulate automatic fire, such as attachable cranks, gunmetal versions of a jack-in-the-box handle that attach to the weapon and strike the trigger faster than a finger can. A crank can be bought online for as little as $40.Modifications such as the bump stock and crank do not technically qualify adapted rifles as automatic weapons or machine guns, which are legal but difficult to obtain and highly regulated in the United States. Those weapons are commonly found at gun shows and firing ranges, including one near Las Vegas that allows customers to shoot military-grade weapons.The high number of firearms found at the hotel suggest a concern for overheating rifle barrels. The barrels can reach several hundred degrees, turning orange and even blue as rounds travel thousands of feet per second through them. In one crime-scene photo published by the Daily Mail, the gunman appears to be wearing a glove on his left hand, probably for holding a smoking-hot barrel."
" Former health and human services secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified Tuesday that Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) asked her for help in changing a Medicare billing policy that cost his supporter, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, millions of dollars.Sebelius, testifying as a prosecution witness in , recounted the events leading up to an August 2012 meeting with Menendez and then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) at Reid¡¯s office.¡°I don¡¯t know exactly what [Menendez] wanted, just that he wanted me to do something,¡± Sebelius, a Kansas Democrat who led HHS from 2009 to 2014, testified. ¡°My definite impression was that he was very concerned that the policy was inconsistent and unfair and something should be done.¡±After meeting for about 30 minutes, Sebelius declined to take action, explaining that she thought the policy was consistent and clear and in keeping with safety protocols.The defense has argued that Menendez was voicing concerns about a national policy issue, an appropriate action for someone with congressional oversight duties, and that he didn¡¯t even bring up Melgen¡¯s name during the meeting.  Menendez¡¯s intervention in the Medicare issue is a key prong in the government¡¯s case. The senator is accused of fighting for Melgen¡¯s business and personal interests in exchange for political donations, trips on Melgen¡¯s private plane and other gifts.Sebelius testified that she turned down an earlier request from Menendez to meet about the issue and didn¡¯t agree to talk to him until Melgen¡¯s appeal of the case was no longer before her agency.She said she was surprised when Reid set up the meeting.¡°It was unusual for Senator Reid to ask me to come to a meeting involving another member of Congress,¡± Sebelius said, adding it was the only time she could recall a member of Congress asking her to discuss a specific Medicare or Medicaid billing policy.Over the past week, the prosecution has laid out the chronology of events that led to the meeting at Reid¡¯s office, which came three years after Menendez started advocating for his friend on the Medicare issue.Menendez worked his way up the HHS ladder until getting all the way to Sebelius. Along the way, Menendez also , who declined to get involved.At every turn, a sometimes angry Menendez challenged Medicare¡¯s policy on the ¡°multi-dosing¡± of a drug for macular degeneration. At issue was Melgen¡¯s practice of splitting single vials of the drug into multiple doses and billing Medicare for more than one vial. The agency ended up coming after him, demanding repayment of $8.9 million.The defense has argued that Medicare policy allowed for the multi-dosing of another similar eye drug.Prosecution witness Jonathan Blum, a former official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, testified this week that a contentious 2009 phone call with Menendez ended with the senator hanging up on him. Blum also attended the 2012 meeting, along with Reid, Menendez staffers and another HHS official.From the time Menendez¡¯s staff first contacted Medicare officials, it was the agency¡¯s thought that he was advocating for Melgen, Blum testified, a claim that the defense repeatedly disputed Tuesday.An internal HHS email introduced Tuesday as evidence notes that Menendez¡¯s office said it didn¡¯t want Melgen punished if he complied with Medicare regulations.Two months before the meeting at Reid¡¯s office, Menendez met with Medicare¡¯s acting top administrator, Marilyn Tavenner, who said she thought the purpose of the meeting was to discuss her Senate confirmation process.Instead, Tavenner said, she was confronted with the Medicare billing issue. She backed Blum¡¯s conclusion that the agency¡¯s actions were appropriate. Abbe Lowell, Menendez¡¯s attorney, produced a memo from Menendez¡¯s office showing that he wanted to discuss a range of issues with Tavenner.But Tavenner recalled talking only about the Medicare situation.¡°(Menendez) said he wasn¡¯t satisfied with my actions, so he would take additional steps,¡± Tavenner testified on Tuesday. ¡°He told he me was disappointed .?.?. and he wouldn¡¯t let it stand.¡±That led to the meeting with Sebelius, who agreed with her staffers¡¯ responses.Blum testified that he didn¡¯t recall Menendez or Reid making a specific request during the 30-minute meeting, but he remembered Reid expressing frustration to Sebelius and stating that the Medicare billing policy ¡°doesn¡¯t make any sense.¡±Reid was the only person at the meeting who brought up Melgen specifically, Blum said.After the meeting, Menendez said he would use the ¡°full power¡± of his seat on the Senate Finance Committee to get the answers he was seeking, Blum said.Blum said his only follow-up to the meeting was to look into whether doctors who ¡°multi-dose¡± can be reimbursed for administrative costs unrelated to the cost of the medicine itself.With every element of the Medicare dispute discussed in excruciating detail, U.S. District Judge Williams Walls cautioned jurors on Tuesday that they shouldn¡¯t parse the details of the dispute, but rather determine ¡°whether the squabble was the subject of a conspiracy to commit bribery.¡±The seven-woman, five-man jury will be called upon to untangle a web of gifts and campaign contributions to determine whether they amounted to bribes. The trial, now in its fifth week, is taking place against the backdrop of recent rulings in similar cases that have narrowed the definition for what qualifies as an ¡°official act¡± by a politician.With the jury out of the courtroom, Walls referred to the most high-profile of those cases, the U.S. Supreme Court¡¯s reversal of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell¡¯s (R) conviction on bribery charges.It is unclear whether Reid will testify."
"The State Department will ?expel 15 Cuban diplomats after dramatically reducing the U.S. mission in Cuba last week, citing unexplained injuries among American personnel there. The decision announced Tuesday is certain to deepen the two countries¡¯ rift over what the State Department has called  during the past 10 months. The United States has not blamed Cuba, which has denied any involvement and has cooperated with FBI agents dispatched there.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement that the expulsion was ¡°due to Cuba¡¯s failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention. This order will ensure equity in our respective diplomatic operations.¡±  The expelled Cubans, whose names were on a list presented to the Cuban ambassador Tuesday morning, will have seven days to leave the country. Last week, the State Department said it would pull more than half its personnel out of the U.S. Embassy in Havana, and they are expected to leave by the end of the week.Neither the FBI nor a separate Cuban investigation has been able to determine what and who is causing the maladies that have befallen at least 22 Americans stationed at the embassy, with symptoms ranging from hearing loss to cognitive disorders. They are believed to have been ¡°targeted¡± either in their residences within compounds owned by the Cuban government or in hotels. The most recent incident happened in late August, but some conditions are still being diagnosed. On Monday, the State Department confirmed an additional victim, who is believed to have been attacked in January.One possibility being explored is whether the diplomats were made ill by a ¡°sonic attack,¡± though the State Department has refrained from using that term. It is also possible that they are being singled out by a third country seeking to create tension between Cuba and the United States, which normalized relations and reopened their embassies two years ago after half a century of enmity.  Now, what had been hoped to be a historic opening is backsliding to an era of mutual suspicion and recrimination. On Friday, the State Department issued a travel warning advising all American visitors to stay away because their safety could not be guaranteed, a measure that is certain to harm Cuban tourism, the most dynamic segment of the economy. It also suspended issuing visas to Cubans, a step that makes it difficult for Cuban Americans to reunite with relatives.¡°It appears that this plays right into the hands of a potential rogue actor ¡ª Russia perhaps ¡ª that is trying to create a further wedge between our two countries and other nations in the hemisphere,¡± said Rep. Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), however, scoffed at the notion that Cuba is not responsible.¡°No one should be fooled by the Castro regime¡¯s claim it knows nothing about how these harmful attacks are occurring or who perpetrated them,¡± he said, calling for the embassy in Havana to be downgraded to an interests section.But it remained unclear how expelling Cubans would further the investigation into one of the great diplomatic whodunits of all time. And the U.S. response could be playing into the hands of the perpetrators, whoever they are.¡°If these health incidents are indeed targeted attacks, their intentions are to disrupt bilateral relations and affect dialogue and engagement,¡± said Collin Laverty, head of Cuba Educational Travel. ¡°Scaling down embassies gives them the result they are aiming for.¡±Cuban officials last week expressed disappointment with the U.S. reaction. A concerned Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr¨ªguez Parrilla flew to Washington in a futile attempt to dissuade Tillerson from withdrawing U.S. diplomats. But the Cubans have said they will continue to cooperate in what is already an unprecedented willingness to allow FBI agents into Cuba to investigate.¡°If the U.S. government is serious about solving this mystery, they shouldn¡¯t make it more difficult to cooperate with the Cuban government during this critical time of the investigation,¡± said James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a group that aims to strengthen U.S.-Cuba ties. The 15 Cuban diplomats being expelled represent about the same percentage being withdrawn from the U.S. Embassy, officials said, though the actual number of personnel ordered to leave Havana has not been disclosed.The Americans will not be allowed to return to Cuba until the government in Havana can ensure their well-being, said the U.S. official assigned to brief reporters on the expulsion. He could not, however, explain how the Cubans could offer those assurances if no one knows the cause, much less when it may be safe for diplomats to return.¡°We are making it clear that the safety and well-being of our people is being affected by these health attacks,¡± said a State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under administration ground rules for briefing the media. ¡°We can no longer expose them to the environment down there.¡±"
"Weeks before he allegedly planted bombs in New York City and New Jersey, federal officials say  had a jokey text conversation with a relative about explosives and government surveillance.¡°Don¡¯t wanna find any bomb plans,¡¯¡¯ the unidentified relative texted him in August of 2016, according to court records.¡°This is not the place to joke,¡¯¡¯ Rahimi replied. ¡°Too late they reading our messages,¡¯¡¯ the relative answered, adding ¡°IF THE NSA IS READING THIS I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING.¡¯¡¯ Rahimi then replied: ¡°Give them good reason to invade my privacy.¡¯¡¯On Monday morning, Rahimi will go on trial in Manhattan federal court, accused of detonating a bomb in the Chelsea neighborhood on Sept. 17, 2016, that injured 31 people, sent a dumpster flying, and sparked a frantic manhunt for the suspect. He also left a bomb in New York, detonated one earlier along the course of a charity 5k race in Seaside Park, N.J., and dumped a bag full of pipe bombs outside a train station before trying to disappear, according to investigators.The two-day manhunt ended when police officers in Linden, N.J., approached a man sleeping in the doorway of a bar. Investigators say the 29-year-old Rahimi pulled a gun from a fanny pack and started shooting. One of the bullets struck an officer in his bulletproof vest. Rahimi was badly wounded in the shootout.  While in the hospital recuperating, Rahimi made several incriminating statements to FBI agents, but Rahimi¡¯s attorneys argue that those exchanges were improper because their client was suffering from grave injuries, in and out of consciousness and in no condition to waive his Miranda rights. Prosecutors have said they will not try to use those statements at trial.Court records show they have a wealth of other evidence. Besides the text messages, there are emails from 2012 showing Rahimi¡¯s interest in violent Islamist militant propaganda, sales records indicating he bought the material used to make pressure-cooker bombs and pipe bombs, and video that captures him leaving his neighborhood in New Jersey and traveling to the bomb sites.There are also videos shot outside his residence on the day the bombs were planted that show a figure who appears to be Rahimi carrying multiple bags, video of his arrival at Penn Station in Manhattan, video of his movements and specifically leaving one of the bombs on West 27th Street. Investigators say they have fingerprint evidence tying Rahimi to the bombs, according to court records.Prosecutors also hope to show the jury the mangled trash container that was sent flying, allegedly after Rahimi placed one of the pressure-cooker bombs inside it. The most damning evidence, however, may be the letter written in a notebook Rahimi was carrying when he had the shootout with police. Stained by blood and torn in places, the letter is addressed to the U.S. government and describes his anger over U.S. foreign policy, indicates his admiration of Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki, and ends with the declaration: ¡°Inshallah the sounds of bombs will be heard in the streets. Gunshots to your police. Death to your OPPRESSION.¡¯¡¯Rahimi, whose last name is sometimes spelled in government documents as Rahami, faces a possible life prison sentence if convicted in what is expected to be a two-week trial. He also faces separate charges in New Jersey for the bombs allegedly left there.Counterterrorism officials have described Rahimi as  who was not part of any broader conspiracy, but someone inspired by terrorist propaganda ¡ª much of it from overseas ¡ª who decided to act on his own. Prosecutors say a laptop in Rahimi¡¯s home contained 14 issues of al-Qaeda¡¯s ¡°Inspire¡± magazine, which included various bombmaking recipes.The case also shows the difficulty of preventing terrorist threats even when there is a hint of danger. The FBI briefly looked into Rahimi in 2014, after they learned his father had made comments to others indicating his son might be involved in terrorism. But that investigation ended after an FBI review found no links between Rahimi and terrorist groups. "
"Last August, a secret message was passed from Washington to Cairo warning about a mysterious vessel steaming toward the Suez Canal. The bulk freighter named was flying Cambodian colors but had sailed from North Korea, the warning said, with a North Korean crew and an unknown cargo shrouded by heavy tarps.Armed with this tip, customs agents were waiting when the ship entered Egyptian waters. They swarmed the vessel and discovered, concealed under bins of iron ore, a cache of more than 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades. It was, as a United Nations report later concluded, the ¡°largest seizure of ammunition in the history of sanctions against the Democratic People¡¯s Republic of Korea.¡±But who were the rockets for? The Jie Shun¡¯s final secret would take months to resolve and would yield perhaps the biggest surprise of all: The buyers were the Egyptians themselves.A U.N. investigation uncovered a complex arrangement in which Egyptian business executives ordered millions of dollars worth of North Korean rockets for the country¡¯s military while also taking pains to keep the transaction hidden, according to U.S. officials and Western diplomats familiar with the findings. The incident, many details of which were never publicly revealed, prompted the latest in a series of intense, if private, U.S. complaints over Egyptian efforts to obtain banned military hardware from Pyongyang, the officials said.It also shed light on a little-understood global arms trade that has become an increasingly vital financial lifeline for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the wake of .  A statement from the Egyptian Embassy in Washington pointed to Egypt¡¯s ¡°transparency¡± and cooperation with U.N. officials in finding and destroying the contraband.¡°Egypt will continue to abide by all Security Council resolutions and will always be in conformity with these resolutions as they restrain military purchases from North Korea,¡± the statement said.But U.S. officials confirmed that delivery of the rockets was foiled only when U.S. intelligence agencies spotted the vessel and alerted Egyptian authorities through diplomatic channels ¡ª essentially forcing them to take action ¡ª said current and former U.S. officials and diplomats briefed on the events. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. and U.N. findings, said the Jie Shun episode was one of a series of clandestine deals that led the Trump administration to freeze or delay nearly $300?million in military aid to Egypt over the summer.Whether North Korea was ever paid for the estimated $23?million rocket shipment is unclear. But the episode illustrates one of the key challenges faced by world leaders in seeking to change North Korea¡¯s behavior through economic pressure. Even as the United States and its allies pile on the sanctions, Kim continues to quietly reap profits from selling cheap conventional weapons and military hardware to a list of customers and beneficiaries that has at times included Iran, Burma, Cuba, Syria, Eritrea and at least two terrorist groups, as well as key U.S. allies such as Egypt, analysts said.  Some customers have long-standing military ties with Pyongyang, while others have sought to take advantage of the unique market niche created by North Korea: a kind of global eBay for vintage and refurbished Cold War-era weapons, often at prices far lower than the prevailing rates.Over time, the small-arms trade has emerged as a reliable source of cash for a regime with considerable expertise in the tactics of running contraband, including the use of ¡°false flag¡± shipping and the clever concealment of illegal cargo in bulk shipments of legitimate goods such as sugar or ¡ª as in the case of the  ¡ª a giant mound of loose iron ore.¡°These cover materials not only act to obfuscate shipments, but really highlights the way that licit North Korean businesses are being used to facilitate North Korean illicit activity,¡± said David Thompson, a senior analyst and investigator of North Korean financial schemes for the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a nonprofit research organization based in Washington. ¡°It is this nesting which makes this illicit activity so hard to identify.¡±With North Korea¡¯s other profitable enterprises being hurt by international sanctions, Thompson said, such exports are now ¡°likely more important than ever.¡±Even by North Korean standards, the  was a veritable rust bucket. The freighter¡¯s steel frame was corroded from bow to stern, and its fixtures caked with coal dust from previous voyages, U.N. investigators would later report. The desalination system had stopped working, judging from crates of water bottles officials would find strewn around the crew compartments. Whether its weapons were discovered or not, the ship¡¯s 8,000-mile voyage last summer was probably destined to be its last.¡°The ship was in terrible shape,¡± said a Western diplomat familiar with confidential reports from the official U.N. inquest. ¡°This was a one-shot voyage, and the boat was probably intended for the scrap yard afterward.¡±  Seaworthy or not, the ship set sail from the port city of Haeju, North Korea, on July 23, 2016, with a 23-member North Korean crew that included a captain and a political officer to ensure Communist Party discipline on board. Although North Korean-owned, the vessel had been registered in Cambodia, allowing it to fly a Cambodian flag and claim Phnom Penh as its home port. Using a ¡°flag of convenience,¡± as the tactic is called, allows North Korean ships to avoid drawing unwanted attention in international waters. So does the practice of routinely shutting off a vessel¡¯s transponder, behavior documented in a February U.N. report that described the voyage.¡°The vessel¡¯s automatic identification system was off for the majority of the voyage,¡± the report said, ¡°except in busy sea lanes where such behavior could be noticed and assessed as a safety threat.¡±Still, a 300-foot-long freighter big enough to hold 2,400 passenger cars is not easily concealed. U.S. intelligence agencies tracked the ship as it left North Korea, and then monitored it as it steamed around the Malay Peninsula and sailed westward across the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The vessel was heading northward through the Red Sea in early August when the warning was passed to Egyptian authorities about a suspicious North Korean vessel that appeared bound for the Suez Canal.¡°They were notified by our side,¡± said a former senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of the events. ¡°I give their foreign ministry credit for taking it seriously.¡± The Jie Shun had not yet reached the canal when an Egyptian naval vessel ordered the crew to halt for an inspection. At first, the cargo hold appeared to match the description on the manifest: 2,300 tons of loose yellow rocks called limonite, a kind of iron ore. But digging beneath stone and tarp, the inspectors found wooden crates ¡ª stacks of them.Asked about the boxes, the crew produced a bill of lading listing the contents, in awkward English, as ¡°assembly parts of the underwater pump.¡± But after the last of the 79 crates was unloaded and opened at Egypt¡¯s al-Adabiyah port, it was clear that this was a weapons shipment like none other: more than 24,000 rocket-propelled grenades, and completed components for 6,000 more. All were North Korean copies of a rocket warhead known as the PG-7, a variant of a Soviet munition first built in the 1960s.  A closer examination by U.N. experts would reveal yet another deception, this one apparently intended to fool the weapons¡¯ Egyptian recipients: Each of the rockets bore a stamp with a manufacturing date of March 2016, just a few months before the Jie Shun sailed. But the label, like the manifest, was false.¡°On-site analysis revealed that they were not of recent production,¡± the U.N. report said, ¡°but rather had been stockpiled for some time.¡±North Korea¡¯s booming illicit arms trade is an outgrowth of a legitimate business that began decades ago. In the 1960s and ¡¯70s, the Soviet Union gave away conventional weapons ¡ª and, in some cases, entire factories for producing them ¡ª to developing countries as a way of winning allies and creating markets for Soviet military technology. Many of these client states would standardize the use of communist-bloc munitions and weapons systems in their armies, thus ensuring a steady demand for replacement parts and ammunition that would continue well into the future.Sensing an opportunity, North Korea obtained licenses to manufacture replicas of Soviet and Chinese weapons, ranging from assault rifles and artillery rockets to naval frigates and battle tanks. Arms factories sprouted in the 1960s that soon produced enough weapons to supply North Korea¡¯s vast military, as well as a surplus that could be sold for cash.  By the end of the Cold War, North Korea¡¯s customer base spanned four continents and included dozens of countries, as well as armed insurgencies. The demand for discount North Korean weapons would continue long after the Soviet Union collapsed, and even after North Korea came under international censure and economic isolation because of its nuclear weapons program, said Andrea Berger, a North Korea specialist and senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Calif.¡°North Korea¡¯s assistance created a legacy of dependency,¡± said Berger, author of  a 2015 monograph on the history of Pyongyang¡¯s arms exports. ¡°The type of weaponry that these [client] countries still have in service is largely based on communist-bloc designs from the Cold War era. North Korea has started to innovate and move beyond those designs, but it is still willing to provide spare parts and maintenance. As the Russians and Chinese have moved away from this market, the North Koreans have stuck around.¡±As a succession of harsh U.N. sanctions threatened to chase away customers, North Korea simply changed tactics. Ships that ferried artillery rockets and tank parts to distant ports changed their names and registry papers so they could sail under a foreign flag. New front companies sprang up in China and Malaysia to handle transactions free of any visible connection to Pyongyang. A mysterious online weapons vendor called Glocom ¡ª jokingly dubbed the ¡°Samsung of North Korean proliferators¡± by some Western investigators ¡ª began posting slick videos hawking a variety of wares ranging from military radios to guidance systems for drones, never mentioning North Korea as the source.The sanctions stigma inevitably scared away some potential buyers, but the trading in the shadows remains brisk, intelligence officials and Western diplomats say. Some remaining clients are fellow pariah states such as Syria, whose recent purchases have included chemical-weapons protective gear. Other long-term customers are nonstate actors such as the militant group Hezbollah, which has acquired North Korean rockets and missiles from arms smugglers and sympathetic regimes. North Korean-made rifles have even been recovered from the bodies of Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria, although U.S. officials believe the guns were probably looted from stocks sold to the late Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi years earlier.Still other customers look to North Korea as one of the last suppliers of low-cost parts and ammunition for older weapons systems that are scarcely found in commercial markets. The list includes sub-Saharan African countries such as Uganda and Congo, which for decades relied on North Korea to train and equip their armies.The list also includes Egypt, a major U.S. aid recipient that still maintains diplomatic ties and has a history of military-to-military ties dating back to the 1970s with Pyongyang, said Berger, the Middlebury researcher. Although Cairo has publicly sworn off dealing with North Korea, she said, incidents such as the Jie Shun show how hard it is to break old habits, especially for military managers seeking to extend the life of costly weapons systems.Egypt¡¯s army today still has dozens of weapons systems that were originally of Soviet design. Among them are at least six types of antitank weapons, including the RPG-7, the 1960s-era grenade-launcher that uses the same PG-7 warhead as those discovered on the Jie Shun. The number of Egyptian RPG-7 tubes in active service has been estimated at nearly 180,000.¡°Egypt was a consistent North Korean customer in the past,¡± Berger said. ¡°I would call them a ¡®resilient¡¯ customer today.¡±When Egyptian officials were first confronted about their country¡¯s possible ties to the Jie Shun¡¯s rockets, the response was denial, followed by obfuscation, Western diplomats said.At the time of the discovery, Egypt was a newly elected nonpermanent member of the U.N. Security Council, and its delegation resisted including information in official reports linking Egyptian officials or businesses to illicit North Korean weapons, said U.S. officials and diplomats familiar with the discussions. The embassy statement said Egyptian officials sought only minor delays to ensure that their views on the events were properly reflected. It noted that Security Council officials had ¡°recognized and praised Egypt¡¯s role¡± in assisting the investigation.In any case, the February U.N. report on the incident sidesteps the question of who was meant to receive the rockets, saying only that the munitions were destroyed by Egypt under U.N. supervision, and that ¡°the destination and end user of the equipment was investigated by the Egyptian general prosecutor.¡±But evidence gathered by U.N. investigators and later shared with diplomats left little doubt about where the rockets were bound. An early clue was the nature of the rockets themselves: All were practice rounds ¡ª fitted with removable, nonlethal warheads of the type used in military training ¡ª and the large quantity suggested that the purchaser had a sizable army with many thousands of recruits. Egypt¡¯s active-duty military is 438,000 strong, with another 479,000 reservists.The most damning evidence was discovered on the crates. Each had been stenciled with the name of an Egyptian company, but someone had taken trouble of covering the lettering with a canvas patch. Diplomats familiar with the investigation confirmed the involvement of the Egyptian company, but declined to name it.Likewise, the Egyptian company is identified nowhere in the U.N. report. A single footnote states, cryptically: ¡°National authorities closed the private company and revoked its license.¡±While U.S. officials have declined to publicly criticize Egypt, the Jie Shun incident ¡ª coming on top of other reported weapons deals with North Korea in recent years ¡ª contributed to the diplomatic turbulence that defined relations between Cairo and the Obama and Trump administrations. U.S. officials confirmed that the rockets were among the factors leading to the Trump administration¡¯s decision in July to freeze or delay $290?million in military aid to Egypt.During Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi¡¯s visit to Washington that month, President Trump praised the military strongman before TV cameras for ¡°doing a fantastic job.¡± But a White House statement released afterward made clear that a warning had been delivered in private.¡°President Trump stressed the need for all countries to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea,¡± said the official statement, including the need to ¡°stop providing economic or military benefits to North Korea.¡±        "
"President Trump, not for the first time, publicly contradicted his chief diplomat on a major foreign policy issue Sunday, saying via Twitter that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was ¡°wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.¡±Using his nickname for North Korea¡¯s leader, Kim Jong Un, and apparently warning again of a U.S. military response to its escalating nuclear threat, Trump advised, ¡°, we¡¯ll do what has to be done.¡±The tweets came the day after Tillerson, on a visit to Beijing, told reporters the administration had and was probing for a response. ¡°We ask, ¡®Would you like to talk?¡¯¡± he said. ¡°We can talk to them, we do talk to them.¡±The latest display of dissension follows earlier presidential put-downs and efforts by Tillerson and other national security officials to smooth Trump¡¯s rough edges on issues as diverse as U.S. policy toward NATO, Mexico and the Persian Gulf.  All have sparked questions about Tillerson¡¯s longevity in office, with repeated speculation that he is fed up, or that Trump wants him gone.¡°Humiliating for Tillerson, but worse, renders him useless. He¡¯ll resign, today or after a brief face-saving interval,¡± predicted former Obama administration ambassador and National Security Council official Dan Shapiro, one of many foreign policy experts who tweeted about Trump¡¯s Sunday comments, sent from his New Jersey golf club.¡°President Trump spectacularly shot down SecState Tillerson after important Beijing talks. How long can this last?¡± asked Carl Bildt, former conservative prime minister of Sweden and current co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations.Neither the State Department nor the White House responded to queries on Trump¡¯s comments.Tillerson¡¯s aides were quick to explain on Saturday that the secretary¡¯s remarks, made during a brief visit to China to plan for Trump¡¯s trip there in November, did not imply that any substantive talks were underway with Pyongyang.¡°That¡¯s not happening,¡± senior Tillerson adviser R.C. Hammond told reporters aboard the secretary¡¯s flight from Beijing. ¡°There is a means by which the countries can engage with each other,¡± Hammond said, adding, ¡°North Korean officials show no indication that they are interested in or ready for talks on denuclearization.¡±  In Washington, a senior administration official said immediately after the secretary¡¯s comments, ¡°I wouldn¡¯t read too much into that.¡±Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned Sunday that ¡°if we don¡¯t ramp up the diplomatic side?.?.?. it¡¯s possible that we end up cornered.¡±¡°I think there¡¯s more going on than meets the eye,¡± Corker said on NBC¡¯s ¡°Meet the Press.¡± While the Trump administration and the United Nations have rapidly increased sanctions against Pyongyang, he said, ¡°I think Tillerson understands that every intelligence agency we have says there¡¯s no amount of economic pressure you can put on North Korea to get them to stop this program because they view this as their survival.?.?.?. We¡¯re moving to a place where we¡¯re going to end up with a binary choice soon.¡±Shortly after Corker¡¯s appearance, Trump tweeted again. ¡°Being nice to Rocket Man hasn¡¯t worked in 25 years, why would it work now? Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won¡¯t fail.¡±Kim, who was preceded by his father and grandfather, has been in power since late 2011.  Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil chief executive with no previous diplomatic experience, has been under a broader cloud in office, with lawmakers and others criticizing the slow pace of diplomatic appointments, his acquiescence to massive budget cuts proposed by the White House, and the State Department¡¯s lack of visibility on a number of issues.Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan acknowledged at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing last week that department morale was low.¡°I think there¡¯s uncertainty,¡± he said, ¡°and that causes ¡ª uncertainty leads people [to be] unsettled, and we need to address that,¡± he said.On the world stage, where?Tillerson has sought to reassure?allies that the United States under Trump is a reliable partner, many have concluded that his influence is limited.With White House aides such as presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and others given a major role in foreign policy, the question of ¡°who is responsible for what segment¡± of national security remains an open one, said a senior official in the government of a close European ally, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk about sensitive diplomatic issues. Unpredictability ¡°may be a useful tool with adversaries,¡± he said, but with allies it creates ¡°uncertainty and irritation.¡±Tillerson defended Trump¡¯s early August threat to rain  as ¡°important?.?.?. to avoid any miscalculation on their part.¡± But he quickly followed with reassurance that Trump was ¡°just reaffirming?.?.?. that the United States has the capability to fully defend itself from any attack, and our allies, and we will do so. So the American people should sleep well at night.¡±Jim Mattis, the retired Marine general who is Trump¡¯s secretary of defense, has often joined ?Tillerson in  over military saber-rattling. But Mattis, a Trump favorite among the retired and active-duty military advisers around the president, has been spared the belittling comments and tweets that Tillerson has endured along with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and others.  Early in the administration, Tillerson and Mattis, as well as Vice President Pence, traveled to NATO headquarters to express unwavering U.S. support for the alliance that Trump, during his campaign, had called ¡°obsolete.¡±In late February, as Tillerson was visiting Mexico, Trump told a business forum in Washington that he would launch a ¡°military operation¡± at the U.S.-Mexico border to remove ¡°gang lords?.?.?. drug lords¡± and other ¡°bad dudes out of this country at a rate that nobody¡¯s ever seen before.¡±At a news conference the same day with his Mexican counterpart, Tillerson chose to take the high road. ¡°In a relationship filled with vibrant colors,¡± he said, ¡°two strong sovereign countries will have their differences.¡±Perhaps the sharpest dissonance occurred in June, when Tillerson publicly called on a ?Saudi Arabia-led bloc of Arab nations to immediately cease their blockade of neighboring Qatar, which they had accused of terrorism financing, and he urged ¡°calm and thoughtful dialogue.¡± Barely an hour later, ¡± and said he agreed with the Saudi accusations. Members of his staff have sometimes risen to Tillerson¡¯s defense. When a White House aide this summer publicly chastised the secretary for meddling in ¡°military matters¡± on North Korea for his ¡°sleep well¡± comment, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert bristled. ¡°He¡¯s a Cabinet secretary,¡± she said. ¡°He¡¯s fourth in line to the presidency. He carries a big stick.¡±Tillerson himself has largely refused to talk about any frustration he may feel toward Trump. ¡°There is no gap between the president and myself or the State Department on policy,¡± he told Congress in late June. ¡°There are differences in terms of how the president chooses to articulate elements of that policy.¡±More recently, following August¡¯s neo-Nazi violence in Charlottesville, Tillerson was asked on ¡°Fox News Sunday¡± about the values of a president who said ¡°many sides¡± were to blame.¡°The president speaks for himself,¡± Tillerson replied. David Nakamura and Carol Morello contributed to this report.        "
"Early in his administration, President Trump signed a directive outlining a strategy of pressure against North Korea that involved actions across a broad spectrum of government agencies and led to the use of military cyber-capabilities, according to U.S. officials.As part of the campaign, U.S. Cyber Command targeted hackers in North Korea¡¯s military spy agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, by barraging their computer servers with traffic that choked off Internet access.Trump¡¯s directive, a senior administration official said, also included instructions to diplomats and officials to bring up North Korea in virtually every conversation with foreign interlocutors and urge them to sever all ties with Pyongyang. Those conversations have had significant success, particularly in recent weeks as North Korea has tested another nuclear weapon and ballistic missiles, officials said.  So pervasive is the diplomatic campaign that some governments have found themselves scrambling to find any ties with North Korea. When Vice President Pence called on one country to break relations during a recent overseas visit, officials there reminded him that they never had relations with Pyongyang. Pence then told them, to their own surprise, that they had $2?million in trade with North Korea. Foreign officials, who asked that their country not be identified, described the exchange.The directive also instructed the Treasury Department to outline an escalating set of sanctions against North Korean entities and individuals, and foreigners who dealt with them. Those instructions are reflected in a steady stream of U.S. and international sanctions in recent months.The directive was not made public at the time it was signed, following a policy review in March, because ¡°we were providing every opportunity as a new administration to North Korea to sit down and talk, to take a different approach,¡± said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss closed-door policy decisions.¡°We made clear the door was open for talks before the president had even signed off on this strategy, but North Korea continued to launch missiles, continued to kidnap Americans to keep as hostages .?.?. all the things they did when we were early in the administration and sending signals that the door was open to talks.¡±That door remains open, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Saturday in Beijing. Speaking to reporters following talks with Chinese officials, Tillerson for the first time acknowledged that the United States was in direct communication with North Korea.¡°We are probing, so stay tuned,¡± he said. ¡°We ask, ¡®Would you like to talk?¡¯ We have lines of communications to Pyongyang. We¡¯re not in a dark situation, a blackout. We have a couple, three, channels open. .?.?. We can talk to them; we do talk to them.¡±  In Washington, however, officials quickly played down any idea that negotiations were underway or that anything had yet come of the talks. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert issued a statement saying that ¡°North Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization.¡±The senior administration official said it would be wrong to ¡°read too much into¡± Tillerson¡¯s remarks. ¡°The U.S. has always maintained some kind of channel, kept some channel open even in the darkest days of previous administrations.¡±Those channels include conversations between the State Department¡¯s special representative for North Korea, Joseph Yun, and Pak Song Il, a senior member of Pyongyang¡¯s delegation to the United Nations. They have met several times this year to discuss American prisoners being held by North Korea, among other matters. Other contacts have taken place through the ¡°track two¡± process, which regularly brings together nongovernmental U.S. experts ¡ª and occasionally U.S. officials ¡ª and North Korean officials.Tillerson¡¯s remarks Saturday came after a day of meetings with top Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, which saw both sides strike a careful, conciliatory tone following a new North Korean nuclear test and missile launches, and weeks of insults and threats between Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.In brief formal statements before their meetings, Chinese leaders ¡ª who have repeatedly called for restraint ¡ª did not mention North Korea. Instead, they tried to keep the focus on Trump¡¯s upcoming Asia visit, which Xi promised would be a ¡°special, wonderful and successful¡± event.The Cyber Command operation, which was due to end Saturday, was part of the overall campaign set in motion many months ago. The effects were temporary and not destructive, officials said. Nonetheless, some North Korean hackers griped that lack of access to the Internet was interfering with their work, according to another U.S. official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a secret operation.Cyber Command and the White House had no comment. But the senior administration official said, ¡°What I can tell you is that North Korea has itself been guilty of cyberattacks, and we are going to take appropriate measures to defend our networks and systems.¡±Eric Rosenbach, who led the Pentagon¡¯s cyber-efforts as assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration, said the operation ¡°could have the advantage of signaling to the North Koreans a more aggressive posture. However, there¡¯s accompanying risk of an escalation and a North Korean cyber-counterattack.¡±Rosenbach, now co-director of the Belfer Center at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that he was not aware of the actual operation but that if it is ¡°truly a military operation,¡± he sees no reason to hide it. ¡°The Department of Defense should probably own it,¡± he said.Aaron Hughes, a former senior cyber-official in the Obama administration, said he, too, was not aware of the actual operation. But ¡°if I was still in my [Pentagon] seat, I would actively be advocating we do these types of things. .?.?. We should be using all elements of national power to deter and message the North Koreans, to include our military, including cyber,¡± Hughes said.Others said they would be cautious about using even minor ?cyber-capabilities against North Korea and doing it openly because of the risk of retaliation.¡°I wonder what the disruptive payoff is that we¡¯re getting that¡¯s worth even a marginal extra chance of nuclear war?¡± said Jason Healey, a former military ?cyber-operator and now a senior research scholar at Columbia University¡¯s School of International and Public Affairs.
