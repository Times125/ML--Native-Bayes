he eastern horizon was a pale streak capped with pink, but it was still dark at Hollin Bank car park and I could barely make out Bill Gordon s face as he waited. Bill is a volunteer for the , monitoring ring ouzels, the mountain blackbird. To record their calls, he was carrying an impressive-looking microphone on a pole with a  dead-cat  windshield, rather cosy on a frosty April morning.We had barely walked a few yards when, without a word, he pushed his headphones over my ears.

To my right, I could hear  chipping away and, from all around, with a measure of distance between each, the . Just ahead of me, on steep scrubby ground, the wren that had sounded so thin and distant became gigantic, all lungs.It occurred to me that listening to moorland might illustrate its health just as well as looking at it. Then, from higher up the slope, came the piping voice of a male ring ouzel (), tight and vibrant, as though bounced off a drum-skin. We walked towards it, caught a brief impression of a dark shape poised on the edge of a boulder.  are more upright than blackbirds, more lithe too, with an elongated tail, but more cautious and shy.The male flitted east, and we ambled after as the light strengthened. When we found him again, he was with a female. Older males arrive first from wintering grounds in north Africa so he will face competition from younger males soon. Only then will he start singing. Research has shown that ring ouzels have regional dialects; these birds have their own distinctive Derbyshire song.  I worry that one year they won t come,  Bill said.  Then we ll only have the recordings.
