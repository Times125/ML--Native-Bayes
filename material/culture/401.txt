here s a reasonable premise to this horror-thriller, but also something straight-to-rental about the look and feel of the whole thing. It s a heist movie-horror mashup. A ruthless armed gang led by sisters Leah (Francesca Eastwood) and Vee (Taryn Manning) plan on taking down a neighbourhood bank. They make all of the terrified customers and employees kneel on the floor, and one nerdy guy with a moustache (played on autopilot by ) tells them there is a secret vault, one floor below the main bank concourse, that is crammed with millions of dollars. What he doesn t say is that this vault was the subject of a horrifically violent failed bank job in 1982, and now the ghosts of that robbery are lying in wait to take a terrible vengeance on those who venture down there.Perhaps inevitably, there is no satisfying third-act conclusion to this setup, but plenty of cliches, including the one in which people feel the need to set stuff on fire, flipping open a Zippo lighter and tossing it into the pool of gasoline, etc.
